2009-02-12,AU,China,"A firefighter died after a 40-story Beijing luxury hotel, scheduled to open this year, burned down Monday near the end of the Chinese New Year's celebrations, CNN.com reported.
The Mandarin Oriental Hotel was unoccupied at the time of the fire, but one firefighter died of smoke inhalation. Six other firefighters and a construction worker were hospitalized, according to CNN.com.
Police suspect fireworks to be the cause of the fire, according to CNN.com. Central China Television, which is constructing a complex next door to the hotel, apologized after claiming staffers authorized the shooting of fireworks that accidentally started the blaze.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"To think of D.C. is to think of following dreams to the White House, Capitol Hill or maybe a lobbying firm. But for every congressional hearing, D.C.'s got a slightly more exciting local concert for you to attend. Sure, possibly for the first time in your life, all of your favorite bands are nearly guaranteed to stop near where you're living, but the music scene in the District has got any touring act beat. Below are some bands to keep an ear on.
The Aquarium
www.myspace.com/aquariummusic
Audiophiles know that Dischord defined D.C.'s music scene beginning in the '80s and continuing all the way through the early-2000s break-up of Q and Not U. While the label was and still is home to D.C. hardcore, and the aforementioned dance-punks have indeed stopped the music, The Aquarium have the whole post-post-punk thing down. It's also no accident Laura Harris lends her sticks to the sounds of two bands; she owns that kit. The band has a new single coming out this fall, and possibly a new LP in the not-so-distant future.
Benjy Ferree
www.benjyferree.com
Benjy Ferree virtually impossible to compare accurately to any other artist. His sound is part doo-wop, part rock 'n' roll and all passion. Ferree is from D.C. and cites area legends like Chuck Brown and Fugazi as influences. His interests are diverse, and his music reflects that. His latest, ""Come Back to the Five and Dime, Bobby Dee Bobby Dee,"" is a nod to Bobby Driscoll, the child actor who played Peter Pan.  With Ferree's fiancée Harris at the drums, its obvious musicianship is at the heart of every track.
Imperial China
www.myspace.com/imperialchina
If you were absolutely forced to choose one style of music to define D.C.'s sound (and good luck with that), post-punk would definitely be it, and Imperial China's got it down to a science. They sound like the District, but in a new and constantly surprising way. Like every self-respecting post-punk band, they're angry - that guitar wails, for sure. But unlike the rest, they explore the nuances of that angst and come out with something special. 
Midnight Kids
www.myspace.com/midnightkidsmusic
It's hard to explain why a band who seemingly have yet to play a gig made this list unless you know about the Apes. Three-quarters of this stellar new quartet are ex-members of the former D.C. stand-out. The passion that made the Apes special is still there with a impressive new twist: more polished, more mature, more, well, Stereolab. The band still owns their beat, but now its down-right dreamy, like Blondie on a Sunday. Midnight Kids have a bright future that is definitely worth listening to.
Noon:30
www.myspace.com/noon30band
Noon:30 could be called D.C.'s answer to The Noisettes. But they're better than that. Their harmony screams polish, the distortion screams garage and lead singer Blue S. Moon just all out screams, or croons. It's beautiful, electronic post-punk pop. ""French Song"" is sung, unsurprisingly, in French but with a fearless American accent, which makes sense since this all-female trio is all about courageous interpretation.
True Womanhood
www.myspace.com/truewomanhood
Missed Sonic Youth touring this summer? You'll probably want to check out True Womanhood. Genuinely like nothing else in the city, the band plays music in a way you've never seen before: guitars bowed with other guitars; a giant metal, well, thing played for percussion. Perhaps one of the District's most experimental bands, their music is definitely some of its most beautiful and complex.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"Although swiping your card at TDR and sitting with your new posse at may initially seem cool to incoming freshman, it will get old - especially if you don't take a TDR hiatus every once in awhile. Sure, TDR has stir-fry, a sweet salad bar and all-you-can-eat ice cream. But it is crucial to embrace other restaurants as well by leaving campus on occasion and sampling some of the local area's most delicious cuisines. Depending on your mood and cravings, here are some excellent places you should definitely check out this semester. 
Thai: Neisha
Location: 4445 Wisconsin Ave., N.W., directly across from the Tenleytown Metro stop.
Why Go There? Neisha is a popular AU student destination that serves up an incredible Asian cuisine. It has an extensive menu of soups, salads, appetizers, entrées and desserts. Try ordering the satay (chicken skewers with peanut sauce) for an appetizer, followed by the grilled salmon in banana leaves for an entrée. If you're still hungry, order ""a la mode"" for dessert (fried banana served with young coconut ice-cream.) 
Sushi: Raku
Location: 7240 Woodmont Ave. in Bethesda, Md.
Why Go There? Tom Sietsema of The Washington Post Magazine said, ""If there's a Bethesda restaurant I'd like to see cloned, it's Raku!"" The restaurant is decorated with bamboo, cozy booths and colorful parasols that hang from the ceiling. Try ordering the seafood spring rolls or any type of sushi listed on the menu - you won't be disappointed. 
Italian: Angelico
Location: 4529 Wisconsin Ave., N.W. in Tenleytown.
Why Go There? Huge menu, awesome food, prime location, AU delivery - need we say more? Angelico is an Italian eatery, but offers everything from buffalo wings and roasted lamb salad to pizza, pasta and cannoli. It's a great place to pick up a quick bite when you're in a rush and are craving some comfort food. Try ordering either the basic spaghetti with meat sauce or treat yourself to the shrimp italiano (fresh shrimp sautéed with garlic and marinara sauce, tossed with fettuccine.)  
Pizza: 2 Amys
Location: 3715 Macomb St., N.W.
Why Go There? 2 Amys has been written up as one of the best pizza restaurants in D.C. for years. Within walking distance of AU, 2 Amys is at the fingertips of students. D.C. Foodies wrote that ""2 Amys is hands down, the most wonderful place in D.C. to get gourmet pizza."" Skip an appetizer (although the potato and prosciutto croquettes are delightful) and go straight to the pizza menu. Just like traveling to Italy, you can order anything on the menu and not be disappointed. Both the classic Margherita and the Calabrese (tomato, anchovy, fresh mozzarella, parsley and olive) are among the restaurant's best.  
Burgers: Five Guys
Location: Everywhere. (Georgetown, Bethesda, Dupont Circle, Arlington, Va., Chinatown, etc.) 
Why Go There? For out-of-towners who aren't familiar with this incredible burger chain, it's time to experience its utter deliciousness. Five Guys serves up classic burgers and cheeseburgers with no trans-fats and a plethora of available toppings including mayonnaise, onions, lettuce, pickles, grilled mushrooms, jalapeÃ?Â±os and the like. Also popular are the french fries, either regular or Cajun-style, and its kosher hot dogs.  
Burritos: Chipotle
Location: 4301 Wisconsin Ave., N.W. # B in Tenleytown.
Why Go There? Make sure you've been fasting for days before diving into one of these massive burritos! Chipotle's Mexican concoctions are huge, yet incredibly delicious and addictive. A growing chain around the country, Chipotle serves up scrumptious burritos, soft tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and, most recently, burrito salads! First-timers must try a steak or chicken burrito with rice, your choice of beans and a handful of other fresh toppings.  
Frozen Yogurt: Mr. Yogato
Location: 1515 17th St., N.W. near Dupont Circle
Why Go There? Trying to avoid those freshmen 15? Make a visit to Mr. Yogato, a very unique fro-yo parlor. Mr. Yogato carries 18 flavors of non-fat frozen yogurt and 40 different toppings including Captain Crunch, Junior Mints and toasted mini Eggo waffles and anything else their patrons could think up. The best part about visiting this healthy dessert haven is the crazy rules created by Mr. Yogato himself. If you wear a Yogato stamp on your head, you get 10 percent off your purchase, or you can get 20 percent off your total for reciting the Stirling battlefield speech from Braveheart in a great Scottish accent.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"For newcomers to AU and to D.C., this list is a guide to some of the neighborhoods often frequented by AU students throughout the year.  From dining and shopping, to bars and clubs, these locations throughout the city include venues enjoyed by many. 
ADAMS MORGAN
Adams Morgan, accessible by Metro, and is only three stops down the red line. The neighborhood includes a wide variety of attractions, including shops, restaurants and bars.
The Metro stop is called Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan, and the entrance to the Smithsonian National Zoo is a short walk up Connecticut Avenue. Like many other Smithsonian museums, admission to the National Zoo is free of charge.
A walk in the other direction from the Metro stop and down Calvert Street will get you to the heart of Adams Morgan.
Adams Morgan is known as one of the hippest, most happening spots in town. Hookah bars, regular bars, restaurants and other attractions make this area a weekend hot spot for AU students.
Dan Raby, a junior in the School of Communication, said he enjoys the dynamic of the restaurants and nightlife of the neighborhood.
""I like Adams Morgan because if you want to do something, you can always find it in Adams Morgan ... If you want to find any restaurant, from something fancy to little holes-in-the-wall, it's in Adams Morgan.""
One example is Tryst Coffeehouse, a favorite coffee shop of Florence Lumsden, a junior in the School of International Studies. The Diner is a restaurant adjacent to Tryst that Lumsden said she also enjoys. 
""It is open really late, pretty much all night, and they have nice food and nice dessert,"" said Lumsden.
Lumsden also said that there are many popular bars in Adams Morgan, but that most of them only admit those who are 21 and up.
Another quirk of Adams Morgan is the annual ""Crafty Bastards Arts & Crafts Fair"" put on by the Washington City Paper. Raby said he goes every year. 
""They have clothes, jewelry, and all sorts of things,"" he said.  This year's fair is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 3, according to the City Paper Web site. 
DOWNTOWN 
Downtown D.C., which includes Chinatown, Penn Quarter and the National Mall, has many attractions including national buildings such as the White House, the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress and many others. 
In addition, Smithsonian museums, such as the Air and Space Museum and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, line the National Mall.
""The Mall's always great. Even if you don't want to see a museum or art gallery, it's nice to go down there and find a green spot to rest,"" Raby said.
Many AU students tour the national monuments around the mall multiple times.
In addition, the National Gallery of Art's Sculpture Garden is open all week and includes a fountain area with seating. The National Gallery of Art also opens an outdoor ice skating rink November through March, according to its Web site.
Downtown also has a bustling nightlife. Ultrabar, Lotus Lounge and Avenue Night Club are all in that area. 
""Ultrabar is a cool place because it has really awesome lights and cool music, but if you go on weekends and on Saturdays, it's really packed and really hard to get in,"" Lumsden said.
DUPONT CIRCLE
Dupont Circle, only four Metro stops from Tenleytown on the red line, comes alive at night with its many bars and restaurants.
""Dupont Circle is a really good location to meet up with friends,"" said Eric Elliot, a junior in the Kogod School of Business.
A favorite spot in Dupont Circle for AU students is Kramer's Books & Afterwords Cafe, a combination bookshop and restaurant, appreciated for its late hours. It is open 7:30 a.m. through 1 a.m. daily and 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays, according to its Web site. ""It's kind of a pricey place to eat, but a wonderful place to go at night to get a fabulous dessert,"" Lumsden said.
Student's looking for international cuisine will find plenty to eat in Dupont Circle. 
 ""Name a country, it's probably there,"" Raby said.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"There are only so many times that you can visit the Smithsonian museums. Sure, the Apollo spacecrafts are cool, and who doesn't want to see the Hope Diamond? But after a while you get tired of fighting the tourists and seeing the same old exhibits. 
Check out a few of these museums that are not part of the Smithsonian. You'll have to pay to get into these museums, unlike the free Smithsonian museums, but they are well worth the price of admission.
The Newseum
This is the ultimate museum for news junkies. The Newseum has exhibits on the history of news and freedom of the press as well as a Pulitzer Prize photograph gallery. Be sure to visit the Today's Top Pages Gallery, which shows the front pages of over 700 newspapers from around the world. The Berlin Wall Gallery and the 9/11 exhibit are also must-sees. 
Sarah Stahlberg, a junior in the School of Communication, said that as an SOC student she felt right at home at the Newseum. ""The first time I went to the Newseum, I felt like a complete news junkie and communications nerd,"" Stahlberg said, ""Even though it isn't free like other museums in the district, it is well worth the money, because there are so many cool things to see there.""
Non-news junkies should also be able to enjoy the museums many interactive exhibits and historical artifacts. Also don't miss the beautiful outside veranda looking out towards the Capitol building.

This huge museum covers spy history from the Greek and Roman Empires to the present day. When you first enter the museum you are given a ""spy profile"" and a ""fake identity"" to assume, and you can test your memory about this fake identity at different interactive kiosks throughout the museum. For $10 extra dollars, you can also participate in ""Operation Spy,"" which is a one-hour interactive experience that leads you through a day in the life of the average spy. 
""The exhibits are really cool and showcase espionage over the past few centuries. It is well worth it for a day trip,"" said Michael Kelly, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences .

2009-11-12,AU,China,"PHILADELPHIA — Libertarians are a diverse bunch. Some of them wish they could abolish government entirely. Others just want its power reduced. But what unites them is their shared belief that the state should be substantially smaller and do drastically less. 
Here at AU, the libertarians have a club. AU Students For Liberty is a small operation. I’m told that fewer than 20 students attend regular meetings or events. Still, there are few diehards, most of whom I met this past weekend when I traveled with AUSFL to the 2009 Students For Liberty Mid-Atlantic Conference. The event took place at Drexel University, smack dab in the middle of the Cradle of Liberty itself — Philadelphia. The journey I took there and back again is something I won’t forget soon. It taught me about an alternative governing philosophy, but it also gave me a glimpse at what it’s like to be part of a political counterculture.
Our odyssey began last Friday with a Chinatown bus ride. On the way from D.C. to Philly, I got a primer on libertarian philosophy and policy from a few members of AUSFL. For two hours, I asked hundreds of questions and took furious notes. The young libertarians explained their core principles of nonaggression and self-ownership. They argued that taxation is slavery. They dismissed the entire idea of slicing up the economic pie, saying the solution is simply to make that pie bigger. 
Throughout the conversation, I had several realizations about libertarians. First, many of them don’t love Ron Paul. True libertarians want government out of their lives in every respect, so they don’t understand Paul’s pro-life stance or his opposition to gay marriage. They say the state shouldn’t be involved in any of this.
Second, libertarians disagree amongst themselves — a lot. In fact, it seems to me, based on my little exposure, that there is greater diversity of thought within the libertarian movement than within the conservative or progressive movements. There is a great libertarian debate over just how tiny government should be. A few of them like public education, but most don’t. Many think the government should run the justice system, the military and the police force, but some don’t.
As I learned talking to AU and Drexel students at a mixer late Friday night, there are two main camps within the libertarian movement: the minarchists and the anarcho-capitalists or anarchists. The former advocate extremely limited government. The latter, at least ideally, prefer no government at all.
Learning about anarcho-capitalism shocked me, as I imagine it would shock many people. Certainly, I am familiar with the argument that limited government means more freedom. I get it. It’s compelling. I can conceive of a scenario in which America reverts to the traditions of the Founding generation and structures government simply to provide justice, defense, security and maybe a limited form of welfare. That transformation, which is what minarchists want, would be radical, but it could happen.
What I found unbelievable was that anarcho-capitalists think the Founders’ government was way too big. They have so much faith in capitalism, so much faith in free exchange, that they literally wish for a world where markets make the rules. They philosophically and practically think the state is a problem. Its abolishment, they argue, is the rational endgame of the liberty movement. 
These are radical views. They fly in the face of the Founders’ intent. They’re outside the mainstream of American politics. I think they’re insane and an overwhelming majority of Americans — nearly everyone — would reject them outright. 
The students I talked to know this. They’ve faced reality. None of them wear rose-colored glasses. The minarchists understand government will always be bigger than they’d like and the anarcho-capitalists know they’ll never have the government-free society of their dreams.
At Saturday’s conference, the students and the speakers made mention of these realities. The presenters — college professors, organization leaders and authors — spoke of setting small goals and pushing for incremental change.
I left the conference early, but I stayed long enough to get the gist. I saw Irena Schneider, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, give an impassioned speech in her capacity as Mid-Atlantic Director. I saw Eagle columnist Alex Knepper realize he was the moderate in the room. And most importantly, I saw a group of earnest political activists enjoying each other’s company, which is always cool. 
The Students For Liberty may have unconventional views about government, but they’re well within the mainstream as far as how to have a good time. I hardly knew any of them before last weekend, but everyone was accommodating and appreciative of an Eagle writer tagging along.
I had many personal firsts last weekend. I made my first visit to Philly. I ate my first Philly Cheesesteak. And for the first, and likely last time, I saw an apartment full of libertarians sing “Don’t Stop Believing” at the top of their lungs.
“...Some will win, some will lose/Some were born to sing the blues.” 
Sounds like libertarian economics to me.

2009-12-03,AU,China,"In mid-March of 2004, the government of Angola was preparing to welcome a cohort of foreign dignitaries. Government officials deeply desired to impress their guests. After all, the ambassadors they were welcoming had just provided Angola with a $2 billion loan. In a world that has all but forgotten the African continent, foreign investment is especially appreciated by the few nations that receive it.
It may surprise some that these were not American diplomats, nor ambassadors from Western nations that Angola was greeting. Instead, it was the People’s Republic of China that was being welcomed. Delegates from Beijing not only visited Angola that year, but also Algeria, Gabon and Nigeria. These trips — and the economic agreements that accompanied them — were a part of China’s increasing efforts to integrate itself with the African continent. Although this intent may seem benign, the regional sphere of influence China is cultivating has several troubling implications.
Why has Beijing been compelled to reach out to African nations? Analysis indicates that it is China’s expanding demand for oil that has stimulated its proactive African relations.
While it was a net exporter of oil in the 1990s, by 2006 China had become the world’s third largest importer of fossil fuels. Obviously, if its booming economy is to be sustained, Beijing must procure an increasing supply of energy. Estimates indicate that China’s demand for imported oil are to sharply increase from 3.6 million barrels per day in 2006 to 13.3 million barrels per day in 2030. 
Clearly, this 10 million barrel addition will be a significant burden. Without cultivating foreign relations with regions that chronically export fossil fuel, the world’s oil supply might by-pass China. 
Enter Africa. What do Angola, Gabon, Nigeria all have in common? No twist here — they all export copious amounts of oil.
Consequentially, commerce between China and Africa increased 45 percent between 2007 and 2008 alone. By January this year, Africa was exporting an astounding 80 percent of its oil to China. However, Beijing also recognizes the importance of not only trade, but increased investment. Besides its loan to Angola, China has financed a $300 million dam in Ethiopia, provided a $2.5 million interest free loan to the Central African Republic and purchased $2.3 billion stake in a Nigerian oil rig. 
At this point, some may be wondering where the problem is in this. Why does this involvement give the Chinese a diplomatic advantage in the region? Western nations still give aid to Africa. Moreover, many European powers still assist in investment within there former colonies.
All true. Yet African nations have been swayed by the results of Chinese involvement. The minister of construction in the Congo Republic has been quoted as saying, “The Chinese build things, the Europeans don’t.” This suggests that this regional influence of China is developing to the detriment of that of the West.
More troubling to Western nations are the conditions that China attaches to its African investment — or lack of them. Beijing has given aid to disgraced leaders like Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan.
This disregard for humanitarian concerns that should cause nations world wide to be concerned with China’s increased involvement with Africa. Unfortunately, Beijing remains unperturbed. When asked if the genocide in Darfur should prevent Sudan from attaining Chinese loans, the Chinese Foreign Minister uttered a cold, terse reply: “Business is business.”

2011-09-13,AU,China,"Having lived in D.C. for three years and just outside of it for most of my life, I’ve realized that you have to be borderline-obsessed with the Redskins, pandas and cheeseburgers to truly fit in in this town. Have a conversation with any Washingtonian about Hightower’s chances of being the ‘Skins starting running back, giving Tai Shan back to China or Bobby Flay’s potato chip-laden burgers and you’re in for life. 
In the recent years, “burgermania” has taken over the city with New York City imports Shake Shack and P.J. Clarke’s, and President Obama’s fixation on Ray’s Hell Burger. Here are a few new-to-the-D.C.-area burger joints worth checking out that won’t break the bank. 
SHAKE SHACK
Metro: Dupont Circle (Red Line)
Having joined D.C. in early summer, Shake Shack has made a seamless transition from New York City to the District’s burger elite. At Shake Shack you’ll find “roadside” burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard and (surprise!) beer and wine.  Stick with the classic “ShackBurger” (with cheese, crisp lettuce, roma tomatoes, “ShackSauce” and topped with the best burger bun imaginable), an order of crinkle fries and one of the Shack’s root beer floats.
If you’re feeling extra hungry, try the frozen custard for dessert; along with the signature flavors, the custard menu features a different flavor every day and changes each month. And, as if they couldn’t make their way further into the hearts of Washingtonians, Shake Shack has a mini-menu at Nationals Park.
Bobby’s Burger Palace
Metro: Foggy Bottom (Blue/Orange Line)
Be prepared to wait in line for one of Bobby Flay’s burger creations, as the joint just opened early this month. Flay’s Burger Palace offers every kind of gourmet burger topping you can imagine (watercress and pickled jalapeños, anyone?) along with shakes, sweet potato fries and onion rings. The Palace offers salad and sandwiches too, but why eat one of those when Bobby Flay’s grilling the burgers?
Standouts include the “Crunchburger,” topped with double American cheese and a heap of potato chips (in fact, every burger on the menu can be “crunchified”). Finish your meal with a pistachio milkshake and call it a day.
Elevation Burger
Metro: Court House (Orange Line)
What makes Elevation Burger so unique is its use of “elevated products” and an “elevated” dining experience, according to the restaurant itself. But what really makes Elevation Burger unique is that you can order any burger “bloody,” catering to the ravenous carnivore in all of us.
Eco-friendly diners can rejoice in the use of organic, grass-fed and free-range beef and fresh produce. (Even the tables, chairs and paint are made of recycled materials.) As for the menu, try a malted milkshake or the “Vertigo burger,” a build-your-own burger that allows the hungriest of hungry to fit ten patties under the bun. 
BGR: The Burger Joint
Metro: Dupont Circle, Bethesda (Red Line)
BGR: The Burger Joint claims that they offer the “one burger YOU MUST HAVE before you die.” While the attitude is a bit egotistical, the place does offer a damn good burger. BGR’s classic burger features the menu’s star: a prime, dry-aged beef patty that’s topped with a sesame seed brioche bun. The menu also offers turkey, tuna, veggie and lamb burgers along with double-fried Yukon Gold and sweet potato fries.

2011-10-11,AU,China,"I’d like to think I am from a country with great potential. 
No, I am not talking about the United States, but about Brazil, where I lived for nine years. 
We’ve had a 7.5 percent growth rate in the last year and a booming economy even amid the current crisis. We have constant oil discoveries, a World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. And we are not only seen as the most promising country in Latin America for investment, but are beginning to trade in the big leagues with countries like China. 
Our accomplishments have bumped our rank in the Human Development Report to 73, or the “High Human Development” sector. However, we are still below the regional average of Latin America and the Caribbean, due to not only our multidimensional poverty but also to our corrupt and poisoned government. 
After the events that have been happening this week, in both New York City and D.C., I could not help but parallel Occupy Wall Street and Occupy D.C. to the corruption that plagues my country. Both protests are branches of Occupy Together, a grassroots protest against the greed and corruption of the wealthiest 1 percent of society. 
If only such a protest could come to Brazil.
If there’s one thing Brazilians know, it’s greed and corruption. We are from a country that is held back by the poverty that affects the majority of its population. Nevertheless, instead of addressing these issues, corrupt politicians take away the money, time and effort needed to bring Brazilians back to their feet. 
A perfect example is current federal deputy of São Paulo, Paulo Maluf. An ex-state governor of São Paulo, mayor of the City of São Paulo, congressman and presidential candidate, Maluf has been convicted of “maladministration” and is wanted for money laundering by a New York prosecutor, according to The Economist. 
Through this conviction and Maluf’s current indictment for alleged fraud, it is common Brazilian belief that Maluf has been accused of stealing money from public government projects and embezzling it into his private life. There is even a verb inspired by the man himself: malufar — to steal public money from the people. 
Another example is former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. It is illegal for a president to promote or show obvious preference to any type of candidate during election time. However, Lula not only promoted current president Dilma Rousseff on radio shows, but also was featured in TV campaign ads. 
What I find most upsetting is not the fact that these politicians are so corrupt, but that Brazilians continue to let them participate in the government. Despite Maluf’s suspected and proven wrongdoings against the Brazilian population, not only has the government decided to drop further charges against him as a result of legal loopholes, but Maluf is constantly re-elected into government positions despite his dubious history. Continuing the disturbing trend, Lula basically picks our country’s next president, due to his immense popularity amongst the population, and receives no form of punishment. 
Brazilians may have no memory, but sadly, many of them also have no education. They are not taught to think critically, to notice bias, to think for themselves or even know the functions of different government officials. However, seeing as the government refuses to educate the people, it is up to informed and frustrated citizens to help the uneducated and poor population. 
For this reason, I applaud those who are participating in Occupy D.C. 
It is up to the people to keep checks and balances on their government. Although the United States may be going in a somewhat opposite direction economically compared to Brazil, its citizens stand for honesty and just politics. This is the mindset that sets the first world apart from the third world, and the successful from the stuck.
Maybe one day, Brazilians as a people will also be able to occupy our capital, Brasilia, and demand for the just and honest government we deserve and need, if we ever wish to achieve our potential.

2012-04-10,AU,China,"•Someone remind me why I stayed at AU while the rest of my family is on vacation... on a beautiful island far from the wicked stench of DC sewer air...



•I like you a lot, but I'm worried if I tell you, hanging out will just get way too awkward.
•""And I have known the eyes already, known them all...""
Thank you other Eliot ranter :)
•Seriously, stop caring about other people's sex lives. It's none of your business what I choose to do. Stop trying to force your values down my throat, because I didn't ask for your opinion.
•congratulations, you read an article on promiscuity. now read one on sincerity and come back when you give a crap about how 'depressed' we're going to be for our 'promiscuity'.
•I intern, have a job, volunteer, take 16 credits, and have a pretty active social life. But what am I thinking about most of the time? How excited I am to have explosive sex with my f*** buddy.
•@Pitt bomb threats--yes.  My house is a few minutes away from one of the campuses.  It is very sad to see this happening.
•Do you want to know why I hate the feminists on this campus? It's because they never shut up- I am in the same sociology classes with you semester after semester and I am tired of hearing what you have to say. The classes I am in are not about feminism, so if you could STFU I would appreciate it...
•You got that something that keeps me so off balance.
•@""there are people in this world who would kill you, your family, your friends, anyone who is opposed to them in a heartbeat. But there are people out there stopping them.""  The world is not black and white like you portray. It’s not ‘the bad guys vs us, the good guys’. People don’t randomly hate other people for no reason.  Maybe think about WHY they hate us and what we CAN DO to rectify this anger (hint: more bombings and killings are not helping the situation, only making it much much much worse).
•@""(I'm going to continue posting this until someone replies that they picked it up... hopefully whoever lost it sees this!)"" Um what if they picked up their stuff at lost and found but they don't read eagle rants. Just sayin...
•I hope the person who ranted ""finally free. you held me down for far too long"" was not my ex-boyfriend. I hope that was not how you felt about our relationship because I thought it was pretty great
•When we first met, I was 100% positive you were gay...Then we became friends and I learned you are straight. I'm still waiting for the day you realize you're gay.....
•@join AUCR's and try to make that more prevalent on campus but please do not create this club” Are you serious here? The college republicans disgust me. I identify as libertarian. But I would totally join the conservative feminist group because women’s initiative doesn’t actually accomplish any substantive policy that would help women. Maybe the conservative group would.
•People say the anonymity of the internet brings out the worst in people. But I couldn’t disagree more. Anonymous eagle rants are so full of support for others and concern for helping our community. It really warms my heart when strangers reach out to ne another. Anonymity is totally awesome. (Or maybe the editor is filtering 10 nasty mean rants for every nice rant that is posted. Hmmm)
[Editor's notes: This editor filters the extremely mean, curse-filled, racist, hateful, etc. Rants.]
•@lost and found ranter: Why don’t you just go to lost and found and ask if someone picked up what you dropped off?
•What does FTL mean? Can we PLEASE stop making up acronyms. K thanks.
•@liberal housewife after college: Me too! Why does everyone assume housewives have to be conservative?  So annoying.  I plan on adopting very liberal parenting methods for my kids and cooking organic vegan meals every night. Yay liberal housewives!
•It’s I’m an idiot WHO likes boys, not THAT likes boys. Do we really need to go over this basic grammar concept yet again?
•So conservative women don’t like the abortion stuff, and liberal women want women to be able to not have to worry about getting pregnant. So can we all just rally together around making birth control more accessible? This leads to fewer abortions (which should make the conservatives happy) and more ability to plan one’s own timing of when to start a family (which should make liberals happy). Do we have a deal?
•@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?
•My word search was defective. Not cool. Not cool.
•How few calories does one have to consume before one has an eating disorder? -scared I may be anorexic
•So I pooped at my boyfriend's apartment and forgot to flush the toilet. He definitely saw. How do I fix the awkwardness?
•Question for women who don’t believe in legal abortion : Do you just sit around wishing that women will stop having abortions or do you actually think about how to rectify the situation, like having over the counter birth control pills so women who don’t want to be pregnant never end up getting pregnant in the first place (and therefore will not need abortions).  This is a serious question, and I would love an answer from a conservative female who opposes legal abortion.
•Remember the time Gary Johnson came to AU? That made my life. Gary Johnson 2012! No more foreign wars. Fixing the deficit by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Marriage equality. Where is all the AU support for this socially tolerant and fiscally conservative presidential candidate? You know he is going to win right?
•Can we really not choose who we fall in love with? This has to be an urban myth. TELL ME THIS IS JUST A MYTH?
•If you were my girlfriend,
I'd respect you absolutely.
I'd protect but not cage you.
I'd write poetry about you, even if you weren't around to hear it.
I'd dance with you into the wee hours of the night.
I'd make you laugh without trying.
But you are not my girlfriend.
You're the girlfriend of the guy who just called me ""broseph"" and told me how hard he was going to ""tap that"". Such is life.
•One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today.
•I hate phone interviews!!! I hate them!! I hate all kinds of interviews!!!! Waaahh!! Can't we just, like, I duno, pretend that my resume says EVERYTHING about me, and leave it at that??? gughhghgh so nervous!
•To the absolute moron who is cheating on his beautiful girlfriend: I'm on to you. The only reason I'm not going to kick your ugly rear from here to Japan is because I know you're getting busy with another guy. I would never out you to the world, but I swear to science if you don't own up to your girlfriend about what you're doing...
•Guys at this school need to learn that ""jokes"" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is. I was involved in a sexual harassment case recently, and it is just wrong for someone to make my situation seem more okay for the perpetrators through ""jokes"".  It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.
•Look over there!
Look over there!
Somebody loves you THAT much!
•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.
here's the big problem. I'm a WOMAN, a PERSON, not a GOOD OR A SERVICE. bite me.
•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually ""promiscuous"" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.
•I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(
•That awkward moment when you go to a party full of alumni who have been called by the phonathon and have to defend the phonathon and its workers to them...
•Long Islanders, please join me in prayer for everyone dealing with the brush fire back home. My heart goes out to everyone, and I hope that by the time this is posted, it will be quelled and there will not be too much damage.
•This eagle rant does not exist.
•All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
All men are Socrates.
•To the 25 year old girl with no close female friends: I'm also 25 and have no close female friends. Just know you aren't alone!
•Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...
•And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
•People can hate all they want on TDR, but their mashed potatoes last night were DREAMY.
•What about military doctors? What about service people who get their MD's? I just blew your minds ranters
•Who just posted some TS Eliot? ...I love you.
•what's the point of take back the night?
[Editor's note: ""Take Back the Night seeks to end sexual violence in all its forms including sexual assault, sexual abuse, dating violence, and domestic violence ... Take Back the Night's goal is to create safe communities and respectful relationships through awareness events and initiatives.""]
•@Pitt Bomb Threats - I was between Pitt and AU...this is reason #1001 that I'm glad I came to AU! But I've been following it and I'm very concerned because I have a lot of friends there :/
•@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?
[Editor's note: Uhh, that's way complicated. Why not just meet up somewhere?]
•when i say i miss you i mean it. when i say i love you i mean it.
maybe we should be more than friends, but i dont know if you feel the same way :( #onemonthtoshowyouiloveyouforreals
•North Korea! Stop sending nuclear rockets in the direction of my family!!!!!!!! seriously, stop. No one will think you are cool.  Not even China.  They don't even really like you anyway.  You don't even really like you. god!
•@""condoms in the wellness center could have holes too"" It's not my logic! it's the logic of AU. now see why I'm ranting?
•Where are the lesbians on this campus?  Is there some secret underground lair that I don't know about?
•Editor...please keep editing for content. It's very disappointing scrolling through a list of boring, repetitive rants day in and day out. I very much appreciate the fact that u are not allowing certain ones, it makes it better for the rest of us :)
[Editor's note: Then this editor gets ""yelled"" at for alleged censorship...]
•To the person on the 6th floor that complained about a black male sleeping on the north lounge couch in the wee hours of sunday morning, i hope public safety comes after your ass someday. people do know him on the floor and the fact that you felt the need to report him based off of his race shows how f-ing ignorant you are. racial profiling at its best @AU!
•You see the sizes S, R, L and you think they'd be small, regular, and large. But no. The creators of tampons apparently wanna fuck with hormone-crazed women. They did the complete opposite and renamed internationally recognizes sizes to super, regular, and light. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
•I need to stop creeping on your facebook/twitter. It makes me miserable yet I can't stop doing it. Anyone else have this problem??
•PLEASE just get up with me already, i enjoy hangingout/hookingup with you but i can't take this waiting game!!
•Why is amword so bad? I feel bad for ranting about how bad it is but the most recent issue was awful. Most of the photographs were pixelated or blurry and some of the text was illegible. Please, get your act together. This isn't even the first time this has happened.
•I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????
•I promised myself not to text you too much in order to avoid looking desperate and/or creepy...But at the same time constantly refreshing Facebook chat waiting for that little green dot to pop next to your name is only slightly less stalkerish. And inevitably more frustrating.
•Lets face it. Mark Zuckerburg is the root of all evil when it comes to academic productivity
•How anybody at the Facebook offices ever get anything done is beyond me. Their stalking skills must be at ninja levels now
•I'm feeling the J. Alfred Prufrock as well.
•I thought my gay-dar was bad, but my ***hole-dar is even worse.
•Running at night is the best
•I love literature so much. I love my classes. I love everything we read, and our discussions. I just hate having to write papers SO MUCH. I've written exactly three sentences in four hours.
•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?
•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

•Why is amword so bad? I feel bad for ranting about how bad it is but the most recent issue was awful. Most of the photographs were pixelated or blurry and some of the text was illegible. Please, get your act together. This isn't even the first time this has happened.
•I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????
•I promised myself not to text you too much in order to avoid looking desperate and/or creepy...But at the same time constantly refreshing Facebook chat waiting for that little green dot to pop next to your name is only slightly less stalkerish. And inevitably more frustrating.
•Lets face it. Mark Zuckerburg is the root of all evil when it comes to academic productivity
•How anybody at the Facebook offices ever get anything done is beyond me. Their stalking skills must be at ninja levels now
•I'm feeling the J. Alfred Prufrock as well.
•I thought my gay-dar was bad, but my ***hole-dar is even worse.
•Running at night is the best
•I love literature so much. I love my classes. I love everything we read, and our discussions. I just hate having to write papers SO MUCH. I've written exactly three sentences in four hours.
•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?
•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

2012-04-12,AU,China,"Former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman will be speaking on April 18 in the University Club.
He will be the Kennedy Political Union’s last speaker for the year, co-sponsored by the AU College Republicans.  The event will start at 8:15 p.m.
KPU Director Alex Kreger thinks Huntsman will be a good speaker because he was so recently in the national spotlight.
Huntsman dropped out of the Republican presidential primary in mid-January.  His campaign featured his daughters, who created a series of campaign videos for him. The videos were posted on their YouTube channel, Jon2012Girls.
Prior to his campaign for president, Huntsman served two terms as the governor of Utah and spent time as the American ambassador to China under President Barack Obama.
Kreger said Huntsman has some of the freshest political ideas right now and will be able to speak to Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike. 
“I think there will be a lot of excitement and people will be interested because he is a unique candidate,” she said.
Tickets are not required for the event.

2012-05-03,AU,China,"•@""Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist."" Just because people here are accepting (which generally, yes they are), doesn't mean they're what a person is looking for in a friend. Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.



•Girl, I love you, but I have to confess that I rub my chest hairs for two hours in the morning to get the blood flowing.
•@ ""Sneak into TDR"" or ""Make out with an AU student who later comes out"" or ""Go to an 8:55 class drunk"" or ""Post an EagleRant"" ""

•I just kissed my best friend I'm in love with. He's leaving in 2 days. Better late than never I suppose.
•China.  That is all.
•""Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist.""
So you're saying that if this person doesn't have any friends at AU, it must be because he/she is so obnoxious that even the most accepting students in the world won't put up with him or her. What a nice person you are- I'm sure you're very accepting.
•Ok, May 2nd rants sucked. 4 more days of daily rants you guys. MAKE THEM GOOD!
•@”If you've had something of yours stolen on campus, please join the Victims of Theft Facebook group (filed within American University). Together, we victims can stand up for ourselves and for justice!” That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
But sorry for the ranter with the lost phone? Did you have the “find my iphone” function turned on so you can GPS track it?
•Did anyone else read the New York Times ""Room for Debate"" section yesterday on the feminism versus motherhood debate? It was very fascinating. But the first columnist talking about attachment parenting and then randomly veering off into being anti-birth control talk was a disgrace. She does not represent attachment parenting. Attachment parenting is driven by science, and the science is in on birth control preventing cancer.
•What's the real difference between Salon and Slate in terms of news coverage?
•Editor, a few days ago you referred to watching summer shows this summer as a god alternative to daily eagle rants. Do you have any to recommend? Because once Desperate Housewives is over in 2 weeks, I am scared life as I know it will cease to exist.

•""Wednesday May 3rd?"" I'm just going to assume you mean today (Wednesday, May 2nd). Here goes nothing.
•So after the NESAC (the little ivies), the Patriot League (which AU is part of) is listed on college confidential multiple times under rich kid schools.  I always thought of AU as extremely economically diverse with lots of rich kids but also lots of upper middle class kids, middle class kids, and lower middle class kids who are the first in their family to go to college. I thought of Vanderbilt, Duke, Emory, Wake Forest, Richmond, and mainly southern schools as the more “rich kid” schools full of snobbery and an old money plantation type feel.  Am I wrong here?
•You're so cute and wonderful. Suddenly, everything looks and feels differently in the world and I think this may be right. I'm going to miss you so much this summer.
•Does this bagel have tarragon? Oh la la
•@""I want to respect women but I know if I do, it'll lower my value as a man in the social hierarchy of life...""
You're not looking at it correctly. Girls aren't attracted to nice guys, that's correct, but it's not because the guys are nice- it's because ""nice"" translates to ""obsequious."" Doormats aren't entertaining. On the flipside, girls really aren't attracted to straight up assholes- there's a big difference between lighthearted teasing and genuine assholery. Teasing is fun, it's the name of the game, not being a dick
•@""•Whenever I work the desk and the rowing team comes in, I get excited. I think their coxswain is a cutie.""
props for knowing how to spell it!
•We know you don't want to be doing this group project with us. We don't want to be doing it either. But if you would please drop the attitude and stop simultaneously insisting that you need to do all of the work for us, it would make this experience a lot less painful.
•You want to talk about being a Jake and Amir fan?  I followed their personal Vimeo accounts before either one started making videos for CollegeHumor.  Originally they were both normal people, but in one early video Amir claimed to have drunk sixty beers in one night, and Jake realized that he had never been drunk at all.  They rolled with it, and Amir got crazier in every episode.
•Sometimes I wish I had regular finals... what I would give to just sit down with a book a study. But no, I'm staying up all night working on projects and trying to perfect even the tiniest of details.
•I just now used the ""Chat with a Librarian"" tool on the Library website-- coolest thing ever :) It's nice to get answers to question without having to go to the library. ^.^
•This has been such a great year. Expelled some biddies from my life, met some great people and better friends, partied hard, finished last semester with a 3.5 and still doing well!

But I feel like that handwashing article in the Eagle next to Sarah's letter was a joke? It was so extreme that it made me question whether Sarah's letter was a joke, too.

•Dear graduate,
I am so happy we can end on a good, friendly, happy note. Although I'm half way done, and you're off to the next chapter in your life, I hope we can still continue our friendship. I have learned and experienced a lot from everything with you. I don't regret anything I did, or say. It was all worth it because of how much it gave me. Thanks. Good luck with everything. You know where to find me.
•@""¡¡¿¿¡¿¡¡¡¿POR QUÉ NO ME AMAS??!?!?!!!?!!"" te amo <3
•yea, i get it, it's finals... but i can't stand not knowing what's going on in your head (aka how you feel about me) please just get up with me? i miss you
•Otters? CBVD's class?
•To whoever complained about the invert exam being open notes: you are mean
•I hate how I can never buy fruit without it going spoiled first with  half the fruit remaining. Can't wait until I have a family, so we can all share fruit.
•Dear Couple Across from me in SIS: This is a HUGE building and literally every other couch and table area is empty. You seriously have nowhere better to sit and tickle each other, and groom each other, and laugh really loudly at nothing? You really have to sit NEXT TO ME? It's finals week. Go mate somewhere else.
•That story about rape is full of holes in so many places it is not even acceptable to discuss. The Sarah story is either a fabrication or we are only hearing half the story. Talked to an officer at Sibley and never heard back... as the son of policeman in a city that is bull. But the rabbit wheel goes... spend more and more money on positions for rape awareness. This is madness.
•I love everyone at AU.
••Wish granted. It is finals week and I'm getting some lovin. But, be careful what you wish for because I cannot bring myself to study now when I could be spending seven hours in your room.
•you make me so angry.
•when you try to be upfront with someone to prevent conflict, your voice makes me so angry that I cannot pay attention to what the actual issue is because I'm too distracted by your stupid voice.
•Dean Peter Starr is one of the coolest people on campus! I'm going to miss him after graduation.
•The reason I don't take 8:55s is becoming increasingly clear through this 8:55 final for a 10:20 class. Why is the final schedule so cruel?

•Just 3 days stand between me and my LDR boyfriend being reunited...and despite all the s*** I've gone through this semester and all the finals and papers I still need to complete just knowing that puts me in the deepest state of peace <3
•Dear graduate,
I am so happy we can end on a good, friendly, happy note. Although I'm half way done, and you're off to the next chapter in your life, I hope we can still continue our friendship. I have learned and experienced a lot from everything with you. I don't regret anything I did, or say. It was all worth it because of how much it gave me. Thanks. Good luck with everything. You know where to find me.
•@""¡¡¿¿¡¿¡¡¡¿POR QUÉ NO ME AMAS??!?!?!!!?!!"" te amo <3
•yea, i get it, it's finals... but i can't stand not knowing what's going on in your head (aka how you feel about me) please just get up with me? i miss you
•Otters? CBVD's class?
•To whoever complained about the invert exam being open notes: you are mean
•I hate how I can never buy fruit without it going spoiled first with  half the fruit remaining. Can't wait until I have a family, so we can all share fruit.
•Dear Couple Across from me in SIS: This is a HUGE building and literally every other couch and table area is empty. You seriously have nowhere better to sit and tickle each other, and groom each other, and laugh really loudly at nothing? You really have to sit NEXT TO ME? It's finals week. Go mate somewhere else.
•That story about rape is full of holes in so many places it is not even acceptable to discuss. The Sarah story is either a fabrication or we are only hearing half the story. Talked to an officer at Sibley and never heard back... as the son of policeman in a city that is bull. But the rabbit wheel goes... spend more and more money on positions for rape awareness. This is madness.
•I love everyone at AU.
••Wish granted. It is finals week and I'm getting some lovin. But, be careful what you wish for because I cannot bring myself to study now when I could be spending seven hours in your room.
•you make me so angry.
•when you try to be upfront with someone to prevent conflict, your voice makes me so angry that I cannot pay attention to what the actual issue is because I'm too distracted by your stupid voice.
•Dean Peter Starr is one of the coolest people on campus! I'm going to miss him after graduation.
•The reason I don't take 8:55s is becoming increasingly clear through this 8:55 final for a 10:20 class. Why is the final schedule so cruel?

2012-05-04,AU,China,"In lieu of all the dark and grim movies this summer season seems to be offering, it’s nice to see a movie that embraces escapism like “The Avengers.”
The film dives into the weird and the mystical right away with no qualms about alienating the audience. But then again, with a built-in fanbase like “The Avengers,” they have nothing to worry abut.
“The Avengers,” directed by Joss Whedon (“Serenity”) is Marvel’s biggest endeavor yet, throwing together all of Marvel’s biggest stars together in one flashy blockbuster. The star-studded list includes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., “Tropic Thunder), Thor (Chris Hemsworth, “Thor”), Captain America (Chris Evans, “The Losers”), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, “We Bought a Zoo”), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, “The Kids Are All Right”) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol”).
Needless to say, there are a lot of characters, not to mention strong personalities, to keep in harmony in one film.
However, as director and co-screenwriter, Whedon does a tremendous job. The dialogue is snappy, the banter is witty, and each character gets their moment to shine in the sun. Yes, even Hawkeye.
The film’s plot itself is pretty simple, with the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D losing a precious item, the Cosmic Cube, to this movie’s Big Bad, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, “War Horse”). As a great source of energy, this Cube has the ability to make or break the world, as per usual for a deus ex machina device. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, “The Other Guys”), in a desperate attempt to gain back the Cube, calls on this world’s only superheroes. The only thing is, they all hate each other.
Whedon does an excellent job of weaving together the intricacies of having such dynamic characters meet and interact. Each character gets their own hero shot along with a grand entrance, building anticipation for all the fans in the audience. However, by making them all interact in a very hostile way, Whedon builds the way for character development and team struggles, a conflict that he has crafted so well before with television series like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Firefly.” However, Whedon is not only a master weaving together a team, but a master of dialogue.
The dialogue is probably the strongest part of “The Avengers.” The lines are fast, funny and full of exposition, allowing way more rooms for laughs than one would initially expect. Downey Jr. excels in Whedon’s trademark snark, rattling off punch line after punch line. As Black Widow, Johansson gets to break free from the stiff characterization of her character in “Iron Man 2,” reveling in her witty and comic lines. The film even pokes fun at its own characters, making it quite a meta and pop culture-saturated film, something Whedon is well-known for.
The high-energy dialogue supports the nonstop action of the film, which is perhaps one of its low points. Though “The Avengers” is a blockbuster and a superhero film with certain expectations, it often felt like the movie was composed of action sequence after action sequence, punctuated by a few select moments of exposition. While the action scenes were magnificently flashy and they flow very smoothly, it caused the plot of the film to move along rather slowly.
However, this being a Whedon film, it’s not so much the plot that matters as the characters. Despite most of the film being a snarkfest between the main characters, the stars clearly had a lot of chemistry with each other, and you found yourself rooting for them to work together. Even the supporting characters played their part, such as the lovably deadpan Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, “Mr. Popper’s Penguins”), who acted as a sort of emotional link between all the characters’ films. Of course, since Whedon is behind the helm, one of these characters to whom you’ve grown so attached has to die so that Whedon can rip out your heart and stomp on it on the ground.
Despite the jumble of elements that hold together this film, it works. “The Avengers” could have easily slipped into dangerous Michael Bay territory with its wealth of aliens and science fiction, but it was grounded by the dynamic characters and masterful dialogue. It’s not a perfect movie, but it is a great superhero movie.

2012-05-04,AU,China,"•@ ""Dafuq is wrong with you?""
As an American, I'd like to invade Dafuq tomorrow. They stole our Cheese Nips.



•RAWRRR. I planned Thursday to be silent and roommate-free so I can finish my huge paper. Except it sounds like my neighbor's shower tiles are being replaced one by one and there's SO MUCH BANGING AND LOUD NOISES.
•""These didn't used to be so low"" -Carl Saggin'
•@""Why is the final schedule so cruel?"" Because if every class started its final on-time, then 4:00pm class finals would go until 6:30pm, thus messing up 5:30 classes for everyone. Hey wait, that's not such a bad idea...
•I don't give a fuchsia about you!
•Huzzah for those Carl Sagan rants!
•Update: the deafening construction on my neighbor's bathtub stopped almost immediately after I sent in that rant. Eagle Rants, you have magical magical powers.
•Ugh, I'm already antsy to get my grades posted already.
•My neighbor is loud, annoying, and rude at all hours of the day. I hope he moves or drops out. I would add ""graduates"" to that list but since he apparently never does any homework, I don't think that's a possibility.
•Wish I could just have a hook up for finals week, I need some way to get rid of all this stress
•Editor- I don't understand why you can't get the message to STOP CENSORING rants. If people have comments about Sarah McBride, and they're not obscene, by your own rules, you have to publish them. She's a public figure and like it or not, people have a right to express their opinions. If she didn't want the criticism, she shouldn't have published in the Eagle. You guys published it, you have to allow ALL sides of commentary.
[Editor's note: Hateful Rants will not be published. See Rants rules.]
•@fruit sharer: you made my day
•NANTS INGONYAMA BAGITHI BABA!
•@”Even the Texas Rangers who she claims to have helped deny working with her.” Are you seriously using this as your evidence? NO ONE she works with is allowed to confirm that she worked with them. Evidence discovered through a psychic is not admissible in court because we don’t yet understand the science behind it, so the police have to say that they found the evidence on a hunch via good police work. Are you really that clueless?
•@”And its very convenient that she can't do it on command isn't it?” Ya, it’s convenient that you can’t dream on command either. You must be lying whenever you talk about your dreams. Just because you don’t understand the neuroscience behind what she does doesn’t mean that she is faking it. People said the same thing about the first scientist who said that washing hands before delving babies would prevent more babies dying from infections. Why is it impossible to think there could be mind germ or mind DNA that we haven’t yet discovered?
•Can we vote to change the once a week summer rants? Is there any way the new editor will change his/her mind and decide to do daily rants? I can't take the weekly suspense! And it hasn't even started!
•@”Actually, the person harassing me started harassing my friends as well so I stepped back to protect them, and now because of this person and their friends I'm afraid to go out on campus except for class.” Why can’t you just ignore this person? I doubt AU has bullies who would follow you around harassing you. But if there is one, have you told your RA or campus security? PS Sorry for your situation.
•I can't wait to see my LDR bf either. That sense of peace knowing you will see him is wonderful. But I have to wait 6 more weeks. :(
•@”It's people like you that make people afraid of the gym.” People WHO, not people THAT.
•@”Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.” Assuming the rant was not jointly written by two friendless people, the plural pronoun “they’ve” does not go with the singular noun “OP”.  You’re welcome.
•I don't wanna leave AU next week!
•@”@ Chick who tried to give me an HJ. Don't try to perfect what I already have. You'll just embarrass yourself.” Curious, how does one perfect a penis with a HJ?  Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough? jw…
•@obsequious guys rant: Personally I like having an obsequious guy who wants to be my slave. ;)
•@ “Thanks AU...for one more year of horribly overpriced food and limited dining options.” You do realize AU was voted best vegetarian and vegan food for any college in the country right? AU food is great. Stop being a snob. Sorry you don’t have a personal chef following you around.
•@""Can we revoke the campus plan?""
-DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!
-Your license has just been revoked.
•ONE INCH. ONE FREAKING INCH. What kind of sick human being forces a sleep-deprived, hopeless college student to remount a project because the illustration board is ONE INCH too short.
•Dear Editor, Dorm ? Res. Hall
•I respond well to jerks
•It is me, the AU Vigilante. I am here to give my only warning to those who seek to take advantage of the drunk and vulnerable. Starting this summer and next semester I will be doing safe walk backs, quad patrols and other activities to ensure people are safe on this campus and the surrounding area 24/7. I will also create a system in which anyone can reach me if they ever feel unsafe. You may not see me, but you will feel my presence fighting evil on this campus. Vigilante Out
•Hope is not lost. Faith is not broken. The Vigilante lives
•can we make war against all the biddies?
•I do like you, I really do, but some things about you I really dont like.
•IF YOU SAY GDI AGAIN IMMA PUNCH YOU IN DA FACE <3
•Why do I bother playing support if my carry is just going to end up rushing a black cleaver and a warmogs.  LoL fans will know what I mean.  So many bad AD carries.
•I wish I hadn't wasted so much time in the beginning of the semester trying to be friends with one group of people.  I feel like I missed out on making other friends who I would have clicked with better.  I feel like it'll be harder to start up friendships as a sophomore than it was at the beginning of freshman year.
•I really don't want to have a big wedding with lots of people. Large crows for extended periods of time really stress me out. I'd rather just elope. But I know my brother and sister want a big wedding party. Is it selfish or emo to elope? Btw, my bf also prefers a very low key elopement.
•I love you so much. I wish I could give you your love language, but in this situation I cannot.
•Atlantic > Slate + Salon
•I wish eagle would allow anonymous commenting on the articles again like they used to a few years ago. It really sucks how now the articles don't have any comments. But I guess I'll just have to suffice with commenting on articles via eagle rants.
[Editor's note: Our comment system changed, making comments no longer anonymous. You can always make up a username.]
•Taking a shot of whiskey right before my exam today = best finals choice I've made yet.
•The only reason I really want to know your sexual preference is because I think you're dating potential. I know it's technically not my business and that you have every right not to make it public, but I really am curious. Unfortunately, it would be extremely odd to ask, so I'm left trying to figure it out with very little clues.
•@That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
You were lucky. Most of us have not. My experience has made me a lot less naive and willing to trust random AU kids to look out for my best interest. Someday you may lose your iPhone and it simply won't come back. Then you'll get the point.
•@""Hahaha, here that nice guy? One girl says sure you can be sloppy seconds after she has stopped whoring herself out, and the other ""I like nice guys"" but am a complete ditz. Screw em' acquire capital.""
^this guy is a moron and a douchebag. Don't listen to him.  I mean, come on- he used the wrong type of ""hear"". That's failing at basic middle school grammar.
•@ ""I don't care that girls think the straight men at AU are ugly and nerdy. I've always had good luck."" Amen, sister!
•@ ""I am 23 years old, have never had a girlfriend, and I am a misanthrope. Yes, I am a proud product of AU."" Are you from NJ and smoke a lot of weed? If so, I think I know you...
•I know. And if I seem like a b***h sometimes, it's because I don't want to give you the wrong impression.
•""Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known"" -Carl Sagan
•I want Finals week to be renamed ""Student Deathmatch Super Fun Time Week.""
•I know it's messed up but a part of me hopes you fail your ivy league finals and drop out so that we can be near each other again. I'm dying of loneliness.
#sorrynotsorry
•I love AU. I have had the best years of my life here and am glad that I won't have a single regret when I leave. #sucked the juice out of college and had the most enriching years of my life
•Let's play a game called ""If I didn't go to AU, I would be at x college."" I'll go first. If I didn't go to AU, I would be at University of Florida. So glad I came to AU.
•Im sorry but the DG salute looks absolutely stupid in all of your facebook pictures
•We can debate whether or not gym class heros was good all day long, but as long as AU continues to neglect the need for a big, campus wide outdoor music festival with a name like ""spring fling"" or whatever we're never going to have any campus-wide musical unity. Its sad that the best concert Ive been to this year was at GW.
•The reason I'm failing all my finals: Tetris Battle on facebook. Ack!
•Being unavailable is temporary until she's wearing a ring.  Do you seen one on me? Don't count me out yet.
•Here's how I rate The Eagle! F!!!!! Stop trying to be sensationalist and maybe you won't be sued
•CAUS and CASJ...shut up! No one cares what you have to say! If you don't like it here go to another school!
•President McBride wasn't present at enough events? Are you serious Eagle? You ""reporters"" need to come out of your cubby hole because McBride was everywhere.
•Hey Eagle reporters....get over yourself! You're not The New York Times or The Washington Post...Thanks!
•Hey Eagle...SG Senate got Gender Neutral Housing on campus #giveussomefreakingcredit
•SO MUCH SEX! YAY
•SG does not have a problem with inclusion! Stop making us seem like we are the Antichrist
•I didn't see The Eagle at the SG Senate Townn Hall. It's amazing how the one time we can look good the Eagle is not there. Coincidence...I think not?
[Editor's note: Eagle staffers have been at every SG Senate meeting.]
•Finals...Must Study...OOH cats online!
•REVEAL YOURSELF QUEEN OF THE QUAD!
•Thanks Heather for your fair report of SG Senate! It is good to know that there is someone who takes there job seriously in The Eagle
[Editor's note: Go Heather!]
•What does YOLO mean?
•Alright, Sarah McBride and those who obsess over her, I am very supportive of her but her attention is getting really annoying. We get it, you've been picked up by Gaga and HRC. I hope she remembers where she comes from. Also, her op ed was not necessary. Again, totally supportive, but her need for attention makes me gag.
•The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?
•I just overheard a girl ask who Tim McBride was... really, a whole year at AU and you don't know who he is?
•Eastbound and Down, baby.
•Peace to the homeboy Yangmo Ku. Keep ya head up, dawg.
•It won't be worth it without you.
•I never want to come back from Russia.
•the only time I go to breakfast at TDR is when I pull all nighters in the library- another punishment for staying up all night. am I the only one who thinks TDR breakfast sucks?
•To the girl constantly posting about how much she hates her roommate and how she is in love with her best friend who already transferred, hi. This is your roommate. Want to have an adult discussion? I'm not going to get upset; I've heard it all before. Might as well clear the air because we are only living together for four more days.
•No puedo hablar español, pero quería apoyar a la nueva sección bilingüe diatriba. Gracias Google Translate!
[Editor's note: Jajaja.]
•@ China. That is all.
Man you know what's up. ?????
•Editor, I love you.
[Editor's note: Aww thank you. This editor loves you too.]
•I started waking up early so I can read the rants when they first come out each day. I wake up early today and NO RANTS yet!!! AHHHHHH!
[Editor's note: Sorry! This editor is posting Rants from downtown at D.C. Superior Court in between covering murder cases.]
•Look, I just got accepted to AU a couple weeks ago. I’m just an average guy. I like sports and DVDs, but I’m worried the AU community won’t accept me because I’m “different.” You see, I was born with Werewolf Syndrome. My whole family’s got it for crying out loud! Before I enroll, I wanna hear what the AU community has to say about this.
•People here are so shallow Here!!  I have a micro pene. Ok there, I said it! Why can’t someone just give me a shot.
•The Incubator has just died.
•Why are there so many people hanging out and talking in the library during finals week? What the hell happened to courtesy?

2012-06-01,AU,China,"“Snow White and the Huntsman” has all the elements of a good medieval fantasy movie: a richly imagined world, breathtaking CGI, a dazzlingly good-looking cast. Only there’s something off.
It may be the soulless “acting” of Kristen Stewart. It may be the stilted, awkward dialogue. But it probably was that “Snow White and the Huntsman” tried to be the best interpretation of the classic fairytale to ever exist, only to fall a bit short.
The movie invests a lot in how it looks, spending much time on sweeping shots of the bleakly majestic countryside and slowing down the magic-filled CGI scenes as much as possible without looking too tawdry. Even the soundtrack makes an obvious effort to be as epic and grandiose as possible. And it works, at least for the first 45 minutes.
The story begins simply enough, with a prelude dictating the fall of the king (Noah Huntley, “Your Highness”) and Snow White (Kristen Stewart, “Twilight”) by the hands of the beautifully vicious Ravenna (Charlize Theron, “Young Adult”). After years of imprisonment, Snow White escapes, only to get lost in The Dark Forest, forcing Ravenna and her creepy brother (Sam Spruell, “Defiance”) to hire the titular Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth, “Thor”) to track her down. However, the Huntsman instead decides to aid her in her fight against the Ravenna.
Seems like a simple enough plot, right? Well, it seems the movie thought so too, and decided to spice things up with a few more subplots. “Snow White and the Hunstman” seems to pick up as many subplots as possible, including a magical destiny and a messy love triangle involving William (Sam Claflin, “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides”), a childhood friend of Snow White’s, both of which are unceremoniously dropped in favor of a huge battle scene. The overabundance of subplots weigh down the film, not to mention their lack of resolution.
If the subplots weren’t enough, there is many a plot hole and deus ex machina device in this movie. Many of which the film does not explain, opting instead to distract us with yet another beautiful scene of CGI magic. The hallucination scenes are indeed gorgeous, though.
As much fun as it is to rave about the excellent CGI, the actors aren’t to be overlooked. Theron is magnificent — albeit a bit one-note — as a vain woman driven power-mad by paranoia. She snarls and struts her way through her role but still manages to act circles around Stewart.
In fact, everyone acts circles around Stewart. The poor girl seems to have little talent for the wide-eyed vulnerability that the role seems to call for, looking instead like she’s posing for a magazine photo shoot in each shot. There’s no denying that Stewart is beautiful, but her limited acting ability makes it hard to see Snow White as a character rather than a plot device.
Hemsworth provides the gravitas and angst required for this movie, playing the Hunstman as a roguish brute with a heart of gold and a traumatic past. It was relieving to have him play a larger part in the film, as Snow White’s other love interest, played by Orlando Bloom look-a-like Claflin, does little other than look vaguely handsome and shoot off a couple of arrows.
“Snow White and the Huntsman” is an enjoyable medieval fantasy movie, especially if you’re up for ignoring gaping plot holes and a miscast main actress. If not, you can always re-watch “Game of Thrones.”

Right now premiums are high to account for everyone without insurance consuming health services without the ability to pay up. When everyone has insurance (especially when those formerly unable to pay can afford it), premiums will be lower because they won't need to account for other people's unpaid health bills.

2012-09-13,AU,China,"The Bánh mì was impeccable: crunchy daikon, savory beef and sweet plus acidic chili-lime mayo combined to create something that was magically foreign, but comfortably local. On a hot Friday afternoon, Navy Yard filled with four-wheeled ambassadors. My tongue could travel halfway across the world with 10 steps to my left or to my right, and it was easy to get lost amongst the tacos, hoagies, gelati, empanadas and curries at Truckeroo.
Beyond the smells, tastes and sounds of orders being yelled to truck-based culinary conductors, there is a history. Bánh mì dates back to French colonial involvement in Vietnam (then Indochina) in the 19th century. Combining the distinctively French baguette with rice-powder and Vietnamese meats, sauces and sides led to the birth of a sandwich that fused two cultures from opposite sides of the world, the result of a colonial empire.
Natives of D.C. will rave about the vibrant Ethiopian food, and many have sampled wot, injera or tibs. Yet, rarely is the question asked why D.C. has the largest Ethiopian population in the United States. The answer is rooted in the USSR-supported, Ethiopian Marxist movement of the 1970s. However, the story goes beyond Cold War politics: during the diaspora of the 1970s, Ethiopians settled in areas of D.C. like Adams Morgan and U Street, which were neglected and feared after the race riots of the 1960s. The immigrant population reinvigorated these neighborhoods and helped transform them into modern-day hotspots. 
This past week launched the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership, a joint effort between the U.S. State Department and the James Beard Foundation. Eighty chefs were given the designation of State Chefs as part of the American Chef Corps (some familiar names might be Mike Isabella, Rick Bayless and José Andrés). This partnership acknowledges the importance of food in understanding and connecting the world. The culinary 21st century has been defined by a recognition and admiration of local, ethnic and cultural foods. Never before have unique food cultures been embraced so openly by writers, critics, TV personalities and food blogs.
Food as diplomacy recognizes that the way to a person’s heart is through their stomach. Culinary ambassadors can connect the United States with individual from around the world through what is perhaps the oldest diplomatic tool. Food is universal, but also something that is unique to different countries, ethnic groups and religions. Understanding a culture’s food is essential to understanding the culture as a whole.
Food is more than just Yelp! reviews or Instagram photos. Food in D.C. is defined by not just cross-cultural collaboration and Americanization, but also ethnic independence. Culinary ambassadors are the first steps in understanding the world beyond GDP, political brinksmanship and the basic theories of international relations. The story behind the food, the story that connects us to different cultures, is almost as amazing as the sweet, spicy and savory Bánh mì at Truckeroo on a hot Friday afternoon.

2012-10-12,AU,China,"After wallowing for years as the bland leading man in a series of formulaic Hollywood efforts, Ben Affleck has recently re-established himself as a reputable director with ambitious, well-received pieces like “Gone Baby Gone” and “The Town.”
Affleck demonstrates his newly acquired talents with “Argo,” a sophisticated, taut suspense drama that employs real-life events to simultaneously exhilarate the audience and tweak Affleck’s beloved film industry. Likely to be a contender for several Academy Awards, “Argo” is gripping but not overly serious, smart but not overly complex, well-paced but not overlong. It’s just right.
The film begins in 1979 Iran, detailing relevant history through subtle animation. A stunning first sequence depicts an intense frenzy as Iranian protesters infiltrate the American embassy and take 52 Americans hostage. Six of the Americans manage to escape the Iranians’ clutches and find temporary refuge in the Canadian Embassy, but to leave from there would be to endanger their lives.
Back in D.C., CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) devises a risky and outlandish scheme to smuggle the hidden ambassadors out of militant Iran with minimum suspicion. With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman, “Trouble with the Curve”) and legendary producer Lester Siegel (a hilariously dry Alan Arkin, “The Muppets”), Mendez constructs the trappings of a fake science-fiction film called “Argo” and travels to Iran, where he hopes to transport the hostages disguised as a film crew.
“Argo” avoids many of the pitfalls of lesser thrillers. Its focus is tight, with no extraneous subplots to distract from the driving rescue narrative. The process-oriented script by Chris Terrio ignores melodramatic tendencies to focus on the simple problem of how best to retrieve the hostages, detailing necessary machinations like trade publications, script readings and publicity. Such buildup amplifies the power of the later, more action-oriented section.
The dialogue is sharp, with witticisms about the movie industry and Melendez’s drinking habits drawing surprisingly cathartic laughs amidst the pervasive tension. Affleck seems to be simultaneously mocking and celebrating his own industry, lampooning its tendency to produce schlocky science-fiction and foster unjustified egos while reinforcing the idea that movies, frivolous as they often seem, can make an impact.
The cast is superb. Affleck proves to be a capable (if not earth-shattering) lead, understated as a man who excels at his job even as his colleagues doubt him. Bryan Cranston’s intensity from “Breaking Bad” translates seamlessly into his role as Mendez’s boss, a man whose patience quickly wears thin. Goodman and Arkin, meanwhile, provide some of the film’s most vibrant comedic scenes; they are particularly adept at delivering several well-timed F-bombs and satirizing various Hollywood professions. 
Admittedly, “Argo” is not entirely original or even particularly surprising. The action sequences and dramatic conversations are compelling enough to offset much of the predictability, but the climax and denouement are far from shocking. Nonetheless, both pack a surprisingly emotional punch. Tony’s marital struggles, meanwhile, feel tacked on in a few obligatory scenes of Mendez moping generically, but the film’s moving conclusion and last line partially offset that unnecessary wrinkle as well. 
Affleck’s direction raises the suspense and accentuates the mood with such finesse that the relative lack of originality allows “Argo” to excel beyond conventional iterations of its genre.

2013-05-13,AU,China,"Baz Luhrmann's version of the quintessential American yarn of Jay Gatsby and his inevitable decline at the hands of the decadence and excess of the Jazz Age is a visual technicolor rhapsody.
As a director, Luhrmann can be divisive amongst moviegoers. After the questionable outing that was the arduous ""Australia,"" it's surprising to see him make a film like ""The Great Gatsby."" Although on the surface it seems gaudy and flamboyant, it has a reserved center, displaying a maturity in Luhrmann's direction. 
Luhrmann reunites with a fuller faced Leonardo DiCaprio (""Django Unchained"") 17 years after his neon fantasy version of ""Romeo + Juliet."" Considering the over-the-top parties Gatsby throws, it's not hard to see how Luhrmann was attracted to F.Scott Fitzgerald's generation defining novel.
The plot of the film remains the same as the novel, though with an added embellishment. The film frames the story with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire, ""Spider Man"") as he sequesters himself into a rehab. Carraway, filled with alcohol and regrets, seeks help when his doctor suggests he write to calm his nerves. 
Recalling his memory by actually writing ""The Great Gatsby,"" Carraway retells the events of moving to West Egg, Long Island. Unknown to him, Carraway has set down next to the enigmatic Gatsby's mansion.
Eventually, Gatsby asks Carraway if he would invite Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan, ""Drive"") for tea. Carraway, who sees this as an opportunity to show a kind gesture of friendship toward Gatsby, sets off a chain of events that lead to Gatsby's demise.
Luhrmann lets Fitzgerald's work speak for itself, knowing full well that the strength of the novel is in the power of its words.
At times, the screenwriting duo of Craig Pierce (""Moulin Rouge!"") and Luhrmann draws parallels a little too closely to the life of Fitzgerald. Luhrmann culls from Fitzgerald's life and letters in order to address the opulence that surrounds Gatsby's world. 
The script connects the real life friendship between Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald by fictionalizing it in the Hemingway-esque character of Tom Buchanan, that Joel Edgerton (""The Thing"") plays as a booming brute, and deconstructing Fitzgerald's personality between Carraway and Gatsby. This tenuous relationship eventually coalesces into an explosive confrontation over Daisy.
DiCaprio's performance as the golden haired midwestern boy who struck it big and eventually retreated to his empire of extravagance is more humanizing than Robert Redford's performance in Jack Clayton's version of ""The Great Gatsby."" Redford was at the pinnacle of his golden boy persona but was icy and too reserved. Dicaprio finds Gatsby's emotional core and exerts it for all its delirious net worth.
The weakest link, though, is unfortunately the source of Gatsby's obsession. Mulligan simply doesn't embody the character of Daisy well enough to make the audience believe that Gatsby would dedicate his life to resurrecting the past in order to blaze a future for them. Compared with Mia Farrow's performance in the aforementioned Clayton version, with her sharpened cheekbones, and a voice that literally sounded ""full of money,"" as Fitzgerald described, in Farrow the audience believed that a man would go to great lengths to win her over. In Mulligan, we do not.
It's also evident that much care went into recreating 1920's New York. From Simon Duggan's slick, expressive cinematography to Jay-Z's curated soundtrack, production design by Luhrmann's wife, Catherine Martin, and an evocative score by Craig Armstrong, the set becomes fevered, but believable. Luhrmann ties it together with references to films such as Alexander Mackendrick's ""Sweet Smell of Success"" to Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard.""
Much ballyhoo has been made about the 3D element, which seems like a novel idea at first. But the limits of the technology are evident. Blurry shots and unfocused backgrounds make the picture fall flat.
Luhrmann and Piece's script tries to fit in as many motifs of the original novel as possible, including the eyes of doctor T.J. Eckelberg hovering over the fiery expanse between New York and West Egg. Luhrmann also includes the troubled relationship between Myrtle and her husband George Wilson, played by Isla Fisher (""Rango"") and Jason Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty""), respectively. 
But the film attempts to fit in as much as possible. At a hefty 143 minutes, it feels muddled at times.
Suppose Luhrmann was intrigued by Fitzgerald's novel the same way he was attracted to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" Parallels between the two narratives unhinge at the limits of the character's grasp of control. The machinations of a few small acts condemn both Romeo and Gatsby to their death. 
Though ""Romeo and Juliet "" was a tragedy about the irrationality of youth, Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is about the projection of hope and the eventual victims of excessive hubris. Our hopes remain out of our grasp, like Gatsby's silhouette trapped looking across the Long Island sound upon that shimmering green light. 
We, too, are borne back, ceaselessly into the past.

2014-02-12,AU,China,"The Chosun bowl at Sakuramen.
As diners stroll by Adams Morgan’s most popular shops and restaurants, they can hear loud music from Madam’s Organ, smooth jazz from Tryst and hip-hop throwbacks from an underground ramen bar. 
That last adage might sound out of place. A ramen bar has Aaliyah, Wu-Tang Clan and pre-“Magna Carta Holy Grail” Jay-Z on rotation? 
That’s what Sakuramen, a ramen bar in a basement on Adams Morgan’s busy 18th Street, is all about. Walking down the steep, eroded steps into the warm bar, you can see the intentional blending of cultures, music and food. Ramen noodles are traditionally Japanese, but Sakuramen makes a note to fuse different Asian foods into the restaurant’s bowls of broth, noodles and other goodies. 
My favorite dish every time I visit, usually to impress friends from home, is the Chosun bowl. The different flavors and culinary staples from Korea, Japan and China are all apparent in the bowl. Angus bulgogi steak, seasoned boiled egg, kimchi and nori (seaweed) blend Korean and Japanese foods in a bowl without muddling the flavors. The umami flavors of the steak and boiled egg stand by themselves and at the same time balance out the broth and nori.
For adventurous eaters, try the Tonkotsu Red bowl. Boiled pork is enough for me to call this dish a stretch. For those not used to the texture, take it slow. But once you get over the naked texture of boiled pork, you realize how wonderfully flavorful it is. The Tonkotsu Red also uses pork broth and ranges from not that spicy to outrageously spicy. I always go for the spiciest of flavors offered. The Tonkotsu Red bowl tries the taste buds but not in a way that prevents diners from enjoying their food.
I consistently bring out-of-towners to Sakuramen for the great location, warm atmosphere and even better food. Unlike typical American dining, Sakuramen uses long tables where diners face each other. This is a great way to meet people and feel connected with the surroundings. If you want a more private experience, there are some smaller tables around the restaurant.
Prices are fair for the quality of food you get as well as the heap of deliciousness in your bowl. Typically, bowls range between $11-$13.
Waiters are also a plus at Sakuramen. They are as cool as the house soundtrack and nice enough to help diners who know nothing about ramen, kimchi or nori.
Next time you’re on 18th, bypass the jumbo slice and take a chance on Sakuramen.

Arts & Entertainment
Although the fourth is an American holiday, celebrate other cultures while you wait for the fireworks at the second week of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, from July 2-9 . This year’s spotlight is on China and Kenya, and both nations have booths filled with art, food and cultural performances all day on the National Mall. 
Speaking of the National Mall, the annual Capitol Fourth Concert will take place on the West Lawn of the Capitol and on live telivision at 8 p.m. This year’s lineup includes artists old and new, like Frankie Valli, John Williams, Phillip Phillips, Jordin Sparks and many, many more.

If lyrics aren’t your thing, the National Cathedral is hosting its annual Independence Day Organ Recital at 11 a.m. Hear your favorite American classics performed in one of D.C.’s largest houses of worship and ask yourself, “What is separation of church and state?”
Music
If you’ve always wondered what it would be like to be admitted to Puff Daddy’s notorious White Party, here’s your chance (sort of). The DMV’s rap and hip-hop radio station, WKYS, is hosting their Independence Day White Out party at the Howard Theatre, complete with a performance by rapper and entrepreneur Yo Gotti.

Doors open when the party begins, 10:30 p.m., right after the fireworks are finished.
Lifestyle
For food, music, fireworks and a good ol’ American block party, stop by the Hill Country’s Backyard Barbecue on the N*ational Building Museum’s West Lawn* from 2 to 9 p.m., where Jeremy Steding, The Slim Kings (featuring Liberty DeVitto) and Jonny Grave & the Tombstones will be performing.

2014-09-12,AU,China,"Eagle columnist Shelby Ostergaard has written an eloquent plea for AU to divest from its energy stocks (Divestment necessary for AU’s future, April 18 Eagle), but it rests on two assumptions, one unproven and the other incorrect. First, Ostergaard claims that if energy companies “burn all the oil they currently have, the temperature of the world will go up six degrees.” Then she reports that “every AU student has had, in at least one class, a discussion about climate change and the havoc that oil drilling is imposing on our planet.” 
In her first assumption, Ostergaard is simply repeating what climate modelers call “scenarios,” not even predictions, that occur when computers are run for a hundred years forward using the opaque models that have been “tuned” to replicate temperatures over the past 100 years. As someone who has guided students through the models and statistics of climate change here at AU for the past decade, I can tell your readers that the models, while fascinating in their construction, are in their infancy, both in looking backwards and in looking forwards. They certainly have misfired badly over the past 15 years, predicting one of those degrees of temperature rise but seeing, in reality, absolute zero. 
In her second assumption, Ostergaard appears to misunderstand the nature of instruction. Of course we professors introduce issues relating to claims of “climate change” but not to impose on our students a belief that oil drilling creates “havoc.” We certainly hope that students will form an opinion, based on the way we have taught them to analyze evidence for themselves, about whether it was more likely natural fluctuation or industrial gas that caused the one degree rise in temperature from 1860 to 2000, and whether that one degree rise has led to havoc in hurricanes, droughts and sea level rise. But the data are weak on all of these questions, and it is not our job to make those judgments for them. Similarly, the University as a whole is not able to decide these difficult and uncertain scientific questions, and so should not be choosing stocks on the basis of allegations of “climate change.” The same holds true for hydraulic “fracking,” to which Ostergaard is so opposed. The trade-offs between the environmental risks and the economic payoffs are many and varied, and should be decided by elected politicians, not appointed academics. 
As someone who also teaches African politics, I would argue that even if the scariest climate change scenarios come true, there is a strong moral argument for not applying divestment to energy companies working in Africa. I am a great believer in divestment as a tactic in achieving social justice. I worked on the anti-apartheid divestment campaign both in college and as a staffer in Congress. But this time, divestment will harm, not help, Africans. 
A successful divestment campaign would be a death sentence for African economic development and millions of Africans. Like many other areas in the developing world, Africa has not achieved the carbon-based industrialization that has boosted education, comfort, income and life expectancy to record levels in the developed world. Even if Africa did make the leap, it would still account for only about 5 percent of global emissions. America’s per person emissions are 20 times higher. 
African economic development is being derailed by a lack of reliable consumer and industrial electricity. According to the World Bank, only 24 percent of Africans have access to electricity, which is being denied them on the basis of the supposed environmental dangers of electricity.  The rest must resort to burning dung and wood in their houses and huts, leading to horrific rates of lung and heart disease.
The typical African business loses power 56 days each year, severely constraining investment and output in commerce, agriculture, education and industry. Growth suffers, and because wealth allows people to live healthily, so does life expectancy. Energy poverty is stunting the sort of economic growth that Africa needs if it is to move from 59 years of life expectancy to the 79 that China has achieved through 20 years of economic growth fueled by intense, government-backed promotion of carbon-based electrical capacity. With almost a billion Africans alive today, that is about 20 billion years of life lost. 
As it was under apartheid, so it is for energy now: it is for the Africans, not the West, to decide.  They wanted freedom then, and they want reliable electricity now. There is a right to development just like there is a right to democracy. Let’s listen to Africans’ voices as they call for 100 percent access to electricity. Let’s envision the children sitting in their huts as deadly wood smoke swirls around them, with the fire too dim for them to read their homework assignments. Please, AU, let’s divest from the call for energy divestment.

2014-10-13,AU,China,"Gaining access to international cinema can be a challenge. Films are frequently rare or out of print, and copyright issues occasionally prevent them from being seen at all outside of their host country. But beginning this semester, samples of world cinema are coming straight to campus and anyone can see them at no cost.
The International Cinema Series – a multi-year program sponsored by AU, the National Gallery of Art and several embassies – began in late September with a quartet of Italian films. Each film is carefully selected based on its cultural significance or simply because it is a never-before-seen gem. 
The Italian series featured an especially unique blend: two classic films and two contemporary films, each offering its own portrait of lifestyles throughout the country’s history.
International films are different from domestic films in several ways, according to Sharon Metcalf, senior director of Strategic Partnerships and Programs in the School of Communication. 
“The foreign films unfold at a different pace, but there’s nothing like film to give you the perspective of day-to-day life,” Metcalf said.
This will be especially evident in the next series of films, beginning Oct. 17. Four documentary features, all made in China, will receive screenings, and one of them (“Nostalgia – The Ballade of Village”) will receive its U.S. premiere. Each film presents a glimpse into the lives of Chinese citizens in both rural and urban locations.
November will feature films created in the Czech Republic, and in December viewers will travel to Greece.
Each screening is preceded by a brief discussion in which speakers offer introductory remarks. “Il Sorpasso”, one of the Italian films, featured opening statements from SOC Dean Emeritus and Film and Media Arts professor Larry Kirkman, as well as Michele Giacalone, public relations officer for the Italian Cultural Institute. 
“It’s very enriching for viewers to have that context and appreciate some of the nuances of the film that they might not have been otherwise aware of,” Metcalf said.
Audiences at the International Cinema Series so far have included Gallery members, film aficionados, AU students and staff, diplomats and many more. 
The International Cinema Series takes place in the Malsi Doyle and Michael Forman Theater in the McKinley Building. A full schedule is available online at american.edu/nga Cinema Series.

2014-11-11,AU,China,"I am not afraid of men. I am afraid of a lot of things—the dark, that parasite that crawls into your brain in hot springs, peacocks—but not men. I am a freshman in college in Washington, D.C., and I will admit that I walk by myself all the time and I am never afraid. I go places by myself at night that I definitely shouldn’t (don’t tell my parents), and I have never once felt unsafe. 
Recently I watched a documentary on rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo in my sociology class. I watched as women recounted being raped by groups of men, brutalized, sodomized with branches and the barrels of guns. These women often develop fistulas due to the tearing of their vaginal and uterine walls. They are left incontinent. Social pariahs unable to care for themselves and their children. In Congolese society, being raped is often a social death-sentence.  
I walked out of my class at 1:00 p.m. feeling ill. I needed to get off campus. My favorite pho truck was parked on 7th and G Street so I made my way to Chinatown. I got off the metro and headed towards a row of food trucks when suddenly a man grabbed me by the hand. His grasp was so firm that I thought he had broken my bone. 
“Hey, what’s your name?” he said.
“Hi...I’m sorry I have to go,” I managed to stumble out. 
I tried to keep walking but I was jerked back with force. He wouldn’t let go. He pulled me closer to him and put his other arm around my waist. He smelled like grease.
I started to panic. I was practically screaming, pleading with him to let me go but he was steadfast in his grip. About a hundred people were watching, but no one did anything.        I began to cry, he softened his hold on me for an instant and I bolted. I ran up to a group of businessmen and pretended to answer a phone call as my assailant calmly strode away. These men had seen what had happened but none of them said a word to me. 
In a daze, I ordered my beef pho and sat on the side steps of the National Portrait Gallery. Everyone was staring at me. They had all watched from their perch as one of the scariest moments of my life unfolded like it was some sort of Aeschylean drama, and now they watched me cry over a Styrofoam bowl of soup. I felt like some sort of modern Blanche DuBois facsimile, listless in high-waisted shorts and a striped sweater as my Stanley faded into the crowd. 
The reality is that I am considered “lucky.” I was not raped, I was not severely beaten and I have incurred no fistulas. My experience today was incredibly scary, but there will be no lasting damage. But does that make it okay? Is it acceptable that this man was allowed to walk right up to me and make me so afraid that I later cried and vomited in front of my favorite art exhibit? 
I am not afraid of men. I will continue to walk by myself whenever I damn well please. I will not be afraid of what’s lurking in the shadows. I am terrified, however, of anyone who says that he or she hates feminism. Anyone who thinks that women seeking to live in a world where being grabbed on the street isn’t considered “lucky” is some sort of an affront to men. Anyone who thinks that feminism is about women wanting to have their cake and eat it, too. Anyone who can deny that women disproportionately bear the brunt of poverty and conflict.   Anyone who can acknowledge that women face rape, genital mutilation and sexual humiliation as a product of war and still ask, “But what about men?” 
Equality is not a zero-sum game. By increasing the rights of women, nothing is taken away from the rights of men. By advocating for equal pay in this country and equal access to education in another, men do not suffer. The consequence of feminist success is not a militant-lesbian hegemony in which all bras are burned and men become untouchables. The consequence of feminist success is progress.

2015-05-08,AU,China,"Songbyrd Record Cafe, a new restaurant in Adams Morgan, offers its customers the opportunity to record their own vinyl records, all while consuming delicious cafe food. Created by Alisha Edmonson and Joe Lapan, the cafe is a gem for foodies and music lovers alike.

	Edmonson and Lapan named the cafe after Charlie Byrd, the famous 60s jazz and Bossa Nova mixer. The restaurant sits in the same location where Byrd supposedly conjured up the inspiration for one of his albums, 
	according to the Washington Post.

	Visitors can record an album of their own for a fee of $15. Guests can record three minutes and ten seconds of anything on a 7 inch vinyl record. Those who are musically inclined can bring instruments into Songbyrd’s 1947 Voice-O-Graph, as long as the instrument fits into the room. If a visitor lacks an instrument, the cafe will provide the aspiring recording artist with a guitar.

	Before guests record their masterpieces, they should take a look at the restaurant’s menu. Every food item on Songbyrd’s menu is named after a band or song, like “Love Me Do,” a beef on a baguette sandwich, and “Little Richard,” a veggie muffaletta. The cook serves the decent portioned options in a colorful way that can only be described as “hip.”

	While the sandwiches at Songbyrd will satisfy most customers, the open-faced focaccia pizza are the cafe’s most notable dish. If you can’t decide what to order, try the Mumbo Slice pizza, which is topped with pork, pineapple and other goodies. Or, if you’re in the mood for something big and heavy, try the Jumbo Slice pizza, a pizza topped with provolone and pepperoni. Songbyrd also offers delectable coffee and espresso. The restaurant’s organic free-trade coffee and espresso live up to high expectations of even the snobbiest of coffee experts.

	While waiting to be served, guests can browse Songbyrd’s assortment of records for sale and test them out at listening stations before making a purchase. Jazz and Brazilian vinyl records line the shelves of the cafe, accompanied by plenty of blues, indie, classic rock, soul and funk records.


Songbyrd has a plethora of vinyl record items for purchase (Danielle Bourn/The Eagle).




	Songbyrd Record Cafe might be the perfect hipster date spot of Adams Morgan, much like Kramerbooks of Dupont Circle and Chinatown Coffee in Gallery Place. The cafe blends the love for the old with the inevitability of the new, giving the cafe an aura of nostalgic modernism. So, take a trip to Songbyrd Record Cafe, eat some pizza and give all those indie bands some competition with an album of your own.

2016-10-13,AU,China,"I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

2017-04-11,AU,China,"Murray Bessette, Adela Lan, Larry Liu, Burton Wides and Ning Xianhua take their seats as they discuss the recent events in China. 
Scholars and activists gathered at AU on March 29 to discuss political persecution, organ harvesting and human rights in China. 
Murray Bessette, director of academic programs at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, hosted the panel of speakers that included Adela Lan of Initiatives for China, Larry Liu of Falun Dafa Information Center, Burton Wides of Human Rights Legal Counsel and Ning Xianhua, a former political prisoner in China. 
Jason Lin, a sophomore in the School of International Studies, created the event to shed light on China’s political persecution, censorship and organ harvesting. 
“In light of China’s ongoing violations of human rights, I felt compelled to speak out against the regime and bring together scholars and activists to reveal a narrative to the AU community, often censored abroad or self-censored as a result of pressure from Chinese soft power,” Lin said. 
China’s organ harvesting trade involves forced organ harvesting or political prisoners and minorities to be sold on the black market. 
“In September 2013, the Organ Transplant Institution for Peking University told China Economic Weekly that the hospital conducted 12,000 liver and kidney transplants within the particular year,” Liu said. “All of the organs were from prisoners sentenced to death.” 
Liu said that the Chinese government claims that only 10,000 organ transplants occur per year. In 2007, only 169 hospitals were licensed to conduct organ transplants. More than 600 hospitals had conducted them without a license, he said.
There are two components of organ transplants in China that are very different from the process in the rest of the world and signal abnormalities in China, Liu said. 
Liu said that the first component is that transplants require a very short waiting time of weeks or even days, which he said could only be possible with a large bank where organs can be harvested from. The second aspect is that there was not an organ donation program in the country until 2013. 
Ning Xianhua, a former political prisoner, is very familiar with what prison life is like in China. “I have been detained many times and arrested five times,” Xianhua said. 
In 2013, due to his involvement with creating human rights groups, Xianhua was arrested and placed in jail. Xianhua said the conditions there were dismal; he received soup that was almost water as food, would have to sleep on boards, received very little daylight and was denied visits while in prison due to his political activity. 
“The treatment there was very inhumane,” Xianhua said. “I had a black bag over my head during all of the investigations and only allowed to wear underwear or whatever they gave us.”
Wides, a representative from Human Rights Legal Counsel, described the situation in China as a brutal dictatorship, oppressive and a nightmare for ethnic minorities. 
“No independent minded person can go to bed in China feeling comfortable,” Wides said. 
He expressed that Americans that are not familiar with the issue have no idea of how extreme the situation is. One of the reasons for this is how much power the Chinese government has on what people hear, see and read about China. Wides described the government as having great control over what information is released. 
“As a society of people who can speak freely and live without fear of political persecution, it is our responsibility to ensure that others have the same because just like them, we had generations of activists and revolutionaries that have worked to secure the liberties that we presently have,” Lin said. “It is time for us to pay it forward.”
Fatima Tariq, a freshman in the School of International Studies, was glad to see the discussion panel taking place at AU. She believes that such panels give insight to what is happening in the world and make her grateful for her surroundings, as well as her rights. 
“Humans work to improve their lives, but for people in developing countries such as China, it’s contradictory,” Tariq said. “Working improves their economic lives, but impacts their rights as humans.”
The discussion panel was followed by a screening of the movie “The Bleeding Edge,” which provides insight about organ harvesting. 
For those who would like to help, Lin suggested becoming up to date on human rights violations in China, and reaching out to nonprofits such as China Aid and Initiatives for China to get involved. 
“We can reach out to our elected officials to take a stand against these atrocities abroad and work towards advancing human rights in China,” Lin said.

2019-06-05,AU,China,"Freshmen Saumya Mangalick and Marissa Proto are making waves in the AU community through their start-up beauty company, Viale. They became involved in the American University Center for Innovation after being accepted into the University’s Incubator program. 
Viale connects beauty creators and helps them market their services to students and potential clients. Their website provides links to each creator’s individual booking system. They use social media to reach their clients through direct messaging and show before-and-after pictures of customers. 
Viale didn’t just start as a pitch to the Incubator program. Mangalick said she began providing beauty services to students by starting an eyebrow threading business out of the freshman dorms. 
“I learned how to do threading when I was 12 years old,” she said. “When I got to college, people started asking me where I was getting my brows done.” Mangalick then began threading her friends’ eyebrows, and word quickly spread. 
“It is a pretty big time commitment, so I started charging $5 per threading, and I was running it off of Instagram,” she said. “It became so overwhelming that I was unable to keep track of every single person that wanted an appointment.” 
She researched online booking systems and then began hearing from customers from all grade levels, including graduate students. According to Mangalick, social networking was the key to her services becoming well-known in the student community. 
Customers weren’t the only ones reaching out— Mangalick said that students talented in other aspects of cosmetology started reaching out to her to ask for advice. That’s when Mangalick met Proto, the co-founder of Viale. 
“We started talking and realized that this is a bigger issue that affects every single college campus,” Mangalick said. “Beauty services for students are often geographically inaccessible because you have to go off campus somewhere and [are] also exorbitantly expensive.”
The Viale team is composed of co-founders Mangalick and Proto, as well as Sam Doran who is the company’s tech assistant responsible for maintaining the website. The other beauty creators are Aena Iqbal, who specializes in makeup, Sydney Peltz, a hair stylist, and Alice Wang, a nail artist who was professionally trained in China. 
The team emphasized the impact that social media has had on marketing their product.
“Instagram and social media has really allowed us to connect to people and create these surprisingly intimate personal connections to people,” Doran said. “Our goal is to build community— connecting people— to make the campus a nicer place.”
They chose a name that reflects their values, Mangalick said. Proto, who is of Italian descent, chose the Italian word “viale” because it means avenue. 
“We seek to be the avenue that connects students to other students who are all passionate about self-care, self-love and promoting that in a positive way,” Mangalick said. “Our whole philosophy is that every single person should have the tools they need to take care of themselves and appreciate the beauty that they have.”
Armed with a team of beauty creators ready to service the AU community, Mangalick began looking for the next steps forward.
One of Mangalick’s Kogod professors encouraged her to look into the Incubator program. 
“After doing some research about the program, talking to some of the professors that were involved with it, I met with Marissa and together we did the initial application,” she said. “We had to come in for an informal interview, which is when we brought Sam along.” 
After the interview, the three students pitched Viale to the leaders of the Incubator and moved onto the final stage— a 10-minute formal business pitch followed by a questioning period. 
Viale officially became part of the AU Center for Innovation in January. Through the Incubator, located in Don Meyers, the team is able to hold meetings and workshops in the coworking space, office, and pitch room.
“Professor White and Professor Bellows have worked with us to refine our ideas and introduce us to people in the industry,” Doran said. “[They] give us guidance and also the physical space and validity that goes along with that to build our product.” 
Viale will also receive a grant of $1,500 this summer to cover start-up costs. Over the summer, the two co-founders will focus on researching legalities, competition, and the in’s and out’s of the industry, Mangalick said. 
Their current system needs to be smoothed out, she said, but they will work to improve it for the fall. 
“Our goal for the fall semester is to have a fully integrated platform that has our own booking system, our own payment service, our own gallery showcase and review system,” she said. “We would also be having a mobile app developed so that any student can easily make an appointment for whatever they need.”
Threading client and School of Communications student Jéla Lewter is a two-time customer of Mangalick’s threading service and had a few issues with the booking system and Mangalick’s availability. “I acknowledge that she’s a college student too, and you have to cut them some slack,” she said. “There will be some kinks you have to work out, but overall I was really satisfied with the results and the way my eyebrows turned out.” 
She commented that the service was very conversational and that Mangalick provided the option for the threading to be done wherever she felt comfortable.
Even with the current system that they have, Viale has made an impact on the AU community. 
“Students are excited to feel good about themselves, and we are helping them do that by offering nearby, inexpensive, high-quality beauty services done by people in their community,” Proto wrote in an email. “People want to work with us for free because they see how spreading self-love makes people feel, and they want to be a part of that force.”
When they return in the fall, the Viale team will tentatively appear at a launch event during Welcome Week. “We [want to] show the returning campus and any new students that we’re here to make their lives easier,” Mangalick said.

2019-07-03,AU,China,"Florence Pugh, Vilhelm Blomgren and Jack Reynor in ""Midsommar""
In “Hereditary,” director Ari Aster built tension and horror around deftly placed hints throughout the movie’s 127 minute run time. One could never quite place it, but something was incredibly unsettling about the life of the seemingly normal family at the heart of the story. It isn’t until the third act of the film—following an exceptionally gruesome twist—that things begin to reveal themselves, and all hell breaks loose.
In his much-anticipated subsequent feature, “Midsommar,” Aster disposes of the conventional, dread-inducing uncertainty of a quiet room’s dark corners and drags audience members out into the uncertain terror of the Swedish sun, where blonde men and women adorned in white clothes and flower crowns dance giddily in beautiful, grassy fields.
The plot follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), as well as a group of Christian’s friends. One friend, Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren),invites the group to his remote commune in the forests of Sweden for a once-in-a-lifetime midsummer festival. Dani’s impromptu presence on the trip is blatantly unwelcome from the perspective of the group of friends, especially since it is made clear from the beginning that the couple’s relationship has been teetering on the brink of collapse for some time. That being said, a recent tragedy in Dani’s life caused the group to soften, reluctantly enduring her presence.
This is not to say that Dani is bothersome, however. She is the principal character, and she is deeply sympathetic, especially after what she goes through in the first 10 minutes of the film. Aster establishes immediately that her company is a group of men that aren’t meant to be liked. This plays a role throughout the film as the themes and tropes of toxic relationships and “ugly Americans” progressively become more apparent.
It would be unfair to constantly compare “Midsommar” to its predecessor, but in many ways, it feels like “Midsommar” is a direct and deliberate circumvention of what made “Hereditary” a success. This is one of those pesky movies where writing about the details would be revealing too much, but while  “Hereditary” relies on twists and plot elements that seemingly came out of nowhere to reveal its true intent, “Midsommar” lays bare its machinations relatively early on. The viewers know that something is going to go wrong, and throughout much of the film, our American visitors seem to be uneasy as well.
In disposing of dirty tricks and common—even if intelligently used—tropes, viewers are just as much along for the ride as Dani and company. While the straightforward and even prophetic storytelling is refreshing, at times the borderline telegraphed plot points take away from some of the tension that is being built up into the finale. 
“Midsommar” is essentially a film without a climax, but that shouldn’t necessarily be seen as a negative. There is one moment about halfway through the movie that dramatically and viscerally changes the tone of the festival—oh, you’ll know it when you see it—and from that point forward, the rest of the film feels like a sickening (and beguiling) fever dream that our ugly American friends (and the audience) must ride out.
Whereas “Hereditary” was deceptively interested in the supernatural, “Midsommar” demonstrates that there is nothing more immediately frightening than the mundane. The ambiguity and creeping unease of the festival and the intentions of this idyllic community are infinitely more universal and more frightening than any ghost or demon.
Ultimately, “Midsommar” is a deceptively complex (and funny!) rumination on many themes, ranging from toxic relationships to cultural ignorance, a twisted expression of female empowerment to the reception and craft of Aster’s previous feature. This gruesome misadventure will leave you—along with the residents of this commune—smiling all the while.
Midsommar will be released on Wednesday, July 3.

2020-02-13,AU,China,"Ferkat Jawdat, an Uighur American activist whose family was targeted for his continued advocacy against the prosecution of Turkic Muslims in China, spoke at AU on Jan. 28. Jawdat had not seen his mother in 14 years and said she spent time in one of China’s internment camps for Muslims in Xinjiang.
Jawdat began speaking out about the issue in 2018. Since then, he has been covered in the press, spoken at many events and met with U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event, moderated by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, occurred on international Holocaust Remembrance Day. Before the discussion, Rogin took a moment to acknowledge the many human rights atrocities that have taken place since the Holocaust, including what is currently taking place in China. 
Jawdat’s family has faced repercussions as a result of him speaking out. His mother described being monitored, mistreated and pressured by the Chinese government. This story was documented by the New York Times podcast “The Daily.” Jawdat said that even when speaking at colleges like AU, the Chinese government will pressure his mother to tell him to stop speaking out. 
He said that despite the personal risk to his family, his activism is essential. 
“Every time Western people hear about or read about 3 million people locked up in concentration camps, it just becomes a statistic to them,” Jawdat said. “I realized that I can use my story to put a face on the number.”
Jawdat also pointed to the parallels of the rise of xenophobia in the U.S. and in China. 
“China just borrowed the war against terror from the U.S. government and used it as a reason to suppress the Uighurs,” he said.
Jawdat said that college students can involve themselves in the issue by reaching out to their representatives and protesting goods made in China. 
KPU Director Kevin Norton said that he wanted to give the Chinese government a chance to also share their perspective. He wrote to the Chinese ambassador prior to the event, inviting them to join the discussion, but did not receive a response. 
“I told my team that if you want to travel to China, I suggest not working this event,” said Norton.

2020-03-10,AU,China,"This article has been updated with a correction. The University did not quarantine students returning from South Korea for 14 days in Nebraska Hall. The statement was referring to students from China only. No students returning from South Korea returned to campus upon their arrival in the U.S.
As the threat from the coronavirus increases both around the world and in D.C., the University’s cross functional Emergency Response Team says they are exploring proactive ways to handle the situation. Options on the table include online education, a period of suspended in-person classes and self-quarantine or “social distancing,” among smaller adjustments. 
David Reitman, the medical director of the Student Health Center, explained that the University is working closely with the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health as it designs its response. As changes are made, Fanta Aw, the vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence, and Jessica Waters, the dean of undergraduate education, said that main priorities for the response team are maintaining student health, avoiding any education disruption and continuing clear communication with the community about the University’s status. 
Once decisions are made by the team, Waters said that implementation is done at the individual level.
“We had a group of 20 students coming back from South Korea,” Waters said. “They're all in different academic programs, have different academic needs, maybe one’s a senior, one’s a freshman, they're taking this course or taking that course … We are working very closely with each and every individual student through their associate dean and their advisor to make sure we understand their individual academic situation.”
Reitman said that 10 students returning from China were initially not told by the government to self-quarantine, but following a press conference from Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, three students were moved to Nebraska Hall for two days to reduce interactions with the rest of the campus community. Communication between the CDC and HHS confused the process for two days, he added, but the University worked out the problem with the CDC and the D.C. Department of Heath to clarify the situation and notify the students that they no longer had to self-quarantine.
Depending on their situation, students back from abroad will be conducting independent studies, taking online classes or doing some combination of the two, Aw said. 
The Emergency Response Team, which makes the major decisions on the University’s handling of the coronavirus, is made up of six administrators, including Aw, Reitman, Waters, Director of Public Affairs Stacie Burgess, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Matt Bennett and Assistant Vice President of Risk, Safety and Transportation Dan Nichols.
AU has already taken a series of actions to address the spread of the virus. Study abroad students in China, South Korea and Italy have been recalled to the U.S.after the CDC upgraded the threat level in those countries, and AU announced Thursday night that it was suspending international alternative break programs and the trip to California.
Tess Herdman, a senior in the School of International Service who was studying in Rome until her program was cancelled, said that she’d been told she could continue her classes online, as the Eagle previously reported. She added that the University said she’d be compensated for her flight back, which Aw confirmed. 
All decisions by the team are made with student finance in mind, Aw said, which is why the University is offering refunds and reimbursements where possible.
On Thursday, the Department of Education released guidelines on how universities should handle coronavirus, which included greatly increased discretionary freedom for institutions to change policies on distance education, enrollment requirements, federal work study payments and the length of the academic year. 
“The Department of Education came up with guidance that… really [advances] what needs to happen at this time,” Aw said. “Our team in financial aid… analyzed that to understand what the implications are, and the big macro level is really that they provided enough flexibility that would allow [the University to quickly implement online classes] that would allow it to become part time if needed… so students are not adversely impacted.” 
“Every decision that we've been making when students have been coming back is with financial aid in mind, and making sure that that is really preserved as much as possible because we know that it is really critical for students and their families,” Aw said. 
The University is preparing for the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak in Washington D.C., following the announcement that there have been three confirmed cases in Montgomery County, Maryland and one confirmed case in D.C. These plans involve asking faculty to prepare online course content in the possibility that in-person classes may be suspended after spring break.
Georgetown University announced on Wednesday that it had suspended all university-sponsored international travel. The Hatchet, George Washington University’s student newspaper, wrote on Thursday that the university had done the same.

2020-03-12,AU,China,"The AU Abroad office in 2017. 
In an email late Wednesday night, the University announced that in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend all travel between Europe and the United States for the next 30 days starting Friday, all AU Abroad programs worldwide are cancelled effective immediately. 
Students abroad are required to return to their homes as soon as possible, Provost Dan Meyers and Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw wrote in the email to the AU community. All faculty and staff traveling and planning to travel are also required to cancel plans and return. 
The announcement comes days after the University announced it was moving classes online for three weeks following spring break. Students studying abroad in China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain have already been recalled. 
“AU Abroad and academic programs will be providing additional information, but given the impact of this development, we wanted to inform our community as soon as possible,” Meyers and Aw wrote in the email. 
The email said the University would work with students on “academic arrangements, travel and financial matters.”
In a separate email to students studying abroad in Europe, Mark Hayes, the director of AU Abroad, recommended that they book flights back to their permanent addresses as quickly as possible. The decision extends to students in the United Kingdom, even though the country is excluded from Trump’s announcement. 
“Further communications will be forthcoming to you very soon,” Hayes wrote in the email that arrived just before 2 a.m. in the U.K. “Please keep a close watch for new messages and be prepared to respond immediately.”

2020-08-12,AU,China,"The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting visual art.
 Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on theeaglecoronavirusproject.com, a separate website created by Eagle staff at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Articles from that website have been migrated to The Eagle’s main site and backdated with the dates they were originally published in order to allow readers to access them more easily. 
Updates and corrections: This article has been updated since it was first published with artwork from Mikray Pida. It’s also been corrected to state that Pida lived in Hebei Province during the SARS outbreak, not Hubei and “Katzen Gallery” has been replaced with “AU Museum.” Randal Packer’s name has been fixed with the proper spelling.
Due to the coronavirus, the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center remains closed, and many artists have had their shows canceled. Curators and creators have been rethinking the ways in which they can present their art. 
Randall Packer, a former professor in the Department of Art, started a website in 2017 called the Third Space Network, an online platform meant to break the barrier between the physical space and digital space. The goal of the platform is to create a “third space,” known as the shared space between the two.
“All of a sudden, with the Third Space Network, I found myself at the center of a complete transformation that was taking place in education, in theatre and performance,” Packer said.  “I’ve been developing techniques for this very moment in time for the past 10 years.” 
Packer develops programs and collaborates with artists to host town halls, live events and  interviews from his home studio. 
Packer felt that the online experience was largely underestimated as a medium for art, due to people’s lack of understanding on how to navigate the internet. During his events, he encourages social interaction among all the attendees, such as asking questions and being active in the chat box.  
“I was really interested in how I could make this dynamic more social so that people forget they are even on the internet,” Packer said. 
Attendance at Packer’s events varies between 100 to 500 people depending on the type, he said. Packer hopes that other artists will be able to find creative and innovative ways to adapt to the changing circumstances. 
Packer has been working on a series called Raw Hope of Humanity Rising to discuss artists’ work and to capture some of people’s ideas leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Topics include Democracy vs Authoritarianism, Information vs Propaganda and Idealism vs Cynicism.
The last talk of the series will be on the theme Real vs Fake on Sept. 2. 
Recently, Packer has also been working with the founding director and curator at the AU Museum, Jack Rasmussen, to host virtual gallery talks and transition some of the gallery’s exhibitions online.
According to Rasmussen, the AU Museum will remain closed for the rest of 2020, and about 20 artists have had their shows canceled as a result. People can still download catalogues from canceled shows on the museum’s website. 
“Works of art are a lot more than a digital image of something,” Rasmussen said. “So it’s been quite a learning experience to make this transition, but it’s also opened up some really interesting possibilities for the future.” 
Mikray Pida, a Uyghur American artist living in D.C., had her show canceled at the AU Museum. The show was scheduled for Sept. 12 through Dec. 13. She comes from a Turkish-speaking ethnic group in Xinjiang Province, an autonomous territory in China whose people and culture are under systematic attack by the Chinese government.   
Pida’s artwork is meant to communicate the powerful experiences she’s had in her life, much of which is based on her time living in China. She lived in the Hebei Province during the SARS outbreak. Her art reflects her experiences with environmental problems, the refugee population, disease, immigration and the connection between these topics. 
“My painting is not about decorative art, or beautiful color; it’s more that I try to make people think about the world we are living in today,” Pida said. 
Because of COVID-19, Pida has not been able to share artwork that she deeply values with the public. She is saddened by this because she believes that showing her paintings in person, and having a dialogue with others, especially Americans, is vital to the impact of her work. 
“After Americans go through the impact of this pandemic, which is huge, from my paintings we can have dialogue about what this is all about, and I want to have that in public,” Pida said. 
Rasmussen is still working on exhibitions for 2023. Now, he’s reflecting on what it means for the AU Museum to move its programming to a virtual environment. 
“In many ways, it’s made viewing a richer kind of experience, using these tools that can’t be denied, and that’s exciting, that’s a great educational resource,” Rasmussen said.

2020-09-12,AU,China,"Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on theeaglecoronavirusproject.com, a separate website created by Eagle staff at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Articles from that website have been migrated to The Eagle’s main site and backdated with the dates they were originally published in order to allow readers to access them more easily. 
Six months ago, on March 12, American University students received an email from President Sylvia Burwell that changed their college experiences more than any other event in recent history: AU was going fully online for the remainder of the spring semester, not just for three weeks, as the administration originally announced. 
While the news that AU was transitioning to virtual education didn’t signal the first coronavirus-related change to the semester — just a day earlier, all study abroad programs were canceled — it was the moment that many students realized things weren’t going back to normal anytime soon. 
“Within the last 24 hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic,” Burwell wrote at the time. “There are now more than 124,000 cases in 118 countries, and the WHO expects the number of cases and affected countries to grow. Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency for the District, and the DC Department of Health recommended that non-essential mass gatherings, including conferences and conventions, be postponed or canceled.”
Earlier that day, the Patriot League canceled all spring practices and competitions, prematurely ending a major sports season. At the time, much of the student body was spread around the world on spring break. In January, students studying abroad in China were called back home. 
Since Burwell’s March 12 email, the AU community has been affected in countless ways. A total of 78 students, faculty, staff and contractors were infected between March 1 and Aug. 31, according to AU spokesperson Stacie Burgess. At least one has died: School of Public Affairs and Washington College of Law professor Joseph Kaplan, who was 66. 
Students have lost housing, jobs, study-abroad opportunities, affordable transportation, sports, in-person commencement and much more. Faculty, staff and the University itself have also suffered. 
Kyla Blazer, a junior in SPA and the School of Communication, said that she doesn’t see the effects of the pandemic going away for a “very long time.”
“There are so many aspects of life it touches, including human life itself,” Blazer said. “You can’t measure the impact of a human life being lost.”
In June, the University announced a hybrid reopening plan for the fall, later retracting it at the end of July, in favor of fully online classes. The change helped AU avoid the risk of outbreaks that have dominated the news at UNC Chapel Hill, Iowa State University and more. According to a New York Times tracker, at least 88,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at more than 1,600 colleges across the country. 
Still, the cancellation of on-campus housing and in-person classes has made life for new and returning students chaotic, disconnected and isolated, many said. Students frequently take to Facebook meme pages to commiserate about their online classes and feelings of loneliness, spending even more time on Zoom or FaceTime, in an attempt to remain connected with friends that, in some cases, they haven’t seen since before spring break. 



Blazer said that this summer has been the most emotionally difficult part of her life. Not being able to see close friends, especially as a first-generation student without siblings, took a toll, she said. 
“When you’re so busy, but you’re just trapped in your room — or like me, sitting at my dining room table — and just go from meeting to meeting, staring at a screen, it wears on you emotionally,” Blazer said. “The pandemic continued to get worse, classes went online and it all just kind of toppled on top of each other. The disappointment adds up, and you can’t really escape it.”
The summer was also filled with headlines about what many refer to as the other pandemic: racism and police brutality. Protests erupted around the globe after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May. Despite the pandemic, AU students gathered at demonstrations to push for change.
Ryan Barto, now a 2020 SPA alumnus, was looking forward to finally being able to bring his mom, who didn’t graduate from high school, to his graduation at the end of the spring semester. While he was disappointed not to have an in-person commencement, Barto feels that there are many other more important things to concentrate on. 
“If anything, AU prepared me for situations like this,” Barto said. “When things go wrong, AU, and the student body specifically, prepared me to be able to just go out and deal with it, to adapt, to be there, to show up, to stand out, and to not let anything bring you down.”
Looking back, what Barto remembers most clearly from spring break, and from the news that the semester was completely changing, is grief. But as things became clearer, he realized he had to just live with it. 
“For a lot of people at AU, AU is their home,” Barto said. “It’s the place that they feel comfortable, where you can see your friend on the quad and get coffee at the Dav, or go to your study spot in SIS. All of that was stripped away.”
Now, students can visit campus after doing an online COVID-19 evaluation, and both The Bridge and The Davenport coffee shops are open for takeout, still staffed by students. 
As for what the next six months will bring? Blazer and Barto aren’t certain, but there are some things they can say for sure. 
“Follow the damn rules and wear your mask,” Barto said.

2020-11-13,AU,China,"Many Friendship Heights Metro Area businesses are closing or have shut down. 
Just one metro stop away from Tenleytown, the Friendship Heights commercial district used to be a hub for American University student life. But recent financial struggles in and around Mazza Gallerie and Chevy Chase Pavilion have prompted pleas for redevelopment. 
“The stores that remain are almost exclusively for the very wealthy or uber rich,” senior Eamon Vahidi said. “It's very inaccessible to a neighborhood that has a lot of students and families; it's not really the right demographic.” 
Friendship Heights, which connects D.C. and Montgomery County, has competed for years with newer developments such as CityCenterDC near Chinatown and DC USA in Columbia Heights. The economic crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic only heightened the financial struggles of the area. 
Two of the major retailers that touched down in Friendship Heights during its original development, Lord and Taylor and Neiman Marcus, have announced liquidation sales and foreclosure going into effect this fall. 
Developers in the 1970s predicted that Mazza Gallerie would serve as D.C.’s version of Fifth Avenue, The Washington Post reported. But, a year after opening, the 60-store shopping mall struggled to fill space. The building, which has been sold four times since its opening in 1977, was sold this August in a foreclosure auction for $38 million. 
“This is like a 20-year degradation of the area, and now we’re here wondering what happened,” said Nolan Rodman, who owns Rodman’s, a specialty grocery store and pharmacy located in the area since 1955. “It's insane, there needs to be investment and building and new blood and life. Right now, there's only been people exiting.” 
Rodman attributes some of his store’s success to the fact that it’s family-owned. 
“A lot of retail establishments [in the area] have not adapted over time to a changing environment,” Rodman said. “If I wanted us to change my store completely tomorrow, I would decide with my dad to do it and we would do it. It’s not like we have this bureaucratic thing we need to go through.” 
However, Rodman, similar to others, believes the commercial district still has the potential to prosper.
With household incomes ranging from $170,000 to $200,000 a year, Friendship Heights is home to some of the District’s wealthiest residents. The commercial district sits in the middle of million-dollar, single-family home neighborhoods. 
“[These businesses’] clientele is of a particular market and it doesn't necessarily fit all the people who might be utilizing that area,” said Brett Gilbert, an associate professor in Kogod. “So [land owners] would definitely do well to essentially try to bring in businesses that can tailor to people who are at a lower socioeconomic level.""
Students believe the commercial district’s proximity to campus certainly allows for the space to be utilized by the AU community.  
“I think there’s a chance to really create new living spaces, open up more places for AU kids to go, and increase equity and access,” Vahidi said.

2021-08-03,AU,China,"For those who make their way to D.C.’s Chinatown for the first time, they may find it jarring to see McDonald’s, Chipotle and Walgreens occupying the streets. What’s more, each shop in Chinatown shares a blatantly appropriated chinoiserie aesthetic — which would be fine if the shop was a local Chinese grocer and not a CAVA. 
What went wrong? Where are the Chinese shops — and more importantly — where are the Chinese Americans that kept this neighborhood - and Chinatowns around the nation - alive? 
Director Lisa Mao’s “A Tale of Three Chinatowns” seeks not only to answer those questions, but to also explore the stories of the Chinatowns located in Boston and Chicago. In roughly a century, these Chinese American communities have developed differently in both positive and negative ways. 
The film covers the three Chinatowns through interviews with community members, activists and Asian American history experts. We don’t just learn about the diabolical Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882: Mao hones in on how each Chinatown in focus is unique from each other and why some are in decline. 
Hearing from the residents of these Chinatowns reinforces the sense of community throughout the film; it both warms the heart and allows us to empathize with their personal stories. This makes the issue of affordable housing — or lack thereof — that much more tragic. It's why most Chinatowns today are a result of displacement and are no longer in their original locations. 
Gentrification is another recurring theme and one that particularly hits hardest when Mao focuses on D.C.’s Chinatown. As of now, the Chinese American population in that neighborhood has dwindled to less than 300 people. For a community that first arrived in D.C. to settle in the 1850s, the future of D.C.’s Chinatown seems subject to monopolies and chains, instead of locally-owned businesses — the reason for the neighborhood's entire existence. 
Conversely, the film’s tone does shift from bleak to hopeful when it focuses on Chicago’s Chinatown: unlike D.C., this neighborhood is growing in population and full of business opportunities for Chinese Americans. It’s an intriguing juxtaposition that leaps the film forward with its call to action. 
Exploring Chicago’s Chinatown gives a glimmer of hope because it proves that reviving Chinatowns across the country can be done. The reason is clear: these neighborhoods represent a cultural, communal and economic hub for not just Chinese Americans but for any racial and ethnic minority that has resided there.
While this film depicts extremely relevant issues, how it communicates that message comes off as a bit dated. The film’s graphics, transitions and editing techniques feel a decade or two behind. The choice to fade in important words that interviewees bring up isn’t received as emphasis but instead invokes awkward, cheesy PSA ad vibes. 
That, however, isn’t the largest, most distracting issue. “A Tale of Three Chinatowns” is misguidedly sequenced: the film covers all three Chinatowns, but then circles back to its first subject, Boston, to explore another idea. From then on, topics, interviews and clips struggle to stay cohesive to the main narrative. Scholars and activists end up elaborating on similar, previously explored ideas, or the focus switches abruptly. The film essentially feels finished before the final third of the runtime. 
Nevertheless, this is an extremely important film that shines a light on the histories and experiences of Chinese Americans in these cities. While its shortcomings in sequencing and editing dampen its overall emotional impact, “A Tale of Three Chinatowns” is still a critical documentary to watch today. 
At the very least, it’ll encourage you to support the locally-owned eateries in D.C.’s Chinatown. From dumpling houses to barbecue meats, they are definitely worth a try. You should take a break from that New American brunch place you go to every weekend, anyway. 
“A Tale of Three Chinatowns” screened at the DC Asian Pacific American Film Festival from July 15 to July 25.

2021-12-10,AU,China,"From the Newsstands: This story appeared in our December 2021 print edition. You can find the digital version here.
Students walked onto campus early on the morning of Aug. 30 for the first day of in-person classes at American University since spring 2020. 
For some, the walk across campus was familiar, but for others, it was an entirely new experience. From moving in, studying abroad and performing, students are still adjusting to what life at AU now looks like. 
For Lilliana Silver, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and the College of Arts and Sciences, the experience of arriving on campus this fall to attend in-person classes was strange. Despite completing her freshman year at AU, she hadn’t been in a classroom since her senior year of high school. 
“March came and [my high school’s administration] was like, ‘We’re going to go online for two weeks’ ... and then we did not go back, and now I’m a sophomore in college,” she said. 
While most members of the class of 2024’s last experience in a classroom was just under two years ago, some non-traditional students like Kai Yuen Suherwan, a sophomore in the School of International Services, haven’t been in a classroom in three years. After graduating high school in 2018 and then enrolling in the Singaporean army for two years, the delay of another year of the college experience wasn’t expected. 
“I would think about the typical American college experience, I would think about the parties, actually going to lecture halls and stuff, and I was looking at the School of International Service and I was like I can’t wait to go here,” Suherwan said. “But then contrast that with me sitting in the basement staring at a screen.”
Now that classes are in-person again, he said he can finally partake in some of the college experiences he’d hoped for. His excitement over being back in person is one that has been echoed by many. 
“For the first time, I was able to look to my left and I had a student there,” said Jehane Djedjro, a sophomore in SIS. “I could talk to them about school and the material we’re learning. Mentally, it’s just brought me to a better place.”
What normalcy looks like has been a question that all students have faced in their return to campus this year. The two remaining classes — the class of 2022 and 2023 — are the only ones that have experienced the University pre-pandemic.
Victoria Guillen, a junior in SIS, said that the return to in-person learning came with a different campus experience than the one she recalled from her freshman year. 
“Returning to campus, socially a lot of stuff changed for me,” Guillen said. “A lot of my friends from freshman year either graduated, took a gap year, transferred or dropped out. So everyone is in a completely different position than where we were before. And that’s been a lot to digest too.”
Borders begin to reopen and students look abroad 
Guillen and many others were planning to study abroad in spring 2022, and while some programs are being offered in a limited capacity, many plans have been put on hold. For many, the opportunity to study abroad is what drew them to AU. According to U.S. News & World Report, AU is a top-ranked university for those wanting to study abroad. At some point during their time at the University, 54 percent of students will study abroad, the University’s website says. One of these programs is the Sakura Scholars program, where SIS students can spend two years abroad at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.
This year, Mizuki Brent, a sophomore Sakura Scholar, was the only member in their cohort allowed entrance to Japan through their Japanese citizenship to follow the program’s typical progression.
“I haven’t actually met any of my cohorts yet just because my whole freshman year was online, but I’ve been in touch with a couple of them on the phone,” Brent said. “It’s not that I really feel like I’ve been missing out on any friendships because I haven’t been able to meet them yet, but I’ve been able to meet some of the other kids [here in Japan].”
Brent said that AU isn’t the only university where students have felt disconnected during the pandemic. Ritsumeikan University just started allowing students to attend in-person classes due to low COVID-19 numbers. 
“Classrooms are much emptier than normal, classes are mostly all hybrid, and there are a lot of kids in South Korea and China that can’t make it over,” Brent said.
Performing arts returns to the stage
While classrooms across the globe have begun to look more normal as campuses navigate COVID-19 protocols, auditoriums for the performing arts are still just starting to get live audiences back. 
Nicole Klokiw, a senior in CAS, said that the University’s Department of Performing Arts looks very different under post-pandemic restrictions than it did before. Audience capacity is maxed at 50 percent, crew and orchestra members are masked and staging is socially distanced. 
But after performing in two shows last year over Zoom, Klokiw said that even though in-person performances look different than they used to, she’s happy to be back on stage for this fall’s production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.”
“This is the first in-person show I’ve been in, in three years,” Klokiw said of the late October show. “Being able to look into the audience … is really nice. It’s pretty encouraging actually to see and hear people reacting. It makes me happy.”
Not all shows have been in person. Kelsey Walker, a junior in CAS said that this fall’s production of Shakespeare’s “A Winter’s Tale” is being filmed. While the decision was made in order to be able to accommodate the possibility of the University closing in-person shows, Walker said that the transition back to campus has still been difficult. 
“I lost a lot of trust in the thing I love to do most, which is really hard to grapple with,” Walker said. “It’s hard to place trust in theater itself, or in an institution like AU when things change so constantly. And I know that you just have to deal with it, but it’s hard when you’re like ‘okay, this isn’t how it used to be, or this isn’t how I want it to be,’ ... Like that’s all I want to be doing, and I don’t really feel like we’re back yet.”
The uncertainty of what the future holds is a sentiment that all students share. With the pandemic still unfolding, students have learned to be flexible and how to deal with the challenges of living in unprecedented times. While what “normal” looks like will continue to change over time, AU students have proven resilient.

2022-04-13,AU,China,"Editor’s Note: Panelist Emily Brignand is a columnist for The Eagle and was not involved in the writing, reporting or editing of this story.
The Asian American Student Union and American University’s chapter of Project Pengyou hosted a joint panel Thursday, featuring speakers who discussed how Asian American history is preserved, taught and used to empower communities. 
The three panelists were Executive Director of the 1882 Foundation Ted Gong; AU Asia, Pacific, and Diaspora Studies professor Elaine Cho; and sophomore Emily Brignand, who is the director of education and culture at AU Project Pengyou. Public history graduate student Mia Owens moderated the event. 
The 1882 Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to raise awareness of the history and ongoing impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Project Pengyou is a flagship initiative aimed at fostering U.S.-China youth leadership, launching over 80 campus chapters across the country. 
A focal point of the panel was the lack of Asian American history taught in schools, which Cho elaborated on through an anecdote of her own high school experience. 
“[Growing up] I barely had any knowledge of Asian American studies or anything about Asian American history,” said Cho, who was raised in Texas. She said that her first exposure to the subject was in an AP U.S. history class, where a teacher “glossed over” the Japanese internment camps. 
“Any student, no matter what race, what background you are … if someone says ‘that’s it,’ you’re like, ‘I’m going to go and get more information,’” Cho said. “Because of that, I inquired more about it, but the more I inquired about it, I couldn’t find much information in my local library … It fueled me to get more interested in learning about our Asian and Asian American history because that’s part of my identity.” 
Brignand said that for her, learning about Asian American history as a biracial individual has been a journey of self-discovery. 
“As someone who is trying to self discover, I’ve been having trouble really knowing who I am,” said Brignand, who added that her struggle with identity began when she returned to Nevada after living in China for six years. “When I came back, I had a lot of internalized racism because going to middle school and being one of the only Asian people … it felt out of place.”
Now, Brignand feels that more emphasis should be placed on teaching a fuller picture of Asian American history in schools. 
“I think it’s really important for us to use this opportunity and learn more about the world and ourselves, as well,” Brignand said.
The panel comes as advocates across the country are pushing for lawmakers to pass legislation that would require schools to teach about Asian American history. Several states, including Ohio, Florida, California and New York, have begun working towards the inclusive curriculum, according to NBC News. Illinois became the first state to mandate the teaching of Asian American history in public schools last July. 
It is changes like these that Gong said are necessary to protect the stories of Asian Americans from erasure. 
“There is a subset that needs to be looked at, and that is the Asian American component,” he said. “In order to develop those resources and those topics that are not going to be mentioned … that’s where the Asian American studies component comes in.” 
Gong recommended that teachers of students in the K-12 range should “embed Asian American topics within core curriculum.” 
The panel also touched upon cultural appropriation in the media and among celebrities, such as the “fox eye” trend — using makeup to emulate “almond-shaped” eyes that critics say appropriates the Asian facial feature. 
“A lot of times white TikTokers would take trends from different cultures and then use them to their name,” Brignand said. “It’s somehow okay for other people to do it, but when Asian Americans embrace the way they look, it’s somehow judged differently.” 
Cho mentioned that Asian-American appropriation can be traced back to the early Hollywood era.
“It is appropriation because they don’t know the history of it,” Cho said. “Those kinds of stereotypes are long-standing … At the same time people wonder why Asian and Asian Americans are offended because they don’t listen to our stories or experiences.” 
Gong said knowing one’s history and identity are interconnected. 
“The idea is you need to understand yourself, and that requires you to understand all the things that make you up,” he said. “That includes all this history, all this culture, the difference in what that means and that includes the idea of ‘how are you an Asian navigating America?’” 
Looking to the future, the panel stressed the importance of being politically active to pave the road for change. 
“Something that matters a lot to me and a lot of people I know, especially at AU, is the fact that we need to have our voices in important matters that go on in this country,” Brignand said. She also encouraged Asian American audiences to “occupy spaces,” or build a larger presence for themselves in areas where they have been historically underrepresented. 
Cho said that she hopes Asian American students keep advocating for themselves. 
“Tell this University what you want,” she said. “Don’t let it fade… We’re here, we’re here to stay. So continue to speak up.”

2023-05-03,AU,China,"American University’s Center for Environment, Community and Equity concluded its first inaugural year with a round robin of environmental justice initiatives on April 27. The event reflected a year of connections and intersections among faculty, staff and students alike. 
Professors across departments spoke about their research and current projects and celebrated their own personal and scholastic milestones in and outside the classroom. Representatives from the School of International Service, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Affairs were just some in attendance. 
As CECE focuses on environmental justice, many professors and scholars shared their backgrounds and the intersectional ways they push for a more sustainable and resilient future. Topics ranged from poor water quality and inadequate infrastructure in cities to the history of environmental injustice in D.C. 
Some attendees discussed integrating environmental justice into research internationally in places such as China and American Samoa. However, scientific research isn’t the only medium to advance environmental justice, and many audience members highlighted artistic projects in progress. 
Maggie Burnette Stogner, the executive director of the School of Communication’s Center of Environmental Filmmaking, mentioned a milestone for one of her films. 
“The film that I just finished, with the help of students…I always love to bring the students in with the experiential education was ‘Upstream, Downriver’ about water equity and justice,” Stogner said to attendees. “We just got two grants to build it from a half hour, what it is today, to a full hour.” 
William Snape, III, the director of the Washington College of Law’s Program on Environmental and Energy Law, announced two new initiatives WCL has implemented.
“We have an environmental justice course that we offer at least every other spring for two credits, that’s a new course taught by an alum, Karim Marshall,” Snape said. “Secondly, our program has been, as many programs do, fundraising from our alums, our adjuncts and supporters. And we did raise some money, and we have awarded six environmental justice public interest scholarships to law students this summer. It’s really exciting.” 
The events focused on sharing accomplishments across various schools to encourage collaboration between schools and highlighted the importance of approaching environmental justice with an interdisciplinary lens. 
In the coming year, CECE will continue to host environmental justice conversations and create a database that will document environmental efforts at AU, such as those from CECE attendees. Dana Fisher, a professor from the University of Maryland, will be taking over the role of CECE director from Simon Nicholson and leading this new charge. Fisher wants the database to become an “environmental think tank.” 
“I’m thrilled to be here. I’m so excited about CECE and helping to build something big,” Fisher said.

2009-03-05,AU,India,"On Feb. 26, AU Abroad sent an e-mail to students to unveil its two newest programs - both of which are in India. Students now have the opportunity to study at Fergusson College in Pune or at Manipal University in Manipal. 
With more than 1,500 different recognized dialects and 24 official languages, India is the most multicultural country in the world - a fact many foreigners may find daunting, according to Ethan Merritt, an AU Abroad adviser. 
""I have never been more overwhelmed in travels abroad than when I spent time in Delhi,"" he said. ""Thousands of people are all around you, all speaking different languages and going different places.""
But after recently returning from India, Merritt and AU Abroad Director Sara Dumont said they found this high-scale diversity to be the most beautiful part of the country.
""What you get in India is a sense of what diversity really means,"" Dumont said. ""You could travel 50 miles in any direction and be in a totally different culture than where before. That's what makes it so important for Americans to be able to study there.""
Pune's Fergusson College is east of Mumbai, according to Merritt. Pune is small city compared to Mumbai, but it is known for its reputation as a young, vibrant cultural hub, housing multiple universities and India's National Film Archives and Institute.
Pune is not considered a tourist destination, according to Merritt. The Alliance for Global Education runs Fergusson's program. The Alliance is trying to limit the amount of students involved to 20, according to Dumont. Abroad students at Fergusson will live in homestays with a family, and have the option to be as involved with the family as they would like.
The second abroad program in India is held at Manipal University - one of the country's top five universities, Dumont said.
The world-renowned university is very international, and boasts degree-seeking students from more than 50 different countries. While Manipal is known for its medical and engineering curriculums, the university's Cultural Studies, Communications and International Politics departments run the study abroad program - a perfect fit for AU students, Merritt said. Manipal has a tropical climate, and is miles away from the beach. Its campus has a thriving community feel where all students and most faculty live on campus.
The two new India programs fill a void in AU Abroad, Dumont said.

2009-08-13,AU,India,"September doesn't just mean the start of classes and schoolwork; it is also the start of an active AU fall sports lineup. 
Often, when someone thinks about AU sports, the basketball team is the only thing that comes to mind. While they have been successful in the last few years, the AU field hockey, volleyball and soccer teams have also succeed in their respective sports. The fall season holds several NCAA tournaments and Patriot League Championships just like in the springtime.
Of the fall teams, the women's volleyball team has been the most successful. The Eagles coach Barry Goldberg has accumulated a record of 296-187 over 19 seasons with the school. His success has not come in just a few unbelievable seasons, and his consistency has shown on the court, as the Eagles have been selected as Patriot League preseason number one for the eighth year in a row.
Along with their strong coaching staff the team returns most of their members, only losing four members to graduation. To go along with their veteran squad, the Lady Eagles also have the world's tallest female twins returning in front of the net. They have been an important part to AU's success in the last few years and look to continue their dominance again this year.
The volleyball team opens their season Aug. 28 at George Mason University, and their home opener will be on Aug. 29 against George Washington.
AU's field hockey team has also put together a stretch of winning seasons and has created a winning atmosphere. The ladies will begin their season Aug. 28 against Indiana in search of their seventh consecutive Patriot League Title. Five-time Patriot League Coach of the Year Steve Jennings 12 will be returning behind the bench for American.
The team's success has not come without recognition as they are ranked in the national top 20 in both the coaches' and RPI polls for the sixth consecutive year. With the Lady Eagles only losing three to graduation, they look to continue that dominance.
Among the players returning are Patriot League Rookie of the Year Tatum Dyer, Third Team All-American Christine Fingerhuth and All-Mid Atlantic Region and Patriot League Second Team selection Kristin Gebhart. All of these players, including several other national selections, will be attempting to continue Jennings' smash mouth defensive minded hockey. 
It is clear that the ever-evolving talent pool paired with Jennings' coaching style has been fruitful, as the team rides a 43-game conference win streak. They have struggled recently against non-conference opponents however, and will have to make it through their first nine games before seeing a League opponent. They open up their conference schedule on Oct. 3 at Holy Cross.
The final two sports of the fall season are men's and women's soccer. Both teams have struggled in recent past but look to improve off of last year.  The men's team finished the year in the Patriot League semi-finals with a final record of 9-7-3 overall. The women didn't have quite the same success posting a 5-10-4 record, but have certainly made progress towards winning.
Perhaps the most important thing for the men to concentrate on is continuing their success at home and in the conference. They had a record of 5-2-1 at home and a 5-1-1 record against conference opponents; winning these games are how teams become champions. The Eagles were successful in overtime, winning several nail-biters in extra time. These wins are crucial since they often boost morale and give a team confidence.
The AU fall sports line is packed with great games. AU Athletics has something for everyone. Not only can everyone enjoy good matches, but they also can be part of a winning culture. While not all teams are on top of their respective Leagues, they are certainly moving in the right direction.

2010-02-11,AU,India,"• Neither rain, nor snow, nor sleet, nor hail will keep blow jobs from being given in the arboretum. Definitely heard some noises in there on Tuesday night.
• I've noticed there are a ton of skateboarders on campus this year? Anyone want to teach me to long board? I'm serious
• The girls on the AU gymnastics team are pretty hot.
• It would be cool if disgusting couples would stop hooking up in the lounge and the north side bridge.
• Just because you can make out/dry hump your girlfriend in the lounge doesn't mean you should.
• I was walking the arboretum today. I think I saw an imprint of where some guy was kneeling in the snow.  Was this a sign of the mysterious BJ guy?  I think so!
• I think to solve the housing crisis we should all move to the arboretum with the guy who gives blowies.
• Dear annoying dramatic girls at AU,
We all see right through your vague Facebook status and know you just want attention. Work your shit out in private. I don't want to hear it.
• Dear Eagle:
IF AU cared about Haiti (which I'm convinced we don't) why aren't we allowed to donate our library and parking fines to relief?
CASJ member.
• SG needs to update its Web site more than once in a blue moon. My friend being the head of Club Council (and me trying to organize a club trip) is how I found out AUTO was back online. So much wasted time looking for alternate transportation and arguments!!!
• RE: the evolution rant last time:
New rule.  If you don't believe in evolution, you become a monkey again.  Any takers?
• I really don't understand the complaints about the housing plans for next year. Many people are complaining about their inability to finance off campus housing. I know the economy is bad now. However, some blame also rests with students. Students at AU attend a school that costs around 47k a year. If you really can't afford 47k a year or are unwilling to take out a loan (or two), then you are much better suited to attending a public in state college. If you already have tons of loans and still can't afford AU then this school isn't for you. Save your money and your sanity by attending a college within your financial means. Otherwise you are following the same irresponsible financial spending pattern that led to the recession in the first place.
• I normally can't stand Alex Knepper, but the radical postmodern Marxist queer Chicano feminists of color comment on last week's Eagle Rants made me lol
• Why is it that ugly people always have the most obnoxious sex? It’s 2 a.m. and I can hear my neighbors bed shaking, her moaning, and him asking what about me.  Really guys? is the necessary?  I’m gonna go with no.  So much for living on the quiet side.
• Person on L7 making loud, obnoxious, angry sexual threats when playing Mario Kart...that is NOT ATTRACTIVE. I doubt any drunk man or lesbian would want to hook up with you making that much noise. So please...do us all a favor and SHUT THE FUCK UP!
• Snowstorm + no channels except for ATV=the Shining
• okay, listen up all you ""south of the mason-dixon"" people, snow is not reason enough to stay balled up in your room all day. those of us from up north have no problem trekking through the snow to go out/eat/not go crazy. man the hell up.
• I am being kicked off campus next year despite the fact that I will be a senior and pay 100 percent full tuition for everything.  WTF.  Housing and Dining did not inform me of this until a few months ago.  Fuck housing and dining.
• So apparently if you move off campus for a semester due to personal reasons, housing and dining does not let you move back onto campus the following year.
SCREW YOU HOUSING AND DINING!
• Why does housing and dining not offer room selection by credit hours anymore? Grrrr
• Dear sorority girl in my group project group:
I have always thought that sorority girls were vapid, shallow, dumb, fake, conformists who only enjoy drinking and gossiping.  But you have completely changed my perception of sorority girls at AU.  You are friendly in a sincere way, conscientious, polite to even the dumbest of our group members, and you really work hard in a collaborative manner.
You don't seem trashy or slutty and you don't wear disgusting amounts of make-up or jewelry.  Congratulations on joining greek like and not becoming a stereotype.  If only there were more like you.  You are probably the nicest girl I have met at AU.
Sincerely,
Non-sorority girl
• Whenever I bring up marriage to my boyfriend of one year, he never says anything.  (It's not like I want to get married anytime soon, not until I'm at least 28.) I always try to bring up our future together, but he never wants to talk about it.  Does this mean that he doesn't see a future with me and he just doesn't want to tell me that so that he can continue to get sex?  Why else would he always avoid talking about marriage?
-worried girlfriend
• Is it cheating to flirt with other guys on Facebook chat and not tell my boyfriend?  It's not like I do anything with them.  Most of them don't even live in the same city.  What do guys think about that?
• Is there a club on campus for pregnant girls?
• I am a female and I do not understand what all the feminists are complaining about.  Women have the choice in their lives to go work, stay home with their kids, or do some of both.  Men don't have that choice.  Men are severely socially stigmatized if they decide to stay home with their kids while the wife works.  Men do not have the options women do.  So why are females the ones complaining?  If I were a man, I would be pissed off at the injustice.
• If I have sex with a girl, my boyfriend doesn't need to know, right?
• How dumb do you have to be to suspend Nick Hendra? Jeff Jones you need to reinstate him, now!
• Nick Hendra is like Michael Jordan. Without him our eagles are an endangered species.
• Yo, Jeff Jones, I'll let you finish in a few, but that's got to be the biggest boneheaded decision of all time.
Is Jeff Jones getting paid off by other schools to bench our best players? If not why did he bench Hendra? Putz.
• Dear Charlie:
Can you fix something about the headlines ""Mets Among Losers in MLB Offseason"" Mets is synonymous with losers. It's like calling someone Fat Obese, or Skinny Thin.
EDITOR’S NOTE: As a Met fan I agree completely. 
• The fact that I have been subjected to ATV for the entire weekend has been PURE TORTURE. PUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE TORTUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I WANT TO GOUGE MY EYES OUT
• ATV being the only channel available during snowpocolypse has led me to my downfall...goodbye cruel world!
• Jeff Jones liked Nick Hendra when he needed a 300th win. Now that Jeffy has it, he doesn't care.
• Can't afford housing?  Chances are you can still afford a blow job in the arboretum.
• Famous words before a disaster:
""Indians, what Indians?""-General Custer
""Iceberg alert, full speed ahead""- Captain Smith
""Lets go to the theater""-Lincoln
""Lets suspend Nick Hendra""-Jeff Jones.
• I feel like the upperclassmen complaining about housing are a vocal minority. I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to live in the dorms.
• Sad fact: I haven't met anyone at AU who'd be worth claiming my virginity. Maybe I should just hook up with the AU threesome and get this over with.
• I don't like you romantically, but I don't think you quite get it
• OMG, Mother Nature should have snowgasms more often =)
Radical postmodern Marxist queer Chicano feminist of color say: Alex Knepper can suck it.
• Today I complained about the disproportion of single women to single men on campus. MLIAU.
• I don't think snow days are anything new for the staff at the school newspaper. Everyday seems to be a snow day for ""The Eagle"" in terms of journalistic talent.
• College ACB you are awful

2010-02-11,AU,India,"The Democrats officially ceded the seat of their fallen hero — a seat they had held since the late Ted Kennedy’s brother occupied the White House — when Vice President Biden administered the oath of office to Republican Scott Brown last week. Brown’s arrival in Washington sounds the death knell for the dreamlike demands of President Barack Obama’s liberal base. Gone are the days of health care optimism and cap and trade consensus. Silence reigns where there were once cries for a second stimulus and righteous calls for a New York City civilian trial for Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 
At least Obama had fair warning. Fragmentation of Democratic majorities began last November in New Jersey and Virginia. At the time, I described the gubernatorial victories of Republicans Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell as needed boosts for a desperate Republican Party, not direct repudiations of Obama’s policies. For the GOP to continue such success, it would have to court Independents and field “the right candidate … trumpeting a tailored message.” Three months later, despite doomsday predictions of the Tea Party's rise, Republicans have utilized this game plan to perfection. The American public has indeed rejected the Democratic mantra of more: more spending, more debt and more centralization of power in Washington. Judging by history, however, Obama should be quietly cheering his party’s fall from grace this coming November. Yes, you heard me correctly — root for the Republicans, Mr. President. 
As a man who grounded his 2008 campaign in centrist rhetoric, Obama has been willing to punt the liberal agenda to Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill. On top of the criticism that boxes him in from his left and right, the president has watched the center slip from his fingers. Therefore, Obama cannot tie his legacy to Democrats in Congress if he has any hope of turning his fortunes. In fact, working with a resurgent opposition party after 2010 would insulate the president from warring factions in search of his head. Then-candidate Obama enraged many Democrats when he claimed that Ronald Reagan had altered the trajectory of the political landscape in a way Bill Clinton had not. He did not mention that, as Jonathan Rauch of the National Journal reminds us, both Reagan and Clinton, the most popular and successful recent chief executives, shared power for significant portions of their terms. Detractors to the divided government theory may argue that George W. Bush benefited from Republican majorities in Congress throughout most of his presidency. How did that go for him in the end?
Data derived from the American Presidency Project demonstrates the counterintuitive notion that a Congress run by the rival party need not cripple a sitting president. The combined concurrence percentage of combined House and Senate votes to the expressed wishes of President Eisenhower (an underrated president) was roughly 70 percent. This statistic is relatively high until you consider that less successful presidents like Jimmy Carter (77 percent) and G. W. Bush (81 percent) witnessed better levels of concurrence. Reagan left office with a 62 percent concurrence mark and a 63 percent approval rating. Clinton’s Congress voted for his policy proposals only 57 percent of the time, but he exited the White House with support from two-thirds of the nation.  
Christie, McDonnell and Brown are just the first wave. Voters are frustrated with the priorities of Democrats in Washington. The economy is slowly recovering, but it will be a long march out of the woods. Republicans are priming viable, jobs-focused candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Shift to the center and Obama could enjoy a Clintonesque revival after the midterm elections. Embrace arrogance and partisanship, and Obama’s legacy will follow the path blazed by Carter and Bush.

2010-11-09,AU,India,"Every other week The Eagle goes about asking the assistant music directors and DJs at WVAU what they’re currently listening to. Here’s what they’re recommending. Check out WVAU.org to listen. 
Sufjan Stevens — The Age of Adz
(Asthmatic Kitty)
Sufjan Stevens, a ‘prophet’ of modern folk, has suddenly embraced drum machines, synths, and…auto tune? “The Age of Adz” (pronounced “Odds”) is a mix of wild electronica and epic orchestration. It’s whirling, disjointed and rambling, but grotesquely lovely. Stevens has stripped away the pretentious lengthy song titles, stories, settings and grand biographies in favor of first-person non-fiction. 
Lyrically, “Adz” is closest to his album “Seven Swans” — straightforward, honest, and immediate. Themes of depression, religious-zeal, death, and love run throughout. “Sufjan/the panic inside/the murdering ghost/that you cannot ignore,” he sings to himself on “Vesuvias” with full choir, woodwinds, and spiraling synths. He sings with reckless abandon on “I Want to Be Well” with lyrics like “Did I go at it wrong?/Did I go intentionally to destroy me?”

Small Black — New Chain
(Jagjaguwar)
Nostalgic vintage synths, samples and loops? Distorted, fuzzy vocals about wishing you could stay wherever you are or go back to wherever you were last summer? Piano melodies that could have been on a Lionel Ritchie album? Simple, 4/4 drum machine beats? Super short running time? A check to all of these! 
Small Black has made great chill-out music for your chillwave party. Whether or not you should choose to ride that wave is your own business, but bringing you back to a simpler time is Small Black’s business. The recommendations for this may as well say “the concept of chillwave.”

Brian Eno with Jon Hopkins & Leo Abrahams – Small Craft on a Milk Sea
(Warp)
Brian Eno’s newest album is split pretty evenly between ambient music (which he invented) and dark, synthesizer and drum machine-driven music (which he perfected). Though he’s spent the last few decades producing middle of the road U2 and James albums, Eno has retained his experimental sensibilities — these songs have movements in the sense that dramatic tone shifts pop up every once in a while and they have structure in the sense that they all have beginnings and ends. 
There’s an anger to the non-ambient tracks that Eno doesn’t usually express. Everything is faster and more crowded than the work he’s produced in the past, but when the harder-edged songs end, the gorgeous ambient tracks are there to clean the slate.

The Extra Lens — Undercard
(Merge)
“I hate this town, and there’s a whole long list of things that I hate. I had to starve myself all week to make way. Cleveland Ohio, 1985.” Does it get any more John Darnielle than that? The singular force behind The Mountain Goats has been writing songs like “Cruiserweights” for eons, elegizing small town failure and toil the way Belle & Sebastian do with shyness and photography. That’s not to say “Undercard” is a rehash of Goats’ material, as Darnielle takes us into more pop-y territory with a less sparse sound and some quality harmonies with frequent collaborator Franklin Bruno. But the straight-up acoustic sound, diary-esque lyrics, and Darnielle’s iconic “heart on sleeve” delivery puts this album firmly into his stylistic canon. And for the countless, rabid Mountain Goats fans out there, that’s really not a bad thing.

Bad Books — Bad Book
(Favorite Gentlemen)
Bad Book’s self-titled debut album does not disappoint. As a side project of Kevin Devine and Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull, this album melds the two groups’ styles perfectly by seamlessly combining the soft folk sound of Kevin Devine with the darker sound of Manchester Orchestra. But never fear, Bad Books isn’t simply a regurgitation of the two artists’ previous work; this album has a distinct sound. It is dark yet delicate, and the vocal combination of Devine’s adolescent-esque voice combined with the strained and rough voice of Hull creates a very interesting medley.

2011-04-12,AU,India,"The title of “Happythankyoumoreplease” is quite apropos — you will leave the theater grateful and wanting more of its offbeat charm. If you are already groaning at the prospect of yet another contrived indie rom-com à la “500 Days Of Summer” or the movie version of “Friends” or the millennials’ answer to “Singles,” you will find yourself pleasantly surprised.
In “Happythankyoumoreplease,” director, writer and star Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”) forgoes the hipper-and-more-clever-than-thou approach in favor of an unassuming, natural dialogue and genuinely likable characters. And if there is such a thing as a New York “vibe,” the movie captures it spot-on.  
The lead character, Sam (Radnor), is an aspiring novelist on the way to a meeting with a publisher who meets a boy named Rasheen (Michael Algieri) who gets separated from his family on the train. As a plot vehicle, Rasheen and Sam’s relationship is meant to assure us of Sam’s inherent goodness despite his ne’er-do-well, seemingly rakish lifestyle, delivering some of the more heart-warming, cute lines in the movie. 
For example, Sam labels his suburban angst-free childhood as hardly “Dickensian” or conducive to writing the great American novel. Or when Sam discovers Rasheen’s art talents, he laughs at Rasheen’s drawing of him as a “dashing Russian aristocrat.” These sort of exchanges abound and make the movie terribly endearing with a low cheese factor.
The other characters are equally compelling. Mary Catherine (Zoe Kazan) and her boyfriend Charlie (Pablo Schreiber), who try to decide whether or not to move to Los Angeles, which Mary calls the “epicenter of all that is awful.” Sam’s best friend Annie (Malin Akerman) is bemoaning her unfortunate choice in men, (dating “29-year-old 12-year-olds”) when she meets a seemingly dorky co-worker who seems to constantly hang out on her floor at work because “philanthropic giving is the cool place to be.”
Annie tells this story of an Indian cab driver-would-be-guru who advises her that a good way to perpetuate more gratitude in the universe is to simply say, “Thank you. More please.” Albeit hokey as far as mantras go, it’s veritable enough for hippie-esque Annie, who in the end gets over her abysmal dating streak and allows herself to be wooed by the uncool Sam #2.
Then, there is Sam’s love interest, waitress and cabaret singer Mississippi (Kate Mara), whose refusal to sleep with Sam due to her New Year’s avowal to “not be a whore” leads to their impossibly-cute three-day-stand/move-in session, complete with a hand-written contract and key exchange.
The characters in “Happythankyoumoreplease” feel very realistic with no tacked-on, contrived idiosyncrasies for entertainment’s sake. It’s definitely a feel-good movie, but not in a mawkish, fake sense. In the end, the characters all end up working through their various conflicts, but the resolutions are not fanciful and unrealistic.

2013-04-11,AU,India,"The usually quiet AU Quad was enveloped in a cloud of bright colors on April 7, as dozens of students gathered to celebrate Holi, the Indian Festival of Color. 
Holi celebrates the coming of spring in India and is traditionally celebrated by throwing powder and water at those who attend the festivities. 
Those who were prepared wore white, and those who weren’t watched as their clothes were destroyed by pink, yellow and red powdered paint provided by the South Asian Student Association, which hosted this event. 
Holi was also co-sponsored by Student Government, AU Muslim Student Association, AU Bhangra, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and the Residence Hall Association.
The event started at 2 p.m., with groups of soon-to-be-painted students hesitantly approaching the area outside of Kay. 
After paint packets were distributed, the Quad became a swarm of bright colors, with attendees throwing powder at friends and strangers alike. Holi was open not just to AU students, but all members of the community.
“The most impressive thing to me was the diversity of the people there,” SIS junior Alison Pease said. “By that I mean there were not just AU students there, but also families and other people from the community. I think it’s great that AU takes the opportunity to celebrate such a fun holiday and that the community chooses to participate as well.” 
Local DJ Naiem Reza played popular songs throughout the event from both the US and India. Those who were versed in Bollywood dance styles had a chance to shine in the center of one of the various dance circles that had formed. Everyone else was able to come together for some paint-covered group dances like “The Cupid Shuffle” and “Gangnam Style.”
Soon after, another component was added: water. Buckets were filled and combined with paint to make colored water that was then dumped on people’s heads or shot through one of the water guns provided by SASA. 
The paint-stained, now wet Quad lent the perfect environment for a mud-sliding competition that cleared what was once the dance floor. 
“Being Hindu, I’ve never had so much fun celebrating Holi,” CAS freshman Sarthak Batra said. “From the beautiful color to the thick mud, it was more than an experience, and I look forward to doing it next year, even though the aftermath of cleaning up was difficult.”
Batra also said that this event sparked his interest in joining SASA, which also catered free samosas, an Indian fried pastry, for the event. 
After the celebration, the Quad was left stained bright red, resembling some sort of eerie abandoned battlefield after combat. 
However, the only casualties in the event of the Holi festival were some white t-shirts and a few pairs of jeans.

2013-04-11,AU,India,"This profile on AU men’s basketball Head Coach Jeff Jones was originally published in full on Schad's blog in October. 
In March 1993, a reporter asked then-Virginia head coach Jeff Jones where he saw himself in 20 years. The round-faced coach took a bite of his barbeque sandwich and answered.
“I won’t be coaching 20 years from now,” Jones, then 33, told The Roanoke Times. “There’s just too much excess baggage to go with the job.”
That, of course, was before he took Virginia to the Elite Eight in 1995. Before the son of a coach surpassed his father in wins. Before he remarried and moved to Washington D.C. Before he led American University to a pair of Patriot League titles and NCAA Tournament appearances.
Now 52, Jones smiles at the thought of his 33-year-old self. He sits quietly at his desk writing a thank you card, sporting a black Nike pullover and a light stubble. Commemorative basketballs and pictures of his children dot the office. A Big Gulp on his desk has been reduced to ice.
It is here, nestled in a corner office overlooking Bender Arena, that the fiery skipper, the man who routinely screams at his bench and is hoarse by game’s end, is at his most serene.
“Some people would say ‘well, it’s just basketball,’” Jones said, explaining his job. “It is, but when there’s that many people that pay that much attention, it is your livelihood. And there’s a lot of stress involved.”
The Washington D.C. region has seen its fair share of collegiate coaches come and go over the last dozen years, from a fired Karl Hobbs to the retired Gary Williams. But before Wednesday, only Jones, who first arrived at American in 2000, had survived.
He did it by winning in a winnable conference, building a rock-solid program that has never finished below fourth in the league. Graduation rates on the team were high. Support from the athletic department had never been better. Jones was comfortable, and one year ago his contract was extended through the 2016 season.
“We love DC, and there’s a loyalty,” Jones said in October. “American has been very welcoming, and for me that’s a big thing: to be at a place where you’re appreciated. There have been other opportunities, but this is and continues to be the right place for me.”
The Daily Press reported Wednesday that Jones has accepted the head coaching job at Old Dominion University. The move will be announced at a Thursday press conference, according to Press columnist David Teel.
———-
Jeffrey Allen Jones was a strange kid.
His father, Bobby Jones, coached the Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers for 13 years, first as an assistant and then as head coach. Born in Owensboro, Ky. in 1960, Jeff was five when his father started coaching, and he immediately fell in love with the game of basketball. He loved watching his dad’s practices, soaking up the intricacies of the game for hours on end. While his friends were outside, running around or maybe playing basketball themselves, little Jeff was sitting quietly in the gym, observing the Panthers’ practice.
“I remember people joking around that I was a strange kid because I would go and watch his practices, and I would literally watch,” Jones said. “I’d go and I’d sit there and I’d watch, and that was a great day for me.”
Jeff didn’t love coaching, but he loved basketball. Surrounded by the sport, he took to the court and quickly became one of the best point guard prospects in the state of Kentucky. Hours of watching practices had taught him how to see what other players might miss. It made him invaluable.
After high school, Jones opted to leave his home state for Charlottesville, Va., where he was a four-year starter for the Virginia Cavaliers. He’s most well-known for playing alongside Ralph Sampson and leading the team to four postseason appearances, including the 1980 NIT championship and the 1981 Final Four.
When he graduated with a psychology degree in 1982, he had five job offers waiting for him. The world was his oyster. But none of those offers fulfilled his lifelong dream of going to the NBA, so he waited. After being signed and cut by two teams in a matter of months, his NBA dreams were dashed by Christmas. He was looking at two options: play professionally overseas, or return to Virginia as an assistant coach.
“Playing in the NBA was a dream. Playing overseas wasn’t a dream,” Jones said. “When that NBA dream kind of ended, I was ready to turn the page. And that’s when coaching became something that I wanted to do.”
———-
As a 22-year-old assistant coach at Virginia, Jones was given a lot of freedom and input in head coach Terry Holland’s system. The staff would hash and rehash and re-rehash a plan ten times before finalizing it, and Jones’ opinion was valued every step of the way.
He learned by observation and worked his way up the coaching totem pole at Virginia until Holland left to become the athletic director at his alma mater, Davidson College. In a controversial move, the athletic department picked Jones, who was 29 at the time, to be his replacement. He became the youngest head coach in Atlantic Coast Conference history.
“I don’t think there was any question that I was ready,” Jones said. “Maybe unknowingly, I had been preparing most of my life for that.”
Seven years, six 20-win seasons and five NCAA tournament appearances later, the wheels began to fall off. Three arrested players tainted Jones’ reputation at Virginia, and a losing record on the court certainly didn’t make things any better.
When leading scorer Courtney Alexander was accused of hitting, kicking and choking his girlfriend in June 1997, Jones ignored suggestions from his higher-ups in the athletic department and dismissed Alexander from the team. The move left a hole in the Virginia lineup and a growing rift between Jones and the administration.
Jones was fired after the 1998 season.
“There were lots and lots of great memories [at Virginia], and obviously when you fall short and you don’t do as well towards the end, those are the ones that, initially, you remember the most,” he said. “But I think we experienced a pretty good level of success. I’m not sure that Virginia’s been back to that level of success since.
“In fact,” Jones continued with a sly smile, “I’m sure that they haven’t been back to that level of success.”
———-
The year after Jones was fired was both the best and worst time of his life. He actually enjoyed his summer for the first time he could remember, spending time at beaches instead of hunting down recruits. But by October, the familiar itch of basketball season returned. Jones needed it. He desperately missed the sport.
He signed on to broadcast a few college basketball games with what is now Comcast Sports. But between those games was when Jones really took off. From early November to the middle of spring, Jones embarked on a whirlwind tour visiting the country’s best college coaches. He watched Gary Williams at Maryland and Tom Penders at George Washington. Bob Huggins at Cincinnati and Skip Prosser at Xavier. Rick Majerus at Utah – twice. Dave Odom at Wake Forest. Tubby Smith at Kentucky. College teammate Rick Carlisle, who was then an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers.
Altogether, the coaches Jones visited have accrued 4,210 wins.
“It was kind of like my sabbatical,” he said of the trip. “Those guys allowed me to see inside – it was great. The thing I’ve always told people is you pick up some new stuff and new perspective, but it also sometimes reinforces your beliefs in your way of doing things. There’s a lot of different ways to be successful, and every place you went, you could see that coach’s imprint, their personality, their style.”
———-
Jones brought a style of his own to American when he was hired to resurrect the flailing program in 2000. In his first year, he held practices at 6 a.m. every morning to send a message to his players: the losing ways of the past were unacceptable.
Losing is as unacceptable now, more than a dozen years later, as it was then. Jones hates losing. Abhors it. And he makes it very clear to his players that if they lose, it won’t be for a lack of effort. Jones works his players as hard as anyone starting point guard Danny Munoz has ever played for.
“I think anyone who plays Division I college basketball is going to be a hard worker coming into collegiate athletics, but there’s another step that you really have to go to when you get here your freshman year. It’s not something that’s easy, at all, and he really pushes you to get there,” Munoz said. “Putting everything that you have into one thing is so important to him and that’s why I think you see a team each year at AU that plays as hard as it can. Because it comes from him.”
Jones berates his players during games and yells more than he talks. To an average fan this may look like insanity or a need for anger management classes, but for Jones it’s an outward expression of his passion for the game and his players. He doesn’t yell at them because they screwed up – he yells at them because he so desperately wants them to reach their potential.
“My style, whatever that is, is not for everybody,” Jones said. “But when the players know that the coaches care about them, and the players care about one another, I think that – in terms of their experience while they’re here – that adds a lot.”
Contrary to popular belief, Jones does have a soft side, too. He’s a generally easygoing person away from the court. He has three kids – Meghann, Madison and Jeffrey – and a spacious house in suburban Arlington. He’s a diehard Redskins fan. And in between practices and games, Jones doesn’t get too swept up by the pressures of basketball to appreciate the process.
“It’s kind of weird thinking of Coach Jones off the court because that’s where you spend the most time with him, but when we’re just at the hotel or the day before the game, he’s happy and jokes around with us,” Munoz explained. “He’s a laidback guy. He likes to have a good time and have some laughs just like everyone else.”
———-
It’s been 19 years since Jones was asked about how he would spend the next 20, but now the question is being posed to him again. He smiles at the thought and thinks about all that’s happened in the past two decades – the good and the bad, the firing and the hiring, the trips across the country and trips on the court. As he thinks, the fire-and-brimstone version of Jones slowly shrinks away. In his place is simply an aging man contemplating the future. With a healthy family and steady job, he counts himself as blessed.
The fiery basketball coach leans forward on the desk and stares straight ahead. His eyes are a steely blue. He’s never really had a plan for the future or a grasp on the past. But when asked where he’ll be in 20 years, this time around, he knows exactly what to say.
“God,” Jones says, “I hope I’m at a beach somewhere.”

2013-09-12,AU,India,"Krishna Temple in Udupi
I’m a “When in Rome” type of person, and by that I mean that I try to fit in when visiting a foreign country. 
All too aware of the stigma attached to Americans abroad, I try my best to be culturally sensitive and respect the locals. Sometimes I can tell this is appreciated. Other times it ends in hilarity.
By my pale skin alone, it’s clear that I am foreign. Still, I dress in traditional Indian clothing, stand up when professors enter the room and eat exclusively with my right hand, sitting on my left to avoid making a giant faux pas. 
But India is a place of tradition and rituals like no other, and since I came here knowing next to nothing about them, the learning curve has been steep. The smallest things bring me back to freshman year when I didn’t know how to use the laundry machines and got lost going to Tenleytown. 
Even things like crossing the road are different. Traffic not only comes from the opposite direction, but crosswalks and sidewalks are nonexistent. If they do appear they are not respected by the motorcycles, cars, auto rickshaws, bicycles, pedestrians and animals that all use the streets of Manipal. Within my first week I learned from experience that perhaps the only time a rickshaw will stop to let you cross is when you slip and fall in its path. Maybe I was just lucky.
A pinnacle of this learning process came during a Krishna Janmashtami celebration a couple weeks ago. Krishna Janmashtami is the birth of the Hindu deity Krishna. A few of us decided to go to the service at the local temple, wanting to experience the holiday. The service was completely in Sanskrit, but we sat cross-legged in the crowd, attempting to follow along. When people stood, I stood. When gongs and bells sounded, I tried not to jump. When people lined up to receive a blessing, I followed, not knowing what the blessing was, but dutifully taking the holy water and thanking Krishna as I put it on my head.
Finally, the ceremony ended, and it was time for the free food promised to us from the beginning. Like most college students, free food is one thing that I know. I am good at receiving free food. But instead of Georgetown cupcakes, these baked goods were easily 95 percent sugar, had a texture resembling chalk and were liberally piled on my plate. The main dish was not pizza, but a heavy rice dish with coconut. I soon realized that there was no way I could finish this small mountain of food. 
And this was a problem. As part of the ceremony, you have to finish since the food was blessed by Krishna. The temple was soon empty with only our group of Americans and half-full plates remaining. As the priests started cleaning up, our desperation grew. Looking around for a trashcan or stray dog, I slipped a few of the baked goods into my bag to make my plate look emptier and motioned for others to do the same. We discreetly stacked our plates with the empty ones on top, concealing the mounds of leftover curry. With my bag full of baked goods, I guiltily left the temple, feeling more American than usual. 
Forgive me, Krishna, I thought. I’m but a mere foreigner.

2013-12-10,AU,India,"Houseboat tour on the backwaters of Kerala, India.
As difficult as it is to accept, my study abroad is over. I left Manipal four days ago at 5:30 a.m., sent off by my friends and loving resident director, who came bearing hot coffee. I don’t think even my own mother would walk a mile up a hill carrying a pot of coffee at 5 a.m. just to keep me sane on my journey south. As the car rounded the bend, leaving Manipal behind, tears started streaming down my face, the driver clearly uncomfortable with the crying white girl in his back seat.
During my flight to Kochi and the hours that I spent in the fancy hotel waiting for my parents’ arrival from Mumbai, I tried to come to terms with the fact that my study abroad had ended. Had I changed? What had I actually gained? 
My parents and I spent the next couple of days bumming around Fort Cochin, a touristy enclave in the southern state of Kerala. Watching my parents try to adapt to India was hilarious: they were undoubtedly American, smiling and saying hello to each person they passed on the street, looking confused and shell shocked when auto-rickshaw drivers pestered us to get in and not knowing what the different dishes were on menus at restaurants. Each time they didn’t understand what somebody said, they turned and looked at me and I gladly translated Indian English to American English and vice versa.
Our third day there we went on a backwaters tour. For the first time in four months, I was with strangers who were not Indian, which was unnerving in an unexpected way. All were tourists who had been in the country for a month or less, and I couldn’t help but feel a little superior to them as they talked about how crazy the traffic was and other things I had long since gotten used to.
Halfway through the tour, our guide asked us where we were all from. He was confused when he got to me: “You have been in India a long time. I can tell; you understand me better,” he said. I could have died with happiness.
While I am obviously still seeking closure to my abroad experience, traveling with my fresh-off-the-boat parents through this overwhelming country has shown me that I have learned to be Indian, for the most part. On the Delhi Metro this morning, packed like sardines even though it wasn’t even rush hour, I didn’t notice the masses staring until my mom pointed it out. While my parents flinched at every close call on the ride to the airport, I slept through it, unfazed by the obviously unsafe driving. I know how to ignore beggars, touts and people selling just about everything like the best of them. I’ve become all but immune to the smell of urine and sewage. I’ve learned to appreciate the chaos and the hubbub; never will you find a country more alive.
Who knows what I actually learned this study abroad, but I know that India will never be a total puzzle to me again.

2014-02-11,AU,India,"“Orange is the New Black” actress and activist Laverne Cox reflected on her life as a transgender woman of color on Feb. 11.
“One is not born a woman, but becomes one,” Cox said at the start of her speech, citing Simone De Beauvoir. 
Women’s Initiative sponsored the event and presented Cox as their Women’s History Month Speaker. 
By the time the doors to Ward 1 opened at 7 p.m., the line to hear Laverne Cox speak had wrapped three times around the basement and was already out the door. 
Cox began by describing what she referred to as “a state of emergency for trans people.” She shared terrifying statistics regarding the exponentially high homicide, unemployment and violence rates for trans people, particularly trans people of color.
Much to Cox’s delight, the audience soon developed a system of snaps for times where they appreciated or agreed with one of her sentiments. 
After giving an overview of the subject, she spoke of her own story of growing up in Mobile, Ala. 
“Everyone was telling me I was a boy,” she said, “but I knew I was a girl.” 
She faced harassment from classmates and teachers, and was not accepted by her mother, a devout member of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
After a suicide attempt in the sixth grade, Cox poured herself into achievement, citing Alice Miller’s “The Drama of the Gifted Child,” in which a child repressing trauma feels they must overcompensate in other areas of their life. 
This need for achievement allowed her to transfer into the Alabama School of Fine Arts, where she noticed more than ever the implications of the intersections of race, gender, sexuality and class. 
After graduating from ASFA, Cox attended Indiana University, but transferred to Marymount College in New York after two years. She said that most of her education came from outside of Marymount and in the New York City club scene, where gender expression was celebrated instead of shamed. She met other trans women who caused her to question her misconceptions and eventually inspired her to begin her own transition. 
Six years after she began her transitioning process, Cox was still being “spooked” (spotted as trans) on the street. She recalled experiencing countless instances of street harassment and one assault.
“Calling a transgender woman a man is an act of violence,” she said, also emphasizing the importance of pronouns. 
In regards to the recent controversy regarding Janet Mock’s appearance on Piers Morgan, Cox said “Piers Morgan had difficulty hearing outside of his own narrative in order to hear Janet’s,” then, with a smirk, “Wow, that was diplomatic.”
During the following Q&A session, Cox accepted an honorary bid to Gamma Rho Lambda, a multicultural, LGBTQ-inclusive sorority on campus. 
By interjecting humor and honesty in a serious discussion about the intersections of misogyny, transphobia and race, Cox delivered a message of positivity and love. Students who originally came to see Sophia from “Orange is the New Black” left with a desire to overcome the patriarchy and resist oppression. 
And for that, we give her snaps.

2014-03-07,AU,India,"On an overcrowded public bus in India, a man on the work commute gets felt up by a smiley, wrinkly stranger; no one notices. Across town, another man stares up at a ceiling fan, waiting to die.
Director Ritesh Batra lifts a magnifying glass to modern-day Mumbai—a city bursting at the seams—to examine these most microscopic stories of human interaction. “I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to,” one character muses. Often, these stories and connections in “The Lunchbox” are fascinating and unexpected.
The story begins with a happy accident, giving life to one of the film’s favorite lines: “Sometimes the wrong train can lead you to the right station.”
One day, the dabbawala (a lunch delivery service) mistakenly drops middle-class widower Saajan Fernandez (Irrfan Khan) a lunchbox from a young woman named Ila (Nimrat Kaur). The box was meant to go to her husband. Noticing the mistake, she pens a note to Fernandez, and tucks it into the lunchbox for delivery. Despite the original mistake, Saajan and Ila allow the mismatched deliveries to continue, communicating back and forth via lunchbox letter. In time, they develop an unconventional but rewarding friendship.
Andante-paced, sprinkled with humor, The Lunchbox is a collective of snapshot stories on what it means to connect with another human being. The mundane humdrum of modern life in Mumbai is captured gorgeously in cultural context. The tantalizing possibility of future change is portrayed with lingering, sometimes indulgent shots of Saajan and Ila lost deep in thought.
While impressive for what it accomplishes in just over 100 minutes, The Lunchbox comes off as almost a dream-like teaser clip, hesitating to commit itself to any kind of concrete conclusion or resolution. Much is left unanswered. The film takes its time, exploring human action and reaction, and is enjoyable in what it accomplishes, but does so at the expense of a fuller, richer ending.
At its core, “The Lunchbox” is very human, with each character searching for acknowledgment and love in society. The film is enjoyable as a diluted, but elegant cultural drama on micro-level human relationships and self-discovery.

It’s an achievement AU is proud of, even going so far as to plaster the statistics on the side of some shuttle buses. Mary Caroline Brazill, a rising senior in the School of International Service, and Eric Rodriguez, a recent graduate of the College of Arts and Sciences, have both become 2014 Truman Scholars. 
The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation identifies students with a passion for public service and awards them $30,000 towards graduate school. Brazill and Rodriguez have joined the ranks of people like former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and senior CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. 
AU has been home to 13 Truman scholars since 2000, including Brazill and Rodriguez. Around 600 candidates are nominated for the scholarship by their universities, according to the Truman Scholarship website. Out of those, 59 students became Truman Scholars in 2014. 
Mary Caroline Brazill
Despite a long history of public service, Brazill wasn’t initially sure that the Truman Scholarship was for her.
“I knew I wanted to do work in local communities in Sub-Saharan Africa,” Brazill wrote in an email, “and I had this image in my mind of Truman winners as very government, policy-level based.”
It wasn’t until she dug deeper into past scholars that Brazill decided to start the application process. According to Brazill, the initial application is 15 short answer questions and a section where the applicant identifies a flaw in a piece of legislation and proposes a solution.
Brazill wrote more than 10 drafts of her application before submitting it.
“About three-fourths of the way through, I ended up revamping the tone and emphasis of my entire application, which was simultaneously exciting and terrifying, but definitely the right decision,” she said.
It ultimately paid off. Brazill’s application was chosen for a panel interview, where she competed with eight people for the Pennsylvania scholarship. 
“I was really surprised at how many people were internationally focused— Arabic speakers, Chinese speakers and multiple students flown in from study abroad locations,” she said. “[I felt] unbelievably anxious and honestly a bit defeated. I thought I didn’t measure up.”
Brazill was at her internship with the Department of State. Late in the afternoon, she received a phone call from an unknow District of Columbia number.
“I ran to the back of the office in our big conference room, shut the door, took a breath and answered the call,” Brazill said. “President Kerwin was on the other end of the line, and he told me congratulations, that I had won! I remember letting out a bit of a scream— sorry, President Kerwin— and asking him if he was serious.” 
Brazill is no stranger to accepting awards. She spent the past year in Zanzibar, Tanzania as a 2013 Boren Scholar, where she became an advanced Swahili speaker. That time abroad helped solidify her commitment to working with local communities, she said. 
“I felt most valuable and most competent when I was interviewing local lawyers or holding an hour long workshop with secondary school students about human rights,” she said.
Before grad school, Brazill hopes to spend one to two years in Sub-Saharan Africa. After completing a graduate degree in human rights studies, she said she hopes to enter the non-profit sector and work on designing and implementing post-conflict programing.
“I know conflict resolution is complex, multi-dimensional and challenging,” Brazill said. “I was taught that there is always a solution; where there is a will, there is a way. Regardless of circumstances or emotions or obstacles, I was told that I had the ability to navigate the twists and turns and to find an answer.”
Eric Rodriguez
Eric Rodriguez, 27, is a first-generation college student from the Yakama Reservation in Wapato, Washington.
“I was born and raised on the reservation,” he said. “I grew up in the housing projects. That’s where [my family] still live[s], they’re still there.”
Rodriguez’s experience with public service started early. At 18, he became a volunteer firefighter and once he turned 21, a tribal police officer.
“It was basically just trying to change the philosophy of policing and being proactive,” he said. 
As a police officer, Rodriguez addressed issues like teen suicide and domestic violence. He realized he needed to get his degree when he went to tribal high schools and encouraged the graduating seniors to attend college. 
“One person asked me, ‘So where did you go to school?’ and I didn’t finish community college,” he said. “So I just knew I had to go back to school and finish my education, so I could make more of an impact.”
The best place to make an impact was at AU. Going to school in D.C. meant that Rodriguez could learn about how federal American Indian policies were developed, he said.  So two and a half years ago, over six years after he graduated high school, Rodriguez started at AU.
The Truman Scholarship is not the first award Rodriguez won as an AU student. In 2013, he was awarded the Udall scholarship for tribal public policy. From there, the Office of Merit awards suggested he look into the Truman Scholarship. 
“It kind of fit perfectly, because [public service] is what I want to do anyway,” Rodriguez said.
After sending in his application, the Office of Merit awards held mock interviews to help Rodriguez prepare.
“I think the mock interviews were more rigorous than the actual interview,” he said, laughing.  According to Rodriguez, the Truman interview was 20 minutes, with around eight people asking him questions.
Rodriguez graduated from AU earlier this May with a degree in anthropology and plans to go to law school this fall. Rodriguez wants to use that education as an in-house tribal lawyer. Tribal leaders go to attorneys to make decisions, he said, meaning that’s the best place to make a positive impact.
“It’s trying to bridge that knowledge of growing up, going through the customs and traditions and then having a legal background to be able to interpret that,” he said. “It’s being able to interpret traditional knowledge into a type of argument you can bring in front of a court.”

2015-10-12,AU,India,"Texas-raised Alan Palomo—better known as Neon Indian—will perform at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 13. The artist is set to release his latest album “VEGA INTL. Night School” on Oct. 16, Palomo’s first recording since his 2011 release of “Era Extraña.”
You can already listen to the singles “Slumlord,” “Annie” and “The Glitzy Hive” from “VEGA INTL Night School.” A music video for “Slumlord” will also be released soon, according to  pictures posted on Palomo’s Instagram account.

On the upcoming album, Palomo reverts back to the glitchy tendencies and electro-pop sensibilities that first gave Neon Indian its cosmic quality in “Psychic Chasms” (2009). While Palomo is moving away from the humorous elements of “Psychic Chasms,” which included track names like “Laughing Gas,” “Should Have Taken Acid With You” and “Terminally Chill,” his new album still keeps things light-hearted and merry.

The newest singles from “VEGA INTL. Night School” make listeners feel life they are simultaneously in paradise and living in a modern version of Miami Vice. Much more energetic than “Psychic Chasms,” yet unshakably beachy, the latest album assures that concert-goers will have a kinetic and unique experience at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 13.
New Zealand native and New York-based vocalist Tamaryn will open for Neon Indian. Tamaryn will showcase her latest album, “Cranekiss,” released August 2015.

2016-05-13,AU,India,"(Courtesy of IFC Films)
The Man Who Knew Infinity is the story of the math genius, Srinivasa Ramanujan who is famous for making groundbreaking contributions to theoretical mathematics.  
Interestingly enough, the film doesn’t fail in making formula-writing into riveting plot material. It fails in the ways that a lot of the “genius genre” films do: oscillating between melodrama and unbridled wide-eyed “oh, aren’t you impressed” theatrics. The authenticity rings hollow and the film falls victim to many overused tropes--namely the “obscurity to recognition” trajectory of geniuses and the fact that only the West is deemed authoritative enough to recognize geniuses.
Ramanujan (Dev Patel) is a self-taught mathematician living in India, barely scraping by as an accounting clerk. In his spare time, he writes formulas for ideas such as  the number of partitions a number has, with the number growing to infinity. He writes a letter with his work to G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons), a mathematician at Trinity College in Cambridge. Hardy is so impressed by Ramanujan that he summons him to England to learn more about his theories.
The relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan is easily the most compelling part of the film, as the audience  hardly gets to know much about Ramanujan other than his work. Ramanujan credits divine inspiration for his incalculable formulas—he says it’s intuition that things are right is all he needs. Hardy is presented as an atheist who couldn’t possibly grasp the mystical ways of Hinduism. 
This precisely is the issue with the film—you won’t have to look far for “Orientalist” overtones, ad infinitum. Ramanujan’s spirituality is presented clumsily, replete with elephant Ganesha statues and all sorts of reductionistic motifs. He is made to look provincial in mind—merely the vessel for genius bestowed from up above.
The colonial mentality of England is presented surprisingly well, on the other hand. Everyone, but a few people like Hardy, make little effort to hide their disdain for Ramanujan’s Indian origin and humble beginnings. Micro aggressions including  not being allowed to step on the grass at Cambridge abound. 
Jeremy Irons plays Hardy beautifully, as a man wanting to help Ramanujan but perhaps too timid in facing down the pervasive racism leveled at his protégé. He publishes Ramanujan’s work and seeks to get him a fellowship but not once does he actually ever address the colonial mentality espoused by his colleagues—he simply, and formulaically, advocates for Ramanujan as a mathematician, not as a person.
Dev Patel, too, stays mired in playing Ramanujan as a bumbling country bumpkin;  tall, gawky and impossibly awkward in every sense. All he wants, he says, is to publish and  to get people to read his work, the scope of which is mind-boggling. In a true genius sense, he can’t be bothered with Hardy’s pedantics of proving theories. 
The viewers are made to feel as though he has so many ideas bursting forth, it is all he can do to keep up with even so much as recording them. But the person gets lost in the formulas. We never understand, for example, much about his love for his wife, whom he left behind in India. We get little nuancing of him other than as a repository for other-worldly ideas. In the midst of all of this, mawkishness abounds… soft lighting and Indian sitar strains do, too.

In 2016, voters are using their relationships to swing the vote toward their own party. 
According to a new study by the Pew Research Center, few Clinton or Trump supporters look for friendships in the opposite party. Among registered-to-vote Trump supporters, only 4% have “a lot” of close friends supporting Clinton. This number is more dramatic in relation to registered-to-vote Clinton supporters, with only 2% saying they have “a lot” of close friends supporting Trump. Further, Trump supporters have a lot (44%) of friends supporting Trump, and some friends (38%) supporting him. 16% of Trump voters have “just a few” or “none” of their friends swinging for Clinton. The same goes for Clinton’s voters, with 31% saying they have no close friends who support the opposition.
The data tells us that people are less willing to build friendships with those who support different viewpoints. This explains the widespread polarization in media, pop culture, communities, and the United States as a whole. The age bracket of 18-29 -- Millennials, including college students -- reflects this isolated trend. With 58% of Clinton supporters saying none of their close friends support the other candidate, only 34% of Trump supporters say the same.
As I have different viewpoints than the majority of my peers on AU’s campus, these figures do not surprise me. Another study by Pew supports my feelings by reporting that 40% of Millennials ages 18-34 support the government censoring “offensive” speech. The data highlights the decline in acceptance of other views in America, and how alternative opinions are viewed on modern college campuses.
Examining this idea more in depth, OKCupid released a new study detailing how partisanship actually influences a person’s dating profile. Their research concluded that “the amount of OkCupid users who couldn’t date someone with opposing political views is at 50% — a number that’s been rising since 2008.” 
Apparently, voting even counts when seeking a proper life partner. Personally, this is not surprising. Most people seek a partner who holds their same values that can grow and thrive in a family. Therefore it is only logical that one chooses another to spread these values within the home.
The OKCupid study found that in dating profiles, liberals are likely to feature interests like “The Daily Show, Broad City, NPR, podcasts, and weed,” and conservatives are likely to use words like “Jesus, Faith, Country, and Guns.” Bipartisan overlaps for words include “INTP (a Meyers-Briggs personality type), Outlander, Indiana, iPhone, Adventure, Honesty, and Considerate.”
Examining these polls, both parties express different values that are not only attractive when voting, but also when choosing friends and partners. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is upsetting when a large portion of the U.S. youth population is wary to hear different viewpoints, unregulated speech, and expression. 
As a founding principle of the United States, free speech was intended to support minorities from the dictatorship of the majority. It appears that many millennials do not feel that way, especially when choosing friends and spouses.
At the end of the day, it is a good thing we can all agree: honesty and consideration are good characteristics for partners. But maybe appreciating our partners and friend groups’ differences can be just as valuable.

2016-10-13,AU,India,"I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

2017-04-10,AU,India,"A new and highly concentrated major in dance is currently under review by AU administration to be approved as a major. While dance is currently available as a minor, a major would expand the class offerings for students. 
Britta J. Peterson, the director of the dance program at AU, said that the major was designed with the AU student in mind. The proposed program is structured so that students who enroll in the major may still double major, study abroad, have multiple minors and be able to intern while earning 43 credits toward their dance major.
The foundation of the program would be what Peterson calls “Embodied Knowledge,” or dance technique classes, which could include different types of dance, such as urban and Indian dance forms. Students will also be able to learn about other relevant topics including anatomy and the history, technology and business of dance.
“I know that when our students enter the field, they are going to have the hard skills to do their work,” Peterson said. 
The program will be geared to the interests and career goals of the student, Peterson said. 
“What we see is that the dance student is in the driver seat, and then me and my colleagues are hanging in the side car, making sure people don’t run off the road or hit a pothole,” she said. “And if you do, we’re there to help pick you up.” 
The process of introducing a brand new major at AU is a long one, Peterson said. She has been working on developing the program for the past few months, and discussions about proposing and implementing a major have been happening for years. The wait could be over: the board will meet this spring, and if approved, the dance major may become a reality for students at AU this fall.
“We talked to students, we [did] all this past research, looked at what classes have been offered, which classes have worked, what other people are doing across the nation that’s working,” Peterson said.
She has also revamped the dance minor to be more diverse and fit into the schedules of students. The movement classes, based in different types of dance, are proposed to be two credits, giving students the opportunity to add dance into their schedules even if they are not a dance major or minor. The changes for the minor are included with the major proposal and will be implemented if it is approved by the board. 
Emma Rawley, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, is taking an intermediate jazz course this semester with Britta Peterson. She is involved in AU in Motion, AU’s largest student-run dance organization, with a focus on jazz and modern dance. She is looking forward to the changes to the dance program. 
“Maybe AU will start to seem like something more than just SIS,” Rawley said. “People can start to see it as more diverse.”
Jean Thompson, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, also spends a lot of her time on AU in Motion and wishes that the dance major was in place when she enrolled at AU as a freshman. 
“I would have definitely tried to double major in dance,” Thompson said.
Thompson said she was hesitant about declaring the minor as she had always been classically trained in ballet, but is excited to see what the new major will incorporate with its diversity of dance forms. 
“You don’t have to be a major to take these classes,” Peterson said. “Everyone is welcome.” 
Peterson said that the dance department is invested in inclusion, and her colleagues’ different perspectives and expertise is what will give the program its depth. 
Peterson encourages all students that are interested to come to the “Dance Works,” the annual spring dance concert featuring the American University Dance Company. This will give an opportunity for students to see the work of current dance students and experience the new perspective of the dance program, she said. The show is set for April 21-22 at the AU Greenberg Theatre at 8 p.m. Tickets are available here.

2017-05-05,AU,India,"Those professors among us who teach from the perspective of the oppressed are often tasked with un-teaching what our students learned before arriving. As we know, the education system is a crucial site of social (re)production, fully complicit in the art of domination. Children learn that our American hands are clean and our rule is just. To inculcate each new generation of patriots, Cowboys (or Cubs) fight Indians, “good” guys are pitted against bad hombres, super-predators, terrorists, the axis of evil. A children’s textbook in Texas refers to African slaves as migrant “workers.” Hegemony is secured in the rewriting of history. The original sin has been erased.
So this becomes a dilemma. It is difficult to talk of a shared heritage that celebrates victories of subjugation and extermination when one is not herself of the lineage of the conqueror, but to do otherwise contradicts the stories we as a collective – “we the people” – tell. This collective worldview endows on the conquered the Hegelian double consciousness of master and slave that W.E.B. Du Bois so eloquently extended to the black American. The master can only be shocked, angered or insulted when Beyoncé gets in formation or when Colin Kaepernick takes a knee. The master is not repulsed by the portrait of Andrew Jackson, who once offered $50 and “ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred” for his runaway slave, that hangs in the Oval Office.
The slave, by contrast, cannot but know the horror because she embodies our original sin.
The historical record is contested because its narrative pervades our lived present. It is ongoing. And while the “alternative facts” of the 45th Administration are so flagrant as to seem abnormal, our standard education is one of alt history, alt economics, alt politics, and certainly alt race relations. The “alt right” is brought to us courtesy of our alt education.
Power is a shape-shifter, and,with every gain of the subjugated, it manifests anew. So when Jim Crow at home and colonial rule abroad became untenable, racism came to be depicted not as a systemic or structural force but rather a problem of the racist individual. Being stripped of the institutions of racial domination, in other words, necessitated the erasure of their structural legacies. It pushed the problem of racism to that of racists, easily denounced in the collective purge of racist offenders. A generation is raised on this erasure, and claims colorblindness with the same surety as its sibling claims of neutrality, objectivity and universality. What’s wrong with All Lives Matter, the master asks? Doesn’t Black Lives Matter simply perpetuate these false divisions?
What’s all the fuss over a banana?
We have been here before.
The personal aberration, the defective racist, finds her corollary in personal responsibility. So after a half century it becomes legitimate to dismantle affirmative action, when studies show that it would take 228 years for black families to close the wealth gap with white families. When last year The Washington Post declared, “Net worth of white households in D.C. region is 81 times that of black households,” and described a “racial wealth gap” that, while frequently attributed to “individual character flaws” in fact represents “an extensive history of the structural barriers in local and national policies, Supreme Court rulings, programs and practices that created wealth for many White families and prevented wealth accumulation or stripped wealth from many Black families.”
The myth of personal responsibility is built on the erasure of America’s original sin. Thus it is with no small irony that I write as an AU professor in Washington DC, the belly of the beast.
The education system, a crucial site of social (re)production, cannot but be complicit in the art of domination. We are the intelligentsia, engaged in a war of position, which is all too often the intellectual production of revision and denial.
How then might we make agency of our double consciousness?
In reaction to Monday’s hate crime, occurring just as Taylor Dumpson became the first black woman president of AU’s Student Government, and against the national backdrop of the police murder of fifteen year-old Jordan Edwards and the failure of the Justice Department to prosecute in the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling, the AU Faculty Senate proposed a Permanent AU Commission for Anti-Discrimination that aims to “develop the most advanced model in higher education for anti-discriminatory policies and accountability in the nation.” 
I applaud the measure. But we must go further, to the heart of our mission as an institution of higher education: let us decolonize. Let us challenge ourselves to be the most advanced model for teaching truth to power. When “diversity” and “inclusion” are superfluous add-ons, seminars and weekend workshops separated from the “real” work that “serious” scholars do, our students take the cue. In 2017, an AU student can still graduate without learning that this country and this world looks the way it does for reasons that make “we the people” look bad. Moreover, the classes that teach these truths are too often set apart as less stringent scholarship or posed as alternative readings of what is otherwise a normative reality. Is this what we want from the next generation of informed citizens in a multicultural world?
Responding to systemic incidents on this campus and elsewhere, the belated conversation around curricular change has begun: we are seeing the Habits of Mind AUx take effect, a Racial Literacy project went forward last year, a series of interdisciplinary degrees under the Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies Collaborative are unfolding, and faculty have submitted an AU2030 Social Equity Initiative proposal. May this be merely the beginning of something much greater. It is only when we un-teach the lies of the past that claims to a shared heritage will mean something other than the art of domination.

2017-08-11,AU,India,"There is no comprehensive reporting system for the number of missing and murdered Native American women and girls in the United States--the only category of missing persons without one. Many reports, however, estimate that Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the 
	national average.

	“Wind River,” although fictional, portrays this bleak reality with a steely resolve. Screenwriter and director 
	Taylor Sheridan (“Sicario” and “Hell and High Water”) paints a picture of life on a reservation in muted, grim tones. The film brings to vivid life how drugs have ravaged the community, how violence so often punctures the fabric of daily existence, how Native culture has been obliterated and how the reservation is a place both forgotten and stigmatized.

Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds the raped and beaten body of a young Native woman in the snow. The tracks point to a seeming impossibility--that she had been running barefoot through the snow for miles. Natalie (Kelsey Asbille), the best friend of Cory’s daughter, had died three years earlier under similar circumstances.

	Rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (
	Elizabeth Olsen) flies in from Vegas, where she is stationed, to investigate the crime. The Tribal Police chief, who has come to accept law enforcement’s utter lack of concern for his people, jokingly remarks, “see what they send us,” when she arrives clad in summery attire in the midst of a blizzard. But Jane is different. The absolute brutality and violence women are subjected to at Wind River shakes her to her core. Olsen makes palpable the feeling of a woman contending with violence against women─as something that feels intensely and viscerally personal.

	Jane asks Cory to help her in the investigation. That dynamic is also really interesting since Jane lacks the typical authority figure hubris. Witnessing the dynamics in a community that has received no help from “the government,” she recognizes that Cory can not only “help her hunt a predator” but that he can also earn the trust of the community, which has no reason to trust anyone outside of it.

	“Wind River” is a so much more than a taut murder mystery. Free of polemics, Sheridan’s director hand turns the lens on how elusive “justice” can be for the Native American community, on multiple levels. Finding the perpetrator of this specific crime can’t offer the satisfaction traditional murder mystery films offer in catching the bad guy, because most other victims never get the dignity of having someone care to find the perpetrators.

	“Wind River” will shake you to your core, but it is an important film to see.

2018-10-11,AU,India,"The Little Wild Things Curry
Our weekly search for restaurants that probably aren’t on your radar. As young, broke college kids we will bring you our honest reviews of affordable restaurants in dope neighborhoods.
Calling out all veggie lovers, this one’s for you. And even if you aren’t into vegetables, you’ll still be interested in this review. 
After the Festival of India’s exhibit on vegetarianism on the quad, we decided to go for a healthier option this week, and we didn’t have to look very far.
We decided to hit up Beefsteak, which is right by the AU-Tenleytown Metro stop. Created by legendary D.C. chef Jose Andres, Beefsteak puts veggies “center stage.” As soon as you walk in the door, you immediately pick up on the restaurant's environmentally friendly vibe. All the produce here is locally sourced. 
We decided to try The Edan, the Little Wild Things Curry and the Beefsteak Burger. These are the most popular dishes, and get a 100 percent recommendation from us. 
The Edan veggie bowl has so much to offer. It’s filled with quinoa, edamame, zucchini, cilantro sauce, garlic yogurt and cucumber salad. 
The Little Wild Things Curry has rice, lentils, carrots, spring onion blend, kale, kohlrabi, green curry sauce, toasted sesame seeds and radish. 
Our last dish, the Beefsteak Burger, was definitely our favorite. It’s quite simply unlike any burger we’ve ever tried. It’s made from marinated beets, pickled red onions, leaf lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, vegan chipotle mayo, olive oil and sea salt on an olive oil brioche. Although this burger is entirely meatless, it is topped with a delicious tomato that adds in the extra taste and makes up for the lack of meat. We were skeptical at first too, but you’re going to have to trust us on this one. We also recommend adding avocado to yours if you’re feeling extra hungry. 
We’d describe Beefsteak as a healthier Chipotle that gives you a variety of fresh, locally grown vegetables at your fingertips. The chill environment is similar to that of a cozy coffee shop, and we’d definitely recommend it as a place to hang and study. 
Each table has outlets and USB ports, so you could spend hours there doing work if you, hypothetically, haven’t started studying for any of your exams. The USB ports are also great if you want to post a picture of your awesome food, but your phone is about to die. 
Beefsteak has additional locations such as Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom. And if you are on the run, they have you covered with their app that is easy for ordering food for pick up. 
We cannot recommend that you try this restaurant and these dishes more, so you need to hurry because their menu is subject to change soon.

2018-12-12,AU,India,"Freshmen Nirmala Persaud, left, Sayukta Agarwal, center, and Janvi Sai, right, perform a Bollywood Garba fusion dance at the 2018 annual Jalwa Culture and Fashion Show.
Students clad in vibrant lehengas, saris and kurtas alike filled the Tavern on Oct. 19 for “The Royal Jalwa,” an event hosted by AU’s South Asian Student Association. Students who walked the runway of the event’s fashion show wore colorful garments, jewelry pieces and sequined shawls that represented distinct elements of their culture. 
Janvi Sai, a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, chose to wear a lehenga decorated with orange, yellow and pink. Sai said a lehenga is an embroidered two-piece outfit, a skirt and a blouse, often complimented by a dupatta, a long scarf. 
“The dupatta for the lehenga was silk. Banarasi silk, I think,” she said. “I was wearing golden ruby jewelry as well. The outfit and the jewelry were both from Hyderabad; it made me nostalgic.”
Sai said she grew up with these clothes. Her mother often designed costumes for her Bharatanatyam performances, an Indian classical dance form based on a Hindi concept called “Natya Shastra.” Dancers would typically wear long, pleated costumes embellished with embroidery.  
For these performances, Sai said she would wear her embroidered costume, paint on her hands, bells on her ankles and jasmine flowers in her hair. Sai’s mother would design intricate costumes through needlework and chose accessories to match. 
“When it comes to haute couture, South Asian clothing may not come to people’s minds,” Sai said. “My mother’s designs changed the game and fueled my fascination for South Asian clothing.”
Syeda Siddiqi, a junior in the School of International Service, wore a sari to Jalwa. A sari is considered traditional Indian dress, made up of long pieces of cloth and fabric. Wanting to make her outfit a bit sultry, she chose a red and black garment and gold jewelry pieces to match. She said that these events and these clothes are some of the ways she maintains connection with her culture. 
The sari can be traced back to Tamil poetry, which described women in elegant gowns and wraps. It eventually made its way to North and South Indian fashion. There are many legends about the creation of the sari. 
One suggests that a weaver daydreamed about a beautiful woman while using his loom. Due to his absent minded daydreams, he kept using his loom until he realized that the garment had become yards long.
A kurta is a long garment worn usually by men, while women typically wear kurtis. Kurtas and kurtis are worn throughout South Asia, in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Nepal, just to name a few. The main discrepancy between the two is based on the length of the garment. Kurtas and kurtis can vary  in length, typically near the knees. They can be dressed up or down worn with a churidar, salwar or a more modern pair of jeans. 
A churidar is a trouser that is more tight, similar to leggings. The salwar, on the other hand, is looser and a bit baggy. 
Sai wore a tikka to the event, a headpiece made of gemstones such as ruby or gold. Maang tikkas are used as accessories for brides as well. Hindu mythology writes that this spot on the forehead is a “third eye” resting on the sixth chakra, which holds power of concentration and emotion. However, tikkas are now becoming an accessory that is worn at many events to evoke fashionability or elegance. 
Sai said that South Asian fashion represents the diversity that exists in the wide region. With the many subcultures, peoples and languages in South Asia, Sai said, comes various styles and forms of clothing. She said that the lehenga she wore to perform with her dance group could be considered more North Indian. 
“I also wore a lehenga because I’m fascinated by South Asian history and how lehengas date back to the Mughal era,” Sai said. “I find South Asian clothing to be a reflection of our history and heritage.”
Nostalgia often occurs for Sai during these events. The clothing frequently reminds her of her memories in India and the city of Hyderabad. Sai said she then grew up in a primarily-white town that did not offer many opportunities for this kind of expression. 
“I’m appreciative of the experiences that I’ve had with South Asian culture at AU because I didn’t really have that back home. I had to make it for myself. I was really among the only people of color or even South Asians in my high school in my town,” Sai said. “I was always constantly being told by peers and teachers, that they wanted me to assimilate, and it was kind of this problem that they had with me. But no, I'm going to embrace what's different about me and my culture.”
Students say that AU is not exempt from this type of South Asian erasure. In October, a group entitled Viva Kultura visited Kay Spiritual Life Center for a show about “Hinduism and Indian culture.” Many students were upset by Viva Kultura’s inclusion of several non-South Asian dancers in their performance. 
Maya Krishnan, the president of the South Asian Student Association, published an opinion piece in The Eagle shortly after the event criticizing the group and the University for allowing them on campus.
“AU does not have a large South Asian population, and there is minimal representation of South Asian culture in academia and coursework, even within curriculum of courses hosted in the School of International Service,” Krishnan wrote. “With such little representation, whatever exposure there is needs to be accurate.” 
Siddiqi said that events such as Jalwa are integral for herself and other students at AU, as there are not many opportunities to celebrate South Asian culture through fashion, music and dance.
“It’s important that we refuse South Asian invisibility on campus,” she said. “It reminds us that our culture is important.”

2019-10-09,AU,India,"American University is a leader in the field of international service. The nationally-ranked program is sought after by many students and offers a plethora of unique opportunities that anyone interested in the subject would be lucky to have access to. Still, as ahead of the curve as AU loves to emphasize that it is, significant work is yet to be done on how our students learn about countries other than their own. 
As a CLEG major, my interactions with SIS are limited to getting work done at the Dav and one or two required classes that fit under the discipline of international service. Still, after taking one of those courses, it is clear to me that the way we teach and talk about non-Western nations is condescending and a disservice to the regions in question. 
Students of color, like myself, are in a unique position to bring something new to the discussion of other nations. My background specifically gives me a comprehensive understanding of how India works beyond what’s on paper, and allows me to juxtapose that with my upbringing in the United States. It is an incredible resource to have, especially when it comes time to study that region specifically. Still, my experience with that aspect of the course was overwhelmingly negative. 
Sitting in a room that’s almost entirely full of white people, I can understand the impulse to not pick words carefully. However, any adverse suggestions, no matter how well-veiled, nuanced or unintentional, are destructive. Any off-hand implication that another country might be primitive and somehow wrong in their politics is incredibly reckless. These implications grow to be established attitudes students have towards other regions in the world, attitudes that are born of mindless and mostly negative nuance. 
Our perspective of the rest of the world is ingrained in our upbringing, and even as educated adults, it is hard to separate a deeply developed perspective from objectivity. This results in people familiar with the Western experience treating the governments of other nations as primitive, uneducated and sometimes even wrong. I don’t doubt that this treatment is unconscious, but that is even more of a reason to diversify the body of individuals that teach  students about incredibly complicated region-specific issues. 
Diversity is a constant goal to strive towards in any institution; however, it is essential in international studies. In order to accurately communicate the nuances involved in the study of other nations, how they interact with each other and how that affects our own, academia needs diversity. Yes, it is a difficult task to create a faculty made up of members of the nations they teach, but it is crucial to the authentic representation of the politics and cultures of these nations. Politics is not just what’s written in the governing documents of countries; it is the everyday application of those documents, something that can only be fully understood by experiencing it. 
The notion that other nations are wrong and ours is right is dangerous, no matter how casually it is implied. This attitude sends students out into the world thinking they have the tools to save nations and create a Western, one size fits all solution to a region-specific problem. Irrespective of whether the nation is developing or developed, teaching from the baseline of America’s “correctness” is endlessly harmful and taints the noble endeavor of studying to be an international servant.

2020-05-03,AU,India,"Students from AU for Warren sell merchandise on campus to promote her presidential campaign.
While phone banking and canvassing are traditional ways to show your support for a presidential candidate during the primary season, AU student organizations showed that simply sporting a button on your backpack or wearing a t-shirt with your candidate of choice is enough to make a statement.
Student groups on campus have devoted themselves to advocating for specific candidates during the primaries, using merchandise to increase awareness for certain candidates.
Alex Russo is the president of AU for Warren, a student organization that paid for their merchandise entirely out of their own pockets. AU did not provide funding for this merchandise because the organization was deemed as too “short-lived,” according to Russo.
Russo said AU for Warren has about 250 people on its email list, and about 20 or 30 members he could rely on for assistance.
Despite the suspension of Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign in March, the organization has remained active on social media.
AU for Warren wrote in one tweet, “While Elizabeth Warren has suspended her campaign, it does not suspend the truth in her fight.”
Other student groups, such as AU College Democrats, did not endorse specific candidates as an organization. However, Vice President of AU Dems Emily Coneybeare was proudly wearing Elizabeth Warren merchandise across campus. She has a “NH for Warren” sticker on the center of her laptop and a Warren button on her backpack. Coneybeare worked for Warren in New Hampshire, and said that being able to wear merchandise from the campaign has a sentimental value for her.
“To be able to carry on what I know is such a good campaign and to represent it at school and wherever I go is important to me,” Coneybeare said.
Even though Warren suspended her campaign, Coneybeare does not necessarily have plans to stop wearing Warren merchandise. Coneybeare said her Warren merchandise reminds her of the people she met and the formative experiences she had while working on the campaign. 
AU Dems have been continuously using their online platform during the coronavirus pandemic by providing students with resources and advocacy ideas. The club is promoting COVID-19 related material and is selecting students for scholarships.
Christian Omoruyi is the president of AU Students for Biden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, candidate-focused groups have had to brainstorm new ways to keep students involved. 


“Now with coronavirus and all the mayhem that has unleashed, we are definitely looking at virtual ways to keep our momentum going,” Omoruyi said.
Even before Bernie Sanders officially suspended his campaign, Joe Biden had been gaining more traction in the race. Omoruyi said that, across AU for Biden’s communications networks, the club has a wide following.
Since the pandemic caused many AU for Biden members to return to their hometowns, Omoruyi explained that he is “strategizing on future primaries” and encouraging members to raise awareness for Biden in their local communities. He is especially interested in having students spread the word in Pennsylvania and his home state of Indiana. 
Before the spring 2020 semester was moved online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AU for Biden did not have merchandise created.
Nonetheless, Omoruyi said he’s proud of the logo that AU for Biden designed. He said these logos will be used on future merchandise, including buttons. He is working on “light-hearted” t-shirt designs appealing to Biden’s interests in aviator glasses and ice cream.
AU for Biden will most likely sell this merchandise during the fall 2020 semester, since shipping to students across the country would not be financially feasible for the small student club.
Both Russo and Omoruyi agreed that merchandise is beneficial for supporting candidates in the presidential primaries.
“When people see something familiar, like a familiar logo, I guess there’s just something subconscious that just kicks in,” Omoruyi said, adding later, “I think merchandise can also create a sense of solidarity when people are all wearing merchandise together.”
“We are a community of laptop stickers and buttons on our backpacks, and when people see that, just like walking down the quad, that tells them, ‘Oh wait, there’s a community on campus,’” Russo said.

2020-09-09,AU,India,"Alumna Mia Van Allen founded Color of Music Collective to amplify people of color and LGBTQ individuals in the music industry.
At the start of the Color of Music Collective’s panel “Word of Mouth: The Power of Digital Marketing + Promotion Confirmation,” founder and American University alumna Mia Van Allen asked an important question.
“Digital marketing campaigns can be great ways to display solidarity for social change movements to large audiences,” Van Allen said. “As a marketing professional, how do you ensure that your campaigns and marketing strategies are inclusive, diverse and impactful?”
It’s a question that professionals across the country are asking, but one that Van Allen feels is especially pressing in the music industry, which is why she created the Color of Music Collective (COMC) to amplify the voices of people of color and LGBTQ individuals in the music industry.
As a Black student, Van Allen said that she noticed a lack of representation in the music industry through her studies as a public relations major and business and entertainment minor. At her various internships, Van Allen said that she was often the only person or woman of color in the workspace. 
“I dealt with imposter syndrome, and my way of dealing with that was networking with people of color … and getting their guidance throughout college,” Van Allen said. “It created this sort of mentorship program for myself and I was able to maintain those relationships.”
The connections that Van Allen made at AU gave her the idea to create the COMC. She first went to Emily Yankana, a friend and fellow graduate from AU, to flesh out the idea.
Yankana, who is Filipino and West Indian, said she was also troubled by the lack of representation of people of color and LGBTQ individuals at predominantly white institutions like AU and in the music industry. 
Yankana, who graduated with a public relations degree in 2019, is determined to transfer her skills to advocate for underrepresented communities in the public relations field. She said that one way she can do that is through volunteering on COMC’s social media team.
Van Allen said that Yankana was the one who thought of making a collective of BIPOC and LGBTQ individuals in the music industry through virtual networking. The pair worked on COMC’s brand and name, and Yankana used her background in marketing and advocacy to help bring Van Allen’s ideas to life.
The collective launched in June with a free virtual networking panel featuring LGBTQ and BIPOC human resources representatives from different companies. After its first panel, Van Allen said its email inboxes and direct messages were filled with hopeful volunteers. 
“That whole collaboration part is what makes us really special and what makes our community really special,” Yankana said. “I’m always so ecstatic when we add someone new to the team because it just means that I get to watch them grow and mold them into fitting whatever goals they have to achieve.”
Hana Braverman, a 2020 AU alumna who studied business entertainment with concentrations in music and information technology, said that she joined COMC as a community outreach volunteer because of her interest in the music industry and her own experiences feeling underrepresented.
As someone who identifies as half-Korean and as part of the LGBTQ community, Braverman said it was rare to see someone “like her” in the industry. She emphasized that, in the music industry, there is “blatant racism and misogyny.”
“If you are a marginalized voice and you want to work in the industry, it’s so hard to just cold call or apply online,” Braverman said. “This is a really great way to network and meet people and learn about what to expect and what to know.”
As a community outreach director, Braverman and other volunteers brainstorm panel ideas and research potential panelists to bring into the event. Van Allen said that its panels have hit capacity nearly every time. 
“I like to keep it as diverse as possible — ideally different races and different sexualities and genders each time,” Van Allen said, in reference to the panelists.
While the panels give participants an opportunity to ask questions and listen to BIPOC and LGBTQ voices inside of the industry, the volunteers reap the benefits as well.
“Mia, and the whole group, [are] really keen on making sure these people that are volunteering are making those connections because we’re the ones that are really interested in working, and obviously volunteering,” Braverman said. 
Aside from panels, COMC hosts BIPOC and LGBTQ writers on its blog and provides a comprehensive job board with both paid and unpaid internships and part-time and full-time jobs.
“Essentially the job board is for employers and organizations to reach out to us,” Yankana said. “This is sort of us trying our hand at coordinating that process and extending new opportunities to not just our volunteers, but the wider audience in itself.”
On Aug. 14, the organization hosted “The Listening Room,” a virtual concert featuring BIPOC and LGBTQ artists and the band BAILEN as a headliner. The group raised over $200 for Arts Administrators of Color.
Van Allen and the COMC have big plans lined up. In addition to regular panels, Van Allen has started teaching seminars at universities like New York University about racial discrimination in the music industry.
Van Allen and her team are determined to use their growing platform to create a more accessible entry to the music industry for underrepresented communities. Although they’ve already made a difference to their volunteers and audience members, Yankana said that the collective’s work is a “continuous process” to figure out how to best amplify those voices.
“It’s a tough industry and people won’t tell you secrets,” Braverman said. “But it’s nice having people who are like, ‘I understand your struggle and let’s do this together so we can see the industry in a new way.’”

2020-11-13,AU,India,"Cyrus and Myrtle Katzen Arts Center on Massachusetts Avenue 
Editor's Note: This article appeared in The Eagle's October 2020 virtual print edition.
Before the coronavirus pandemic dominated our lives, people commonly spent a weekend afternoon roaming around an art exhibit. There is much to see and experience for general audiences at an art exhibit, from paintings to installations, sculptures to photographs. 
Museums don’t create themselves, however. The projects are carefully calculated by professionals known as art curators.
Since the AU Museum at Katzen Arts Center opened in 2005, Jack Rasmussen, the museum’s director and curator, has played an important role in how the museum works with the AU community. He said that Katzen was built as a focal point for AU’s campus.
“Our programs were really more directed towards Washington, D.C., and over the past several years, we've been trying to get more and more corporated into the life of the campus, the academic life,” Rasmussen said. 
As a very politically-active university, Rasmussen curates shows that reflect on ideas of identity, social justice and politics. Rasmussen says other museums might be hesitant to show exhibits like this because they court controversy, but the AU community is very receptive and supportive of these debatable shows. 
Though Rasmussen is the only official curator at AU’s museum, he often brings in guest curators to highlight different art experiences. The goal of curators and museums, Rasmussen said, should be to recontextualize history, preserve artwork and change culture.
Jordan Amirkhani, a modern and contemporary art history professorial lecturer, said that art galleries do a good job of “hiding the labor that goes into the construction and organization of an exhibition.” 
“It's supposed to look effortless, and that's because curators are responsible for communicating a very clear visual experience for a viewer, for an audience member, for a museum-goer,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani also works as an independent art curator, focusing on living artists, especially female artists of color and female artists in general. She is curating an exhibit for the Atlanta Biennial at the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center, which will debut in February 2021. 
“The word curator comes from the Latin ‘to care,’ and that is something that I think about a lot in my own work, that you are, in a way, a kind of caretaker or steward of artwork and art objects in an art institution,” Amirkhani said. 
Amirkhani and the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center thought they might have to cancel the Altana Biennial. Once they decided not to cancel it, she said it was still difficult to curate the exhibit. Armirkhani used Zoom and FaceTime to see the artists’ pieces that would be in her collection.
“So much of being a curator is being in artists’ studios and seeing work in-person, in real-time,” Amirkhani said. “And, that opportunity was taken [away] from me, and it was really difficult to put together a show with the absence of being able to be in Atlanta.”
Rasmussen also adapted by moving his most recent exhibits online, including the series entitled “Contested Space.” Every presidential election cycle, Rasmussen presents exhibits that address some of the most prominent issues leading up to the election.
Photographer Edward Burtynsky’s “Water,” a series that took five years to complete, features in the exhibit. It captures humans’ relationship with water, including in Canada, Iceland and India.
According to AU’s website, “Water” was previously “curated by Russell Lord, Freeman Family Curator of Photographs, for the New Orleans Museum of Art in 2013.”
“You can get drawn down into just the minute level, and it just holds together all the way down to the almost microscopic. It’s an incredible experience to see these in person,” Rasmussen said about Burtynsky’s series.
Burtynsky echoed Rasmussen’s thoughts about his work, saying the online format is not ideal for viewing his photographs. 
“It's not the experience that you want. You want to stand in front of these prints,” Burtynsky said. “You can go in and put your face six inches away from the picture, and it doesn't fall apart. Everything that is still there, it's readable as information.”
Both Rasmussen and Amirkhani are adjusting to these different times while engaging with topics on identity and contested issues leading up to the election. 
“It has to be relevant to what's going on in the world,” Rasmussen said. “Sometimes, that's the job of the curator for the museum is to provide the context in which you can understand what you're seeing in terms of today.”

2021-04-10,AU,India,"Nikki Randhawa and Simrnjit Seerha met outside their freshmen dorm halls in their first year at American University. Seerha dropped her One Card and Randhawa picked it up for her. They began talking and found out they shared a cultural and religious identity; they are both part of the small Sikh student population at AU. 
Now, as seniors, they are the president and vice president, respectively, of one of AU’s newest clubs: the Sikh Student Association.
Randhawa and Seerha see SSA as a space for Sikh students to feel less isolated and alone on AU’s campus and a place where they can connect with other people of similar backgrounds, experiences and values.
“I think even having a group of three to four people makes all the more difference, because you know that when you get together with this group, there's a sense of shared identity,” Seerha said. “And that is so helpful, especially when you're going to a predominantly white school.""
SSA became an official club last spring, but its roots go back further. 
Deep Kaur, an alumna of AU who is returning to pursue her master’s in international relations, was a vital part of SSA’s beginnings. As a Sikh student at AU, Kaur missed being surrounded by people who shared her same religious and cultural identity. 
Kaur said that former President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 was a crucial time for her as an undergraduate student. It made her realize the importance of having a community to turn to in a time of such confusion and chaos. 
“That was a moment where I was like we really need to have an SSA,” Kaur said. “We need to have these open spaces and places where, as students, we can talk about what's bothering us, how are we being affected and also just [talk] about things in general that happen at AU.”
At predominantly white institutions like AU, it can be hard for students of color to find their community without a designated organization. Clubs like SSA that create a community based around shared cultural experiences and religious beliefs can make the transition into college and away from family less isolating for students, Kaur said.
""When you live away from home, it can be kind of tough to find your group of people,” Kaur said. “Especially for people who might be... not so used to being in a crowd where there’s more non-Indian people or more Caucasian people rather than people of their own community.""
Kaur began hosting weekly meetings in the library to gather AU’s small Sikh population and talk about their culture and religion. The meetings were based around a structured program developed by an SSA at a university in California that facilitated discussions about Sikhi and specific issues Sikh students face on campus. 
The goal of the program was to help Sikh students eventually create their own official SSA. As sophomores, Randhawa and Seerha attended some of these weekly meetings.
Kaur graduated from AU in December 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, before SSA became an official club. She said that, as a graduate student, she would “definitely love” to connect with AU’s SSA.
“I really am excited for them to continue this work and I really hope I get to be a part of it,” Kaur said. 
This semester, SSA is hosting weekly virtual Gurbani Veechar on Wednesdays at 3 p.m. where they discuss interpretations of the Kirtan Sohila, a group of sacred texts written by three Sikh Gurus, over Zoom. They also co-hosted an event with the South Asian Student Association on March 4 called the Farmers Protest Teach-In, which included discussions about the history and the current day issues related to farmers’ protests in India.
As of right now, SSA is small — most meetings are attended by the four members of the executive board and one or two other people — but Randhawa said that she is not focusing too much on the numbers right now. She said she is just proud that they were able to get the club up and running, to begin with, and she hopes that its existence allows Sikh students to feel less isolated at AU.
“What I would hope for in the long run is that Sikh students on campus aren't alienated or isolated, where they can fully have a space to practice our religion and learn more about our religion and the rich history that comes from it,” Randhawa said.
Seerha said that the diversity of South Asian culture calls for more focused groups where students can analyze and talk about their identities in more depth.
“India itself has thousands and thousands of cultures, and each culture is so specific,” Seerha said. “That’s why not only having a SASA is wonderful, but, on top of that, having the Sikh Student Association, where your identity is even more magnified so you can really critically analyze it and understand it.”
Randhawa said that being the president of SSA has involved her learning more about Sikhi and Sikh history on her own. Coming from a Catholic school, she said she knew more about Christianity than she did about Sikhi. And, even now, she said she is still learning about Sikhi every day.
“Coming to Sikhi was actually very comforting and I'm glad that I had that experience of not being able to know much about my cultural-religious identity to now having a good handle of it and how it influences my life currently,” Randhawa said
Seerha said that SSA has been academically stimulating for her as well. AU doesn't offer as much of a variety of courses about South Asia, so Seerha’s work in getting ready for the weekly Gurbani Veechar and events such as the teach-in has been “academically fulfilling,” she said.
Seerha and Randhawa said that their main goal for SSA and a tradition they hope carries on in SSA after they both graduate in May, is engagement with activism. This started with the teach-in with SASA, and they are looking to do more because Sikhi is known for being radical, advocating for human dignity and challenging unjust traditions, they said.
“Sikhi is just rooted inherently in activism and fighting against oppression, injustice,” Randhawa said “I hope that future members of SSA can also focus on that as well because I feel like it's part of our praxis as Sikhs to do so.”

2022-04-12,AU,India,"As American University's coronavirus protocols slimmed this semester, so did the guidelines for clubs. On-campus organizations have taken advantage of the less restrictive guidelines, which lifted food restrictions, made the events timeline request process more flexible and allowed for external guests.
School of Public Affairs and College of Arts and Sciences senior Daniel Cohen is the finance director of AU Club Council and keeps records of the allocation of money to different clubs. Cohen said that the guidelines last semester looked a little different due to the fall 2021 health and safety guidelines released by the University, but as the University’s guidelines changed so did AUCC’s. 
“With the food guidelines, there's no longer a restriction on the food type or serving style,” Cohen said. “Last semester due to COVID we required that clubs had pre-packaged food just because they had to abide by those guidelines put in place by the university.”
CAS senior Shahad Mohieldin is the chair for AUCC and oversees the club consultants and makes sure there is communication between them and their respective clubs. Mohieldin said that last semester, there was a guideline where if an event required food, then it would be considered a “complex event” which meant that clubs would have to put in a budget request five weeks before their event for it to be approved by AUCC. Now due to the updated food guidelines, clubs can put in a request for food three weeks before the event. 
“One of the reasons why we changed this is because of updated guidelines, but we also wanted it to be easier on clubs for them to plan out their events effectively and make sure their food was available, and we realized last semester working with clubs that having a five-week deadline for food complicated things,” Mohieldin said.
The third guideline included inviting external camps for events. Clubs could bring in guests starting from Feb. 15 once they have completed the AU COVID-19 attestation form which confirms proof of vaccination. 
Recently, the Black Student Union took advantage of the new food guideline to plan an immersive cultural catered experience. 
On Feb. 22, BSU hosted an event called “Taste of the Tropics” during Founders Week, which was co-sponsored by AU Caribbean Circle and Student Government.
Zari Scott, a School of Communication junior and the personal relations deputy director for BSU, said that the event was a more enriching experience because they were able to serve food. Students were able to explore the entire diaspora that is the Caribbean trying foods from different countries. 
“My family is from the Caribbean,” Scott said. “Both my parents were born and raised there, so it's just always nice to get to teach people about your culture in a way that doesn't necessarily feel like you're teaching.”
Scott said she thinks that the guidelines issued this semester will really help get freshmen more engaged and bring back that sense of community that upperclassmen experienced before the pandemic. 
Nanaama Idun, a sophomore in CAS, attended the Love of the Diaspora cultural event March 27 as a part of a joint effort from BSU and the AU NAACP. Food was provided at this event for those who attended. 
“The Love of Diaspora event was meant to recognize and celebrate the diaspora that makes up the Black community,” Idun said. “And food — like many cultures in the world — is a huge part of the culture, since the diaspora is so expansive.”
Idun said that the event was a success and helped bring the AU Black community closer together thanks to the less strict guidelines surrounding food from AUCC.
“Food brings communities together, no matter where you're from or what you like to eat. Food is a pillar of what you think about unity,” Idun said. “That’s why the Love of Diaspora event helped bring us all together and celebrate the food that has ties to who we all are.”
Looking ahead, the AU Bhangra Crew is hosting an event on April 15 called the AU Bhangra Bash. A DJ, catered food and performances will be provided free for AU students to attend with valid AU ID and a vaccination card. 
Ajuni Takkar, a CAS junior and choreographer for AU Bhangra CREW, helped plan this event as a part of the e-board. 
“When it comes to cultural events, it is especially important to have food to share a piece of your heritage with others,” Takkar said. “We look forward to bringing catered food from Cafe of India in Tenleytown, so the updated AUCC guidelines this semester have allowed us to also support a local Indian-owned business.”
Takkar said that the club experienced an increase in involvement, which is why it was important for e-board to host an event to boost inclusivity and interest for the fast-growing club. 
“The new guidelines are an improvement, so it’s nice to be able to look at Cafe of India’s menu and not worry about food being individually wrapped,” Takkar said. “We were less focused on food restrictions when preparing for this event and so we avoided spending time on a potential added layer of restriction.” 
Takkar said they put in a lot of effort to organize the event, so hopefully providing food will increase attendance at the upcoming bash. 
“Overall, we are really trying to increase our presence on campus because other nearby schools have a huge Bhangra club,” Takkar said. “We’ve tried to grow and diversify our organization, so having a local cafe cater our event will help with engagement and spread more awareness about the existence of the AU Bhangra Crew.” 
Scott also mentioned how the new regulations will help encourage community building and engagement with clubs as things were before the virtual switch due to the pandemic. 
“I think these new sanctions … bring back that pre-COVID atmosphere that I know a lot of the upperclassmen had,” Scott said. “That's been my whole goal, to give the younger students the opportunities that I know I had and enjoyed and were the reasons why I chose to stay at AU.

2022-09-01,AU,India,"""My Beloveds"" by Storme Webber
Brutal colonialist practices and white supremacy have suppressed the culture and relationship of Black and Indigenous communities for centuries, leaving many members from younger generations disconnected from their mother tongue, lineage and dual identity. 
To strengthen kinship and acknowledge Black and Indigenous identities, the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) “Ancestors Know Who We Are” exhibit affirms how Western standards of isolating identities can’t diminish or silence the unified and outspoken connection of the Black-Indigenous community.  
Anya Montiel, curator of the exhibit, brought together the works of six Black-Indigenous women artists who reflect various aspects of intersectionality, the harms of patriarchal oppression and standards and the solidarity between Black and Indigenous communities as they fight for collective liberation. 
The exhibit features artwork from various mediums and includes essays from Black-Indigenous scholars and activists reflecting on topics such as art in relation to gender and identity and Black and Native Futurity — the need to reclaim stolen land and prevent alienation from one’s culture to secure a future for Black and Indigenous communities. 
“In the United States, we often discuss Black and Native peoples as separate groups and peripheral to white people,” said Fariza Nzinga, a teacher-scholar in residence at the Bell Hooks Institute at Berea College. “This narrow framing ignores shared histories, erases blended families, keeps relatives isolated and alienated from one another and falls into the trap of centering the white experience.” 
Moira Pernambuco, one of the artists featured, has illustrated Black and Native academic theory through her photography series ""Black Boy Beautiful, Black Boy Vulnerable,” depicting the harmful effects of white patriarchal standards on Black-Indigenous men. 
""Troy"" by Moira Pernambuco

In the photograph “Troy,” a man is depicted leisurely sleeping on a bed with his arms crossed over his eyes, displaying a peaceful vulnerability. As a result of targeted police violence and harsh standards for masculinity, putting one’s guard down can be dangerous and life-threatening for Black men. 
Kyle T. Mays, an Afro-Indigenous writer and scholar, reflects on this photograph and relates it to his personal experience: “Looking at the photograph of ‘Troy,’ I am reminded of being told as a young boy that ‘sleep is the cousin of death’... Seldom do we tell Black men to rest and relax, to proactively take care of our bodies and minds. ‘Troy’ reminds us that the act of self-care is, in truth, a masculine act and necessary to the path of resistance.” 
Pernambuco’s photos resist patriarchal standards created by white supremacy and seek to document the history of Black-Indigenous people, since their history has been destroyed by colonizers. Pernambuco said in an interview with the NMAI how she doesn’t know who her African ancestors are and therefore asserts the existence of Black-Indigenous people through her art. 
The artwork of Pernambuco and others displays the importance and necessity of unity across communities to fight for social justice and liberation from white supremacy. “Ancestors Know Who We Are” shows how although history has been erased and stolen from Black-Indigenous people, creators have used art to dismantle Western definitions and hierarchies of race while also celebrating their multiple identities.

2022-11-07,AU,India,"Resilience is something the Washington Wizards Head Coach Wes Unseld Jr. is seeing from his team this year. 
On Oct. 20 at Capital One Arena, some hopeful words were shared from both players and coaches as practice was wrapping up.
“Basketball is about learning. We learn from a mistake and try our best not to repeat it,” said Unseld, who has now begun his second year as the head coach of the District's NBA team. 
It is always a good sign when the practice right after a win is focused on fixing mistakes, but it is an even better sign when the best player is on the same page.
“There is a lot we can do better and there is always room for improvement,” said Bradley Beal, who is now a 10-year veteran for the Wizards.
The team started regular season play at Indianapolis on Oct. 19 with a seven-point win over the Indiana Pacers (3-4). Every win comes from a recipe, and sometimes, the recipe can be quite simple.
“It’s all about how we start and finish quarters,” Unseld said. “We want to put our players in the areas of the floor in which they can excel and be resilient.” 
One of these players seems to be Daniel Gafford. 
“For me, it’s about being at the right place at the right time and just playing smart,'' said the 6-foot-10-inch forward center. 
When asked about his defensive approach, Gafford simply answered with: “Moving my feet, not reaching and not getting mentally fatigued.”
In the NBA world, the Wizards seem to always find themselves in the underdog position and are usually overlooked by other squads. But on Oct. 20, there was an energy in the air, the type that encourages players to be more focused, locked-in and bought in. 
Beal may have said it best:
“At the end of the day, we are pros like everyone else. We can’t worry about other peoples’ opinions. We are a young team and have the opportunity to grow, as long as we stay poised and don’t get rattled.”
The very next day, the Wizard's 4th quarter performance brought them a 102-100 victory over the Chicago Bulls (5-4) in their home opener. Maybe this year the Wizards’ key ingredients will just come down to resilience, moving their feet and poise.

2022-11-09,AU,India,"The American University South Asian Student Association (SASA) hosted its annual cultural event, Jalwa, on Nov. 5 at the Washington College of Law, bringing together students and alumni for a night of talent and fun. The night was themed “Lights, Camera, Action,” complete with movie posters and film decor, setting the stage for a lineup of performers.
From dances and songs to a fashion show showcasing traditional South Asian attire, there was something for everyone in the audience to enjoy and applaud. The full house audience was buzzing with anticipation to see the performances.
“We’re here to offer the stage to people in the community to show off their talents – and of course, dress up and eat good food,” said Vishwa Bhatt, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences and co-emcee for the night along with Sriman Thangaraj, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. 
Students in SASA who participated in Jalwa are from different parts of the South Asian Diaspora, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Maldives, said Bhatt and Thangaraj in their opening remarks. The event was open to SASA alumni and other AU community members who wanted to partake in celebrating South Asian culture.
“I think the food stands out, and I think that’s a big part of why non-Brown people or non-Asian people come, which is good. I think the music is also why,” said SPA sophomore Anusha Mathur, a member of SASA and performer in the fashion show portion of Jalwa.  
Jalwa began with buffet-style food from Spice-6 catering, which according to the restaurant’s Instagram, is “a fast-casual take on Indian cuisine.” 
The night also hosted a diverse group of student performers. The first performance was AU Agni — the first premier fusion dance team on campus — followed by Chaytanya Kumar, who showcased a rap performance. K-District, AU’s K-pop dance team, danced to three songs at the event, and SASA’s co-president Darshi Ambani performed a solo dance. A duet in Tamil, the native language of parts of southern India and Sri Lanka, was performed by Tejasvi Hariharan and Arpitha Sistla. Meera Swaminathan, a member of AU Agni, also performed a solo dance to a Tamil song. 


The final singer of the night was Kruttika Gopal accompanied by Hanish Immanuel, who sang an emotional ballad. To round out the performances, American Bhangra Crew — which is open to Punjabi and non-Punjabi students — kept the energy high with a dance that got the entire crowd cheering. 
Students within SASA also got the opportunity to show off their traditional South Asian attire in a fashion show. The crowd cheered on participants as they walked in pairs across the stage to a song of their choice.
Jalwa concluded with an open dance floor where attendees were able to come together and dance to a combination of South Asian and American music. 
Each group and performer at the Jalwa celebration put hard work into ensuring the diverse talents would educate event attendees on South Asian culture and provide a positive, fun experience. 
“I had a lot of fun at Jalwa, and felt a strong sense of community tonight,” said Mahita Dasu, a sophomore in the School of Communication.

2022-11-09,AU,India,"I'm reporting for the life section about the intersection between consumer aesthetics, climate change, and low government action for climate change. 
Artistic interpretations of Yellow Stone’s geysers, Zion’s canyons, monarch butterflies and magic mushrooms have exploded onto the rack in big-name stores while climate disaster worsens and 58 percent of Americans believe policymakers aren’t doing enough.
Parks Project is the nonprofit arm of the National Parks Service (NPS), sustainably creating and producing fashion to preserve underfunded national parks. The project was joined by big-name outdoor brands such as REI, Pendleton and L.L. Bean to increase NPS profit.
Outside of the Parks Project, corporations such as Target are increasing consumer attention toward environmental aesthetics by launching mycology-themed and “Save the Earth” clothing lines.
John Paul Mejia, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences and national spokesperson for Sunrise Movement, said this trend demonstrates a degree of environmental awareness and an aesthetic appreciation that is intrinsic to humanity.
“Those of us at the bottom of the economic ladder or have neighborhoods that are slashed by the inequalities of race and class have differing accessibility to nature,” Mejia said. “I think that fashion and a yearn for nature speaks to some of that inaccessibility.”
The biodiversity within nature has inspired fashion for centuries: from European textiles to Islamic geometric patterns and Indigenous American tapestries, each conveys earthly reverence. Trending vintage illustrations of nature harken to a hopeful time without the looming presence of climate change.
“Being able to imagine and articulate a future that is good is something that’s sometimes hard to do,” Mejia said. “That requires a lot of labor, a lot of hope and the absence of cynicism. Those things are hard to do when all you see is bad days all around.”
Trendsetting and statement pieces come with caveats. In the process of bringing designer looks to the public, fast fashion companies break labor rights and cause extreme environmental degradation. 
Meanwhile, sustainable fashion negates environmental impact but is often too expensive for the average consumer. The average cost for a Parks Project t-shirt or tank top is $31.97, and REI charges an average of $42.00 for a Parks Project item.
Michael Taffe, a junior in CAS, saw an Instagram advertisement for the Parks Project in 2020 and has been wearing their gear since. He said he loves the retro design and feels the purpose is worth the price.
“It makes me feel a little bit better about it because I know it’s going to a good cause,” Taffe said.
Alongside preserving parklands, Taffe believes businesses using parkland imagery should acknowledge the lives and homes stolen to build national parks.
“I think the Indigenous story needs to be told,” Taffe said. “Reparations should be part of these brands if they truly want to be equitable.”
Few Americans are aware of the national parks’ brutal history. To mold American landscapes into untouched wilderness, the Federal Government authorized the displacement of its Indigenous inhabitants. Without cruelty, illustrations of the undiscovered wild would not be present for marketing.
In September 2022, NPS partnered with American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes, Alaska Natives entities and the Native Hawaiian Community for future national parkland management.
Molly Stites, president of Wonk Trade, a student-run trading and exchange post at AU, and a third year in the School of Communication, said too many Americans romanticize national parks as the paradigm of sustainability.
“I love national parks, but there are many other levels of sustainability and environmental justice that people should be focusing on,” Stites said. “It’s really important to dig deeper into that and open your eyes up to thrifting.”
Scrolling through Parks Project apparel and searching the racks of REI, the wandering eye is drawn to retro screen presses of parklands and scientific sketches of the natural world. New and recycled interpretations of the Earth stand in sharp contrast to the everyday images of climate disaster.
While these illustrations provide nostalgia for a time without the eclipsing presence of climate change, recognizing the origins of the land motivates climate action.
“This nostalgia,” Mejia said, “Whether it is aesthetic or political, helps us imagine different moments in which social movements and artists and other folks who have employed their political and artistic agency have reshaped the country.”

2022-12-09,AU,India,"To uplift Indigenous artists and highlight stories about Indigenity from their perspective, the National Museum of the American Indian hosted its annual Native Cinema Showcase from Nov. 18 to Nov. 25. 
Future Focused Shorts
This compilation of short films highlighted animated and kid-friendly stories focused on the future generations of Indigenous communities. 
“Evan’s Drum,” directed by Ossie Michelin, is a heartwarming story that follows Amy Winters as she tries to teach her son Evan the lost Inuit practice of drumming. Winters leads a drumming troupe in Labrador City, near the Quebec border, which has shrunk in membership from 18 to five in the preceding years. The film depicts endearing scenes of Winters and her son making a drum and illustrates how family bonds are strengthened through the sharing of traditions. The short concludes with a powerful shot of Winters and her son playing their new drums on a serene beach, showing their gratitude for nature by offering the gift of music in return. 
While some films highlighted how generational knowledge is being revived, others depicted the reality of Indigenous people trying to teach the meaning behind their art to others outside of their culture. “Mis Manos Tejedoras,” directed by Río Castañeda, focuses on a Mayan artist weaving huipils, or woven shirts, to sell in a touristy town square. The film’s sparing use of dialogue allows its colorful animation and intimate portrayal of the artistic process to speak for itself. Idyllic images of the artist creating a beautiful piece are starkly contrasted with reality when a tourist doesn’t purchase the huipil when the artist won’t bargain for a lower price. 
Twisted Tales
This series of shorts depicts reimagined traditional Indigenous stories and satire, documenting rituals and cultural commentary through a unique lens. “Nalujuk Night,” directed by Jennie Williams, portrays a Labrador Inuit New Year’s tradition in which men dress up as Nalujuit, representations of heathen spirits, and knock on people’s doors to determine who has been good that year. If children have misbehaved, they are chased through the snow by the menacing figures dressed in animal bone and fur. The film exaggerates the chase scenes, editing them with intense traditional throat singing and thriller-like editing to poke fun at the children’s reactions to the Nalujuit. 
These twisted tales also make comedic jabs at modern issues such as white guilt and cultural appropriation. In the short “My First Native American Boyfriend,” directed by Joey Clift, Emily, a white woman, confesses to her first Native boyfriend Johnny every microaggression she’s ever made, including dressing up as Pocahontas when she was five and calling Rihanna her spirit animal when she was in junior high. Emily also asks Johnny if he's a werewolf like the ones in “Twilight.” Johnny begins to get annoyed, but Emily later reveals that she asked that question because she is a werewolf and morphs into one, resulting in Johnny breaking up with her. The blatant microaggressions and impertinence from Emily satirically displays the consequences of white people thinking that Native people are obligated to alleviate their guilt. 
“Portraits From A Fire”
This enticing and emotional film directed by Trevor Mack follows a 16-year-old boy named Tyler who loves to make movies and put on shows for his community. Upset by his distant father who won’t support his art, Tyler confides in a teenager named Aaron who convinces Tyler to make a movie about his deceased mother. The movie shifts between reality and Tyler’s visions of his mother, interrupted by alarming glitches in the screen in which his mother physically appears for seconds at a time. Ending in a heart-wrenching reconciliation with his father, “Portraits from a Fire” powerfully depicts love and loneliness from a teenager’s perspective. 
Imagining the Indian  
“Imagining the Indian,” directed by Aviva Kempner and Ben West, is a documentary-style feature tracing the fight to abolish Indigenous mascots and unpacking the effects of non-Indigenous people’s perceptions of Native Americans. 
The documentary unpacks the symbolism of Indigenous mascots in sports, from how football is a territorial game to the origin of the word mascot from the Spanish word “mascota,” which translates to “pet.” The occupational range of Indigenous people interviewed includes poets, curators, musicians, athletes, professors, actors and activists, and is a testament to how the fight against Native mascots is interdisciplinary and has negative implications for fields besides sports. 
In one poignant scene, Suzan Shown Harjo, an author, activist and scholar of Cheyenne/Hodulgee Muscogee descent, says of ending mascotting, “You’re trying not just to end the disdainful imagery, but eliminate what has taken the place of you in other people's eyes and the reason they can’t see you as a human being”. 
From informational documentaries to comedic shorts to moving features, the 2022 Native Cinema Showcase showed the importance of consuming art created by Indigenous people and the power of art to dismantle stereotypes and monoliths.

2022-12-12,AU,India,"""Marabar"" under construction in early November
From the Newsstands: This story appeared in The Eagle's November 2022 print edition. You can find the digital version here. 
In 1981, artist Elyn Zimmerman was commissioned by the National Geographic Society to design a sculpture for the plaza of its D.C. headquarters. More than three decades later, Zimmerman returned to what she thought would be the permanent site to re-imagine her million-pound piece before i is moved nearly four miles to American University’s campus.
Zimmerman coordinated her installation with architect David Childs, who led the earlier renovation of the Society’s headquarters. Zimmerman said it was especially unusual for a relatively young, female artist to be chosen for such a large-scale project.
“I didn’t realize that the piece would become as popular as it was and that it would lead, for me, to a lot of other commissions,” Zimmerman said. 
The extent of the sculpture's popularity became evident after its continued existence was threatened. In 2019, National Geographic filed for approval to renovate the plaza of its headquarters. The plans included a new main entry pavilion and a rentable rooftop garden, but no “Marabar.”
Dismantling the purportedly permanent artwork generated significant backlash from the broader artistic community. Museum leaders, architects and art critics sent dozens of complaint letters express- ing their desire that “Marabar” be preserved.
“It made me feel valued and that the work was valued by people who had experience in the art world or architecture,” Zimmerman said.
Public outrage culminated in an organized cam- paign to save the piece, launched by the Cultural Landscape Foundation.
“I was very grateful to the Cultural Landscape Foundation,” Zimmerman said. “They reached out to me and they said ‘Can we help you,’ and I didn’t know how to approach getting this situation remedied.”
National Geographic eventually agreed not todismantle “Marabar'' — committing rather to fund its removal, transportation and installation some- where else. The Society considered Canal Park, lo- cated approximately a block away from the Navy Yard metro station. However, Zimmerman did not think the expansive park landscape was conducive to her piece. 
“It was just a big open space, and it didn’t have any context,” Zimmerman said. 
After visiting various potential properties, Zimmerman chose a spot across the street from the Katzen Arts Center, where the structure will be visible from Ward Circle. Zimmerman said Canal Park was so open that it felt vulnerable, whereas the smaller and tree-lined site on AU’s campus offered some protection.
In its original iteration, “Marabar” consisted of fractured granite boulders surrounding the perimeter of a 60-foot rectangular reflecting pool. Three of the boulders had polished faces mirroring each other, giving the impression that they were once a single monolithic form. Zimmerman compared her design to geodes — rock structures lined with minerals that are often cut open and polished.
The name “Marabar” originates from fictional caves in E.M. Forster’s “A Passage to India.” Zimmerman said Forster’s description of the caves stuck with her and reminded her of real-world caves she saw during her own visit to India. It was seeing these intricate chambers carved out of solid rock that first inspired Zimmerman to sculpt.
“You discover something, and it sort of sets you off,” Zimmerman said. “I feel like I went to India, I was a painter — I came out of there and all I wanted to do was make stone sculpture.”
“Marabar’s” boulders have already been removed from the plaza at the National Geographic Society. There were safety concerns, both for the relatively fragile polished stones and for whoever was tasked with moving the piece, but Zimmerman said the removal went off brilliantly and referred to the people who performed it as heroes.
Returning to the project after nearly four decades is bittersweet, Zimmerman said. Given its site-specific nature, certain elements of the sculpture’s design will be reconfigured to fit the new location. “Marabar” will be renamed to reflect the changes.
The adapted structure will be titled “Sudama,” after one of the elaborate Indian caves that inspired Forster’s fictionalization. “Sudama” not only pays homage to the original name, but relates to Zim- merman’s own artistic journey.
""The reason I started working with rock and with granite in particular was that I had gone to India in 1976, spent four months there and I visited a number of these sites,” Zimmerman said.
Construction is underway across from Katzen Arts Center to prepare the site for the “Sudama” installation. The installation and landscaping is anticipated to be completed no later than spring 2023, according to University spokesperson Jasmine Pelaez.
“I was very nervous about something possibly going wrong ... things being damaged,” Zimmer- man said. “But I see that the people that are engaged, working on it are very capable and everybody wants the same positive experience at the end.”

2023-02-07,AU,India,"When notorious Communications, Legal Institutions, Economics, and Government major Sam Siegal raised his hand for the third time in GOVT-110, freshman Cora Burke could barely contain her excitement. She sat up straighter and listened intently, mentally rehearsing how she would relay whatever off-topic drivel he was about to disgorge later to her roommate. Maybe it would be something inconsequential about a founding father or a long-winded story that inexplicably brought up his dad’s boat. Maybe she would even get lucky, and he would somehow slip a reference to bitcoin into the discussion about the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. 
Before she could run through the complete list of possibilities, tragedy struck; Sam made a creatively engaging comment that was relevant to the required reading without inserting any unwarranted, extraneous commentary. 
“I couldn’t believe my ears,” teaching assistant Lauren Meany said. “He didn’t even correct former U.N. Ambassador professor Skelton’s response despite the fact that she’s a certified woman.”  
Much to his classmates and professor’s surprise, Siegal quietly took notes for the rest of the lecture. That’s right: he didn’t ask any follow-up questions that had no correlation to the original question, and he abstained from checking Elon Musk’s Twitter account for the entire 23 minutes left in class. 
News of this development has taken American University by storm, with many students calling into question all they held dear. Although the notorious CLEG major denied The Seagle’s request for an interview on the grounds that he doesn’t want anything messing with his 2040 presidential campaign, his roommate Phillip Levin was convinced otherwise after an offer of one warm cookie from Subway.  
“I don’t really care about what Sam did in his gov class.” Levin said, midway through the aforementioned cookie. “But could someone please tell him to refill the Brita?”  
Regardless of whether Sam ever refills that Brita, he did redefine – even if only for one shining minute – the abilities of a male CLEG major. 
Editor’s Note: Sam Siegal was recently named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year for groundbreaking developments in humanity. He is on the shortlist for a Presidential Medal of Freedom and is rumored to be the frontrunner.

2023-02-08,AU,India,"Maddy Park choked back tears, her voice mixed with sadness and anger, as she spoke passionately about her grandmother during a student-led candlelight vigil for the victims of the Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay shootings Feb. 1.
The senior in the School of Public Affairs and the advocacy and outreach coordinator of the Korean Student Association spoke about how her grandmother explored Manhattan, New York in her adulthood and now avoids doing so, fearing for her well-being. 
“It pains me to see how limited my independent grandma has become due to a lack of safety and immense fear our community is suffering from,” Park said. 
Park’s voice then swelled. 
“Our communities do not feel safe, our elders do not feel safe, we do not feel safe, but we deserve to feel safe,” Park said.
The event, hosted by Project Pengyou and the Korean and Hindu Student Associations, was a space for the American University community to gather, process and heal as well as remember the victims of gun violence from the Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay shootings. 
On Jan. 21, a gunman opened fire at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, California, killing 11 and injuring nine. Two days later, another mass shooting occurred in Half Moon Bay, California, which left seven dead and one critically injured. The victims of the shootings were of Asian and Latino descent and occurred during Lunar New Year, a holiday celebrated by many Asian cultures. 
The vigil at the Woods Brown Amphitheater started with the event organizers –– Park from AU’s Korean Student Association, Vera Tsang from AU Project Pengyou and Divya Chhotani from the Hindu Students Association –– introducing themselves, followed by a two-minute moment of silence to honor the victims. After the organizers spoke, they opened the floor to any of the nearly 100 attendees who wished to share. 
The Asian American Student Union posted a statement on Instagram following the California shootings. 
“These tragedies, among many others, have made it clear that Asian American and Pacific Islander struggles in the U.S. have been ignored for far too long –– that our collective pain, generational trauma, our grief, our humanity, has been set aside and brushed under the rug by the insidious fabric of institutional racism,” the post read. “It is not radical to claim the right to live in safety and peace. It is not radical to want a better life for family and kin, to immigrate and reside in this country, or to continue to enjoy a rich culture filled with affinity and community. It is not radical to be visible and it is not radical to want to be alive.” 
AASU executive board members called for the University administration to stand up and speak out with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. 
Chyna Brodie, Student Government president and a senior in SPA, emphasized the sentiment of cross-community solidarity as hate crimes continue to occur, such as the recent killing of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who was beaten to death by police officers in Memphis, Tennessee. 
“It’s beyond important to have cross-community solidarity at American University because our community is multi-dimensional and it encompasses a lot of different communities,” she told The Eagle. “At the end of the day, you can say you support a lot of different communities, but if you’re not showing up for them, then it really doesn’t matter.”
While the vigil provided a space for AU students to heal, some of the event coordinators said organizing the vigil caused them an immense emotional burden.
Chhotani, a junior in the College and Arts and Sciences, said putting together the vigil “took away” from the fact that the event organizers were students and that the Asian American and Pacific Islander community was grieving. 
“It’s very stressful that it’s on the AAPI community at the school to take initiative when it shouldn’t even have to be us, and other communities on this campus should be stepping up just as much as we would step up for them in times of need,” she said.
Park said she, Chhotani and Tsang planned the vigil because there wasn’t a space in D.C. for the AU community to process what happened. 
The University sent an announcement to students from California regarding the shootings on Jan. 23, but did not send out campus-wide communication.
On Jan. 25, President Sylvia Burwell sent out an email about the work AU is doing against “hate and bias incidents in society,” specifically antisemitism. Burwell wrote that AU’s investigation on the swastika graffiti found in Anderson Hall last September was closing. The email did not mention anything regarding the California shootings. 
Elizabeth Deal, the assistant vice president for community and internal communication, wrote in an email to The Eagle that the shootings were “tragic.” She stated that “the Office of Campus Life reached out to AU students who come from the surrounding communities to offer support and resources.” 
Regarding the administration’s response to the shooting, Deal wrote that there are multiple factors the University considered before sending out campus-wide communications. 
The University considers questions like “whether the incident occurred on our campus or in the broader D.C. community, if it involves higher education matters or took place on another college campus, or did it directly affect large segments of the AU community, among other areas,” Deal wrote.
While Park acknowledged that other minority communities should be elevated and uplifted, she was shocked that something wasn’t “circulating around what had happened over Lunar New Years.” Because of this, Park said she felt unrepresented and unheard by the administration.
Tsang is the director of education, culture and advocacy for Project Pengyou and deputy of advocacy and outreach for the Korean Student Association. She represented Project Pengyou at the vigil. 
Tsang added the University ignoring Asian American and Pacific Islander issues was “distasteful” on Burwell’s part and that the AU administration had done “an awful job at addressing anything related to AAPI hate.” 
Tsang also mentioned how the University “didn’t do anything” in response to the attack in Aug. 2021 on Sean Lai, a gay and Chinese Georgetown University alumnus, by an AU graduate student in the Kogod School of Business. The AU student was expelled two months later. 
Park said the University released a statement regarding the March 2021 Atlanta spa shootings, but it took more than three days to do so while the Asian American and Pacific Islander community was “severely upset and distraught and disheartened.”
Chhotani also drew attention to how the University has historically responded to anti-Asian threats. Chhotani said the 2021 farmers’ protests caused violence to escalate among different ethnic groups and Hindu communities in the United States. In 2022, Chhotani said there was a “drastic rise of crimes against the Indian community” and no response from the University acknowledging that Indians belong in the Asian American Pacific Islander community. 
Kelly Ma, a sophomore in the School of Communication and president of AASU, was among the 10 speakers at the vigil. In her speech, Ma said she felt “dejected,” but not surprised about the administration’s silence. Ma echoed Park, Tsang and Chhotani’s points and criticized the University for putting the burden on leaders of student organizations to address instances of hate.
“Although we may all feel a sense of hopelessness, anger and sadness, I hope that we can raise our voices in unity to protect our community that we have,” Ma said. “And I hope that we can do justice for the lives that were lost in violence.”
Tsang spoke about being prideful of her Chinese heritage and culture in her speech and because of her deep love for her customs and identity, it was especially difficult to see the recent rise in anti-Asian violence. Tsang said that Lunar New Year, a holiday celebrated in Chinese culture, was “filled with mourning instead of celebration.” Tsang also called out anti-Asian rhetoric surrounding the shooting, the term “Asian-on-Asian crime” and also honored recent hate crime victims of East Asian descent. 
“Everything that’s been happening, all these attacks, these shootings, these deaths, they break my heart,” Tsang said. “To see people like me, people like my friends, like my family get attacked. It breaks my heart.”
Chhotani’s speech, which she called “Being Brown is My Superpower,” detailed her struggles with her racial identity as a child. Chhotani said that as she got older, she slowly began to love and appreciate her identity as an Indian woman. 
“Little me would never imagine how powerful being brown actually is,” she said. In her speech, Chhotani honored murder victims of Indian descent in the United States and demanded justice for them.
Both Tsang and Chhotani ended their speeches by asking the AU community to advocate and stand with the Asian American Pacific Islander community.
Meera Swaminathan, a junior in CAS who spoke at the event, said she was infuriated that the University administration had not made an official statement or helped plan the vigil. 
“But, I think the organizers did a beautiful job,” Swaminathan said. “I’m glad that we have students that care so much to make up for the administration’s lack of support.”
Students struggling with their mental health and the California shootings can reach out to these services on and off campus for additional support:

The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
As wonks across American University’s campus are suffering from stress ulcers in the wake of finals, many look to the greener pastures of summer break for a glimmer of hope. The Office of Campus Engagement recently conducted a survey in an attempt to gauge which factors excite AU students the most about the upcoming break and remind us all of the light at the end of the tunnel. Here are the top seven activities AU students are most excited to do come May 10, most of which were a surprise to precisely no one:    
1. Referring to D.C. as “the city” in their hick hometown. This answer was reported by 28 percent of students.     
My brother in Christ, let's stop pretending Joe Biden is your neighbor; you live in Tenleytown. You are closer to Wegmans than the red line.      
2. Paying under $15 for a shot. This answer was reported by 22 percent of seniors.  
Sure, the bar will have an autographed picture of Rudy Giuliani and only play country/pop sung by neck-bearded tenors, but nothing tastes better than cheap feels! Fair warning, though, some bars will not allow every wandering, babyfaced 19-year-old to slip through the doors, so use that awful fake sparingly. Not every bar values your dollar over their liquor license.  
3. Name-dropping Congress members they briefly interacted with during their Hillternship. This answer was reported by 17 percent of students.    
Cory Booker made eye contact with you at Union Station because you had mustard on your chin, not because you’re the next AOC. Also, the most you’ve ever done to advance your pro-worker agenda was mute the constituent ten minutes into his thirty minute rant about how your moderate democratic state representative is a pawn for ANTIFA.    
4. Cheating on their Georgetown situationship with their hometown situationship. This was reported by 12 percent of students.      
A real Edward versus Jacob moment.      
5. Complaining about their internship. This answer was reported by 9 percent of students.      
What’s more fun than complaining about the classes you’re voluntarily paying a small fortune to take? Complaining about the internship acceptance you literally prayed for! After a grueling nine months of complaining about classes, complaining about an internship will be a breath of fresh air.      
6. Eating a “real” bagel. This answer was reported by 8 percent of students.  
As much as it pains the Seagle to acknowledge the so-called “state” of New Jersey, the people have spoken: there is nothing more important to them than the gluten product they have chosen to define them as a people. This answer wasn’t even a survey option, either. Those watered-down “Italians” abused our “other” section like their terrible fake tans abuse our eyes. 
7. Mansplaining the election for Speaker of the House. This answer was reported by 4 percent of students.      
Our SPA-iest of Eagles are salivating at the mouth to explain to every innocent home friend or unsuspecting younger sibling the historical significance of Kevin McCarthy’s humiliating speaker election. While this event will be months old by the time summer comes around, everyone knows explaining political events aren’t about educating anyone: it’s about that sublime feeling of superiority. And the best part? You don’t even have to be a man to engage in mansplaining. As long as your attitude is pretentious enough, you’re golden.   
Whether your parents are paying for your overpriced apartment in the city or you’re loitering around suburban America and working your part-time high school job: best of luck on your finals and, of course, HAGS.

2009-02-12,AU,Israel,"Two AU clubs on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Students for Justice in Palestine and AU Students for Israel, tabled on the main quad Tuesday on behalf of one cause: Frisbee.
Chelsea Lund, a senior in the School of International Service, brought together many of AU's clubs to support the union of sports and conflict resolution. Ultimate Peace is an organization that promotes peace in the Middle East through Frisbee games.
""[Ultimate Frisbee] is about the team on both sides, supporting each other,"" she said. ""If there's a foul called, you admit it; it's about honesty and it's about working with your teammates and the other team.""
As a member of AU's Ultimate Frisbee team, Lund invited her teammates to play a match at the event, in addition to the several clubs that tabled nearby. OneVoice, an international grassroots movement for negotiation between Palestine and Israel, and AU's Community Action and Social Justice Coalition were also participants.
Most of the clubs at the event participated in activities together previously, but this was the first chance for several of the on-campus clubs focused on  Israel and Palestine issues to co-sponsor a social event, according to Lund.
Rachel Weingartner, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences and a Students for Justice in Palestine member, said the event sounded like a good opportunity. 
Nick Haras, a first-year graduate student in the SIS International Communication program, participated in Students for Justice in Palestine during his four undergraduate years at AU and continues to do so as a graduate student.
""In Lebanon, for example, soccer matches were used prior to the civil war to try to bring Muslim-Christian reconciliation,"" he said. ""Sports allow people to interact with each other and to compete, to get out a lot of energy in a context that doesn't turn violent.""
All the clubs present addressed some aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Lauren Barr, the president of the OneVoice Movement at AU and a sophomore in SIS and CAS, said the OneVoice Movement had not worked with the Ultimate Frisbee team before.
""It's exciting that we've partnered with them, it's kind of fun to cross boundaries that usually aren't related,"" Barr said.
The biggest mishap of the event was a late start, Lund said, but the clubs were able to stay late so students leaving class had a chance to see everything.
""I was excited to see so many people show up for the tabling, that was the part that I thought would be the hardest,"" she said. ""I also got a great Frisbee game going, which was the whole point of the event.""
Lund is also arranging a D.C.-wide Frisbee game March 22 on the National Mall. Club teams and individuals can sign up and pay $10, which will go towards Ultimate Peace.

2009-12-03,AU,Israel,"Julian-Israel Canizares, a junior in the School of Public Affairs, always dreamt of attending a military academy — that is, until he actually went to one.
Canizares spent his freshman year of college at the United States Coast Guard Academy. In addition to schoolwork, Canizares said first-year students were required to participate in military training, athletics and engagement with upper classmen that included memorizing arbitrary pieces of information to be repeated on demand. Canizares was also involved  in extra curricular activities like the glee club.
By the middle of the year, Canizares found all his endeavors were catching up with him. 
“I was having a lot of difficulty juggling academics and military duties,” Canizares said. “I’m much more of a one-track, focus on one thing and really get-it-done [person] than multi-tasking [oriented].”
As Canizares’ grades and athletic performance continued to suffer, an adviser told him that he was in danger of losing his scholarship and his place at the academy.
“It came down to ‘you’ve got to make a decision as to whether or not you’re going to stay at the academy,’” Canizares said.
That is when Canizares made the decision to transfer to a new school.
In last week’s profile of an upset student who is planning to leave AU, sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences Jack Eichner found the university had not met his needs as a student. 
Eichner and Canizares are part of a large group of students who rethink their college choice. In 2005, 7.1 percent of freshmen at 4-year colleges planned to transfer to another school, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. Like Eichner and Canizares, these students wanted to find an institution that would be a better fit.
Canizares found that fit at AU.
 “[AU] suits my interests actually a lot better than the academy,” Canizares said. “I have a lot more freedom to do what I want to do and ... to just pursue social things that I wasn’t able to do at the academy.”
When Canizares was looking for schools to which he could transfer, a strong political science department was one of his main criteria. He hopes now to go into the State Department or join the intelligence community. He joked that one day he might go on to become the president of the United States.
Actually, President Barack Obama did transfer during his college career. The president started at Occidental College and transferred to Columbia University in search of something “more urban and ... more diverse,” according to US News and World Report.
Steve Pemberton, the co-founder and former co-president of national college admission consulting firm Road to College, said that while transferring universities is not uncommon, there are certain challenges that transfer students face.
“It is not uncommon for students to feel isolated and disconnected from the student body at their new school,” Pemberton said. 
Sean Dixon, a senior in CAS, said this was particularly an area of concern for AU’s transfer students commuting to campus.
“American is a school of cliques if you haven’t been there since freshmen year,” Dixon said. “It’s extraordinarily difficult to penetrate the social strata.”
To help with the adjustment AU has recently restructured its Transfer Transitions Orientation Program, according to Assistant Director of New Student Programs Natalie Gempesaw-Pangan. 
An interactive panel discussion with students who have already experienced the transfer process at AU was also added to the program. Those on the panel continue to reach out to the newer students throughout the year in order to help them establish bonds on campus, according to Gempesaw-Pangan. 
“[The director of New Student Programs, Tiffany Sanchez] and I are huge believers and we do agree that when students feel connected they’re more likely to integrate themselves,” Gempesaw-Pangan said. “So it’s as simple as if you have a buddy to go to that student organization meeting, you’re more likely to go as opposed to if you’re going by yourself.”
This January, Gempesaw-Pangan and Sanchez will hold transfer focus groups to assess needs on campus.
During his first year at AU, Canizares lived on Tenley Campus where he made friends he could “hold on to as being new” to AU like him.
“We ended up ... becoming this really, really close community,” Canizares said.
Although he still misses some aspects of the academy, Canizares said he is happy with his decision to come to AU.
“I actually can’t really imagine going to any other school,” Canizares said. “I’ve made some really great friends, taken some really, really interesting classes, learned a lot of things, done a lot of new things ... I’ve met a lot of really great professors who’ve really helped me to figure out what I want to do eventually.”
Canizares said the school has given him the option to pursue interests in art, music and theater. 
“It’s been a great experience overall,” Canizares said.

2010-03-04,AU,Israel,"This week’s column was difficult to write. Not because of the content, of course - but because of what I had to leave out. I could have written this column about the Women’s Initiative’s new venture, the “Vagina Men” campaign (can I start a “Penis Women” counter-campaign?). But alas, I’ve spilled too much ink whining about feminist follies; this column, instead, will address something of actual consequence.
Twice a week, campus ROTC recruits have to wake up early in the morning to engage in physical training, which will prepare them for their eventual deployment. This task would normally be performed on campus, but our esteemed student government has exiled them to Georgetown. The explanation is thus: AU’s official code prohibits funding to any discriminatory organization. And with the military’s official “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy still in place, alas, what are we to do but ban the presence of the U.S. military?
Leaving aside the fact that the U.S. military has done more to make the world safe for gay people than any do-gooder college activist, let me state emphatically that yes, the military’s policy is asinine. Every civilized country on Earth allows for openly gay soldiers, and it’s a shame that our own military has been slow on the uptake. But it makes little sense to punish our perfectly honorable campus recruits for a policy they have nothing to do with. The only people punished by the student government’s policy are our recruits—most of whom oppose “don’t ask, don’t tell,” anyway.
Really, it is a perfect testament to the fact that the student government is filled with kids playing politician that they think that they’re “sending a message to Washington” this way. Washington’s not listening. Those of you in the Student Government ought to figure out what everyone else on campus knows: you’re not important. Leave our recruits alone and get back to doing what you’re supposed to be doing. Some of you, with your inflated egos, might actually get to be members of Congress one day. Right now, you’re just college kids in a student government. Stop trying to send the Defense Department a statement.
Fascinatingly enough, there actually is something that the SG could do about anti-gay campus culture that falls within their proper purview. If it really wants to cut off funding to campus organizations that promote anti-gay policies, I’ve found one that objectively violates this policy: Students for Justice In Palestine.
This week has been “Israel Apartheid Week” on campuses across the country. Groups such as AU’s own Students for Justice In Palestine have taken part in smear campaigns against the—well, I guess I’m supposed to call it the “Zionist entity” this week—instead standing up for a government that is about as friendly to gays as your humble columnist is to feminists. But I have yet to hear a senator propose cutting off funding to Students for Justice In Palestine, despite the fact that there is only one country in the Middle East where gay men can serve openly: Israel. Try holding a gay pride parade in “Palestine” and see if you can get two feet before your life is endangered. There is simply no comparison between the policies of the two governments toward gays.
I’m not saying that the U.S. military’s policy is fair. I’m just saying that if the student government is going to banish the army from campus, we ought to banish Students for Justice In Palestine, too.
Also Women’s Initiative.

2010-11-12,AU,Israel,"Robert Wexler said the best solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be a two-state solution during a speech Wednesday night in the University Club.
A democratic Jewish-Israeli state and a Palestinian state should both exist with internationally recognized borders, “most likely mirroring the 1967 lines with swaps in a way that almost 80 percent of the ‘settlers,’ can be assigned within the internationally recognized borders of Jerusalem,” Wexler said in the Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event.
The former Democratic representative of the 19th District of Florida and current president of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace said one of the major obstacles in solving the conflict is overcoming bias.
“Many of us come with bias, I do, I readily admit that,” Wexler said. “From my 13 years in Congress and six years in the Florida State Senate, I have been deeply committed to the unbreakable bond between the U.S. and Israel.”
The Israeli youth that Josh Halpren, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, met on a visit to the city of Ashkelon were unwilling to change their negative perceptions of Palestinians, Halpren said during the question-and-answer portion of the event.
“There has been a demonization of the other side, in some cases a dehumanization, which is terribly unfortunate,” Wexler responded. “People have developed these ideas because of the experiences they have lived through. We can’t undo those experiences. All we can hope to do is create a political dynamic in which they can see hope.”
Now that the settlement freeze has expired, leaders have returned to discussions over settlements. However, Wexler said settlements were a distraction to the real peace talks that would solve the crisis.
“The moment we have a discussion, the issue of settlements will be cast to the side and will allow [President Barack] Obama, [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas to engage in the real end-of-conflict discussions that need to happen,” he said.
Wexler said a uniting factor between them is that both countries share a common enemy in Iran.
“The national security interests of the state of Israel and the Arab world is essentially identical,” Wexler said. “They share a common thread: extremism in Iran and a nuclear weapons program there, which threatens to ignite a nuclear arms race in the region.”
While the current economic sanctions have done significant damage to Iran, they have not proven whether they are deterring nuclear proliferation, Wexler said. Wexler said Iran felt most vulnerable after witnessing the U.S. defeat the Iraqi army after seven weeks.
“I think we have a very limited time for diplomacy.” Wexler said. “I’m not advocating military action, but you have to put every option on the table because if you don’t, the Iranians will take advantage of it. Remember, the game of chess was invented by the Persians ... they are great manipulators.”

2011-04-12,AU,Israel,"A Student Government resolution recommending AU invest in U.S. companies that are based in or invest in Israel failed after contentious debate April 10.
Even after several revisions, the resolution failed with a vote of 10 senators for, 11 against and seven abstentions. 
Students who supported the resolution said it wasn’t political but rather made financial sense. They felt Israel was a good place to invest because of its strong economic performance during the recession and status as a world creditor, not debtor.
“This is not foreign policy. This is us using our investment money in businesses in Israel,” said College of Arts and Sciences Senator Amy Leazes, the resolution’s sponsor.  
But senators who opposed the resolution felt it was too political.
“It’s wrong for us as the student government body to support such a resolution,” said Class of 2012 Senator Roger Deming. “You can say all you want: ‘This [resolution] to me is just a business transaction.’ But I’m sorry, the Confederate flag is more than a flag.”
Students who are not in the SG voiced their opinions on the resolution during the meeting’s public comment period, before the debate on the legislation.
Former SG President Andy MacCracken, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes investing in U.S. companies that invest in Israel is a sound financial decision. 
“We [AU] have made poor financial decisions in the past. Looking forward, students need to be engaged in how we’re investing our dollars and looking at trends of where it’s most sensible to invest money,” MacCracken said. “Coming out of the financial recession that the world is just recovering from now, Israel is a nation that was least affected.”
Other students disagreed, saying that the economics and politics could not be separated on this issue and that AU support for Israel would be wrong because of Israel’s actions in Palestine.
“I am not interested in AU making financial or institutional profit. I am, on the other hand, very interested in ensuring that the investments that AU does make are in line with socially just and equal principles,” said School of International Service senior Sepideah Mohsenian. “By investing in innovation from Israel, AU is de facto supporting Israeli foreign policy.”
AU spokeswoman Maralee Csellar said AU’s finance office would need to research all funds to determine if the University invests in any companies that invest in Israel.
In 2006, AU’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution saying AU “will not invest directly in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector in Sudan.” The University also notified its investment managers to end any investments in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector.
This resolution is still in effect.

2011-10-11,AU,Israel,"American University is well known for its inclusion and efforts to unify students from a bevy of diverse backgrounds. From athletics to political speakers to the Westboro Baptist Church Counter Demonstration, the AU community comes together to support our entire community. While we each have our own opinions, our campus renowned for our civility and ability to engage in an open dialogue. 
In this light, the students of American University Students for Israel (AUSFI) do not feel it is appropriate to engage in ATV’s upcoming special program focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The format of this program, asking student leaders their opinions, only creates the potential for a hostile environment. 
AUSFI is the umbrella student organization for Israel life on campus, focusing on educating students on the culture and politics of Israeli society. AUSFI embraces the same values as the AU community; we believe in allowing for an open dialogue in a safe and welcoming environment. Unfortunately, ATV’s proposed program does not provide a welcoming and educational environment in which to engage. We encourage students to remain the well-read and educated leaders for which we are constantly singled out. To outline our position in one simple line: We support direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, without preconditions, with final status compromises that result in peace for both parties living together in harmony.
Nothing productive would come of a debate between two student organizations with differing opinions. It is unfair to pit students against each other, especially about a subject many find so personal. At the end of the day, it is up to the leaders of their respective countries to come to a conclusion. What happens within the upcoming weeks regarding Israel and Palestine will certainly be matters of discussion, but not debate.

2011-12-07,AU,Israel,"From sleeping on sidewalks to organizing vigils in McPherson Square, AU students in Occupy AU and other student groups are giving their continued support for the Occupy D.C. movement. Here are what each group is doing to support the Occupy movement.
Community Action and Social Justice Coalition
CASJ is leading AU student engagement in Occupy D.C. The coalition acts as an organizing collective for 14 campus clubs that coordinates independent events and directs interested students to clubs within the coalition, according to Mitch Ellmauer, a junior in the School of Public Affairs. 
CASJ started in the 1960s as an anti-war and anti-draft counseling center and is not funded by AU. CASJ clubs including Movement for Global Justice, Student Worker Alliance and Fair Trade Student Association have had student representation at Occupy D.C.
During the first two weeks of Occupy D.C., CASJ had 10 to 12 students and alumni actively participating together in the events, some of which stayed overnight in sleeping bags at the protests. 
“The point is to try to get people to see and know what’s going on in the city in terms of activism,” said Mary Donoghue, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Participation has lately been on a more individual basis and has been less consistent.
“The thing about Occupy is that it’s trendy, so people will go once or twice then lose interest,” said Rachel Mandelbaum, a junior in the School of International Service.
CASJ will be focusing on student democracy next semester, which would include increased student input in University decision making that goes beyond student government. The coalition hopes to put an elected student with voting power on the Board of Trustees.
Students for Justice in Palestine
While many members of Student for Justice in Palestine have participated in the Occupy movement independently, the group helped organize a vigil Nov. 6 in McPherson Square for the victims of Operation Cast Lead, the 2008-2009 war in the Gaza Strip.
The vigil was not an official Occupy D.C. event, but many D.C. occupiers joined in, Steve Demarest, a junior in SPA, wrote in an email.
SJP also protested Israel’s use of Caterpillar bulldozers during Operation Cast Lead to destroy homes, factories, food and water systems, Demarest said. 
“There is a diverse group of political views within the Occupy movement, but I think the one common thread that unites protesters is opposition to corporate abuse, i.e., putting profit over people,” Demarest said.  
Eco-Sense
Eco-Sense has been advocating for sustainability and environment awareness in the Occupy D.C movement. Members volunteer and engage in political activism on environmental issues on campus and in D.C. A handful of Eco-Sense members were recently involved with the Occupy D.C. movement.
Mandelbaum; Megan Lyle, a sophomore in CAS; and other AU students attended the Anti-Tar Sands Keystone XL rally Nov 6. The rally was not directly a part of Occupy D.C., but many occupiers attended it, Lyle said. 
The protest focused on stopping the construction of the Tar Sands Keystone XL pipeline, which could potentially pollute major water supplies and transport tar sands oil that burn dirtier than other oils, according to Mandelbaum. 
The pipeline would stretch across thousands of miles from Canada, through the continental United States, to Texas to transport unrefined oil, Lyle said. 
American Vegan Outreach
American Vegan Outreach has not been directly involved with Occupy D.C., but numerous AU vegans have joined the Occupy D.C. movement, according to Paige McNamara, a sophomore in CAS. 
The Occupy D.C. Declaration directly mentions opposition to factory farms, a key AVO issue, McNamara said. 
McNamara held teach-ins about veganism at Occupy D.C., offering the platform for discussion on why veganism should be a viable option for all people.
“I hope to be able to introduce the idea of veganism as a tool of liberation, not just for animals but for workers, people, consumers to the people at McPherson,” she said. 
McNamara also said sustainable living practices are a major theme at the Occupy D.C. camp. McNamara said it is only natural that veganism will be the next major discussion at Occupy D.C.
Justice Not Jails
The prison reform advocacy group took part in a march from the McPherson Square to a Wells Fargo bank Dec. 2 to protest the bank’s investment in the GEO Group. Demarest said the GEO Group is a private prison company that cuts costs by assigning one doctor for every 1,300 prisoners at the Rivers Correctional Institute, where many D.C. residents are held.
He saw “a decent amount” of people at the protest.
“Once we got to Wells Fargo, many people spoke about their own thoughts and experiences with private prisons and the prison system in general,” Demarest said. 
College Democrats
College Democrats is one of the largest clubs at AU and has differing opinions when it comes to the Occupy D.C. movement, said Chris Litchfield, president of College Democrats and a junior in SPA and CAS. 
College Democrats agrees with Occupy D.C.’s major issues, but not with the methods the group has proposed for solutions, he said.
One of the major issues that College Democrats has focused on is wealth inequality. The Democratic Party is looking for a more equitable tax structure to help shrink the wealth divide between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, Litchfield said. 
“I think there is still a role to play when it comes to advocacy in government,” he said.
He also said he sees a lot of overlay between the future of the Democratic Party and Occupy participants.
“Occupy is not an arm of the Democratic Party, but moving forward, this will be a very defining time,” Litchfield said. “It is nice to see other people than the Democratic Party talking about these issues.”
On campus, College Democrats hosted a panel on debt negotiation Nov. 30 after the failure of Congress’ Super Committee and plans to host events in the near future focusing on student education of important issues facing the United States and AU.

2012-12-07,AU,Israel,"A candlelight vigil was held on Dec. 4 by the pro-Israel group, J Street U, in memory of the Palestinian and Israeli victims of the recent conflict in Gaza. The event was held in front of the Kay Spiritual Life center. 
Candles were lit in honor of the victims while Ibraheem Samirah, vice president of AU Jewish Voice for Peace, read the names of victims. The list was eight pages long and included six Israeli names along with 107 Palestinian names, according to Damián Fontanez, a member of AU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The names were intentionally scrambled in order to keep focus on the individuals rather than the ethnicity, according to Bradley Harmon, president of J Street U at AU.  
“We are not here to mourn the loss on one side or another,” he said.
J Street U hosted the event after other chapters of the national organization held similar vigils, according to Harmon.
AU Students for Justice in Palestine, AU Jewish Voice for Peace and Christians United for Israel at AU co-hosted the vigil. 
Prayers from the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths were then read in honor of the dead.
“If we can’t come together on this, we can’t come together on anything,” Harmon said.
Students in attendance found inspiration in the prayer service, according to Elana Friedman, a junior in the School of International Service. 
“When I’m at school I don’t pray,” Friedman said, “so it’s nice to remember we can pray for things to get better.”

•i just want you to text me.
•Thirsty girl is on Anderson 6. You guys will have to figure out the rest ;)
•You're such an ass to me. And you're really only nice to me and talk to me when you want some. Why do I still like you so much?
•Yeah, there are guys here who prefer dating to hook ups. We exist I promise. Some of us are actually decent looking by AU standards too. You aren't likely to find a relationship this time of year though--not with finals and winter break about to happen.
•Alcohol = the only thing that will get me through finals.
•I'm a girl liking female accounting major, but you're probably not talking about me :[. Either way, ask her to hang out! There is no girl on campus that would not be flattered if another girl asked her out. Forreals. 
What class do you have with her? Is it intermediate? 
•I'm sick of only having feelings for people who can never know my feelings for them.
••pale nerdy girls with cute faces why do I always date you 
because we're pale, nerdy and cute, of course!
•@LDR help: I'm also miserable in a 3 year LDR and wanting help. I wish I knew you because I am drowning in loneliness and don't know how to make all the pain stop. idk if I can make it until May (when my LDR will finally end and I can be together again with the love of my life). But I know he is worth the wait. I just wish I had more support. All of my friends have local significant others, and they don't understand how hard it is to be apart from your soulmate.
•@$100 eagle bucks that I'm overweight
I can say whatever I want about how much I weight but I can't make you believe me haha. Truth is though that I'm not overweight but I am an advocate for equal representation and for people to not hate on other people because of the way their bodies are.
•i can't get enough of you, baby
@I’m so sick of my friend group here treating me like crap: go to various clubs to meet people. During your first meeting, you might only meet a few people, but if you continue to go to clubs that are relatively active, you will make some new friends :)
•@looking for straight, outgoing guys looking for a real relationship. We exist. Want to meet at the Dav on Wednesday, say around 2:00pm?
•@part of our religious upbringing: yeah, that was my main point. Pre-marital sex is ok, but BC isn't? Still just curious
•Hi, fool here who has booked his life in DC through the 24,
•What am I supposed to do? Say, ""hi will you go out with me in a month?"" I'm planning on asking her out, just when I come back for the spring semester.
•when I said we couldn't be friends I didn't mean it. can we be friends? I miss you.
•1) Saint Paul says absolutely nothing about our modern notion of homosexuality. He talks about prostitutes in the temple/some random person decided to translate a Greek word who's meaning we have no idea of as homosexuality. The acts he condemns are not that of two people of the same gender who love each other
2) Just because Jesus never mentioned it, doesn't mean that people can't draw conclusions from the text
3) So what if Jesus was gay? Is your faith so weak that it would be destroyed by something as trivial as that?
4) It was a joke.
•I'm not someone people notice. I'm so glad he noticed me.
•Awkward library sex. Never, ever again. . .
•Ask me out already!!!!
•my perfectionism is my greatest shortcoming.
•I've friendzoned at least four white girls since Monday. I love me.
•Let me clue you in on something. Olympic weightlifters compete in weight classes. Those in lower classes have to cut weight, but those in the highest class have no incentive to do so, so they eat thousands of calories a day to fuel hours of training per week. There's nothing healthy about it, they sacrifice their health for the sake of their strength and their sport. YOU don't do any of those things, so don't use their commitment as an excuse for your bad habits.
•adderall prices here are absurd! $12 for an XR... wtf?! That's almost as bad as people trying to sell an 8th for $60... #freshmanidiots

2013-02-11,AU,Israel,"Former AU basketball player Charles Hinkle will be blogging throughout the season while playing for Kis-Raba menti Takarek Soproni Kc in the Hungary-A Division. Hinkle’s new squad is just three games out of first place. Hinkle has played in one game since recently joining the team. Submit questions to sports@theeagleonline.com for Hinkle to answer in future blogs.
Szia from Hungary,
After spending 5 months in Istanbul, my career has taken an unexpected turn as I have changed teams and now play for Soproni which is located in Sopron, Hungary. 
So far, my first year as a professional basketball player has been a roller coaster, but one I do cherish. Few have played basketball internationally. But for the people who have, my season is typical for a first year player.
As explained through talks with coach Jeff Jones after my senior season about going forward professionally, I learned that my career might not always be smooth sailing from the beginning. My first job, like my stint in Turkey, is one to get my feet wet, so to speak. It is an opportunity to get experience on my resume and to show other teams that I can not only handle myself on the court, but off as well.
With the overall experience, I loved Istanbul. I was given a three bedroom apartment which I shared with my American teammate, Kervin Bristol, who graduated from Fordham University. We not only played against each other during my first year of eligibility in the Cable Car Classic Tournament held by Santa Clara University, in which AU won, but we were also paired to play on the same team for a tryout this past summer for a team in Israel, which was held in Florida.
The two foreigners, Bristol and I, immediately showed a presence on the court and showed what we were brought in to do. Within the first couple of games, I was top five in the league in scoring and Bristol was top three in both rebounds and blocked shots, but our performances on the court were falling short of getting wins. Compared to all the other teams in the league, my team was one of the youngest in the league and it was evident.
In the majority of the games, my team was either winning, tied or within a four-point margin in the fourth quarter. Most of those games we lost. The team’s morale quickly dwindled and the general manager of the team decided it was best to go with a new coach in early December. 
Although the new coach began implementing new strategies, those too failed as my team fell to a disappointing 3-14 record. By this time, everyone was frustrated with the results of the games.
Throughout the season I would come in before and stay long after for just about every practice. Often I would envision coach Jones telling me to stop working out during the season and rest my body like he often did during my stay at AU, but the constant losses drove me away from those desires. Still nothing was changing, and my team continued to lose.  
It was around early January when I got a call from my agent that a team in Hungary wanted to sign me. He told me that the team was in a race for the top spot of the conference and that the player I would be replacing suffered an injury, and the team needed to fill the role immediately. He told me that if I performed like I did in Turkey, it would look great on my resume because it is against stiffer competition. Being excited for this great news, I was all but ready to pack my bags. But the team in Turkey had to be willing to release me.
After a couple of talks between the team and my agent, I finally got the release, which brings me here to this very moment. The competitive nature in anyone, let alone an athlete, is extremely high as is evident between the changes in mood when you go from a team that is at the bottom of the league to a team that is competing for a top seed in the playoffs. Everyone is much happier and I feel extremely blessed to be put in this scenario and given another chance to win a championship.
Only being in the country for a couple days, I have not seen much. The best way to describe the city is to compare it to an old British town that you would see in the movies. 
I was a drastic change. Where the team in Turkey would sometimes not practice, now I have two-a-day practices nearly every day. Although the practices run an hour and 45 minutes at most, I am finally able to get my legs under me and am getting used to the change in routine.
The team initially put me up in a hotel until the house where I would stay was available, and the first morning I woke up breakfast was being served. A sweet scent permeated the air and I sped across the hallway to reach the familiar smell. 
BACON!!!! 
For those who do not know, Turkey is a Muslim country, and pork is forbidden. Bacon, sausage, ribs and everything else that my stomach had missed so much is now available in Hungary… 
I guess you can say Hungary is serving my appetite quite well.

2013-07-13,AU,Israel,"By Matthew Farrell
Martin Luther King Jr. famously said from a jail cell in Birmingham, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" 
In a simple and concise manner, it articulates the notion that all men are equal and should have a universal interest in each other's well-being and that incidences of injustice shouldn't be looked at as isolated incidents, but as actions that are helping to shape what is viewed as acceptable in our society. 
With this in mind, I want to talk about the Palestinian / Israeli conflict. What's interesting about this conflict is that while the United States continues to use violations of United Nations regulations as a pretext to rally international action against other foreign countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, we as a nation continually underplay the fact that Israel is in violation of multiple international laws. 
To give a brief overview for those who aren't familiar with this, Israel's admittance as a U.N. member state was under the condition that it abide by general assembly resolution 194 calling for the right to return and compensation for Palestinians. A condition it still hasn't fulfilled. The U.N., in addition to the International Criminal Court, have repeatedly ruled that Israel's naval blockade, separation wall and settlement programs are in violation of international law. 
Israel has also been determined by the U.N. to be an occupying force in Gaza which make its treatment of Palestinians there, including it's extra-judicial killings of military and political figures, illegal. Recently, the U.N. released a report detailing how Israel Defense Forces coerce abused children to open bags suspected of containing explosives at gunpoint and even use them as human shields.
You might be wondering why I'm listing Israel's international crimes without addressing those of the Palestinians. My point is not to demonize Israel. My intention is to highlight the point that people are aware that Hamas has violated international law, but not many are aware of the scope and gravity of Israel's crimes. As a democratically elected political party, Hamas has routinely labeled terrorists, their government is de-legitimized and they also face sanctions and blacklisting. Yet many people are unaware that Israel routinely violates international law and Israel only faces minimal international pressure for it's violations of international law. 
It can't be denied that this is a complex situation whose resolution will extend far beyond the admittance of wrongdoings on both sides. However, it simply cannot stand that we continue to ignore the rulings of our international governing bodies when it comes to states that our government favors. At the very least, our country needs to acknowledge that Israel has a lot to account for in this conflict. Contemporarily we are setting a dangerous precedent. We are showing that it is okay to violate international law as long as you are, or have the backing of, a superpower. ?

2013-11-12,AU,Israel,"General site 1 of Geva’s paintings in Katzen Museum.
Israeli artist Tsibi Geva discussed his artworks hanging in the Katzen Arts Center with art critic Barry Schwabsky of The Nation and museum curator Jack Rasmussen in front of an eager audience Nov. 9. 
Geva kicked off his talk by explaining the importance of the process. He accomplishes this by creating multiple strokes of black and white with a layering effect to create a narrative or event for the viewer , which makes pieces come to life.. These black and white streaks and the subtle vibrancy of intense colors represent the influence of conflict and dialogue in his experiences and in Israeli life, Geva said.
When asked about the difficulty of being perceived as an artist in an age that is heavily video-and-media oriented, Geva replied rather optimistically. 
“The new abstract is hard to understand…but give it time and that will change,” he said. 
Geva is an internationally recognized artist with exhibitions in Tel Aviv, Berlin, Italy and New York. His awards include the Aptowitzer Prize, which promotes Israeli advancement in the arts, and the Mendel and Eva Pundik Prize for Israeli Art. 
Arguably his most powerful response was when someone in the audience asked him to pick a painting and explain what it meant to him. Geva seemed discomforted by the question, but was forced to give an answer that left the audience silent and with goose bumps. 
“The story writes me, it’s not me that writes the story,” he said.
He further explained that most artists are able to talk about their problems because painting those particular experiences has helped them do so. However, Geva’s process is the complete opposite. He admits that he paints before he can talk about his struggles, and even after, he doesn’t know how to talk about it. 
Geva stressed the importance of a viewer to be able to perceive a certain energy from paintings without knowing anything about the painting or the artist himself. 
“For me, the painting on the wall has to talk,” he said. 
Tsibi Geva’s work is currently on display at the Katzen Arts center from Nov. 5 to Dec. 15 along with five other exhibits ranging from sculpture to photography.

2014-02-12,AU,Israel,"February officially begins in terms of big box office releases with three new contenders and a smattering of independent releases. A couple of cold-blooded vampire school kids go head-to-head with grisled WWII art historians and blockbusting LEGO men. See what the critics had to say about this weeks offerings at the cinema.
1. The Monuments Men
George Clooney (“The Ides of March”) and his band of brothers including Bill Murray (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”) and John Goodman (“Inside Llewyn Davis”) seem to have hit up upon monumental wall of critical fury over the films profligate historical omissions, causing The Guardian to write a missive against the exclusion of Ronald Balfour. Some have even taken to flaying the score by Alexandre Desplat (“Zero Dark Thirty”) with Flavorwire’s Jason Bailey writing “when that information was revealed at the end of the film (it’s one of those movies that saves all the credits, except the title, for the end), this viewer was stunned. After two hours of wondering what hack was responsible for this obtrusive, garbage music, I certainly wasn’t expecting to see this six-time Oscar nominee’s name…” 
2. Vampire Academy
Mark Waters’ “Vampire Academy” was apparently so good that it opened cold, leaving scant critical consensus to be found. Even though the film was written Daniel Waters, whose “Heathers” outranks “Mean Girls” in notable and quotable snipes and insults, Film Racket’s Bill Gibron had some gripes with the film writing, “Hoping to catch a ride on that particular cash cow, The Weinstein Company is giving us an adaptation of Ms. Mead’s young adult “phenomenon, Vampire Academy,” he writes. “With a mythology so mangled that even J.R.R. Tolkein’s Silmarillion laughs at its ludicrousness, a stink bomb like this requires the devotion of a true fan to not only figure out what’s going on, but why we should give a bat’s ass in the first place.”
3. The LEGO Movie
Big things have small beginnings and the LEGO people in “The LEGO Movie” took over the box office this weekend. It helped that the film has garnered a strikingly large amount of good will and critical praise. Salon.com’s Andrew O’Hehir said, “What could easily have been test-marketed, corporate-processed crap, a branding extravaganza pretending to be a movie, instead becomes a surprisingly enjoyable and satisfyingly dense family entertainment that pays tribute to the spirit of free play and individuality.”
4. Big Bad Wolves
An Israeli thriller about a rogue serial killer committing a series of grisly murders conjures up little sympathy with The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis. She wrote, “In one of those ill-advised director statements included with the press material, Mr. Keshales and Mr. Papushado invoke the ‘existential anxiety’ that ‘serves as Israel’s foundation’ and promise that their movie will ask, ‘Does being the victim give you the legitimate right’ to become a vigilante? Nice try, guys. Although they toss in a sympathetic Arab character, his pacific presence is soon eclipsed by a tortured man’s agony. Is that the point? Is there a point? “
5. The Attorney
A new South Korean drama opens locally chronicling life at law school. The Washington Post’s Mark Jenkins wrote “‘The Attorney’ can be melodramatic, and first-time feature director Yang Woo-seok is not yet a singular filmmaker. But the movie is carried by its rousing pro- democracy message and a lively performance from the versatile leading man, whose credits include such notable Korean films as ‘The Host’ and ‘Memories of Murder.’”
6. The Broken Circle Breakdown
Belgium’s entry for the 2014 Oscars is an ode to bluegrass and all things American. RogerEbert.Com’s Joyce Kulhawik thought the film was fairly profound writing “It’s a wild scene of pain and desperation, and leads to the film’s equally shocking and final blessed moments, which take us back to the film’s beginning: Didier’s band of musicians hovering—sometimes in the background, sometimes nearby—like a cowboy chorus, singing the songs of life, as celebration, as benediction, as commentary, as pure emotional release, singing in the void for all they are worth, singing that somehow we will all get through it —unbroken.”
“The Lego Movie,” “The Monuments Men,” and “Vampire Academy” are in wide release. “The Broken Circle Breakdown” opens at the Avalon. “The Attorney” opens at the Cinemark Egyptian.

2015-08-05,AU,Israel,"President Barack Obama challenged critics of the recent nuclear accord with Iran in a speech at the School of International Service Wednesday, posing a black-and-white scenario: accept the deal or risk further war in the Middle East.
The deal implements limits on the Iranian Nuclear program over the next 15 years by reducing the country’s stockpiles of enriched uranium and closing two thirds of its centrifuges, both of which are necessary to build a nuclear bomb. It has been heavily criticized by Republican opponents and the Israeli government since it was announced, in part because it offers economic sanction relief to Iran in exchange for compliance.
""For Iran to cheat, it would need a secret source for every single aspect of its program,"" Obama said.  
The speech, to which Obama was 38 minutes late and which lasted over an hour, was the third time he has spoken on AU’s campus as president, the most visits of any sitting president. It was well-attended by foreign dignitaries and media, including Chinese Ambassador to the US, Cui TianKai and many members of Israeli press. 
AU students and staff from all schools in the University also attended, with each school allocated tickets to engage the AU community, according to James Goldgeier, Dean of the School of International Service. SIS earlier emailed its students about a lottery to attend.
“I’m not usually one for politics, but just being a part of this historic moment was amazing,” said Maddie Weyand-Geise, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences. 
Weyand-Geise said that before she was contacted by her advisor to attend the event she knew very little about the deal or the issues surrounding it. 
“I’m more of an arts person, but the invitation prompted me to do some research and now I am very interested in the issue,” she said. 
Student Government President Sasha Gilthorpe said the event was a boon for the University.
“The fact that President Obama chose American University is a huge testament to the community we are all a part of,” she said. “History takes place here.” 
Obama directed his speech at critics of the deal, stressing what he described as a strong US-Israel relationship, the need to maintain peace in the region and ultimately urging Congress to accept the deal in its September vote. 
At one point the president compared Republican critics to Iranian hardliners who may be filmed yelling “Death to America!” and who he said similarly oppose the deal. He also called out pundits he said had become “armchair scientists” by contradicting the expertise of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who is also nuclear physicist and was involved in drafting the deal. 
He encouraged Israeli detractors to accept the deal.
""Every nation of the world that has commented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli government has expressed support."" #ObamaAtAU
— The Eagle (@TheEagleOnline) August 5, 2015
""To the Israeli people I say this: a nuclear armed #iran is far more dangerous to #Israel"" @POTUS #ObamaAtAU
— The Eagle (@TheEagleOnline) August 5, 2015
Throughout the speech, Obama rejected the notion that the United States should turn down the current agreement in hopes of a better deal that might have included stronger sanctions. 
“Sanctions alone are not going to force Iran to completely dismantle all vestiges of its nuclear infrastructure,” he said. ""Those who say we can walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy.” 
Rejection of the deal would mean the exhaustion of all alternatives to military action, he said. Obama repeatedly pounded the importance of avoiding another war in the Middle East, noting that the only militant organizations have benefited from recent wars in the region. 
“The emergence of Al Qaeda in Iraq has evolved into ISIL and ironically, the single greatest beneficiary from the region...was the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said, using an acronym for the group more commonly known as the Islamic State. 
Iran does have a history of supporting militant groups in the region. The president argued that while some funds will continue to go to uses the US government does not approve of, the economic relief the release of sanctions will supply will not impact that funding as much as is being discussed. 
In fact, Iran has engaged in such activities before sanctions began.  
The current deal prevents Iran from obtaining plutonium, enriched uranium, removes two-thirds of the country’s centrifuges and allows decades of inspector access to the nuclear supply chain.  
""Nuclear material isn't something you can hide in the closet. It can leave a trace for years,” he said. “We can catch them and we will,"" he said.

2015-11-12,AU,Israel,"*Updated: 5:09 p.m. Nov. 14. Corrections and clarification appended. 
The discovery of posters bearing Islamophobic messages on campus Sunday evening has raised concerns about the safety of Muslim students.
The posters mentioned chapters of the Muslim Students Association and Students for Justice in Palestine. One depicts deceased al-Qaeda member Anwar al-Awlaki with a target over his face. The picture on the poster is surrounded by the words, “MSA Terrorist: Head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, President MSA Colorado State” and the hashtag “#StopTheJihadOnCampus.” A 2010 New York Times article confirms that al-Awlaki attended Colorado State, and was the president of the MSA chapter there.
Another poster, which bears the same hashtag, shows a bloody knife hovering over a Jewish star under the words, “The real meaning of BDS: Boycott, Divest, Stab.” This phrase draws a reference to “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions,” a strategy used by Students for Justice in Palestine chapters and other organizations to protest Israel’s political treatment of the Palestinian territories. 
Students found two posters in the tunnel next to Bender Arena and four more on lampposts between Kogod and Katzen.
Aman Abdelhamid, the president of AU’s MSA chapter, said she felt severely troubled by the posters. 
“We’ve been dealing with [Islamophobia] our entire lives, but to come to a school and to have fliers posted like that with threatening images…it’s just so upsetting,” Abdelhamid said.
The posters are linked to “Stop the Jihad on Campus,” a campaign funded by the California-based David Horowitz Freedom Center. A statement that the Office of Campus life e-mailed to the student body Tuesday afternoon connected the posters to the Freedom Center, and the group’s website claims the organization “combats the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror.” 
Horowitz’s materials have appeared on campuses across the country, according to Abdelhamid.
Members of the MSA and SJP found a 44-page manifesto on the website for the “Stop the Jihad on Campus” campaign. The document claims that MSA recruits for al-Qaeda and Hamas. None of this is true, according to Laith Shakir, treasurer of AU’s SJP chapter. Both organizations’ budgets are financed through AU Club Council, he said.
“Not only is all of the information presented here categorically false, it also propagates an exhausted talking point: if you are (or even just look) Muslim, and you're involved in campus organization, you must also be involved in a terrorist group,” Shakir wrote in a Facebook post Sunday night. “Thus, Muslims and people who ‘look Arab’ are inextricably linked to violent extremism. The promoted hashtag isn't trying to just ‘stop the jihad’ (which, itself, is a nonsensical phrase); instead, it's trying to eradicate anyone who could conceivably be labeled as Arab or Muslim from organizing on campus.”
Shakir was one of several students who shared pictures of the flyer on Facebook. Many urged their peers to report the incident to Public Safety. Some also offered to walk with Muslim students who did not feel safe traveling alone, Mokuena said. 
The posters have made Muslim students feel unsafe, according to Abdelhamid.
“I had people calling me [on Sunday], telling me that they were legitimately scared,” she said. “The posters…had really strong implications, really threatening messages.”
The discovery of the posters coincided with instances of Islamophobia on other campuses in the DMV area, Abdelhamid said. The same posters were recently spotted on the Georgetown and George Washington University campuses. At Virginia Tech, students found the message, “On 11/11, we will kill all the Muslims,” written on a bathroom stall, Abdelhamid said. 
The fact that the posters originated from an outside organization, Abdelhamid said, will not be comforting until the people who put them up are identified. 
“The thing is, we don’t know who posted these flyers,” she said. “It was definitely on behalf of that organization, but we don’t know if they sent people from the organization to come on campuses, or whether they recruited actual students.”
On Sunday night, SJP president Ntebo Mokuena brought one of the posters found in the tunnel to the Public Safety office, where she filed a written report. An officer escorted her to the tunnel to take down the other poster there and walked with her to MGC to look for more. She said she was told that officers would be available to escort any students across campus, and that they would search the campus for more posters.
Members of the MSA and SJP raised concerns about the posters in a meeting with representatives from the Kay Spiritual Life Center, Public Safety, Student Activities and the Office of Campus Life Monday afternoon. 
Although officers assured Mokuena and others Sunday night that they would find and remove as many posters as they could, Attai said she saw three posters on lampposts near Kogod, and one on the traffic box near Glover Gate, on Monday morning. Three Public Safety officers were standing near the one on the traffic box, she said, so she assumed it would be taken down. When she passed by the area three hours later, the officers were gone, and the poster was still there. She and a friend took it down themselves, despite fears of being targeted by the people who put them up. Attai said she removed the three on the lampposts as well.
AU Director of Public Relations Kelly Alexander said in an email that the officers did not remove the poster on the traffic box because it was “crazy glued” down, and the traffic box was city property. To avoid damaging the box, Alexander said, the officers requested that the city take the poster down.
Alexander said that a Public Safety officer removed additional posters on the quad near Kogod.
She said that between Sunday and Monday, any poster that Public Safety officers saw or were made aware of were taken down. Posters left up either went unreported or were put up after officers patrolled the area.
Public Safety did not issue an independent public statement or AU alert, despite requests from MSA and SJP members. The University did release a statement on Facebook and Twitter shortly after the posters were discovered.
""AU Public Safety has been doing a really good job reaching out to us and being proactive in terms of dealing with this whole issue. The head of PS has now met with us for the second time to ensure and work with us that our safety and well-being is secure,"" Attai said.
However, both SJP and MSA members said they were concerned by the University’s lack of protocol for dealing with hate speech.
“The University had good intentions, but they said a lot of what is going to be done is going to happen through the community,” Abdelhamid said. “And I understand that … community involvement and awareness is a huge part of the whole situation, but the administration needs to do their part. We need to know that the University knows how to deal with these kinds of threats.”
Shakir said he was also troubled by the University’s response.
“As students and members of a marginalized community, we didn’t know where to go after being specifically targeted with violent messages,” he said. “Part of our hope is that this will serve as a case study for the University going forward, to have a protocol in place to allow students to know how the University will respond to hate crimes before that happens, and to serve as a sort of preventative measure.”
Gail Hanson, the vice president of Campus Life, said AU does not have a hate speech policy. There is a set of Freedom of Expression Guidelines, which she said outlines the cases in which the University can intervene in student speech. 
“Protest or demonstration shall not be discouraged so long as neither force nor the threat of force is used, and so long as the orderly processes of the University are not deliberately obstructed,” the policy states. 
Prohibited “expressions of dissent” include those that “deny or infringe upon the rights of other students, faculty, staff, or guests of the University community…disrupt or interfere with educational or other activities of the University community…[or] endanger the safety of any person on the University campus.”
The guidelines do not apply to people from outside the AU community, Hanson said. In accordance with University policy, only students, staff and faculty are allowed to place posters on campus. The organizations or individuals responsible for the content must make their names visible on all posted materials. Posters put up by outsiders will be removed, Hanson said. 
Shakir said the posters are “emblematic of a much larger mentality” of animosity toward SJP chapters and Islamophobia.
This is not the first time AU’s SJP chapter has encountered hostility, according to Mokuena. She said that the group’s posters are frequently defaced or ripped down.
The MSA, SJP, the University and AU Hillel have issued statements condemning the posters. 
“I am profoundly upset and displeased at the inflammatory posters that went up over the weekend,” University Chaplain Joe Eldridge said in an interview. “It is incumbent on us as an American University community to surround our Muslim brothers and sisters with compassion.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article misattributed the New York Times article and stated that Anwar al-Awlaki was not president of an MSA chapter. He was, at Colorado State.
An earlier version of this article also misstated the number of posters Attai saw near Kogod.
Clarification: This article has been updated with additional information about Public Safety and the University's responses to the posters. It previously said that Pubic Safety did not release a statement, which they did not do independently around the time the posters were found. Campus police were referred to in some statements made by the University shortly after.

2016-10-13,AU,Israel,"I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

2017-10-11,AU,Israel,"As I witnessed what happened on campus last month, I had one overriding thought: we have seen this before.  We have seen torch-bearing, swastika-clad demonstrators in Charlottesville this past August.  We have seen ugly, crass racial slurs on AU’s campus earlier this year, and we have seen an unrelenting barrage of violent acts and words on the national stage over the last few years.  Rather than appreciating that the United States is special because of its diversity and freedom, the purveyors of hate speech and violence hope to divide our country further.  But we have seen this before, so, with the right approach, we can frustrate their aims.

	The menacing crowd of white supremacists and anti-semites marching with their torches in Charlottesville was particularly jarring for many people, as it combined elements of Nazism and lynch mobs.  Those of us who believe fervently that past is prologue, and that knowledge of history is essential to understanding our present, know that masquerading as perpetrators of the Holocaust or as henchmen of Klan violence should not be dismissed as mere swagger; words and images do matter.  The Nazi Holocaust, which resulted in the inconceivable murder of six million Jews – two out of every three European Jews – during World War II, owed much of its effectiveness to the fact that it began by separating and dehumanizing Jews and others deemed undesirable by the regime. The kind of imagery employed by the criminal who violated AU last week has some goals in common with the Nazis: to liken certain groups of people to animals, to promote a fictional glorious version of a corrupt system, and to encourage fear of the stranger in our midst.

	Already, before the latest incident, AU had taken the rare initiative to found an Anti-Racist Research and Policy Center, headed by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi.  On an evening that should only have been celebratory, with detailed plans announced for the new center, insidious posters were hung in strategic locations – including the offices of the Center for Israel Studies – valorizing the Confederacy while proudly evoking its support for slavery in the cotton industry. In his beautiful and wise remarks to the campus community after the vandalism was revealed, Dr. Kendi acknowledged the wider circle of hurt that such acts create, specifically recognizing Jewish students as being victims of the same kind of anti-semitic, white supremacist agenda as the African-American community on campus and elsewhere.  “I write to AU students,” he proclaimed, “especially students of color and Jewish students.”

	As scholars of the Jewish experience, my colleagues and I know too well the Jewish people’s long history of being targeted by the type of hate and base prejudice that was demonstrated at AU last week.  But we also know the Jews’ history of activism – of resisting those who attack people because of their race, religion, or background, and of fighting for the rights of those victims.  This includes, in particular, a history of empathy with the African-American community and activism even at the risk of some Jews’ lives – from the turn of the 20th century, through the Depression era, and famously in the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.  Jews have learned, in every era, that it is not enough to condemn hate crimes with words – but that informed action is the key to change. In my Jewish history and literature courses, I seek to inform about a history that is often difficult but remains proud, and to show our students that it is not enough to know, but also to speak out, provide support for victims, and expose hypocrisy and prejudice.

	I was struck by the following lines in Dr. Kendi’s remarks: “Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the strength to do what is right in the face of it.”  The same closeness that makes relationships more intense on a college campus, but can spread fear and despair much more quickly than in a normal community, can also provide the key to our solution.  If the University continues to respond, as it has, with creativity and openness – to different ideas and different people – if its faculty and students join together to learn, applying lessons from the past to our complicated present, then we will be fulfilling our mission, and we will join those who meet fear with courage.

2018-03-08,AU,Israel,"Students meet outside of Hillel's office in Kay Spiritual Life Center.
Correction appended.
The University is hosting a series of seminars on anti-Semitism following the anti-Semitic posters hung on the School of International Service building on Tuesday, Feb. 27. The next event, open to students, faculty and staff, will be on March 28 and focus on anti-Semitism at the University.
These meetings are part of a new strategy to address hateful postering, Vice President of Campus Life Fanta Aw told The Eagle Monday. AU chose not to host a town hall after the anti-immigration posters in January and the anti-Semitic posters in February. This marks a change from fall 2017, when the University hosted a campus-wide town hall in Kay Spiritual Life Center after someone hung Confederate flag flyers in several campus buildings. 
“One of things we learned about the town hall in September is that after you’ve had a series of these, if you’re going to do anything, you need to focus on the education piece of it,” Aw said. 
The Anti-Defamation League met with University leaders during summer 2017 to teach them about responding to hate incidents like white supremacist postering, Doron Ezickson, the organization’s D.C. regional director, told The Eagle in February. Campuses can limit hate by “engaging people with knowledge,” Ezickson said. They should not give white supremacist groups the attention they seek, Ezickson said. 
Aw’s campus-wide email and the announcement of community check-ins matches this philosophy. 
“Part of our response is to not give these groups attention, which is what they want, and we want you to know we are being as proactive as we possibly can,” she wrote in her statement.
Steph Black, a Jewish student, said that Aw’s statement is a signal of larger anti-Semitism at the University. Anti-Semitism is not discussed enough, she said. 
“There are a lot of ways to say that these were Neo-Nazis,” Black said. “These were raging anti-Semites. These are people who do not believe Jews are humans and there are ways to phrase things that say who they are without necessarily naming them.”
Joshua Hare, a junior studying law and society, is the Shabbat innovation intern for Hillel. He is not an official representative of Hillel. Hare thought that Aw’s email was a standard reply for white supremacist postering; however, he was impressed by the scheduling of the community meetings
“To me, I find some importance in not identifying certain actors sometimes,” Hare said. “While I understand that some other students would like to know who posted them and more about the organization, to me the University’s priority should be responding to students about how they’re feeling and about how it makes them feel safe on campus.”
Rose Haas, a sophomore majoring in Jewish studies, also told The Eagle that educating students on anti-Semitism is a positive step. However, she would have liked to see Operation Homeland named in the University’s statement. Operation Homeland, a group connected to white supremacist Richard Spencer, was written on the posters.
“It would behoove the school to explicitly name the groups that are problematic,” Haas said.
Anti-Semitism education sessions scheduled for before, after spring break
The two community meetings were both “inward” and “outward” facing events, junior Steph Black told The Eagle. 
Black met with Aw to set up the meetings, she said. Aw had already reached out to the Anti-Defamation League to plan an educational seminar on anti-Semitism before she met with Black, she told The Eagle via email. The same day the posters were hung on the University's campus, the Anti-Defamation League released a report that anti-Semitic incidents surged in 2017. Aw wanted to plan a seminar on anti-Semitism with the Anti-Defamation League in response to the posters. Black urged Aw to hold more educational sessions on anti-Semitism to change how the University approaches the topic, she said.
The inward facing event, open just to Jewish students, was on March 6 in the AU Hillel office. Hillel is the campus Jewish student organization. The outward facing event was on March 7 for all students in the Center for Diversity and Inclusion’s office.
There will be another event on March 28 where students can learn about anti-Semitism at the University. This will be open for AU students, faculty and staff.
“Often anti-Semitism is not seen as a legitimate form of oppression and not seen as a legitimate concern,” Black said. “Jewish students don’t get the support they need when dealing with this.” 
With this new focus on education – and not town halls – the meetings will serve as a way to have a conversation and educate others on anti-Semitism on campus, Aw said. 
“We heard from our Jewish community and I’ve spent some time with Hillel,” Aw said. “I think the way that we can get to this is let’s have community dialogue around the rise in anti-Semitism, what do we know is happening and how does it play itself out in different ways and how do we as a community respond in the most appropriate ways.”
Aaron Traub, a sophomore in the School of Communication, said that town halls are often coupled with protests. One-on-one conversations like these community check-ins provide a less risky, quieter environment to process the postering.
“One-on-one conversations not only limit the risk involved in a protest, but they allow students and faculty to be in an environment where they are free to express their concerns and opinions as well as become more aware of the global issue of anti-Semitism on college campuses,” Traub said.
Scott Boxer, president of AU Students for Israel and a sophomore in the School of International Service, said that the posters disguised anti-Semitism as a criticism of Israel, Boxer said. The decision to hold smaller educational sessions on anti-Semitism instead of a town hall is positive, he said, because town halls provide notoriety for anti-Semitic hate groups.
“Obviously, this was a very disgusting or hateful act. But, this one thankfully didn’t include any personal threats of violence against a specific person or a specific group,” Boxer said. “It wasn’t threatening somebody’s life. There wasn’t that feeling of urgency to have a big town hall with every member of administration and massive amounts of students.”
Along with Black, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and AU Hillel are coordinating these events. Last semester, Hillel and CDI partnered on a workshop for Jewish student leaders, Executive Director of AU Hillel Jason Benkendorf said. 
This semester, beyond the meetings on anti-Semitism, they’re hosting a faculty and staff workshop titled “Building Relationships Across Difference” with Jewish activist Yavilah McCoy on March 19, who will also be speaking on campus on March 20. McCoy will host another workshop called “Allyship While Jewish” on March 21.
According to Dialogue & Diversity Programs Coordinator Michelle Strange, the meetings will be a way to process where the AU community is at with anti-Semitism.
“Now that these posters have been hung up, how do we take what we already have and refocus it?” Strange said. “Processing our feelings, our thoughts and how we build solidarity and how we move forward, what’s the connection and what’s the difference between having a critique on Israel versus being anti-semitic?”
A handful of Jewish students came to the inward event Tuesday, Benkendorf said. He wants these meetings to give Jewish students an opportunity to express their feelings on anti-Semitism and their experience at the University, he said. He hopes students will brainstorm ideas to address anti-Semitism and bigotry during the check-ins.
“It is really important to me that folks understand that on campus and beyond campus, AU really is by and large a really wonderful place to be a Jewish student,” Benkendorf said. “There’s a lot of positive things going on, we’ve got an active and vibrant community. Having an event like this doesn’t change that, but it’s certainly something we have to work through together.”
Correction: The original version of this article mislabeled the third anti-Semitism event on March 28 as a speaker event. The third event will not feature a speaker. Instead, it will be another educational discussion on anti-Semitism.

2018-03-09,AU,Israel,"Students meet outside of Hillel's office in Kay Spiritual Life Center.
On February 27, American University Police Department officers removed anti-Semitic posters from campus. The flyers contained the hashtag, #AIPACgohome, and an Operation Homeland logo. The Eagle spotted the flyers on the School of International Service building at about 2 a.m.
First, The Eagle strongly affirms its support for the Jewish community at American University. 
The posters addressed AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. AIPAC is a large bipartisan, pro-Israel organization. Beginning last Sunday, more than 18,000 pro-Israel supporters attended the conference, according to the event’s website. Many of them are Jewish.
A critical observation of the posters, however, reveals they offer a targeted, hateful anti-Semitic message disguised by anti-Israel sentiment. The University has a large Jewish population. Twelve percent of the University's class of 2022, for example, identifies as Jewish, according to a breakdown provided by the Kay Spiritual Life Center. The posters, which list the name of a group of white supremacists connected with Richard Spencer, clearly target Jews and not exclusively Israel. 
As these events happen, it seems that the University’s response and consequently the student community response decreases. Formerly, hateful events like these -- such as the Confederate flags hung on campus in September -- elicited town hall community meetings. But, no longer does that seem to be the case. In an interview with Fanta Aw, vice president of campus life, The Eagle learned that the University’s primary strategy is to deny attention to white supremacist groups hanging posters like these. They do so with the advice of the Anti-Defamation League.   
Our staff agrees that the University should deny oxygen to white supremacist groups. Town halls, for example, provide too much attention to these groups. We also look forward to learning more about anti-Semitism through University-hosted seminars. 
However, the school has not been transparent about this shift away from town halls. They did not publicly announce why they neglected to host a town hall after the anti-immigration posters were hung in January and after the anti-Semitic posters were hung in February. In the case of the anti-Semitic posters, the University opted to host discussions on anti-Semitism instead of a town hall. Publicly, however, the University produced a rapid, cookie-cutter memo after the anti-Semitic posters were hung. This only reinforces the image of an administration that is disconnected from the student body. Through our reporting, The Eagle knows that the
University is acting on anti-Semitism behind the scenes and has published that information. However, the school is not publicly communicating their actions clearly. 
This can make Jewish students feel undervalued because it seems like the University isn’t taking bigotry against them as seriously as other forms of hatred. In the coming weeks, we hope the University will publicly explain the criteria for a town hall meeting and what makes this particular anti-Semitic postering (in addition the anti-immigration posters) different to the student body. We also hope they will further explain their strategy to deny these white supremacist groups the attention they seek.
Additionally, students feel left out of decision-making discussions, treated solely as assets rather than active members of change in the community. Jewish community members should be consulted on how the University moves forward from these anti-Semitic posters. Jews are as worthy as any other marginalized group of the University’s attention.
The Eagle recommends that University improve its communication with the student body, specifically the Jewish community, about their approach to anti-Semitism and white supremacist postering as a whole. They could do so through face-to-face conversations with students. Burwell recently wrote, “It truly takes a village to build a more inclusive community.” These events are no exception. It is time to include more student voices in the building process and be transparent with your actions.

2020-11-13,AU,Israel,"Palestinian social justice event flyer. 
An Arab and Muslim studies professor from San Francisco State University joined American University students for a virtual event on Oct. 29 entitled “The Palestinian Exception to Calls for Social Justice.” 
Rabab Abdulhadi discussed calls for Palestinian human rights in the United States. AU professors Irene Calis and Zein El-Amine co-hosted the event, which Calis referred to as a call for justice.
“It is about the real material consequences of working towards the emancipation of Palestinian life, land and dignity,” Calis said.
Abdulhadi said that people should recognize that criticism of Israel is not the same as anti-Semitism. 
“Israel should not get exceptional treatment because Israel is not exceptional. Palestine is not exceptional,” Abdulhadi said. “The U.S. is not exceptional, and we argue against exceptionalism. This is a question of justice.”
Abdulhadi also discussed her experience fighting against censorship in her line of work and activism. 
The conversation was co-sponsored by various student groups, including but not limited to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), African Students’ Organization and AU Pride. The Department of Sociology and the Department of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies served as academic sponsors of the event. 
Junior Kiran Waqar, a member of SJP, said that the number of co-sponsors was significant in representing the interconnected concern for justice in Palestine, which many students at AU feel passionate about. 
“It can be difficult for a lot of people on American University's campus when they feel like their values aren’t seen in a lot of places,” Waqar said. “I think a really big part of [the event] is community building and showing people that they can speak up for what they believe is right and that they have other people supporting them.”
Junior Aqsa Rashid, also a member of SJP, said another goal of the event was to paint Palestine in a light that students don’t often see at AU, one devoid of the logistics of policy that might constrain conversation and debate. 
“We're not approaching it from that lens,” Rashid said. “We're approaching it like how we can come together as a community that cares about people and justice.” 
Abdulhadi also spoke about how to keep going when activism work becomes frustrating or hopeless. Abdulhadi advised thinking of this work as a “labor of love.”
“Think of what we're doing as coming together to enrich and support each other,” Abdulhadi said. “Of course, it's exhausting to do all of this stuff, day in and day out. But what option do we have? What choice do we have?”
In reflecting on the event, Waqar found Abdulhadi’s words to be a revitalizing path to justice. 
“It's hard to have energy after a long day and on a Team call, but I did,” Waqar said, referring to Microsoft Teams. “I had energy because there was hope, and that hope is a return to self. This was one of the most effective, genuine events I've been to on campus. It felt like I could finally breathe; I didn't realize how much I was holding on my chest.”

2021-04-12,AU,Israel,"Michael Brenner, American University’s Director of the Center for Israel Studies, received the first Salo W. and Jeannette M. Baron Award for Scholarly Excellence in Research on the Jewish Experience. 
Brenner’s research focuses on the State of Israel and Jewish history from the 19th to the 21st century. His multiple publications and books have been translated into 10 languages. A few of his books focus on German Jewish history in the 1920s, which he said is extremely significant today. 
“I think that this aspect of history, unfortunately, has become more relevant in the United States, than what I thought when I started to work on it initially,” Brenner said. “It shows how democracies can fail and how certain groups can be singled out and blamed for economic or political crises. Today, unfortunately, I see certain rhymes to that history.”
AU’s Center for Israel Studies was established in 1998, the first of its kind. The center has created a space to study, examine and interpret Israel’s landscape as a nation and its people. 
“At AU and CIS, we have excellent relations with many different schools and departments, allowing us to do unique interdisciplinary work,” Brenner said. “At the center, we are able to interact with both high-level scholars and politicians for collaborative research and discussion.”
The award was established in 2020 by the University of Vienna and the Knapp Family Foundation, a nonprofit that fosters diverse education in minority communities. The University of Vienna describes the award as the Nobel Prize in the study of the Jewish experience. The Baron Award recognizes and honors the achievements of researchers whose works focus on the relationship of Jewish and non-Jewish people and perceptions of Judaism in the broader societies in which they live. 
The award was named after Salo Wittmayer Baron, who is widely considered to be the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th century. He is best known for his 18-volume magnum opus “A Social and Religious History of the Jews.” As the first professor to be appointed as the Chair of Jewish History at Columbia University, Baron testified at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the major organizers of the Holocaust, where he explained the sociohistorical context of the genocide against Jewish people. Baron’s work strove to integrate the aspects of Jewish history into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived. According to Brenner, his scholarship is the groundwork for understanding how Jewish people in Israel and worldwide continue to perceive themselves and others today. 
Brenner continues to serve as a professor of Jewish History and Culture at the University of Munich, where he teaches a semester every year. He had the opportunity to meet Baron during his graduate studies at Columbia University. 
“I was honored to visit him when he was 94 years old, where I got to know him. Personally, I am very touched to be the first recipient of the award that was named after him,” Brenner said. “I am also very attached to the fact that Baron and I both shared experiences of having our lives and academic careers be between Europe and the U.S.” 
In the future, Brenner hopes to study Israeli-Arab relations further and create unique global programs for the Center for Israel Studies.  
Brenner encourages non-Jewish students to participate in Jewish and Israel Studies, where students see the intersection of identities to understand other experiences.  
“Jewish studies is here for everyone,” Brenner said. “For non-Jewish students, it is an opportunity to learn about their own families’ experiences as immigrants or minorities by looking at the Jewish experience in the last 200 years. Rather than being isolationist and looking at one’s own, I think we should understand the relations between two or more groups throughout history and today.”

2022-02-11,AU,Israel,"Tzipi Livni, the former Vice Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice for Israel, spoke to American University students in a webinar co-sponsored by the School of Public Affairs and the Center for Israel Studies on Feb. 7.
Livni was the featured speaker at this year’s Amos Perlmutter Memorial Lecture, an annual event held to commemorate Perlmutter, a late scholar of Middle East political leadership and SPA professor.
According to the Center for Israel Studies, Livni is “known for her efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was Israel’s chief negotiator for peace between Israel and the Palestinians during the last two rounds of negotiations.”
The question and answer portion of the webinar was moderated by Saul Newman, the associate dean for Undergraduate Education in the Department of Government at AU.
During the webinar, Livni said she decided to leave politics three years ago after feeling she did not have enough political power to promote continued peace talks between Israel and Palestine.
“This is the right policy for the future of both my sons, but also their generation,” Livni said. “I hope that the time will come and we will see this happening, because the other option, I believe, is not the Zionist option.”
Livni also discussed the “huge gap” between the state of Israel and its perception by the international community.
“For many years, the outside world is looking at Israel through the lenses of the [Palestinian and Israeli] conflict, [and the] sometimes distorted lenses of the conflict,” Livni said. “It also affects the situation in Israel. The nature of democracy, the policy of some Israeli governments affects the relations between Israel and the world. And I believe that we need to open a new dialogue.”
Prior to the event, AU Students for Justice in Palestine released a statement condemning the lecture and Livni’s involvement. As of Feb. 10, the statement has been co-signed by 12 AU student organizations, such as AU Pride, the South Asian Student Association and the Arab Student Association.
According to the AUSJP statement, when Livni was a “key” member of former Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s cabinet, they led a 2008 assault on the Gaza Strip called Operation Cast Lead. The operation led to the deaths of 1400 Palestinians, including 300 children. 
“We call on the university to cancel this lecture and to reckon with its unapologetic support of this settler-colonial and apartheid state, including the disproportionate amount of resources it contributed to an Israeli-centric, and anti-Palestinian, education,” the statement said. “Students for Justice in Palestine will continue to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people until such demands are met and the liberation for all Palestinians is realized.”
AUSJP did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Eagle.
When asked where she draws the line between disagreement with Israeli policy and antisemitism, Livni said that while critizing the Israeli government is legitimate, not accepting the right of Israel to exist is “something completely different.”
“I think that the base is understanding that the Jewish people [have] the rights, historical tradition and international rights to establish and to live in the nation-state of the Jewish people,” Livni said.

2022-11-10,AU,Israel,"Palestinian writer and spoken word poet Ghadeer Malek shared her work in an online event hosted by American University’s Arab World Studies and Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies on Nov. 1.  
During the discussion moderated by AU Director of Arab World Studies Irene Calis, Malek talked about tackling subjects like displacement, feminism and settler-colonialism as a Palestinian woman. The talk also included poets Shano Mohammed, a Georgetown student in the Master of Arts in Arab Studies program, and AU student Satreen Hendi.  
The event is the second installment of the online speaker series, “Palestine: Land, Life, Dignity,” a collaborative initiative aimed at centering anti-colonial struggles and protecting similar stories from erasure. Malek said portraying this reality and relating it to a larger picture is the basis of her work.  
“What drove me to poetry was the need to express ourselves as Palestinians in particular,” Malek said at the event. “I always joke around with my friends that Palestinians are gaslit from the moment they’re born in the sense that … we’re born into a reality in which [our experience of colonialism] is completely erased.”  
Malek added that poetry, specifically spoken word, has become a vehicle for expressing her anger and resilience at the damage colonialism has inflicted on Palestinian and other Indigenous communities.  
“A lot of my voice at the beginning came out as rants because I was angry as a young Palestinian; angry at the world, angry at colonization,” she said. “I wanted my voice to be heard … and that sort of anger was channeled into spoken word.”  
Born in Palestine, Malek immigrated to Canada in 2003 to study at the University of Toronto, where she became active in student movements supporting Palestinian causes. Her body of work includes the poems “I Exist,” “Revolution to My Earth” and the anthology book “Min Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections of Identity, Space & Resistance,” a collection of writing from multiple authors. Malek said having multiple voices was an integral part of the book.  
“The more voices that come to the table the better they are,” she said, adding that gathering writers from various religious and cultural backgrounds helped her form a community. “That’s why I’m very proud of ‘Min Fami’ … I don’t feel like I’m a single voice talking on my own.”  
In an example of gathering different voices, Mohammed and Hendi both shared poems about overcoming cultural and institutional barriers. Mohammed, who was born in Iraqi Kurdistan, recited her poem about the limitations placed on women in the Middle, East and Sateen delivered a poem centered around the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist killed by Israeli police in May.  
“This is one of my process pieces where I start with an idea or a phrase or something and see where it takes me,” Hendi said. “I talk about the frustration of what it feels like to have to deal with the trauma and the pain of experiencing that situation in real time while also trying to convince people to care about it.”  
While spreading awareness about difficult topics is a central part of her work, Malek said she still grapples with self-doubt about her identity and qualifications as a writer.  
“It’s always a lot of questions and a lot of hesitations in the sense that there’s always a voice underneath our voice … there’s always another voice there questioning,” she said. “I like to call that voice the doubtful voice, the colonizer’s voice, the oppressor’s voice telling us that we’re not good enough.”  
Malek said she combats these feelings by reminding herself, and other Palestinian activists, that her lived experience is more powerful than her doubts. 
“Follow that voice of what you know, because when you write about what you know, the hesitations will still be there … but you can override that voice because you know something that voice doesn’t know, which is that you’re Palestinian,” she said. “Always acknowledge that that voice will come, but you have an inherent knowledge that you can tap into.”

2009-02-12,AU,Palestine,"Two AU clubs on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Students for Justice in Palestine and AU Students for Israel, tabled on the main quad Tuesday on behalf of one cause: Frisbee.
Chelsea Lund, a senior in the School of International Service, brought together many of AU's clubs to support the union of sports and conflict resolution. Ultimate Peace is an organization that promotes peace in the Middle East through Frisbee games.
""[Ultimate Frisbee] is about the team on both sides, supporting each other,"" she said. ""If there's a foul called, you admit it; it's about honesty and it's about working with your teammates and the other team.""
As a member of AU's Ultimate Frisbee team, Lund invited her teammates to play a match at the event, in addition to the several clubs that tabled nearby. OneVoice, an international grassroots movement for negotiation between Palestine and Israel, and AU's Community Action and Social Justice Coalition were also participants.
Most of the clubs at the event participated in activities together previously, but this was the first chance for several of the on-campus clubs focused on  Israel and Palestine issues to co-sponsor a social event, according to Lund.
Rachel Weingartner, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences and a Students for Justice in Palestine member, said the event sounded like a good opportunity. 
Nick Haras, a first-year graduate student in the SIS International Communication program, participated in Students for Justice in Palestine during his four undergraduate years at AU and continues to do so as a graduate student.
""In Lebanon, for example, soccer matches were used prior to the civil war to try to bring Muslim-Christian reconciliation,"" he said. ""Sports allow people to interact with each other and to compete, to get out a lot of energy in a context that doesn't turn violent.""
All the clubs present addressed some aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Lauren Barr, the president of the OneVoice Movement at AU and a sophomore in SIS and CAS, said the OneVoice Movement had not worked with the Ultimate Frisbee team before.
""It's exciting that we've partnered with them, it's kind of fun to cross boundaries that usually aren't related,"" Barr said.
The biggest mishap of the event was a late start, Lund said, but the clubs were able to stay late so students leaving class had a chance to see everything.
""I was excited to see so many people show up for the tabling, that was the part that I thought would be the hardest,"" she said. ""I also got a great Frisbee game going, which was the whole point of the event.""
Lund is also arranging a D.C.-wide Frisbee game March 22 on the National Mall. Club teams and individuals can sign up and pay $10, which will go towards Ultimate Peace.

2010-03-04,AU,Palestine,"This week’s column was difficult to write. Not because of the content, of course - but because of what I had to leave out. I could have written this column about the Women’s Initiative’s new venture, the “Vagina Men” campaign (can I start a “Penis Women” counter-campaign?). But alas, I’ve spilled too much ink whining about feminist follies; this column, instead, will address something of actual consequence.
Twice a week, campus ROTC recruits have to wake up early in the morning to engage in physical training, which will prepare them for their eventual deployment. This task would normally be performed on campus, but our esteemed student government has exiled them to Georgetown. The explanation is thus: AU’s official code prohibits funding to any discriminatory organization. And with the military’s official “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy still in place, alas, what are we to do but ban the presence of the U.S. military?
Leaving aside the fact that the U.S. military has done more to make the world safe for gay people than any do-gooder college activist, let me state emphatically that yes, the military’s policy is asinine. Every civilized country on Earth allows for openly gay soldiers, and it’s a shame that our own military has been slow on the uptake. But it makes little sense to punish our perfectly honorable campus recruits for a policy they have nothing to do with. The only people punished by the student government’s policy are our recruits—most of whom oppose “don’t ask, don’t tell,” anyway.
Really, it is a perfect testament to the fact that the student government is filled with kids playing politician that they think that they’re “sending a message to Washington” this way. Washington’s not listening. Those of you in the Student Government ought to figure out what everyone else on campus knows: you’re not important. Leave our recruits alone and get back to doing what you’re supposed to be doing. Some of you, with your inflated egos, might actually get to be members of Congress one day. Right now, you’re just college kids in a student government. Stop trying to send the Defense Department a statement.
Fascinatingly enough, there actually is something that the SG could do about anti-gay campus culture that falls within their proper purview. If it really wants to cut off funding to campus organizations that promote anti-gay policies, I’ve found one that objectively violates this policy: Students for Justice In Palestine.
This week has been “Israel Apartheid Week” on campuses across the country. Groups such as AU’s own Students for Justice In Palestine have taken part in smear campaigns against the—well, I guess I’m supposed to call it the “Zionist entity” this week—instead standing up for a government that is about as friendly to gays as your humble columnist is to feminists. But I have yet to hear a senator propose cutting off funding to Students for Justice In Palestine, despite the fact that there is only one country in the Middle East where gay men can serve openly: Israel. Try holding a gay pride parade in “Palestine” and see if you can get two feet before your life is endangered. There is simply no comparison between the policies of the two governments toward gays.
I’m not saying that the U.S. military’s policy is fair. I’m just saying that if the student government is going to banish the army from campus, we ought to banish Students for Justice In Palestine, too.
Also Women’s Initiative.

2010-03-04,AU,Palestine,"The harms of a university-subsidized student Metro discount
I am disappointed to see that in the March 1 staff editorial, “This Metro trip: Courtesy of AU?” the staff of The Eagle wishes to obtain a desired WMATA transit discount through the means of a subsidy from the university’s funds. 
As we all should know, money just doesn’t come out of thin air. If a subsidy were to come from WMATA, they would just be offering a lower rate, cutting into their profits but not actually supplying more than a meager amount of money to apply the subsidy. I understand that WMATA cannot do this though, given their trouble finances, among other things. But should AU ever decide to subsidize student transit, the school would need the money to come from somewhere in order to provide the funds—real money. Where would the money come from and how would AU work to make up that lost cost? The same way any business would: raising prices somewhere. So, in theory, we can all pay $100 less a year to ride the Metro, but we can make up for it in paying an extra $100 a year in tuition. 
Of course those who travel the most would benefit from this, but those who don’t travel daily would lose money. The vast majority of students would be losers. I’m very pro-student discount—but not from AU.

Interfaith Council calls for campus-wide tolerance
AU’s Interfaith Council has noticed a disturbing trend lately. Various student organizations have been targeted for their worldviews or social action, we assume by individuals or by other groups.
Most recently, AU Rationalists and Atheists put up posters for their first general meeting, and within a day or two, most if not all the posters were torn down from dorm announcement boards and other sites. It’s our understanding that AURA has been forced to put up with this intolerance on several occasions. And while AURA is not a faith group, they are a student group based on a well-defined worldview, which I believe is something to be respected.
A member of Students for Justice in Palestine has recently informed me that they have had similar experiences with disappearing posters.
This is not so different from the stories we’ve heard of an individual following another student from a faith group and challenging his beliefs endlessly with derogatory terms and accusations. It’s not so different from disrespectful messages and swastikas drawn in spaces shortly before a sacred service is set to take place.
I believe there is a hidden tension on this campus, a weed of disrespect. I like to think that most people are respectful here, and yet repeatedly I see grown adults being intolerant, self-righteous or downright obnoxious. I do not think that we all have to get along or agree, but there is absolutely no good reason for the level of mutual disrespect that we witness, whether it’s between individuals or groups with different worldviews or political beliefs.
Interfaith Council plans to continue to help students, staff and faculty bridge their differences to reach mutual respect and appreciation. We have already informed AU’s chaplains of our concerns, and we are ready to help mediate any conflicts between individuals or groups. I can be contacted personally at al3281a@student.american.edu.

2010-06-02,AU,Palestine,"Individual rights are too important to let partisanship cloud our judgment. Strangely, this is a hard lesson to teach on our nation’s college campuses.
While the Supreme Court considers whether belief-based student organizations deserve equal rights on campus, two more universities have been facing this very issue. Georgetown University is facing it over a pro-choice group, the University of Arizona over a pro-life group. 
At Arizona, Students for Life’s application for official recognition was initially denied because the group requires that its members share beliefs “that life is sacred and that the intentional killing of human beings through abortion, euthanasia, and murder, and that all forms of eugenics are morally reprehensible.”
Yet, a public university bound by the First Amendment may not deny the basic right to freedom of association, and the university quickly reversed its decision. Universities don’t like to be shown up as hypocritical when it comes to freedom of speech or freedom of association.
The shoe is on the other foot at Georgetown University, which has prevented a pro-choice group from receiving fair treatment on campus. Georgetown is a private university not bound by the First Amendment, but it is bound, morally and contractually, by its own promises. Georgetown entices students by telling them, “A university is many things but central to its being is discourse, discussion, debate: the untrammeled expression of ideas and information.” Georgetown adds that “Catholic and Jesuit tradition, far from limiting or compromising the ideal of free discourse, requires that we live up to that ideal.”
Georgetown is failing to do so. Just ask H*yas for Choice Vice President Erica Slates. She says that her group has about 100 active members with a mailing list of 1,000. They want to be allowed to be an official student organization and get that asterisk out of their name. Georgetown has been saying no.
According to Georgetown’s Vice President for Student Affairs Todd A. Olson, “As a Catholic and Jesuit university, our policies must reflect our identity and our values,” but H*yas for Choice promotes ideas “inconsistent with Roman Catholic moral tradition” and must remain off of the list.
At Georgetown, College Democrats is on the list. Students for Justice in Palestine is, too, and of course, so is Right to Life. Not H*yas for Choice.
What about the great Catholic and Jesuit moral tradition of permitting untrammeled expression, as Georgetown promised?
Besides, the Muslim Students Association and the Jewish Students Association are on the list. Someone should ask Olson how these groups — in both their expression and their conduct — square with the university’s Catholic and Jesuit identity.
According to Georgetown’s Director of Student Programs, Erika L. Cohen-Derr, “Our goals and yours are the same: to provide high quality programs that reflect Georgetown’s diverse community.” Nevertheless, H*yas for Choice is apparently too far beyond the pale to deserve any official university support. So much for reflecting the actual diversity of views at Georgetown.
Wouldn’t a great university want to give students even greater protection to “think the unthinkable, mention the unmentionable,” as Yale University promises, than even the First Amendment offers citizens at large? Why should a university restrict rather than expand the right to free speech?
 H*yas for Choice isn’t even asking for such a noble educational environment as that. It just wants equal treatment under Georgetown’s actual policies.
However you feel about abortion, if you think free speech principles and promises mean anything substantial, you should be protecting the equal rights of pro-life students at Arizona and pro-choice students at Georgetown. How can one group expect equal treatment if it refuses to advocate equal treatment for all, despite fundamental disagreements?
This is a good question for Georgetown and all citizens to take to heart.

2011-04-12,AU,Palestine,"A Student Government resolution recommending AU invest in U.S. companies that are based in or invest in Israel failed after contentious debate April 10.
Even after several revisions, the resolution failed with a vote of 10 senators for, 11 against and seven abstentions. 
Students who supported the resolution said it wasn’t political but rather made financial sense. They felt Israel was a good place to invest because of its strong economic performance during the recession and status as a world creditor, not debtor.
“This is not foreign policy. This is us using our investment money in businesses in Israel,” said College of Arts and Sciences Senator Amy Leazes, the resolution’s sponsor.  
But senators who opposed the resolution felt it was too political.
“It’s wrong for us as the student government body to support such a resolution,” said Class of 2012 Senator Roger Deming. “You can say all you want: ‘This [resolution] to me is just a business transaction.’ But I’m sorry, the Confederate flag is more than a flag.”
Students who are not in the SG voiced their opinions on the resolution during the meeting’s public comment period, before the debate on the legislation.
Former SG President Andy MacCracken, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes investing in U.S. companies that invest in Israel is a sound financial decision. 
“We [AU] have made poor financial decisions in the past. Looking forward, students need to be engaged in how we’re investing our dollars and looking at trends of where it’s most sensible to invest money,” MacCracken said. “Coming out of the financial recession that the world is just recovering from now, Israel is a nation that was least affected.”
Other students disagreed, saying that the economics and politics could not be separated on this issue and that AU support for Israel would be wrong because of Israel’s actions in Palestine.
“I am not interested in AU making financial or institutional profit. I am, on the other hand, very interested in ensuring that the investments that AU does make are in line with socially just and equal principles,” said School of International Service senior Sepideah Mohsenian. “By investing in innovation from Israel, AU is de facto supporting Israeli foreign policy.”
AU spokeswoman Maralee Csellar said AU’s finance office would need to research all funds to determine if the University invests in any companies that invest in Israel.
In 2006, AU’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution saying AU “will not invest directly in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector in Sudan.” The University also notified its investment managers to end any investments in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector.
This resolution is still in effect.

2011-10-11,AU,Palestine,"American University is well known for its inclusion and efforts to unify students from a bevy of diverse backgrounds. From athletics to political speakers to the Westboro Baptist Church Counter Demonstration, the AU community comes together to support our entire community. While we each have our own opinions, our campus renowned for our civility and ability to engage in an open dialogue. 
In this light, the students of American University Students for Israel (AUSFI) do not feel it is appropriate to engage in ATV’s upcoming special program focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The format of this program, asking student leaders their opinions, only creates the potential for a hostile environment. 
AUSFI is the umbrella student organization for Israel life on campus, focusing on educating students on the culture and politics of Israeli society. AUSFI embraces the same values as the AU community; we believe in allowing for an open dialogue in a safe and welcoming environment. Unfortunately, ATV’s proposed program does not provide a welcoming and educational environment in which to engage. We encourage students to remain the well-read and educated leaders for which we are constantly singled out. To outline our position in one simple line: We support direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, without preconditions, with final status compromises that result in peace for both parties living together in harmony.
Nothing productive would come of a debate between two student organizations with differing opinions. It is unfair to pit students against each other, especially about a subject many find so personal. At the end of the day, it is up to the leaders of their respective countries to come to a conclusion. What happens within the upcoming weeks regarding Israel and Palestine will certainly be matters of discussion, but not debate.

2011-12-07,AU,Palestine,"From sleeping on sidewalks to organizing vigils in McPherson Square, AU students in Occupy AU and other student groups are giving their continued support for the Occupy D.C. movement. Here are what each group is doing to support the Occupy movement.
Community Action and Social Justice Coalition
CASJ is leading AU student engagement in Occupy D.C. The coalition acts as an organizing collective for 14 campus clubs that coordinates independent events and directs interested students to clubs within the coalition, according to Mitch Ellmauer, a junior in the School of Public Affairs. 
CASJ started in the 1960s as an anti-war and anti-draft counseling center and is not funded by AU. CASJ clubs including Movement for Global Justice, Student Worker Alliance and Fair Trade Student Association have had student representation at Occupy D.C.
During the first two weeks of Occupy D.C., CASJ had 10 to 12 students and alumni actively participating together in the events, some of which stayed overnight in sleeping bags at the protests. 
“The point is to try to get people to see and know what’s going on in the city in terms of activism,” said Mary Donoghue, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Participation has lately been on a more individual basis and has been less consistent.
“The thing about Occupy is that it’s trendy, so people will go once or twice then lose interest,” said Rachel Mandelbaum, a junior in the School of International Service.
CASJ will be focusing on student democracy next semester, which would include increased student input in University decision making that goes beyond student government. The coalition hopes to put an elected student with voting power on the Board of Trustees.
Students for Justice in Palestine
While many members of Student for Justice in Palestine have participated in the Occupy movement independently, the group helped organize a vigil Nov. 6 in McPherson Square for the victims of Operation Cast Lead, the 2008-2009 war in the Gaza Strip.
The vigil was not an official Occupy D.C. event, but many D.C. occupiers joined in, Steve Demarest, a junior in SPA, wrote in an email.
SJP also protested Israel’s use of Caterpillar bulldozers during Operation Cast Lead to destroy homes, factories, food and water systems, Demarest said. 
“There is a diverse group of political views within the Occupy movement, but I think the one common thread that unites protesters is opposition to corporate abuse, i.e., putting profit over people,” Demarest said.  
Eco-Sense
Eco-Sense has been advocating for sustainability and environment awareness in the Occupy D.C movement. Members volunteer and engage in political activism on environmental issues on campus and in D.C. A handful of Eco-Sense members were recently involved with the Occupy D.C. movement.
Mandelbaum; Megan Lyle, a sophomore in CAS; and other AU students attended the Anti-Tar Sands Keystone XL rally Nov 6. The rally was not directly a part of Occupy D.C., but many occupiers attended it, Lyle said. 
The protest focused on stopping the construction of the Tar Sands Keystone XL pipeline, which could potentially pollute major water supplies and transport tar sands oil that burn dirtier than other oils, according to Mandelbaum. 
The pipeline would stretch across thousands of miles from Canada, through the continental United States, to Texas to transport unrefined oil, Lyle said. 
American Vegan Outreach
American Vegan Outreach has not been directly involved with Occupy D.C., but numerous AU vegans have joined the Occupy D.C. movement, according to Paige McNamara, a sophomore in CAS. 
The Occupy D.C. Declaration directly mentions opposition to factory farms, a key AVO issue, McNamara said. 
McNamara held teach-ins about veganism at Occupy D.C., offering the platform for discussion on why veganism should be a viable option for all people.
“I hope to be able to introduce the idea of veganism as a tool of liberation, not just for animals but for workers, people, consumers to the people at McPherson,” she said. 
McNamara also said sustainable living practices are a major theme at the Occupy D.C. camp. McNamara said it is only natural that veganism will be the next major discussion at Occupy D.C.
Justice Not Jails
The prison reform advocacy group took part in a march from the McPherson Square to a Wells Fargo bank Dec. 2 to protest the bank’s investment in the GEO Group. Demarest said the GEO Group is a private prison company that cuts costs by assigning one doctor for every 1,300 prisoners at the Rivers Correctional Institute, where many D.C. residents are held.
He saw “a decent amount” of people at the protest.
“Once we got to Wells Fargo, many people spoke about their own thoughts and experiences with private prisons and the prison system in general,” Demarest said. 
College Democrats
College Democrats is one of the largest clubs at AU and has differing opinions when it comes to the Occupy D.C. movement, said Chris Litchfield, president of College Democrats and a junior in SPA and CAS. 
College Democrats agrees with Occupy D.C.’s major issues, but not with the methods the group has proposed for solutions, he said.
One of the major issues that College Democrats has focused on is wealth inequality. The Democratic Party is looking for a more equitable tax structure to help shrink the wealth divide between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, Litchfield said. 
“I think there is still a role to play when it comes to advocacy in government,” he said.
He also said he sees a lot of overlay between the future of the Democratic Party and Occupy participants.
“Occupy is not an arm of the Democratic Party, but moving forward, this will be a very defining time,” Litchfield said. “It is nice to see other people than the Democratic Party talking about these issues.”
On campus, College Democrats hosted a panel on debt negotiation Nov. 30 after the failure of Congress’ Super Committee and plans to host events in the near future focusing on student education of important issues facing the United States and AU.

Candles were lit in honor of the victims while Ibraheem Samirah, vice president of AU Jewish Voice for Peace, read the names of victims. The list was eight pages long and included six Israeli names along with 107 Palestinian names, according to Damián Fontanez, a member of AU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The names were intentionally scrambled in order to keep focus on the individuals rather than the ethnicity, according to Bradley Harmon, president of J Street U at AU.  
“We are not here to mourn the loss on one side or another,” he said.
J Street U hosted the event after other chapters of the national organization held similar vigils, according to Harmon.
AU Students for Justice in Palestine, AU Jewish Voice for Peace and Christians United for Israel at AU co-hosted the vigil. 
Prayers from the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths were then read in honor of the dead.
“If we can’t come together on this, we can’t come together on anything,” Harmon said.
Students in attendance found inspiration in the prayer service, according to Elana Friedman, a junior in the School of International Service. 
“When I’m at school I don’t pray,” Friedman said, “so it’s nice to remember we can pray for things to get better.”

2014-12-11,AU,Palestine,"AU terminated its contract with the apparel company JanSport in October, after the company failed to sign an agreement that would hold its factories in Bangladesh to certain fire and building safety standards.
AU End Deathtraps advocated for AU to end all relationships with garment and apparel producers who had not signed on to The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. The accord is an international and binding agreement to protect factory workers, according to Sean Reilly-Wood, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences who is a member of Student Worker Alliance and part of the AU End Deathtraps coalition.
“We won our campaign,” Reilly-Wood said.
The University ended its licensing contracts with Paramount Apparel and Box Seat Clothing and suspended its partnership with JanSport in September, The Eagle previously reported. JanSport is a subsidiary of VF, which is a large corporation based in the United States that does some of its garment production in Bangladesh, Reilly-Wood said.
President Kerwin received recommendations to end AU’s contracts with corporations that had not signed the accord during the spring of 2014. The recommendation came from the University's Project Team on Social Responsibility, Business Practices and Service that was co-chaired by Linda Argo, who is the assistant vice president of external relations and auxiliary services.
The project team began the legal process of terminating its contract with JanSport on Oct. 9 because JanSport was not in compliance with the University's vendor code of conduct, Argo said by email. The process was complete by Oct. 29, according to Argo.
“I write to inform you that the legal process has concluded and our agent has terminated JanSport's license to produce AU-branded collegiate apparel,” Argo said in an Oct. 29 email to the coalition.
AU End Deathtraps is a branch of the national campaign United Students Against Deathtraps. AU’s branch is made up of a coalition of 12 student groups, including American Dream, Amnesty International, AU Gamers, Bhakti Vegetarian Yoga Club, Eco-Sense, French Club, Muslim Student Association, Queers and Allies, Student Worker Alliance, Students for Justice in Palestine, Students for Reproductive Justice and The United Methodist Student Association.
“Most students were supportive of the campaign,” Reilly-Wood said.
The group has been pressuring the University to end AU’s apparel licensing contracts with the three companies since Fall 2013. 
President Neil Kerwin released a memo to the AU community on April 21 that the University would end all contracts for AU apparel licensees with companies that did not sign the accord within the next 30 days, The Eagle previously reported.
“I received a recommendation of the Project Team on Social Responsibility, Business Practices and Service, to amend AU’s vendor code of conduct to address the concerns associated with the apparel industry in Bangladesh,” Kerwin said in the memo. “I have accepted their recommendation.”
Contract terminations with JanSport did not immediately take place after the 30 day window, because the University was still investigating its parent-company VF Corporation’s labor practices in Bangladesh, The Eagle previously reported.
AU End Deathtraps attempted to contact the administration after the announcement, but there was little communication between the administration and students, according to the press release. The coalition delivered a letter to President Kerwin on Sept. 5 concerning the lack of communication, The Eagle previously reported.
The year-long student action is seen as a victory for both students and Bangladeshi workers.
“This sort of campaign makes universities hold their contracts to the standards of the accord,” Reilly-Wood said.

2015-11-12,AU,Palestine,"*Updated: 5:09 p.m. Nov. 14. Corrections and clarification appended. 
The discovery of posters bearing Islamophobic messages on campus Sunday evening has raised concerns about the safety of Muslim students.
The posters mentioned chapters of the Muslim Students Association and Students for Justice in Palestine. One depicts deceased al-Qaeda member Anwar al-Awlaki with a target over his face. The picture on the poster is surrounded by the words, “MSA Terrorist: Head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, President MSA Colorado State” and the hashtag “#StopTheJihadOnCampus.” A 2010 New York Times article confirms that al-Awlaki attended Colorado State, and was the president of the MSA chapter there.
Another poster, which bears the same hashtag, shows a bloody knife hovering over a Jewish star under the words, “The real meaning of BDS: Boycott, Divest, Stab.” This phrase draws a reference to “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions,” a strategy used by Students for Justice in Palestine chapters and other organizations to protest Israel’s political treatment of the Palestinian territories. 
Students found two posters in the tunnel next to Bender Arena and four more on lampposts between Kogod and Katzen.
Aman Abdelhamid, the president of AU’s MSA chapter, said she felt severely troubled by the posters. 
“We’ve been dealing with [Islamophobia] our entire lives, but to come to a school and to have fliers posted like that with threatening images…it’s just so upsetting,” Abdelhamid said.
The posters are linked to “Stop the Jihad on Campus,” a campaign funded by the California-based David Horowitz Freedom Center. A statement that the Office of Campus life e-mailed to the student body Tuesday afternoon connected the posters to the Freedom Center, and the group’s website claims the organization “combats the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror.” 
Horowitz’s materials have appeared on campuses across the country, according to Abdelhamid.
Members of the MSA and SJP found a 44-page manifesto on the website for the “Stop the Jihad on Campus” campaign. The document claims that MSA recruits for al-Qaeda and Hamas. None of this is true, according to Laith Shakir, treasurer of AU’s SJP chapter. Both organizations’ budgets are financed through AU Club Council, he said.
“Not only is all of the information presented here categorically false, it also propagates an exhausted talking point: if you are (or even just look) Muslim, and you're involved in campus organization, you must also be involved in a terrorist group,” Shakir wrote in a Facebook post Sunday night. “Thus, Muslims and people who ‘look Arab’ are inextricably linked to violent extremism. The promoted hashtag isn't trying to just ‘stop the jihad’ (which, itself, is a nonsensical phrase); instead, it's trying to eradicate anyone who could conceivably be labeled as Arab or Muslim from organizing on campus.”
Shakir was one of several students who shared pictures of the flyer on Facebook. Many urged their peers to report the incident to Public Safety. Some also offered to walk with Muslim students who did not feel safe traveling alone, Mokuena said. 
The posters have made Muslim students feel unsafe, according to Abdelhamid.
“I had people calling me [on Sunday], telling me that they were legitimately scared,” she said. “The posters…had really strong implications, really threatening messages.”
The discovery of the posters coincided with instances of Islamophobia on other campuses in the DMV area, Abdelhamid said. The same posters were recently spotted on the Georgetown and George Washington University campuses. At Virginia Tech, students found the message, “On 11/11, we will kill all the Muslims,” written on a bathroom stall, Abdelhamid said. 
The fact that the posters originated from an outside organization, Abdelhamid said, will not be comforting until the people who put them up are identified. 
“The thing is, we don’t know who posted these flyers,” she said. “It was definitely on behalf of that organization, but we don’t know if they sent people from the organization to come on campuses, or whether they recruited actual students.”
On Sunday night, SJP president Ntebo Mokuena brought one of the posters found in the tunnel to the Public Safety office, where she filed a written report. An officer escorted her to the tunnel to take down the other poster there and walked with her to MGC to look for more. She said she was told that officers would be available to escort any students across campus, and that they would search the campus for more posters.
Members of the MSA and SJP raised concerns about the posters in a meeting with representatives from the Kay Spiritual Life Center, Public Safety, Student Activities and the Office of Campus Life Monday afternoon. 
Although officers assured Mokuena and others Sunday night that they would find and remove as many posters as they could, Attai said she saw three posters on lampposts near Kogod, and one on the traffic box near Glover Gate, on Monday morning. Three Public Safety officers were standing near the one on the traffic box, she said, so she assumed it would be taken down. When she passed by the area three hours later, the officers were gone, and the poster was still there. She and a friend took it down themselves, despite fears of being targeted by the people who put them up. Attai said she removed the three on the lampposts as well.
AU Director of Public Relations Kelly Alexander said in an email that the officers did not remove the poster on the traffic box because it was “crazy glued” down, and the traffic box was city property. To avoid damaging the box, Alexander said, the officers requested that the city take the poster down.
Alexander said that a Public Safety officer removed additional posters on the quad near Kogod.
She said that between Sunday and Monday, any poster that Public Safety officers saw or were made aware of were taken down. Posters left up either went unreported or were put up after officers patrolled the area.
Public Safety did not issue an independent public statement or AU alert, despite requests from MSA and SJP members. The University did release a statement on Facebook and Twitter shortly after the posters were discovered.
""AU Public Safety has been doing a really good job reaching out to us and being proactive in terms of dealing with this whole issue. The head of PS has now met with us for the second time to ensure and work with us that our safety and well-being is secure,"" Attai said.
However, both SJP and MSA members said they were concerned by the University’s lack of protocol for dealing with hate speech.
“The University had good intentions, but they said a lot of what is going to be done is going to happen through the community,” Abdelhamid said. “And I understand that … community involvement and awareness is a huge part of the whole situation, but the administration needs to do their part. We need to know that the University knows how to deal with these kinds of threats.”
Shakir said he was also troubled by the University’s response.
“As students and members of a marginalized community, we didn’t know where to go after being specifically targeted with violent messages,” he said. “Part of our hope is that this will serve as a case study for the University going forward, to have a protocol in place to allow students to know how the University will respond to hate crimes before that happens, and to serve as a sort of preventative measure.”
Gail Hanson, the vice president of Campus Life, said AU does not have a hate speech policy. There is a set of Freedom of Expression Guidelines, which she said outlines the cases in which the University can intervene in student speech. 
“Protest or demonstration shall not be discouraged so long as neither force nor the threat of force is used, and so long as the orderly processes of the University are not deliberately obstructed,” the policy states. 
Prohibited “expressions of dissent” include those that “deny or infringe upon the rights of other students, faculty, staff, or guests of the University community…disrupt or interfere with educational or other activities of the University community…[or] endanger the safety of any person on the University campus.”
The guidelines do not apply to people from outside the AU community, Hanson said. In accordance with University policy, only students, staff and faculty are allowed to place posters on campus. The organizations or individuals responsible for the content must make their names visible on all posted materials. Posters put up by outsiders will be removed, Hanson said. 
Shakir said the posters are “emblematic of a much larger mentality” of animosity toward SJP chapters and Islamophobia.
This is not the first time AU’s SJP chapter has encountered hostility, according to Mokuena. She said that the group’s posters are frequently defaced or ripped down.
The MSA, SJP, the University and AU Hillel have issued statements condemning the posters. 
“I am profoundly upset and displeased at the inflammatory posters that went up over the weekend,” University Chaplain Joe Eldridge said in an interview. “It is incumbent on us as an American University community to surround our Muslim brothers and sisters with compassion.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article misattributed the New York Times article and stated that Anwar al-Awlaki was not president of an MSA chapter. He was, at Colorado State.
An earlier version of this article also misstated the number of posters Attai saw near Kogod.
Clarification: This article has been updated with additional information about Public Safety and the University's responses to the posters. It previously said that Pubic Safety did not release a statement, which they did not do independently around the time the posters were found. Campus police were referred to in some statements made by the University shortly after.

2020-11-13,AU,Palestine,"Palestinian social justice event flyer. 
An Arab and Muslim studies professor from San Francisco State University joined American University students for a virtual event on Oct. 29 entitled “The Palestinian Exception to Calls for Social Justice.” 
Rabab Abdulhadi discussed calls for Palestinian human rights in the United States. AU professors Irene Calis and Zein El-Amine co-hosted the event, which Calis referred to as a call for justice.
“It is about the real material consequences of working towards the emancipation of Palestinian life, land and dignity,” Calis said.
Abdulhadi said that people should recognize that criticism of Israel is not the same as anti-Semitism. 
“Israel should not get exceptional treatment because Israel is not exceptional. Palestine is not exceptional,” Abdulhadi said. “The U.S. is not exceptional, and we argue against exceptionalism. This is a question of justice.”
Abdulhadi also discussed her experience fighting against censorship in her line of work and activism. 
The conversation was co-sponsored by various student groups, including but not limited to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), African Students’ Organization and AU Pride. The Department of Sociology and the Department of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies served as academic sponsors of the event. 
Junior Kiran Waqar, a member of SJP, said that the number of co-sponsors was significant in representing the interconnected concern for justice in Palestine, which many students at AU feel passionate about. 
“It can be difficult for a lot of people on American University's campus when they feel like their values aren’t seen in a lot of places,” Waqar said. “I think a really big part of [the event] is community building and showing people that they can speak up for what they believe is right and that they have other people supporting them.”
Junior Aqsa Rashid, also a member of SJP, said another goal of the event was to paint Palestine in a light that students don’t often see at AU, one devoid of the logistics of policy that might constrain conversation and debate. 
“We're not approaching it from that lens,” Rashid said. “We're approaching it like how we can come together as a community that cares about people and justice.” 
Abdulhadi also spoke about how to keep going when activism work becomes frustrating or hopeless. Abdulhadi advised thinking of this work as a “labor of love.”
“Think of what we're doing as coming together to enrich and support each other,” Abdulhadi said. “Of course, it's exhausting to do all of this stuff, day in and day out. But what option do we have? What choice do we have?”
In reflecting on the event, Waqar found Abdulhadi’s words to be a revitalizing path to justice. 
“It's hard to have energy after a long day and on a Team call, but I did,” Waqar said, referring to Microsoft Teams. “I had energy because there was hope, and that hope is a return to self. This was one of the most effective, genuine events I've been to on campus. It felt like I could finally breathe; I didn't realize how much I was holding on my chest.”

2022-02-11,AU,Palestine,"Tzipi Livni, the former Vice Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice for Israel, spoke to American University students in a webinar co-sponsored by the School of Public Affairs and the Center for Israel Studies on Feb. 7.
Livni was the featured speaker at this year’s Amos Perlmutter Memorial Lecture, an annual event held to commemorate Perlmutter, a late scholar of Middle East political leadership and SPA professor.
According to the Center for Israel Studies, Livni is “known for her efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was Israel’s chief negotiator for peace between Israel and the Palestinians during the last two rounds of negotiations.”
The question and answer portion of the webinar was moderated by Saul Newman, the associate dean for Undergraduate Education in the Department of Government at AU.
During the webinar, Livni said she decided to leave politics three years ago after feeling she did not have enough political power to promote continued peace talks between Israel and Palestine.
“This is the right policy for the future of both my sons, but also their generation,” Livni said. “I hope that the time will come and we will see this happening, because the other option, I believe, is not the Zionist option.”
Livni also discussed the “huge gap” between the state of Israel and its perception by the international community.
“For many years, the outside world is looking at Israel through the lenses of the [Palestinian and Israeli] conflict, [and the] sometimes distorted lenses of the conflict,” Livni said. “It also affects the situation in Israel. The nature of democracy, the policy of some Israeli governments affects the relations between Israel and the world. And I believe that we need to open a new dialogue.”
Prior to the event, AU Students for Justice in Palestine released a statement condemning the lecture and Livni’s involvement. As of Feb. 10, the statement has been co-signed by 12 AU student organizations, such as AU Pride, the South Asian Student Association and the Arab Student Association.
According to the AUSJP statement, when Livni was a “key” member of former Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s cabinet, they led a 2008 assault on the Gaza Strip called Operation Cast Lead. The operation led to the deaths of 1400 Palestinians, including 300 children. 
“We call on the university to cancel this lecture and to reckon with its unapologetic support of this settler-colonial and apartheid state, including the disproportionate amount of resources it contributed to an Israeli-centric, and anti-Palestinian, education,” the statement said. “Students for Justice in Palestine will continue to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people until such demands are met and the liberation for all Palestinians is realized.”
AUSJP did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Eagle.
When asked where she draws the line between disagreement with Israeli policy and antisemitism, Livni said that while critizing the Israeli government is legitimate, not accepting the right of Israel to exist is “something completely different.”
“I think that the base is understanding that the Jewish people [have] the rights, historical tradition and international rights to establish and to live in the nation-state of the Jewish people,” Livni said.

2022-11-10,AU,Palestine,"Palestinian writer and spoken word poet Ghadeer Malek shared her work in an online event hosted by American University’s Arab World Studies and Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies on Nov. 1.  
During the discussion moderated by AU Director of Arab World Studies Irene Calis, Malek talked about tackling subjects like displacement, feminism and settler-colonialism as a Palestinian woman. The talk also included poets Shano Mohammed, a Georgetown student in the Master of Arts in Arab Studies program, and AU student Satreen Hendi.  
The event is the second installment of the online speaker series, “Palestine: Land, Life, Dignity,” a collaborative initiative aimed at centering anti-colonial struggles and protecting similar stories from erasure. Malek said portraying this reality and relating it to a larger picture is the basis of her work.  
“What drove me to poetry was the need to express ourselves as Palestinians in particular,” Malek said at the event. “I always joke around with my friends that Palestinians are gaslit from the moment they’re born in the sense that … we’re born into a reality in which [our experience of colonialism] is completely erased.”  
Malek added that poetry, specifically spoken word, has become a vehicle for expressing her anger and resilience at the damage colonialism has inflicted on Palestinian and other Indigenous communities.  
“A lot of my voice at the beginning came out as rants because I was angry as a young Palestinian; angry at the world, angry at colonization,” she said. “I wanted my voice to be heard … and that sort of anger was channeled into spoken word.”  
Born in Palestine, Malek immigrated to Canada in 2003 to study at the University of Toronto, where she became active in student movements supporting Palestinian causes. Her body of work includes the poems “I Exist,” “Revolution to My Earth” and the anthology book “Min Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections of Identity, Space & Resistance,” a collection of writing from multiple authors. Malek said having multiple voices was an integral part of the book.  
“The more voices that come to the table the better they are,” she said, adding that gathering writers from various religious and cultural backgrounds helped her form a community. “That’s why I’m very proud of ‘Min Fami’ … I don’t feel like I’m a single voice talking on my own.”  
In an example of gathering different voices, Mohammed and Hendi both shared poems about overcoming cultural and institutional barriers. Mohammed, who was born in Iraqi Kurdistan, recited her poem about the limitations placed on women in the Middle, East and Sateen delivered a poem centered around the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist killed by Israeli police in May.  
“This is one of my process pieces where I start with an idea or a phrase or something and see where it takes me,” Hendi said. “I talk about the frustration of what it feels like to have to deal with the trauma and the pain of experiencing that situation in real time while also trying to convince people to care about it.”  
While spreading awareness about difficult topics is a central part of her work, Malek said she still grapples with self-doubt about her identity and qualifications as a writer.  
“It’s always a lot of questions and a lot of hesitations in the sense that there’s always a voice underneath our voice … there’s always another voice there questioning,” she said. “I like to call that voice the doubtful voice, the colonizer’s voice, the oppressor’s voice telling us that we’re not good enough.”  
Malek said she combats these feelings by reminding herself, and other Palestinian activists, that her lived experience is more powerful than her doubts. 
“Follow that voice of what you know, because when you write about what you know, the hesitations will still be there … but you can override that voice because you know something that voice doesn’t know, which is that you’re Palestinian,” she said. “Always acknowledge that that voice will come, but you have an inherent knowledge that you can tap into.”

2009-04-09,AU,conservative,"The national teenage birthrate has increased for the second year in a row following a previous 14-year trend of steady decreases.
The rate at which unmarried women who gave birth rose by seven percent between 2006 and 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control National Center for Health Statistics. The same report showed Texas, New Mexico and Mississippi - all states that traditionally vote conservatively - had the three highest number of teen birth rates. In Mississippi, there were 68.4 births for every 1,000 girls aged 15-19. The report did not cover how many pregnancies were terminated.
The consensus among many experts is that nobody is certain as to what is causing the sudden rise in unplanned pregnancies, although authorities on both ends of the ideological divide have voiced their opinions.
""With any kind of contraceptive there's a risk involved,"" Karin Thornton, AU's associate Catholic chaplain, said in response to the report. The Roman Catholic Church and the federal government both advocate for abstinence-only programs. Under President Barack Obama, the programs could receive significant funding cuts, according to The Washington Post.
Critics of these programs argue that abstinence-only programs do not always provide a complete and effective education.
""I think it's pretty clear from a number of independent research studies that abstinence-only education is not particularly helpful to students,"" said Women's Initiative Director Ashley Evans. 
Evans said that although she supports a person's right to abstain, she also emphasized the need to get all the information.
""'Abstinence-plus' programs would be a more comprehensive solution,"" she said.
While she said she supports a complete education, Thornton said she did not know about other programs outside of her area.
""I don't know the matter of the education is because I haven't listened to their particular plan,"" Thornton said.
Evans and Thornton chose not to comment on the CDC's report, but were happy to share their views on the general topic.
Parents have a role in their children's actions, said Rebecca Hsieh, a graduate student in the School of Public Affairs' Justice, Law and Society program.
""I feel that's where parents really need to intervene and talk with their kids and realize what they're going through because it's ultimately the kid's decision,"" she said.
Women's Initiative will host ""I Heart the Female Orgasm,"" a sex-education presentation put on by authors Dorian Solot and Marshall Miller, on April 24.
While the program is part of a national movement, Evans said she encourages men to attend, calling the event ""the climax of the year.""

2009-09-10,AU,conservative,"As I watched Ted Kennedy laid to rest at the end of August, I found myself thinking about 1987. That was the year Kennedy castigated Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. During Bork's hearings, Kennedy said, ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government."" In retrospect, many people think Kennedy's speech was the beginning of the end for Bork. Critics also charge that the harshness of his words caused of our current culture war. Maybe so. As recently as Aug. 28 of this year, The New York Times ran an editorial stating as much.
Whether or not he caused it, Kennedy certainly was on the right side of the culture war. Like all good progressives, he battled social conservatives who seek to suppress anything they personally find un-Christian, immoral or inconsistent with traditional American values. It is a struggle that still rages today.
The current Virginia gubernatorial race is rife with culture clash. The Washington Post recently reported on Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's college thesis for Regent University (Pat Robertson's school). In said thesis, McDonnell writes that working women are ""detrimental"" to families. He argues that government should prefer married couples to ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.""  He also calls a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing contraception for unmarried couples ""illogical."" He wrote that at age 34. McDonnell is starting to look like George Allen, a Virginia Republican whose 2006 Senate re-election campaign was eventually derailed when he was caught using an ethnic slur.
The Democratic National Committee has released a statement on this issue and its wording sounds familiar. It makes reference to ""Bob McDonnell's preferred Virginia,"" and pundits are already describing Democratic attacks on the thesis as ""Borking"" McDonnell. ""Borking"" is the term Republicans created for when Democrats show their backwards-looking nominees and candidates for what they really are. This entire episode illustrates why despite Democratic struggles, the Republican Party is far away from returning to power. And why? Perhaps because the GOP is a party made up of white men looking out for the interest of white men.
The problem for Republicans is that the number of white men in America continues to decline. Women outnumber them today, and in just a few decades there will be no racial majority in America. The election of a black man who campaigned on the change undercuts the decades-old GOP strategy of appealing to certain white, male fears. There are still plenty of scared white men. They are the armed nuts you see at town halls, and they would love to live in Robert Bork's America. But let us always remember Ted Kennedy. As we look around at our country as it exists now, not in a Republican fantasy of yesteryear, let us realize something. We don't live in Robert Bork's America. We live, mostly, in the America of Ted Kennedy's dreams.

2009-10-12,AU,conservative,"Clarification Appended
It’s always tough to talk about abortion. It’s a divisive issue on which many good people vehemently disagree. This is true at American as it is across America. On our campus, the Students For Life and Students For Choice organizations both thrive. Both are big; both are active. The abortion debate plays out articulately and passionately, to the credit of all involved. 
This newspaper has no plans to take sides in this struggle, especially because there is diversity of opinion among our editorial board. However, we are supportive of advancing honest and open discourse on this issue, which is why we appreciate the panel discussion AU Students For Choice hosted this past week.
Clearly, “Exposing Fake Clinics” was a pro-abortion rights affair. Wednesday’s panel featured representatives from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, the National Abortion Federation and the Feminist Majority Foundation. It’s safe to say none of these organizations advocate overturning Roe v. Wade or supporting Sarah Palin for president in 2012. Still, social conservatives can and should learn from them. The panel exposed disturbing misinformation campaigns on the part of anti-abortion rights activists, which undermine the anti-abortion cause and embolden pro-abortion rights activists. More importantly, they are harmful to American women, pro-life and pro-choice alike.
According to a Sept. 21 press release from Feminist Majority Foundation, many anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers in this country use “misinformation, fear and shame tactics to coerce and intimidate women out of considering abortion as an option.” Some call condoms a “con job,” completely misrepresenting their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and disease. Additionally, some CPCs distribute pamphlets that claim abortion leads to an increased risk of breast cancer. The World Health Organization refutes this claim completely.
To be fair, pro-abortion rights organizations can also be guilty of stretching the truth and omitting information harmful to their cause. This should go without saying. But no serious activist on either side of this issue would justify bad behavior by pointing to more bad behavior. In fact, most activists on both sides of this issue would probably agree on a few things.
Given that abortion remains legal in this country, women should be able to access a wide range of accurate information on this sensitive topic. Social conservatives should stop their scare tactics and misinformation. Social liberals should be honest about abortion’s physical and emotional consequences. Abortions are not a walk in the park. They can be gruesome and they raise troubling moral and ethical questions for an increasing number of Americans, including an increasing number of young people.
This issue is divisive and emotional. For many, gray area simply does not exist. But this is all the more reason why our campus and our country deserve an honest, substantive debate. The abortion argument should never be reduced to competing smear campaigns. Precisely because we cannot render this culture war unnecessary, America must fight it fairly. 
Clarification: The term ""pro-abortion"" was inappropriately used several times in this editorial and should have been ""pro-abortion rights."" This version of the editorial has been changed to reflect this.

2011-11-08,AU,conservative,"Just as one might wake up with a hangover after New Year’s, the government wakes up with a hangover at the beginning of a new fiscal year, said Heritage Foundation economic expert Alison Fraser.
Comparing the fiscal year to New Year’s Day, Fraser spoke about the current state of the economy at an AU College Republicans event Nov. 1
“Our hangover for the federal government is our debt,” she said. 
Fraser spoke to an audience of around 15 students in the University Club. Her organization, the Heritage Foundation, conducts conservative public policy research.
Fraser also discussed specific economic problems facing the United States and potential solutions to these problems.
“We are seeing a dramatic increase in the size and scope of our debt,” she said.  
America’s debt will only get worse with the direction the United States is headed in now, she said.  
“Our lesson learned, if any, from the EU’s experiences is that we are just a couple of years behind having to deal with the same issues,” she said.  
After explaining the issues, Fraser talked about solutions that the Heritage Foundation has supported in the past.  
“I would do it all on the spending side without raising taxes,” she said. “Rather than taxing the rich, I would rather take away their benefits,” referring to Social Security and Medicare.
Taxes make economic growth more difficult, she said.
“We’ve got to do this in a way that makes everyone’s future brighter,” Fraser said.
Fraser encouraged the students in attendance to talk to their parents and grandparents about these issues over Thanksgiving. 
She challenged students to ask them, “What are you going to do to help me?” 
“A lot of these solutions are going to rely on us having a conversation,” she said. 	
The solutions Fraser proposed seemed to resonate with many of the students at the event.  
“I really think she made a lot of sense,” said Ella Davis, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. “She had some really good ideas for the economy in the long term.”  
Charles Merrick, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, had a different opinion. 
“I generally liked the speech,” Merrick said. “I didn’t necessarily agree with things, but they made their points well.”  
Merrick said he was invited to the event by some of his Republican friends and attended because of his interest in economics.  
“It’s important to be open to other opinions,” he said.

2011-11-09,AU,conservative,"•This Rant is currently longer than my paper due Friday. :/
•These hands don't even look like mine anymore.
•I always thought SPA Leadership was like the honors program (i.e. useless and annoying) but without the scholarships … I may put up with crap but at least my tuition is free? Oh, I guess you guys did sell us Taco Bell a couple times freshman year … I did enjoy that. Is there a financial reason to stay in the program … If not, why don't you disgruntled folks bail?
•Dear ""Every time I try to get “Beauty and the Beast” out of the library, it’s checked out. I need to meet my fellow Disney-lovers."" I'm the one who had it checked out! It's my favorite movie of all time! Let's be best friends?
•What if we had Eagle Rants categories like ""relationship rants,"" ""roommate and friend rants,” ""school rants,” etc.?
•Eagle sucks for getting rid of anonymous commenting two years ago. Now no one comments on articles or Rants because they don't want to register. And now no one gives me advice on the issues I rant about. And Eagle still doesn't have an anonymous advice column. Major fail.
•@SHINee and U-Kiss fan: If you're cool with 2NE1, Brown-Eyed Girls, Outsider and BIGBANG, you might be interested in hanging out with my roommate and I. Our room=K-Pop zone
•True bliss is finding someone that you love more than you could ever possibly love yourself, and knowing they feel exactly the same way. That they would take a bullet for you because they would rather die than live without you. I'm not much for bragging, but that's what I have and that's why I'll always be happy :)
•Men: Stop encroaching on my space in class! You are not entitled to any more desk space than any other student, so CLOSE YOUR LEGS!
•""I’m trapped in a cycle of slothfulness followed by frantic work, all wrapped up in self-loathing and despair. Hello senior year …""
•I feel you completely. As a freshman.
•I just read CS's op-ed, ""Six packs are no match for social norms,"" and it was so well-written that I became instantly turned on by him. I've never met him but I want to now … badly. Find me, stat.
•I only read Eagle Rants to make sure people aren't ranting about me
•""You know your life is strange when you’re excited to go back to OHIO so that you can Rant about Korean pop music/dramas. V.V I need more Kpop friends at AU so that I can blast some SHINee and U-Kiss with them <3"" 
•Who the heck from Ohio listens to Korean Pop????
•You're an amazing photographer … I think that's sexy. We should hookup again sometime.
•I don't want to listen to you talk with your dad. I don't want to wave at people on Skype every time I walk in. I don't want to hear the awkward breaks in conversation when the door opens. Thanks. Now I know what grades you got on your tests … This isn't high school, sweetie. I don't care.
•I am sick of the trust fund babies in the school spending their parents’ money while not learning a thing. I can’t afford to have AU friends
•That was NOT AVOCADO that I just ate. I don't know what it was, but it was NOT AVOCADO.
•Ironic how ""Pronto"" takes a long time to make paninis.
•""Yes"" does not count as ""words of affirmation.” You need to read ""The Five Love Languages,” Eagle Rants Editor. I need to be told how special I am.
[Editor’s note: You’re special.]
•Can someone please start a Disney movie appreciation club, during which we watch Disney movies once a week and then maybe play a board game of Disney Trivia? This would make my life.
•The clothes you lent me are going where they belong … with the homeless guy by Z-Burger.

That's infinitely worse than typing it anywhere that's not Twitter. And stop complain about living in the 'privileged' world, dignity people geez …

•I'm so horny I could cry. You're a guy AND my boyfriend; that means you should always be down to have sex with me. Am I dating the only guy on the planet that doesn't want to have sex daily???
•Berlin from Salsa dressed up as Lady Gaga in her bubble costume. This officially makes her the most epically awesome person ever.
•To paraphrase a “Friends” episodes, I haven't had sex, I'm worried it's changed and I haven't gotten the memo.
•So my best guy friend is totally awesome, but lonely and single. And my best girlfriend is totally awesome yet lonely and single. Yet neither one is interested in being set up with the other.
•We had a really legit, albeit drunken, conversation the other night. Because AU social life is weird, I'll probably never see you again.
•Just when I was starting to feel good about my body for once … I start feeling fat again.
•""asdfjkl;"" Should be officially added to the dictionary. I know of no other words to describe the feeling ""asdfjkl;"" describes.
•Death to all past ignorant Eagle Rants. This is to address some of the most idiotic rants I've read in the past.
•1. TDR, Tavern and Aramark workers are NOT your personal maids. Stop complaining that they do not bow down to your over-sized egos. We're all big kids now; clean up after yourself.
2. Why is the ""suspect"" in almost every ""crime alert"" described to be a tall African-American male? AU you need to step up your creativity.
3. Congratulations to American University's increase in diversity … I'm no longer the ONLY black person in class. There's two of us now!
•I wonder how many rants I can get published in one day …
•Is it ironic that I am procrastinating on my Civil Disobedience readings by ranting?
•Students, when you are in TDR and drop a utensil or food DO NOT try to pick it up quickly and put it back. You are not slick. Most likely someone will see you and call you out.
•Also, when hovering over food do not sneeze or cough period. But at least, if you have to, cover your mouth. Cough into your elbows, not your hands then try to touch all over the food that we all have to eat. Who raised you? Cover it up!
•Oh no no nooooo don't funk with my heaaaart.
•Lunch at Tenley Cafe is seriously underrated. Stir-fry FTW!
•Laundry Thef t(caution this is a true story):
•If I'm doing my laundry and I come back three minutes after my laundry is finished, DO NOT touch my clothes. At the same token, do not leave your laundry in the machine all day. And do not go shopping through people's laundry. I’ve been robbed of half of my wardrobe and I'm sick of it! If I find you wearing my shirt that I've had since gymnastics in the 7th grade, I will find you and it will not be pretty.
•Free things from Panera: baguette, coffee thermos, cookies. It's like they're compensating for something …
•Dear Cars in Ward Circle,
Do NOT honk and curse at me when I cross in the crosswalk when my light is green and your light is red. Next time I will jump on the hood of your car and proceed to imitate a gorilla until you understand that red means stop.

•To the Phonathon inquirer: actually, both. 
•Dear AU Central, why do I have to come to your office and communicate with people who do not know what they're talking about? Talking in circles about nothing? Yeah, real helpful, guys. On top of that, why do I have to stand in front of the entire office like a convicted felon trying to get on parole, while you scream all my business so loudly? Like, what happened to confidentiality? I think the whole office overheard my Social Security number, birthplace and future college debt, yeah. Thanks, AU central.
•Shout out to all the classes with deceivingly cool titles but consist of lousy professors, boring material and long unnecessary readings. For example ""The Roots of Racism.”

Throughout the past two weeks, Herman Cain has weathered multiple accusations the he sexual harassed multiple women while the CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Four different women have alleged that Cain acted inappropriately toward them, while two went public this week.

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

Throughout the past two weeks, Herman Cain has weathered multiple accusations the he sexual harassed multiple women while the CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Four different women have alleged that Cain acted inappropriately toward them, while two went public this week. Yet despite the media firestorm, Cain remains a republican front runner, only a few points behind Mitt Romney. Why has Cain been able to whether the scandal? How should people react to sexual harassment allegations? Our Quick Take columnists weigh in:

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?
•@""You know how girls get, right?"" Yes, I do, because I AM a girl, and I hate girls who make excuses for not having a handle on their emotions. Is it your time of the month, sweetheart? It's mine too, you don't see me sobbing and yelling and freaking out - take some Midol and get over yourself!""

•Hey what's with the hating on Letts  4 North? Sure almost everything has broken at some point, but at least our floor is tight
•Why in the hell have the Eagle Rants gotten so pitiful and scathing? I remember the last time I sniped someone's grammar just to be an ass; I remember the last time I ignorantly bashed on someone's religious beliefs and politics. Seriously people, rants are NOT for:

-Poetry
-Public policy debate
-Being a dick
-Etc...

I'll have you know that students in both halls took the challenge quite seriously and purposefully reduced unnecessary electricity use, even going so far as to unplug the vending machines. So thanks for mocking us.
•Why is it that being a conservative at AU automatically makes everyone hate you? I'm not rude to you about your political beliefs, don't be rude to me about mine. And for the record, conservative =/= republican.

And also, stop answering other students' questions before the professor gets to them; I'm paying over $100 a class to learn from HIM, not some prissy-assed girl who thinks she knows more than the man with the Ph.D. in the front of the room.
•Dear next door neighbor: I'm super delighted you like playing electric guitar so much but it would be awesome if you could do it less than FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK and maybe turn your amp down a little, plug in some headphones or realize that we hear you ALL THE TIME I especially enjoy it when you stop playing guitar and just start singing at the top of your lungs, it really brightens my day

•Before I started lifting weights I was like a 120 lb. virgin.. As soon as I touched my first weight it was like BOOM, still a virgin
•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?
•@""You know how girls get, right?"" Yes, I do, because I AM a girl, and I hate girls who make excuses for not having a handle on their emotions. Is it your time of the month, sweetheart? It's mine too, you don't see me sobbing and yelling and freaking out - take some Midol and get over yourself!""

•Hey what's with the hating on Letts  4 North? Sure almost everything has broken at some point, but at least our floor is tight
•Why in the hell have the Eagle Rants gotten so pitiful and scathing? I remember the last time I sniped someone's grammar just to be an ass; I remember the last time I ignorantly bashed on someone's religious beliefs and politics. Seriously people, rants are NOT for:
-Relationship classifieds
-Poetry
-Public policy debate
-Being a dick
-Etc...
So, let's get this nice and crystal clear: play nice, play fair, and don't be a complete tool. Sincerely,

Stop thinking and acting as if you're better than everyone else.  You're not.  And also, stop answering other students' questions before the professor gets to them; I'm paying over $100 a class to learn from HIM, not some prissy-assed girl who thinks she knows more than the man with the Ph.D. in the front of the room.
•Dear next door neighbor: I'm super delighted you like playing electric guitar so much but it would be awesome if you could do it less than FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK and maybe turn your amp down a little, plug in some headphones or realize that we hear you ALL THE TIME I especially enjoy it when you stop playing guitar and just start singing at the top of your lungs, it really brightens my day

•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.

•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@""try to get laid right now"" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out.

•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because ""you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide"": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@""Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,

Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ ""Good Christians aren't Republican"":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@""(but of course I have to come back...)"" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.

•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.

•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive).

How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.

•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.

•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

•If you're an Econ MASTERS student you should be able to pronounce ARBITRAGE.
•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you ""down there"", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.
•I love how upper-middle class whites concur in their smug fawning over Nicholas Kristof...nicely done ER editor
•Dear Roommate: The phone is an incredible invention. Believe it or not, you DON'T need to yell loud enough for your mother in Colorado to hear you without the technology. Indoor voice, darling.
•A jog for a first date in the winter...bad idea. Maybe during Cherry blossom time...maybe. Assuming the chick is fit and let's be honest....this is AU we're talking about so that's as likely as correctly formatted rants.
•True that to the long distance relationship comment. Absolutely the single dumbest thing a person can do while in college. #regretslaterinlife

•Dear ""#richgirlproblems"" whose trust fund hasn't come in yet,

•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!

•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.

•@""That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.""

•@#winning...I don't believe you.
•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.
[Editor’s note: The writers of the sex column this fall and last year both used their real names. The lack of anonymity was not a deterrent for them.]
•Dear girl worried you are his booty call: If his facebook doesn't list you as his girlfriend and you are hooking up with him, you're his booty call.
•@""You're wrong to have a long distance relationship"" Sorry you're jealous that your long distance relationship didn't work out while other people's did. I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for 4 years now. 4 more years to go while as my bf just started med school. And I have no doubt at all that we will make it.
•@""All the normal people who read these"" First off, it's sad that you pride yourself on being ""normal"". Have fun with your average life. Secondly, actually eagle rants were created exactly for relationship issues and policy debates. Get a clue.
•That time where you think you might be pregnant during finals...EFF my life.
•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH."" You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.
•Women needs to quit trying to make the marginalized male population from conforming to their standards.

•@Aspiring drag queen: Athena's on facebook, friend her!

•This I feel like is a legitimate complaint, why doenst AU have a Fall/Spring Fest type weekend, or day, where we bring a cool musical act to campus, and have them perform on the quad? Plenty of other schools have this, and it seems awesome.
•I keep seeing rants that sound exactly like they could be my ex and getting mildly concerned....

•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!

• This is a campus with students who are actually conservative, think they are liberal, say they are moderates, vote democrat, and at the end of the day are disgustingly apathetic and unsure of themselves.
• Dear guy in SIS who thought his headphones were plugged in but was actually just playing music really loudly: That was hilarious and thanks for looking rightfully embarrassed when you realized your mistake!
• To straight female conservative republican. Wow I wasn't even trying to be mean with that first post. You have your whole life to be a racist, bible-quoting, million(miscalculated) mom joining, human rights offender. Why start in college? Keep pretending that your conservative boyfriend doesn't hate gay people because he's in the closet himself. Or that his huge gun makes up for his less than adequate bedroom abilities. If I could legally spit on you I would.

• @”facebook timeline advocate: I love the concept of the timeline, but there are a few really annoying bugs in it that I can’t figure out.  On the “map” feature, whenever I click on a city I have been to it only lets me add a single year. What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.
• @""To be honest, the whole concept of Greek life families really just annoys me..."" Couldn't agree more. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. Your right, where are their priorities?
• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.
[Editor’s Note: I just delete them when they use curse words]
• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!

• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.

I choose to live a healthy lifestyle and do not appreciate people who selfishly release their toxic fumes into my walking path when they could just as easily get their high from a nicotine patch and thereby avoid harming others with their decisions. I try my best not to make decisions that harm others, and I expect the same respect from others.

Actually I have plenty of sex with my amazing girlfriend, thanks for asking.  But I’m glad you view your sluttiness and impulsivity as an accomplishment.  And I admire virgins for waiting for the right person instead of giving it up at a trashy frat party. But I don’t even know why I am bothering to argue with someone who clearly lacks basic human decency towards others and doesn’t care if they blow toxic fumes at innocent bystanders.
• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.

[Editor’s Note: Probably not. Maybe once on Wednesday]
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.

• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]

• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.

• “And if you ACTUALLY knew what you were talking about, you’d know that unless a person’s habits and actions are affecting their, or another’s, day to day life, they dont have a problem.

• Can everyone just live and let live? Just quit judging people and just BE? But I guess then there wouldn't be any Eagle Rants...
• Last semester, I had a great time at AU without out-of-class friends.  This semester, I got some and had a blast hanging out with them.  Then they randomly quit talking to me.  Now I feel super down on myself and am not having a good time at all.  Hopefully being around people who actually like me back home over break will help my confidence, because I feel really sh*tty right now...

I know it existed as of last semester, at least.  I'm pretty sure it's still going on now.  HOWEVER, I run a completely different club, and I can tell you from experience that those ""official"" email addresses usually don't get checked very often.  Your best bet is to find someone who's in it already that can give you the details.

They are mega comfortable. If you by a good quality pair (which doesn't have to be anywhere near expensive), they won't be so tight and revealing. And my boyfriend loves when I wear them, so wins all around!

• @• ""I’m sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished...""

• Regarding the smoking issue:Its irrelevant whether or not smoking is addicting or dangerous. I'm sorry, but if you really are so terrified of second-hand smoke that you cant stand to be around it, then you should have gone to a non-smoking school, instead of making everyone conform to you. This is a matter of liberty. People have the right to do what they want to their body. You do not have the authority to limit people's free choices. Plain and simple.

2012-04-11,AU,conservative,"Usually, when I begin to question college—its reason for existence, my role within it, etc.—I think about “Accepted” (the teen comedy film that came out a few years ago). If you haven’t happened to catch one of its repeated airings on various cable networks, it’s a movie that essentially mocks the entire higher education system. 
Frustrated with the college application process, a few high school seniors decide to forge acceptance from a fake university in order to please their parents. Eventually, their schemes unintentionally lead to the creation of an entirely student-run university, which is refurbished out of an abandoned mental institution. 
While their university becomes subject to a lawsuit by an accredited university, the Hollywood ending reassures us with a victory for the students, who eventually gain official recognition by the board of education. 
Although it may seem like a far-fetched pipe dream, the students in the film display a sense of unified, collective agency that is hard to imagine ever formulating on this campus. 
However, even though I criticize it, I am fully aware that achieving our potential for collective agency is probably the most challenging struggle we can ever face as students. It is a struggle that must be fought not only within the university’s parameters but outside, in the greater societal framework as well.
In May 1968, French students were at the forefront of uprisings that brought university and factory operations to a complete standstill. Groups of student revolutionaries, who espoused ideals of the Situationist International movement, agitated the French population into staging one of the largest general strikes ever recorded in history. Inspired by Marxist ideology, the students were fiercely critical of late-stage capitalism and the alienation it caused between human relationships. 
Two years prior to the strike, students at the University of Strasbourg stirred up a great deal of controversy when they published a pamphlet titled “On the Poverty of Student Life.” 
The students were expelled after printing and distributing about 10,000 copies of the pamphlet, which aggressively promoted Situationist philosophies and called upon students to reclaim their humanity from the mind-numbing depths of the prevailing capitalist system.    
Here is an excerpt from the pamphlet, translated from French, which outlines the students’ views on their predetermined roles:
“Modern capitalism and its spectacle allot everyone a specific role in a general passivity. The student is no exception to the rule. He has a provisional part to play, a rehearsal for his final role as an element in market society as conservative as the rest. Being a student is a form of initiation.”
This past Saturday, I attended a discussion group right here on the campus Quad. Organized as part of the new “Occupy the Classroom” learning collective series, a group of about 30 students met to discuss the topic at hand: our university education within the context of race, class and gender/sexuality.  
Before you jump into skeptical critiques that usually turn up when the “Occupy” label is placed on anything, you should realize that everything we discussed deeply affects all of us as lifelong patrons of institutionalized education.  
Ultimately, our discussions generated a few common themes. 
I noticed that a recurring theme was the existence of a hierarchical and highly individualized structure, which promotes education as a product to be consumed as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, I sensed a deeper frustration with this consumption narrative that seems to dominate all facets of our university education. 
Just as the Situationists declared in 1966, being a student today still seems to resemble taking part in a rehearsal for our future role as passive consumers in the market. They observed, “The student leads a double life, poised between his present status and his future role.”
So, it really comes down to a choice we must make as students. We can simply participate in the charade, reading off our well-memorized lines. Or, we can decide to use our collective agency to subvert the play itself and fulfill our truest desires as we struggle to reclaim our human dignity.

•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.

•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left.

•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth.

But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology. Like where you could click a rant and reply to it anonymously and then the person who originally submitted the rant could look at all the anonymous replies and reply to them. Awesomesauce
•morning rants are da bomb
•@”I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.
•It's always nice to pay for a class where the teacher doesn't teach.  Particularly an elementary mathematical modeling class where you have to find your own practice problems on the internet.
•@”What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to. Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married” This is a very logical feminist position. If only the Women’s Initiative were actually this logical.
•P.S. Please pass me elementary mathematical modeling teacher, even though you can't teach...
•Editor: About how many rants are submitted each day that break the rules and are not posted? jw
[Editor's note: Usually only a few. Depends on the day though. This editor can tell its finals season because Rants are getting angry!]
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling.  You make math tutors angry.
•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...
•If you're a guy, Take Back the Night is about realizing how many people you know are survivors and how oblivious you were.
•Loving whoever it was that posted La Cage aux Folles lyrics.
When the world spins too fast
And your bubble has burst
Someone puts himself last
So that you can come first

•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..
•to the ranter who started with ""If you were my girlfriend"" ILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. I'm not actually desperate and I don't really want a relationship you seem like a genuinely nice guy, sometimes hard to find here
•To the lady who just called out a room of girls being too loud: rock on.
•@@where do Au students go to party? : ""Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm ""glad"" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•""@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

•The Eagle should learn to stop editing the work of contributing writers when it doesn't have any grammatical errors. The editor completely mangled a key sentence in my article.
[Editor's note: We edit any submissions for clarity, relativity, length and profanity, in addition to grammar and AP Style. But send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we'll look into it. Also, this editor doesn't know who you are or what you wrote, but just wants to point out that Eagle Contributing Writers are part of The Eagle staff who have written a handful of articles; content submitted by members of the AU community to the Opinion page is not written by ""contributing writers;"" it's written by people who submit content and, thus, do not have the title ""contributing writer.""]

I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.
•No gorganzola on my turkey cranberry salad from the Tavern?!! Oh HELL NO!! THIS WILL NOT STAND.

•What is a Pitt bomb threat? Can someone please explain this?
-confused alum
[Editor's note: This editor thinks they mean the recent string of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh.]
•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.

2012-11-09,AU,conservative,"Two filmmakers want you to know that the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lies. 
At least, that’s what filmmaker Oliver Stone and AU Professor Peter Kuznick’s new documentary series wants you to believe. Stone and Kuznick screened an episode of their 10-part documentary series, “The Untold History of America,” and answered questions about the upcoming show and book at Ward on Nov. 8.
Stone is known for making politically charged films, so the pairing for the documentary makes perfect sense. His film “W,” which highlights the personal issues of President George W. Bush, made a splash in 2008, while his earlier military-driven films “Born on the Fourth of July” and “Platoon” were nominated for Oscars in the late ‘80s (with “Platoon” actually taking home the golden statue for Best Picture in 1986). 
Kuznick introduced the series as a “history of the American empire” ranging from World War I to present day, including the presidency of Barack Obama.  
The series, beginning Nov. 12 airing at 8p.m. on Mondays on Showtime, aims to “puncture the common American myths,” Kuznick said. It began as one documentary, based on the 1944 Democratic Convention when President Harry Truman was chosen to be on the ticket above the favorite, Henry Wallace.
The general idea behind exposing this injustice was to highlight the fact that had Wallace, a vocal supporter of equality and peace, been chosen, he could have gone on to become president and avoided Truman’s mistakes.
The first episode, shown at the event on campus, was about Truman’s decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The episode argues that Truman lied to the American people, making them believe that the bombs were necessary to win the war when the Japanese had surrendered three months earlier.
Kuznick and Stone have been working on the project for about eleven years, 11 of which were for filming, since the movie required extensive research. During that time, they also collaborated in the classroom, with Kuznick teaching a course titled “Oliver Stone’s America” at AU. 
The documentary project started when Stone sat in on one of Kuznick’s class and heard the story of Wallace. Stone was immediately hooked, saying he “could not get the story out of his head for years.”
Stone was raised in a conservative household and dropped out of Yale University to volunteer in Vietnam. Kuznick pointed out that several of Stone’s friends from the war claim that he even saved their lives. 
In regards to handling criticism, Stone said he is “empathetic towards these political figures, not sympathetic…and there’s a difference.”
The project was important to Stone because he “felt the urge to do something while [he] is still alive.”
“Only 12 percent of Americans are proficient in U.S. history, and the little that people do know, it’s often wrong,” Kuznick said. “That’s what we’re trying to combat.”
“It’s better to know the truth before you die,” Stone said, “or at least some version that’s a little closer to the truth.”

• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums. And yes. He's accountable to a Board of Trustees. It's how the real world works, and it's designed to benefit you to the fullest. Get. Over. It. 
• The CAUS is annoying, skews facts to fit their worldview, underlines the obvious and managed to disturb every single person on campus tonight. I rarely side with the establishment, but seriously, come on. If you wanted to have a stake in your tuition, it make sense to go to a public university.

2014-03-08,AU,conservative,"The water delivered to parts of Northwest D.C. was declared safe to drink at 11:30 a.m. March 7, according to the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority. This lifted the March 5 boil-water advisory that affected more than 1,000 nearby homes and businesses, including AU. 
The water management service tested the water at several sites and at multiple times to ensure that all affected areas were now safe, according to a D.C. Water press release.
D.C. Water advised residents at AU on March 5 to boil water before use due to a power outage at the Ft. Reno pumping station. Ft. Reno is located one and a half miles from the AU campus. The reason for the power outage has not yet been reported.
The areas affected are all uphill of the Ft. Reno pumping station, causing those areas to lose water pressure when the station lost power March 5. D.C. Water was not able to send bacterial disinfectant to parts of Northwest D.C., creating concerns of chloroform contamination in the pipes, even when normal water pressure returned, Nicole Condon, D.C. Water’s water communications coordinator said.
Condon said the boundaries of the potential affected area were “conservative” to ensure the safety of anyone living in potentially impacted areas.
Ingesting chloroform can lead to gastrointestinal issues, including vomiting and diarrhea, Condon said. It was safe to shower as long as the water was not ingested, according to D.C. Water. 
University buys water for campus
AU responded to the advisory by distributing 5,900 water bottles, more than 830 gallons, to students, Camille Lepre, assistant vice president of communications, said in an email to The Eagle.
The supplies arrived the morning of March 6, and residence hall staff distributed the water to on-campus residents, Vice President of Communication Terry Flannery said in an email to the AU community. 
AU gave out three water bottles to each main campus resident, Flannery said. AU also sent more bottled water to the Eagle’s Nest and the Campus Store. 
Some on-campus eateries closed March 6 due to the advisory, including
●	Freshii
●	Global Fresh
●	The Davenport Coffee Lounge
●	Starbucks 
These food locations served food, but did not offer fountain beverages or coffee:
●	Elevation Burger, 
●	Subway and
●	Einstein Bagel Bros.
Elevation Burger provided canned soda or a bottle of water to any customer who bought a meal.
Megabytes didn’t sell any coffee or non-bottled water products, owner Tom Gera said. Megabytes was getting ice from outside sources, he said.
Nobody reported illnesses related to the water advisory to AU, according to Flannery. 
“D.C. Water assures us that there is no contamination of the system,” Flannery said in a memo to the AU community March 6. “This water advisory is a necessary health and safety precaution. We are taking steps to provide campus residents with drinking water and to advise faculty, staff, non-resident students and visitors what precautions to take, until the advisory is lifted.”
The Terrace Dining Room was open and was “taking appropriate precautions for food preparation,” Lepre said.
Specific AU areas not affected by advisory
D.C. Water released its original advisory around 6:30 p.m., Condon said. 
AU did not separately notify the campus community until 8 p.m. AU sent more text message and email alerts around 9:22 p.m. and 11:03 p.m. March 5 and 7:23 a.m. March 6. All further communications came from Flannery in university-wide emails sent at 4:08 p.m. March 6 and 3:04 p.m. March 7.
The water pressure returned later in the evening March 5, but students were advised to “continue precautionary use and boiling as directed,” according to an AU alert issued at 9:22 p.m. 
As of 7:15 p.m., low water pressure affected areas along Nebraska Avenue NW between MacArthur Boulevard NW and Connecticut Avenue NW, as well as a section of Wisconsin Avenue NW between Van Ness Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW, according to a map from D.C. Water. 
According to D.C. Water, only parts of AU’s campus were under the advisory. Leonard Hall, McDowell Hall, Hughes Hall, Asbury Hall, Watkins Building, Kreeger Building, the Public Safety building and Jack Child Hall as well as parts of the Mary Graydon Center and Butler Pavilion complex, Beeghly Hall, the Media Production Center, and Hamilton Building are not listed by D.C. Water as affected areas.
The Avalon, Greenbriar and Berkshire Apartments were not within the affected area, according to a list of affected premises provided by D.C. Water.
However, acting McDowell Hall Resident Director Timothy Staples said in an email obtained by The Eagle that McDowell, Cassell, Nebraska  and Hughes Halls were affected as of 7:15 p.m. March 5, as well as the Berkshire Apartments.
AU decided to maintain the water advisory until 12 p.m. March 7 for the whole campus to ensure safety and avoid confusion, Condon said. University Communications and Public Safety did not respond to a request to confirm this information. 
Eagle staff writers Jared Angle, Paige Jones and Samantha Hogan contributed to this report.

2015-01-08,AU,conservative,"Mary Cheney, right, with wife Heather Poe.
Mary Cheney, the younger of former vice president Dick Cheney’s two daughters, will be the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of 2015.
The Jan. 21 event will begin at 8:15 p.m in the School of International Service’s Abramson Family Founder’s Room.
Cheney’s career as a businesswoman and political adviser spans a wide range of occupations including independent strategic consulting, bipartisan government relations and task force management for AOL, according to a KPU press release. She also advised her father and George W. Bush as a campaign aide during the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, according to the press release.
During her speech, Cheney will address the future of the Republican party as it pertains to the LGBTQ community. While working at Coor’s in the mid-1990s, Cheney implemented a plan that ended a 20-year gay and lesbian boycott of Coor’s products. As a married lesbian herself, Cheney’s position on same-sex marriage has been controversial among her socially conservative family members.
Cheney’s appearance at AU comes 10 months after her father’s appearance at the University aroused student protests and attracted national media attention. 
KPU director Tyler Bowders said in a press release that he hopes Mary Cheney’s speech will complement and contrast with her father’s 2014 event.
“I am pleased that KPU has the opportunity to host a speaker who is able to showcase the future and diversity of the Republican Party,” Bowders said in the press release.

2015-09-10,AU,conservative,"Stephen Colbert. Photo by kpop im, Flickr.
My grandparents were big fans of Jay Leno. They liked his traditional monologue, his tried-and-true street bits. They think Jimmy Fallon is for “the youth.” Going by those standards, Conan O’Brien is for “the strange.” Jon Stewart was for “the liberal.” David Letterman was for ""the cynical."" But who is Stephen Colbert for? 
This is the question Colbert strove to answer in the premiere episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which premiered Sept. 8. Much has been made of Colbert leaving his crazed conservative pundit character behind in favor of a more authentic persona. In his first episode on network television, Colbert pushed the envelope just enough to show viewers that he hasn’t lost his satirical bite along the way. 
Some parts of the episode were unabashedly a part of the talk-show trope, especially during Colbert’s interview with George Clooney. There were attempts at deeper conversation, with questions surrounding Clooney’s humanitarian work in Darfur and his much-publicized marriage to lawyer Amal Clooney, as well as a short sequence of videos playing on a fake action film starring Clooney, hilariously named “Decision Strike.” But the segment was mostly fluff, interrupted at one point by the audience’s chants of “Stephen!” I could feel the pure excitement through the screen, threatening to take over the proceedings at any given moment. 
Other segments were more successful because they alluded to Colbert’s previous brand of political satire. An early bit comparing the media’s obsession with Donald Trump to an addiction to Oreos played well with the crowd, who, like myself, had been thirsting to see Colbert’s response to the bombastic Trump. In his interview with Jeb Bush, Colbert was unwilling to let the presidential candidate get away with typical political answers. Colbert threw him some softballs to start, but then compared the Bush brothers’ relationship to the dynamic between himself and his brother Jay, who sat solemnly in the audience. 
“I love my brother, even though we politically differ,” Colbert said during the show. 
Why couldn’t Jeb do the same with George? Jeb tried to slink out of the question, but Colbert waited for a substantive response, unafraid of scaring off other presidential candidates from appearing on the show. I was immediately drawn to Colbert’s commitment to getting something new from his guests, especially when that guest could become America’s next president. 
It was equally as fascinating to witness the moments when the political caricature bled into the host’s real personality, and his willingness to play off of the public’s knowledge of that character. When Jeb commented on the amount of portraits of the host in the newly renovated Ed Sullivan Theater, Colbert aptly responded, “I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit, now I’m just a narcissist.”
I could see the disappointment in the premiere on social media, mostly from dedicated fans who were struggling with the loss of a persona they looked to for the news every weeknight. Sure, this show doesn’t have the same mission that “Colbert Report” fans know and love. It won’t feel as righteous, nor will it claim to be. But it will be authentic Colbert: absurd, conscientious and sincere. The most beautiful and successful parts of the premiere--the introductory “Star-Spangled Banner” number, the startlingly fresh interview with Bush, the flurry of musical joy in Jon Batiste and Stay Human’s rendition of Sly and the Family Stone’s “Everyday People""-- were the most earnest, a quality that late-night television is desperately lacking. Perhaps that’s who Colbert’s newest endeavor is targeted at--not “the youth” or “the liberal,” but rather, “the earnest.”

2015-09-11,AU,conservative,"Comedian Jessica Williams speaks about her life in an event co-sponsored by KPU and the School of Communication on Sept. 10.
Comedian Jessica Williams spoke to a crowd of nearly one thousand students and faculty in Bender Arena on Thursday night about her career, urging those who are racial or sexual minorities to share their stories and break into the world of arts.
“Now is a good time to be any sort of minority or however you identify,” Williams said. “Because the stories right now are fucking old. They need you. You have something to offer. You are valid.”
Williams’ remarks ranged from light to serious, often eliciting laughter and applause from the crowd. She spoke about her journey from being raised in a black, middle class, conservative Christian household to becoming the youngest correspondent in program history on “The Daily Show.”
“I feel like I sort of grew up on ‘The Daily Show,’” Williams said. “It was the first time that I was really exposed to things that were just racism and pure hate.”
The writer and performer was hired for the show in 2012, while she was still in college at  California State University, Long Beach, and has been a correspondent for the past three years. She said she originally gained her sense of humor from her grandmother, who was physically immobile and watched a lot of television. Williams remembered watching comedic programs like South Park, Conan O’Brien’s late night show and Saturday Night Live while she was growing up.
“I saw that this was something that took her out of this prison that her body became, and I knew I wanted to do something like that,” she said.
Telling stories about her experiences with race, gender, mental health and religion, Williams said that her character as a correspondent is driven by raw emotion, especially when a tragedy or instance of police brutality has occurred.
“It's just the same circus, and the media perpetuates it, and we're supposed to just sit here,” she said. “A lot of times I feel like I am walking around just mad. I'm angry all the time. Sometimes I feel like I can just scream at any time because I'm walking around with this nuggets of pure anger [in me].”
During her remarks, Williams shared a clip of one of her more popular segments from the show, called “Frisky Business”, which mocks “stop-and-frisk,” a police tactic in New York City often used to profile young black residents. She said that piece was the first time she truly found her character.
Afterwards, Williams took questions from the crowd, including one from an Eagle reporter about where she draws the line between freedom of speech and sensitivity towards others when making jokes.
“I can only draw that line for myself personally because, at the end of the day, the only thing I can control is me,” she said. “Where I draw the line is things that push on or oppress people that don't need it.”
The event was sold out after 1,000 tickets had been made available online to the AU community. Williams ended her appearance on a positive note, saying that she felt less alone in her work because of other people of color and women who have told her how much they connected with her bits on “The Daily Show.”
“We all feel that sort of craziness, we feel that we are in this word where things are out of control,” she said. “What helps me sleep at night is knowing that I am not the only person, and if that is the case then I can create something or create art that people can identify with.”

2016-09-12,AU,conservative,"On Labor Day, Phyllis Schlafly died at age 92. 
Immediately in response to the conservative icon's passing, the intolerant wing of the political left erupted in applause. Tweets arose, ranging from ecstatic approval of her passing, to disappointment that she lived such a long life, to one tweet which expressed hope that Mrs. Schlafly was murdered. 
Charming.
I won’t even feign surprise at
this animalistic behavior, as it mirrors the type of joyus celebration that occurred after the passing of
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year. After this most recent
instance, it seems clear that seeing the human side of someone who you disagree
with is an idea that the left finds abhorrent. I find it highly ironic that a
group that so nobly and passionately fights for the equality of all people
seems to forget about the different types of opinion that exist alongside the
different classes, races, creeds, etc. However, in this condemnation of the
left, I do not mean to excuse anyone of my own party who may, in the future,
celebrate the inevitable eventual passing of people like Trevor Noah or Lena Dunham.
But I will not be one of them.
There is little substance to the
hasty justification that Mrs. Schlafly does not deserve respect because, as
many on the left hypothesize, she spent her entire life mercilessly working to
“oppress” her fellow women by vehemently opposing the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA). It is her right as a citizen to disagree with this proposed amendment to
the Constitution--and to oppose it vocally. She did so respectfully, and mostly
on the legitimate grounds that she
believed that the amendment would take more rights away from women by forcing
them into the draft.
Being opposed to drafting women
is a position that is still held today, as an amendment to the federal budget that
would have required women to do so just narrowly passed the Senate but failed in the House back in June. Schlafly’s position, as
one might guess, has grown increasingly unpopular with time; I will acknowledge
that she set the gender equality movement back a substantial amount. It is
perfectly reasonable to disagree with her position, or even to hate her. I’m
not suggesting that you attend her funeral, wear black for the rest of the week
or celebrate her life in any way. I simply find it mind-boggling that people
are so quick to celebrate the end of a life.
While I’ll admit that I certainly
do not have any great love for Phyllis Schlafly’s opposition to the Equal
Rights Amendment, as a budding activist myself, it is hard not to credit her as
being one of the top political activists of her time. There is a very important
lesson that people of all political opinions can learn from her. With her work
against the ERA, she showed how one woman can change opinion on a “sure thing”
piece of legislation with sheer willpower,
political prowess and rhetorical might.
Sure, it might be easy to get
swept up in the celebration of one of your least favorite talking heads. Just
remember that she is someone’s mother.

2016-10-12,AU,conservative,"Sitting on my couch Friday afternoon, I got the flurry of the usual alerts from CNN, Fox, etc. that arrive when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says or does something outrageous. 
I opened a new tab in my browser, went to the Washington Post, and watched the leaked video of Trump on a bus before an Access Hollywood taping with former host Billy Bush in 2005. 
Listening to it, I was absolutely horrified. A grown man running for president of the greatest superpower in the world described violating women against their will. I know he may not have actually raped or sexually assaulted a woman, but he joked about a physical attack against another human being in the same tone that he would when talk about what sandwich he may or may not have previously consumed for lunch that day.
Using his own words, Trump lost the respect of many in his party and his country. He disregarded violence as ""locker room talk"" and showed the American people that he cannot be the leader of our nation. 
With his own words, he proves to us that he cannot be a just and stable leader. He proves that he does not care about the family. He proves that he does not care about the law.
As a conservative, I believe in the strength of the American family. Thinking of my mother, sister-in-law, future daughter and myself, I would never want them to be in a country led by a man who believes that women are playthings, to be touched and grabbed at any man’s will. Thinking of my father, brother, future husband and future son, I would never allow them to speak about myself or another woman in such a manner. By dehumanizing violence, Trump threw out the family values on which the Republican Party is based.
When speaking about the Hispanic community, the Khan family, the Muslim-American community, a Mexican-American judge, and more, Trump proved to the American people that he is unfit to be our leader. Most recently, he has proved to women that he does not respect their privacy. He has proven to the Republican Party that he is not worthy of our support. 
While I will not support Secretary Hillary Clinton in this election either because I cannot and will not support her big-government policies that steal from the American worker, to the conservatives still considering a vote for Trump, I say this: think about your values, your positions, your own future, and the future of your children. The person presented to us this election cycle has shown no respect for these key values, and I don't anticipate him changing any positions. I know you are scared for the future, as I am, but I encourage you to vote with your conscience and think about what kind of future you want for America. 
I suggest protecting down ballot candidates and ensuring the Republican majorities in Congress so there can be some balance, and that you consider third party candidates. However, if you decide to vote for Trump, I do not shame you. This election is difficult, and I do not blame you for voting for change, but I do not believe the change America needs can be found in Trump.
We are a great nation full of diverse people, and we have great powers as a people through our Constitution and Bill of Rights. We must think of those when voting. 
As a conservative, libertarian, Hispanic woman with deeply held values in the free market and principles of liberty, I cannot - and will not - in good conscience vote for Donald Trump this November.

2016-11-11,AU,conservative,"In a week full of tension on campus, students and faculty came together in solidarity against members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who picketed outside of the University on Friday afternoon.  
As the sun began to set, between 500 and 800 students and supporters gathered along Massachusetts Avenue to rally against the ultra-conservative church group, whose members came to protest the resources the University offers to transgender students. 
Westboro Baptist Church is based out of Topeka, Kansas, and is known nationwide for its hate speech and protests against LGBTQ, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, political and Orthodox Christian communities. 
University police were present to keep students safe and prevent them from infringing on the rights of WBC members to protest. Approximately 25 faculty members were also adorned with red safety vests to keep students on University property, Senior Director of Student Activities Michael Elmore said. 
“We just want people to be as safe as possible, so [the red vests] are just simply a measure to identify who’s out here to support students and to try to work to make sure everything goes out safely,” Public Relations Manager Rebecca Basu, who was one of the faculty in a vest, said. 
Three members of WBC attended the protest and sang popular songs replaced with hateful lyrics. But their songs were drowned out by the chants of students saying “Love trumps hate!” and “Trans lives matter!” Students shouted out cries of goodbye and cheering commenced when the WBC members were escorted down Massachusetts Avenue at 4:30 p.m.
“[Transgender rights] is such a prevalent issue nowadays and I feel like if I don’t do anything and just stand back they would have more of a reason to shout out what they’re shouting out… it’s standing in solidarity with the people we appreciate — our class members, our peers, our student body,” Abrar Rahman, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences, said. 
Not all students found this rally to be a productive use of time however. 
“The fact that we keep giving people like this attention keeps them going,” sophomore Joshua Kerobo said. “Like if we had just stopped and people leave… it would have already been done, it would have already been over. They would have just stood there and been gone, they would have been singing to themselves and then they would have left.”
Caution tape kept students on University property, but that didn’t stop students from holding signs of LGBTQ support. As rush hour traffic began to roll by, cars honked their horns and chanted support for counter-protesters. 
“Here at American University, everyone is a part of the community no matter how you identity, no matter what you choose, no matter how you want to be seen,” Kendall Lawrenz, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, said. “We choose to see people the way they would see themselves, and I think it’s important to honor that. I think a group that comes here and tells us how we should see other people has no place in America, has no place at American University.”

2017-01-11,AU,conservative,"This article originally appeared in The Eagle’s December 9 print edition.
Looking back on this election, it has been a rough year and a half to be a Republican woman. Facing ridicule from every side, listening to your party’s nominee criticize women and trying to choose between compromising your values and voting for necessary change at the ballot box was maddening.
However, it is over now. The next President of the United States will be Donald Trump, and it is time for the nation to face that reality and move forward with a positive agenda for change.
Although I did not vote for or support Donald Trump during his presidential run, I wish him the best in office and I truly hope he governs well. Praying for his failure at this point does not hurt his reputation, but the American people as a whole. That is why we must be cautiously optimistic: we must support him and guide him on a path toward righteousness while at the same time be willing to criticize his administration when necessary.
Further, President-elect Trump will be complemented by both a Republican House and Senate, not to mention 33 Republican governors, 26 states under the control of both GOP executive and legislative branches and six state legislatures controlled by Republicans with Democratic governors. This is the GOP’s moment, and the party must deliver if it wants to maintain and grow party support in 2018 and 2020.
To do this, I recommend the following conservative policy proposals to limit government power, control spending, cut government waste and prove that success can be achieved under a Republican government.
Step 1: Reform the criminal justice system
One of the most corrupt institutions in American government is the criminal justice system. It is designed to over-incarcerate low-level, nonviolent offenders. Upon leaving prison, these offenders cannot successfully find a job due to their criminal records and become dependent on less-than-legal means to make ends meet. Often, they are reincarcerated and enter a viscous cycle known as “recidivism.” 
This issue disproportionately impacts minority groups, and it must be stopped. Moreover, the entire system costs a tremendous amount of unnecessary tax dollars (an additional $42 million in 2017 from FY2016) and needs to be consolidated and reformed immediately. To address these issues, a bi-partisan coalition of representatives has already proposed several bills to reform them.
Another way to improve the criminal justice system would be to expand programs that assist ex-felons in finding jobs after leaving prison. Companies like Apple, Hilton Hotels and Chick-fil-A hire returning citizens to begin reintegrating former felons into society. By using public-private partnerships with these and other companies and vocational organizations, the government can prevent the cycle of incarceration from continuing to plague our system, destroy the family and consume our tax dollars. 
Step 2: Simplify the tax code and loosen ridiculous regulations
There are areas in Trump’s tax proposal where taxes among certain higher-level income groups will be higher than under Clinton’s plan, according to the Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a center-left tax policy group. This is significant because Clinton claimed she would use taxes to crack down on the upper class.
Scholar Leonard Burman notes, “Trump’s 33 percent top rate kicks in at a fairly low income level for singles: $127,500 in 2017.” The Trump tax plan could generate more levels of revenue. It would remove personal exemptions and tax breaks which would consolidate the current 74,608-page-long federal code, making it more fair. If he implements this plan, it will cut the burden of taxpayers while not letting off the wealthier economic groups from contributing a sizable amount of income in taxes. 
It would also consolidate and simplify the tax code. By simplifying the code, this would allow Americans to better understand how the federal government collects tax dollars. If Trump goes through with implementing this plan, it would save Americans a lot of time, money and headaches trying to understand all the loopholes and tax breaks in the system of which big businesses take advantage.
Step 3: Create an environment inclusive to all Americans
Often, the political left claims that the GOP is waging a “war on women.” However, 42 percent of Donald Trump’s voters were women, especially college-educated white women, 49 percent of which voted for the billionaire. This happened despite Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emphasis on Trump’s history of bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monumental question is why these women still voted for him, and unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll have an answer until we actually ask these voters. Usually, these types of allegations kill political careers, such as was the case with Anthony Weiner. And yet, it has not derailed Trump.
The GOP needs to emphasize the benefits of limited government for minorities. While protections are necessary to ensure that discrimination is prevented, all people can be most empowered by freedom, not the state. The GOP has this platform, but it does not use it. To better project this ideal, Republicans should be more open to comprehensive immigration reform that opens the door to increasing legal immigration. Further, women could greatly benefit from voluntary Personal Care Accounts that encourage financial saving for leave time. Pre-tax dollars would be saved in this PCA, and it would be used to replace or supplement income during periods of leave. This would help the problem of paid leave or medical issues. Women and minorities in the GOP also need to be louder and prouder, stand up in the name of limited government and run for office.
Although I remain cautiously optimistic, I truly hope that the Trump administration is successful in its endeavors-not just for Republicans, but for all Americans. If he fails, we will all have to live with the consequences.

2017-10-12,AU,conservative,"“Fine messes”, “just wars”, “reliable rumors,” and American political “science.” I get a kick out of fun oxymorons. Okay, that last one isn’t so fun. It’s just painfully true. Let me explain.
Last week I stumbled upon a Ted Talk from a psychologist named Jonathan Haidt. Haidt is a New York native, a professor at NYU, and self-proclaimed liberal. He has a son and a wife, both of whom share his progressive world view. He is not a bipartisan man. Yet, in his talk, “The moral roots of liberals and conservatives,” Haidt says this: “...If we are going to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our lack of moral diversity is going to make it harder.” 
Haidt may be a Liberal, but he’s also a psychologist. He understands what it means to live in an echo chamber, and how dangerous it is to do so. Haidt’s point ends up being this: Liberals’ roles are to tear down faulty institutions and conservatives’ roles are to keep the ones that work. It’s an intricate balancing act -- Haidt even compares it to the yin and yang of Daoist mythology. 
American politics is in such a rut because too many liberals and conservatives hate each other’s guts. Now more than ever, our country is divided. Donald Trump’s election has resulted in not just a proposal for a border wall, but a real wall -- a partition between helpful conservative beliefs and helpful liberal beliefs. It’s so bad that in some parts of the country, “liberal” or “conservative” have become dirty words. They shouldn’t be. We need both. 
Just like Haidt, I’m firmly in the liberal camp. Both my parents are liberal, my father even radically so. But that doesn’t mean I should hate the other side. If the liberal’s role is to tear down the faulty institutions, then I should reserve my hate for the parts of “the other side” that need a wrecking ball and maybe even some dynamite for good measure. Apply the change not liberally (pun intended), but discriminately so.  
For example, the free market is an institution worth keeping.  Even Bernie Sanders, the patron saint of college socialists, would never propose something as radical as completely dismantling the free market. Despite its flaws, while plenty, there’s no denying the sheer efficiency of mostly unrestricted trade. The free market is the one of the most criticized aspects of America mainly because it is most successful. 
What are the institutions worth dismantling? In my opinion, there are many. The idea of traditional marriage is a good example. In 2015, the voice of the left, and even much of the right, agreed that to keep gay marriage illegal was to stay on the wrong side of history. So, it was changed. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the idea of gun control has once again sprung to the forefront of conversation. If it is popular enough, then it too shall change -- a triumph for liberalism. 
It may seem like there are exponentially more ideas worth changing than keeping. Indeed, it’s true. But this shouldn’t be misconstrued as a failure on conservatism’s part. Ideas become outdated or stop working. In the case of gay marriage, the idea was always wrong. Consequently, it’s easy to blame conservatism for everything wrong with America. After all, aren’t conservatives the ones supporting these archaic ideas? True, but they are not unique in doing so. Every established idea has had at some point popular support. Conservatives supported it, and liberals too.  
Yes, the ratio is skewed. And yes, the bad ideas often outnumber the good. But that’s not a terrible thing. That’s progress.

2019-03-08,AU,conservative,"John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate, has been named the 2019 Wonk of the Year, the Kennedy Political Union announced today. 
The politician will speak to students about the future of the U.S. and bipartisanship on March 21 in Bender Arena at 7 p.m.
Kasich began his career in 1978 as a state senator and later became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, notably serving 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee.
After leaving Congress in 2000, Kasich returned to politics in 2010 when he ran for governor of Ohio. He served two terms in the office before leaving the governor’s mansion in January. He is currently a senior political commentator for CNN.
In 2016, Kasich became a household name when he ran for the Republican nomination for president. Kasich “presented himself as a moderate alternative to front-running candidates,” KPU wrote in its press release. During his presidential run, he received the Republican endorsement from The New York Times but ultimately did not have the votes to beat Donald Trump, the party’s eventual nominee. 
“With a perspective unique to a public servant experienced in both the public and private sector, leadership on all levels of government, and work with major media organizations, Kasich will bring thoughtful discussion to American University on the topic of bipartisan solutions and the future of American politics,” KPU wrote in its press release. 
While many analysts place Kasich in the moderate wing of the party due to his views on immigration and other issues, critics have noted Kasich’s conservative record on abortion rights, same-sex marriage and cuts to public education, among other actions. 
Kasich once strongly opposed same-sex marriage, but following the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal in all U.S. states in 2015, he said the country needed to accept the decision and “move on.”
According to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Kasich signed 17 anti-abortion measures into law between 2011 and 2016. Those measures defunded Planned Parenthood and banned abortions from public hospitals as well as from receiving public funds. Ohio Right to Life has credited Kasich for the decline in abortions in the state.
The University has recently introduced initiatives promoting bipartisanship, including the launch of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics last fall. The institute, which is focused on creating bipartisan policy solutions, launched with a September event featuring former Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee). 
Previous Wonk of the Year recipients include Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist Malala Yousafzai, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, former First Lady Laura Bush and former President Bill Clinton.
The event, co-hosted with AU College Republicans, will require an Eventbrite ticket and valid AUID for students, faculty and staff. Doors will open at 6:20 p.m.

2020-09-10,AU,conservative,"The Mary Graydon Center, pictured in 2016. 
American University is projecting a potential budget loss between $104 million and $116 million for the 2021 fiscal year, resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, according to Matthew Bennett, AU’s vice president and chief communications officer. 
In an email to The Eagle on Thursday, Bennett said that some of the major causes of the shortfall include lower enrollment, a 10 percent tuition discount, and the loss of revenue from housing and dining, as the fall semester is essentially entirely online.
“The exact final shortfall will ultimately be determined by final enrollment numbers for the entire year, operating status in the spring, and other factors that are not yet finalized,” Bennett wrote.
Personnel and financial aid make up the largest share of expenses in AU’s nearly $777 million fiscal year 2021 budget, according to the University’s budget report, which was released in 2019. 
AU is considering an additional furlough week for University employees and is collecting input from the community regarding potential furloughs, according to Bennett. He wrote that AU is not considering large-scale layoffs, and the University “has not instituted any layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The Eagle previously reported that 180 food service workers were furloughed in March, after AU extended its virtual format for the spring semester. 
The University is also not considering cutting financial aid to reduce expenses, Bennett wrote. In June, AU committed to dedicating an additional $13 million to financial aid. 
In May, President Sylvia Burwell told the AU community in an email that, “using a more conservative approach,” the University could lose $100 million in revenue and increased costs for the 2021 fiscal year. To address the deficit, Burwell announced that AU would pause new construction, cut salaries for her and her cabinet, implement a hiring freeze, and stop merit increases for faculty and staff making more than $40,000 annually.
“We are acting decisively and prudently to mitigate these shortfalls, including extensive efforts to meet enrollment goals for current and incoming students,” Burwell wrote.
In a June email to the AU community, the administration announced that the University would suspend matching contributions for employees’ retirement plans from August 2020 through January 2021. The email said that AU is also using unrestricted endowment income to help mitigate the impact of the University’s budget deficit.
In 2019, the Board of Trustees voted to raise tuition by three percent in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. When AU reversed its hybrid fall 2020 plan on July 30, deciding to host classes entirely online and cancel virtually all on-campus housing, the University announced a tuition reduction for undergraduate and graduate students by 10 percent. AU discounted tuition for online classes this summer.
The price of tuition for the fall 2020 semester is $22,744 for full-time undergraduate students taking fewer than 18 credits.
Tuition and fees make up 92 percent of AU’s revenue, Burwell wrote in her May 26 email. In addition to discounting tuition for the fall, AU eliminated or reduced some fees for the semester, including the sports center and student activity fees. 
AU is allocating half of the over $6 million in COVID-19 relief funding it received from the Department of Education toward financial aid.
AU is one of many colleges in the United States facing financial loss amid the COVID-19 pandemic. George Washington University, which has higher enrollment than AU, estimates a $220 million budget shortfall. 
This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

2020-10-09,AU,conservative,"American University students voiced a variety of concerns following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, who will replace late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if confirmed by the Senate. 
From a shortlist of conservative political figures such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Trump ultimately decided on Barrett, who is known for her conservative stances on abortion, the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ+ rights, amongst other issues. 
The Executive Board of AU College Republicans said in a statement that they support the nomination. 
“In this time of unprecedented tumult and uncertainty, it is especially imperative that the Supreme Court be at full capacity, to remain a steady defender of the Constitution,” the AUCR Executive Board wrote in a statement released Oct. 2. “We strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett and look forward to her many more years of service to the United States of America and our sacred Constitution.” 
College Republicans declined to comment further. 
Many students said they are concerned that if she is confirmed, she will threaten the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision—a landmark case that protects a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction—and the Affordable Care Act. 
Jeremy Ward, the executive director of AU College Democrats, said that Barret’s nomination “shows that the Republicans don't care about health care.”
Roseanna Yeganeh-Kazemi, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, was also concerned. She cited Barrett’s use of religion to justify and support her legal opinions, such as with cases involving LGBTQ+ rights or abortion, as especially threatening, considering that the U.S. has no established religion. 
“We pride ourselves on that concept that we have a separation of church and state, and the fact that in a lot of opinions she's written and a lot of her stances she brings in Catholicism, which I think is a major problem,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
Several students said they were frustrated that Republicans plan to confirm Barrett with only a month until the general election. In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with eight months left until the election, but his nomination was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. 
“Then fast forward four years later, Justice Ginsburg's body is probably not even cold yet, it's just hours after she passed, and McConnell is saying that we are going to have a replacement,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
While some were upset, many students said they were not shocked, given the long-term political power the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers would acquire if Barrett is confirmed. 
“I was expecting President Trump to make a decision very quickly; I was expecting the Senate to be [quick] to confirm her,” said Ali Siddiqi, a freshman in the School of International Service who has been following Barrett’s rulings since she was on the shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. “She had no scandals or allegations to which the Trump campaign would want to deviate from, especially with Brett Kavanaugh. They want a clean judicial pick.”
Barrett’s confirmation hearing is set to start Oct. 12, and it is not yet known exactly how COVID-19 might affect the proceedings.

2021-01-02,AU,conservative,"The Keegan Theater’s virtual productions of “Trans Am” and “From Gumbo to Mumbo” ran from Nov. 12 until Nov. 29. “Trans Am” focused on LGBTQ+ rights, and “From Gumbo to Mumbo” explored race relations in the United States in a mostly personal manner, accompanied by expressive and powerfully emotional music. 
“Trans Am” is a rock musical and a solo act featuring Lisa Stephen Friday, a real-life rock star who formed a group called Lisa Jackson and Girl Friday. The play focuses on Friday’s life story as she transitioned and overcame the many challenges she faced from her childhood. 
Friday told the audience of her story accompanied by her acoustic guitar. She performed music by Lisa Jackson and Girl Friday after she shared specific experiences. When Friday recalled her experience of coming out as a transgender woman, it was particularly haunting. 
“You know how they say how people should treat us? I didn’t know how to tell my family how to treat me,” Friday said during her performance when recounting her coming out experience. 
Friday was raised in a conservative family in Fayetteville, Ga. She expressed frustration early in her performance about the binary social lens in which she grew up. Even when she came out in 2004, there was not the vocabulary that we use today to describe transgender or non-binary individuals. 
Friday also recounted her experience dealing with her family’s negative perception of her as a drag queen. This perception emerged when she was playing music with her group at the Parkside Lounge in New York City. She collaborated with people such as influential trans rocker Jayne County at the time.
In an interview with Metro Weekly magazine, Friday said, “Unless you have a trans person in your life, or you’re an extremely aware person, you don’t know what that struggle is.” 
She also pointed out that anyone who is not white, heterosexual and Christian is incredibly vulnerable and that transgender people are especially vulnerable to discrimination and prejudicial attacks. In “Trans Am,” Friday uses her own experience of coming out as a transgender woman to talk about how alone transgender people are when they transition. 
“And there I stood. Silent. Shamed. Judged. Completely alone,” Friday said during her performance. 
“From Gumbo to Mumbo” is a New Orleans-based play discussing race-related problems in the U.S. The play explores what it means to be “authentic” in American culture and politics and it reflects on the search for love and happiness.
The play features two local actors, Drew Anderson and Dwayne Lawson-Brown. Anderson is a former science teacher who founded Spit Dat, an open mic in Washington, and Lawson-Brown is a hip-hop artist. 
The play opens with New Orleanian music and a Family Feud spoof. The stage background, lighting and each actor’s colorful outfit reflected New Orleans culture. At the beginning of the play, Anderson’s outfit stood out particularly with a Zion Williamson New Orleans Pelicans jersey and multi-colored necklaces.
Anderson or Brown addressed race relations in their monologues, while footage of anti-Vietnam War protests and race riots in the 1960s and today was shown on a series of small TV screens. The discussion then shifted to police brutality and instances where unarmed, innocent Black men were shot and killed by police because of the color of their skin. 
Further imagery of candlelight vigils with faces of Black men and women killed by police showed the many people who died senselessly because of police brutality, while also keeping these names alive. 
Another powerful visual was Brown’s T-shirt, which showed names of police brutality victims. The combination of rap, hip-hop, poetry, New Orleans culture and visuals made “From Gumbo to Mumbo” an effective play for understanding the times we live in today. 
The play was nominated for a Helen Hayes Award.

2021-01-04,AU,conservative,"In March of 2019, the leader of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said in a speech to party leaders that the official platform on LGBTQ+ rights was, “not about tolerance,” ending his thoughts by emphatically yelling, “Stay away from our children!” In January 2019, the Russian LGBT Network reported that Chechen authorities detained at least 40 people in the previous weeks and killed two in a purge against LGBTQ+ residents. 
While it’s easy to dismiss these as similar but isolated incidents, they stand as a testament to the broader trend across Eastern Europe of persecuting LGBTQ+ persons under the guise of “traditional values.” Often cemented in religious or nationalist ideals, conservative parties such as Law and Justice in Poland and United Russia have evoked traditional values as a means of justifying discriminatory and often outright hateful agendas. 
What’s become increasingly clear over the last decade or so is a strong relationship between the rise of authoritarian regimes along with the evocation of “traditional values” in Eastern Europe and the scapegoating and persecution of LGBT persons and other sexual minorities. Less clear is what we can do to end the systematic human rights abuses or bring any meaningful form of justice. 
We’ve seen these values have been invoked in the passage of the infamous 2013 “gay propaganda” legislation in Russia, which obstensively banned any pro-LGBTQ+ sentiments in media or public discourse. The law has served as an anchorpoint for the intersection of traditional values and homophobia with lawmakers and activists alike using the law as validation that LGBTQ+ people pose a threat to the safety of their children and society as a whole. Similar homophobic overtones defined the declarations made by hundreds of municipalities in Poland that they were “LGBT-ideology free” areas. 
In politics, faith and public discourse, ‘traditional values’ have successfully managed to other LGBTQ+ persons, making them prime targets for persecution and abuse. Existing international human rights frameworks, such as the United Nations’ Convention on the Prevention and Punishment for the Crime of Genocide, fail to grant protected group status for gender and sexual minorities. This gap in protective status leaves LGBTQ+ people uniquely vulnerable to bias-motivated violence encouraged by far-right, authoritarian ideologies that identify homosexuals and gender nonconforming individuals as the source of nations’ misfortunes.
Tolerance for homosexuality varies considerably throughout the world, though the stark contrasts between public attitudes in Eastern and Western Europe highlight a significant point of concern for the future of anti-discrimination norms that outlaw violence against LGBTQ+ persons in the EU. Pew Research Center 2019 survery data assessing acceptance of homosexuality reveal median scores of 86% for Western European states and 46% for Central and Eastern European states.
Additionally, an analysis of legislation throughout Europe showcases another significant divergence between post-communist Europe and Western Europe. Conor O’Dwyer conducted a study of legislation using the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association-Europe’s rights index, concluding that Europian Union member states are significantly more protective of LGBTQ+ persons.
While this legal analysis is confined to Europe, the results speak to potential implications for the future of LGBTQ+ rights globally. Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU allows action to be taken to prevent such discrimination in member states. However, Poland President Andrzej Duda has campaigned using rhetoric that called the LGBT “ideology” worse than communism, while municipalities throughout the country continue to implement so-called LGBT-free zones.
The response from the leadership of the EU has been inadequate in preventing further discrimination, and the decisions that the institution makes now in response to Poland’s aggression will chart the course for the trajectory of LGBTQ+ rights in Europe and beyond.
When nations assault LGBTQ+ rights with impunity within the world’s leading coalition of democracies, we set the stage for the perpetuation of atrocities similar to those currently underway in Chechnya, where the Russian government has aided in the facilitation of torture and execution of gay men under the reign of Ramzan Kadyrov, who heads Chechnya. 
Mass atrocity warning signs have mounted considerably since Russia’s anti-gay propaganda legislation went into effect and efforts were made to legitimize discriminatory actions under the facade of moral sovereignty. Should the international community fail to intervene now, the foundations for the erasure of LGBTQ+ identities through cultural and physical genocide will be irreversibly cemented in the same region as the Holocaust of WWII.

2021-01-05,AU,conservative,"While so much of life now revolves around technology, it’s hard to find moments of escape from news alerts and social media scrolling, and it’s even harder to maintain our jagged and anxious attention. Film began as an imaginative outlook where the camera transformed our world, let us look at ourselves differently and took us to new places. All the time, and all at once, Americans have looked to film as a way to feel better in brief, collective moments, apart from their anxieties, fears and anger. Here are some great films that can help you escape, if only for an hour and then some.
Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) - Available on Disney+
Directed by artistically inclined director Wes Anderson, “Fantastic Mr. Fox” is a perfect, fall escapism film because it’s crafted to draw you in. The animals are cute, witty and motivated. The film is composed along symmetrical lines — Wes Anderson loves his vertical centers — with neat trees, buildings and color blocking. The precision is the exact opposite of the world around us, and it’s a pleasing relief. The film’s plot follows a family of foxes and their rodent neighbors, whose homes are suddenly attacked by neighboring produce corporations. Like the Robin Hood fairytale, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) decides to steal from the rich and save his home and friends. The plot is softly political, so conscious viewers will be eager to root for Mr. Fox and his cohorts, but it’s not jarring enough to keep your mind reeling with the reality of politics occurring outside of Anderson’s claymation creation.
Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) - Available on Netflix and Hulu
A grumpy, old man named Hec (Sam Neill) and a young, quirky kid named Ricky (Julian Dennison) adventure together through the New Zealand bush, on the run from child protective services and police. The pair come across unexpected, yet sympathetic characters - like a rural father-daughter duo and a man who goes by the nickname “Psycho” Sam (Rhys Darby). The film is sprinkled with emotionally sincere moments between the mostly comedic and ironic narrative orchestrated by director Taika Waititi. Waititi’s quick-hit comedy lines and the main characters’ unexplainable quirks are engaging and endearing, bringing any viewer along for an easy-paced film that ends with a touching realization of personal flaws and working together.
Ocean’s 8 (2018) - Available on HBO Max and Hulu (with certain subscriptions)
Beautiful, many famous, women commit crimes together — that’s the plot. Like any other “Ocean’s” film, this Sandra Bullock-led reboot has a simple mission made complicated by clever planning, sleuthing, lying and cheating to rob the glorious Met Gala in New York City. “Ocean’s 8” delivers intensity, comedy and teamwork through a wide-range of character types and fan-favorite actresses. Rihanna, who plays Nine Ball, subverts the nerdy hacker trope to one of cool mystery. Sarah Paulson makes the underestimated mother type an independent agent. Celebrity cameos give the film a hint of realism that makes it more fun to watch. “Ocean’s 8” is a good escape through its familiar plot but entertaining maze of planning that has a million-dollar payoff.
Catch Me If You Can (2002) - Available on Netflix and Hulu (with certain subscriptions)
Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio are always one-step in the wrong direction throughout this 2002 film, which is based on a true story. Hanks delivers his usual good-guy performance as an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, but he’s unrelenting in his pursuit of the most successful young robber and forger in American history. Hanks is a great liaison for the viewer, especially as DiCaprio’s character, Frank Abagnale Jr., seems to trick the untrickable and evade capture at every turn through complex schemes. Abagnale is able to disguise himself in plain sight as a pilot, doctor and prosecutor, all before he turns 19-years-old. But he has to be caught eventually, or else we’d never have this wonderful film. The joy of the chase is a great escape from the daily Zoom routines.
Dolemite Is My Name (2019) - Available on Netflix
This underrated movie about movies dives into the overlooked history of Black American filmmakers in the 1970s. Eddie Murphy plays the struggling entertainer Rudy Ray Moore, the man behind the cult-classic “Dolemite” films. Dolemite becomes Moore’s on-stage comedic persona and then eventually an on-screen karate-fighting, suit-wearing hero. “Dolemite is My Name” is a remarkable story about Black success and creativity in an industry in which they are often shunned. It’s also a fun yet sentimental return to the screen for Murphy, who hasn’t been in a film since 2016. “Dolemite Is My Name” is joyful, which is definitely needed these days. The outrageous camp costuming and funky music is a wonderful escape.
The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) - Available to rent on Amazon Prime for $3.99
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is a cult-classic, musical, science fiction (“double feature”) starring the unforgettable Tim Curry. This low-budget film barely made waves in box offices when it was released in 1975, but over the decades it’s grown to prominence in small-town art-deco theaters. When white-bread characters Janet (Susan Sarandon) and Brad (Barry Bostwick) stumble upon a castle in the woods, they meet mysterious and unpredictable characters with hidden secrets. This is a perfect escapism film because the plot is hardly existent, but the music and acting is so up-tempo and melodramatic that you’ll enjoy yourself, while also wondering what is happening on screen. Songs like “The Time Warp” and “Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me” are incredibly fun scenes, making subtle commentary on sexuality and conservative social norms of the ‘70s. The film features romance, infidelity, murder and aliens, so it’s a catch-all for any time you want some great, ‘70s rock songs with a dash of plot.
What a Girl Wants (2003) - Available on Netflix
When was the last time you thought about Amanda Bynes? It was probably 2003, when this teenage romantic-comedy was released. Bynes plays Daphne Reynolds, the tomboy teen who embarks on her independent journey to reconnect with her estranged father, Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a candidate for Britain’s prime minister. Bynes reminds her father of his younger rock-n-roll lifestyle while she faces public scrutiny from the media and her father’s fiancée for not fitting into the right mold. “What a Girl Wants” has typical 2000s montages, complete with the archetypal fitting room scene and a motorcycle ride around London, and cringeworthy moments that make the film funny and easy. With a familiar message of being yourself and reuniting with loved ones, “What a Girl Wants” is a great throwback to simpler times.

2021-11-11,AU,conservative,"Editor’s Note: The last name of an undocumented student has been omitted in this article for privacy and protection.
When law student Andrea Rodriguez Burckhardt arrived in D.C. to study at American University’s Washington College of Law, she was surprised by the lack of community with undocumented students on campus.
Burckhardt, a student in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, studied as an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin. At UT, Burckhardt said she felt community “from day one” as an undocumented student with a strong support system of student-led organizations at the public university.
According to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal, less than 20 percent of undocumented and DACA-eligible students attend private institutions as compared to public colleges.
Saba Ahmed, the supervising attorney for WCL’s “Defending the AU Dream Initiative,” is working to change that. Created in 2019, AU Dream operates out of WCL’s Immigration Justice Clinic and provides free legal support for immigrant and undocumented students. Ahmed hosted “DACA & Dinner” on Nov. 4 to allow students to learn about DACA under the Biden administration and undocumented students on AU’s campus.
Rodriguez, Ahmed and undocumented graduate student Ellie spoke at the event about their experiences at AU and encouraged students to sign a petition urging the University to publicly support DACA. The event was hosted by a coalition of student groups including the Asian American Student Union, African Students’ Organization, AU Por Colombia, AU League of United Latin American Citizens, AU Dream and the Center for Community Engagement and Service.
Ahmed’s vision is to expand the current services of AU Dream — asylum issues, humanitarian visas, family petitions, advance parole and more — to become a “hub of support” to holistically address the needs of undocumented and immigrant students. 
“I definitely have put in a lot of effort over the past few months to even have people aware that we exist,” Ahmed said in an interview with The Eagle. She added, “I think it’s hard to feel empowered to speak out if there’s no solidarity, and there’s no support.”
DACA and undocumented students find opportunity in AU Dream
After beginning her degree, Burckhardt anxiously anticipated the chance to study abroad. But as a student with DACA during the Trump administration, she struggled to obtain advance parole travel documents.
In September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced measures to reject any new or pending applications for advance parole.
Burckhardt found opportunity in AU Dream and worked with the organization for months to apply for advance parole to study abroad. But even with legal help from AU Dream, Burckhardt faced something else that is part of many DACA students’ experience — financial barriers.
“The cost of the application, not even to find out if you go or not on advance parole, is [$575],” Burckhardt said. “So I would be spending close to $600 more than any other student by trying to see if I could even get into a study abroad [program].”
Ellie also utilized AU Dream to help ease financial burdens. With the help of Ahmed and AU Dream, Ellie was able to receive tuition aid and internship opportunities. 
“I’m not qualified for DACA and I have to pay out of pocket,” Ellie said. “I’ve been supported by family overseas, but then COVID[-19] hits and everyone is in financial difficulty at this time.”
Though undocumented students are unable to qualify for financial aid, states like California and Texas, where Ellie and Rodriguez studied for undergrad, have opportunities for grants. California and Texas are the two states with the highest number of undocumented immigrants, with about 2.2 million and 1.6 million undocumented immigrants, respectively, according to Pew Research Center estimates.
Ahmed also cited housing and food insecurity as well as mental health concerns, particularly for those who are victims of crime or dealing with significant trauma. 
“Someone’s immigration status in itself can be a barrier to higher education,” Ahmed said. “And the students that we see in colleges and universities have had to work incredibly hard to overcome barriers that citizens students might not have.”
Turning the personal into passion — AU students advocate for undocumented community 
Ellie said she wants to see greater University-wide training for faculty who may encounter an undocumented student who needs assistance. When she first looked into resources on campus, Ellie was regularly referred to international student services, even though she was specifically seeking support for undocumented students.
Burckhardt said she believes the University’s next step could be connecting with affinity groups. 
“Living undocumented is a lot of hiding your status, especially when you’re growing up in small towns, or in more conservative areas, you have to hide your status; it’s a lot of living in the shadows,” Burckhardt said. “And having that support in UT allowed me to just stand forward to be heard and feel like I was a student with needs worth recognizing.”
Burckhardt works for the International Human Rights Law Clinic and is also a student who has benefited from its services. She said her experiences have shaped her passion for immigration law, but learning about immigration law started as a way to educate herself and her family.
When she was young, Burckhardt’s family came to the U.S. from Peru on a tourist visa. When the family learned their supposed sponsor was scamming them, they were left without money and papers. Burckhardt hopes she can change the story for future immigrant families.
“The law is something that I see as something that’s really unreachable for a lot of people, and in having the opportunity to learn it, I want to translate it and give it to a lot of others that don’t get the opportunity to do the same,” Burckhardt, whose family is Colombian, said.
Ahmed, Burckhardt and Ellie stressed supporting undocumented community members through listening to their stories and continuing conversations about undocumented students. 
“I do hope people who are undocumented or DACA [are] able to speak up and voice their opinions and talk to people at their comfortability and tell people that it’s important to let others know about this story; this community here,” Ellie said.
Correction: Burckhardt's work in the International Human Rights Law Clinic was misstated in a previous version of this article. This article has been updated with a more accurate and earlier memorandum from the Trump administration about advance parole.

2022-07-08,AU,conservative,"American University is known for its environmental consciousness, priding itself on being the first university to reach carbon neutrality. AU was recently selected as a 2022 U.S. Department of Education “Green Ribbon Schools'' Post-secondary Sustainability Awardee. Admittedly, AU has taken progressive steps in building sustainability plans to achieve groundbreaking goals and milestones. Yet, the impression of a green campus is a narrow, performative illusion that has overshadowed student efforts in maintaining this image. Students demand and deserve more communication, transparency and support from the administration to breed an environmentally sustainable culture involving all contributors, not just the students alone.
On April 14, the AU Community Garden announced that the garden will be demolished to build the new Center of Athletic Performance (CAP) in fall 2023 instead of the initial two to five-year plan to relocate the garden. The news shocked everyone as the garden has served the community by providing a safe and green space, carefully nurtured by its members and volunteers. On top of their regular duties and routines to take care of the garden and plan for next semester, the garden leaders have been working tirelessly to chase down responsible representatives that have not communicated clearly about the plan for the garden. During an April 11 meeting, Leonardo Casas, AU Senior Project Manager, told the gardeners that AU was destroying the garden in the summer without plans to restore it. This devastating update was debunked when the garden leaders met with Anthony Cortes, Director of Capital Management and everyone involved in the CAP project on April 18. A new timeline was introduced at the meeting and they guaranteed that the plan would include administrative support throughout the process of relocating and rebuilding the garden to build a bigger and better one. 
Thankfully, there is a more definite and optimistic plan for the garden now, but this would not have happened if it were not for the garden’s fearless leaders’ determination and resiliency in uncovering the ideas and decisions made behind closed doors without their input. 
The lack of communication and transparency is a consistent behavior of AU when it concerns environmental projects initiated by students. The administration’s inaccessibility for students to reach out to representatives and access resources hinders the garden’s progress and our goal of becoming more environmentally friendly. Even the Summary Narrative of AU’s application to Green Ribbon Schools heavily emphasized the role of the garden and the University’s financial support towards clubs dedicated to improving sustainable outcomes around campus. Yet, the so-called “sustainability fund” has never been consistent or enough for clubs like the AU Community Garden to utilize. The lack of funding restricts the garden to more conservative projects. Therefore, bigger and bolder proposals like building a greenhouse or a pond were pushed back or rejected. AU seems to only care about environmental sustainability for superficial purposes, such as the aesthetics of the Arboretum and the benefits of tourism and recruitment, greenwashing and fostering a culture of “look, but don’t touch.”
Unlike the “culture of sustainability” AU claims to have, there is a lack of unity within our community. Stemming from the lack of collaboration with administration, students feel as though no one is in the loop of knowing what is going on, including professors in the environmental science department and many other related departments. Garden members and other AU community members were distraught prior to the updated information the leaders unearthed by relentlessly hassling administrative people for answers. It was also disheartening to witness AU leaving sustainability behind again by leaving the garden out of the 2021 Campus Plan. Disjointed words about the garden were tossed around without consulting with the members who take care of the garden. Students are then forced to clarify the situation and make room for themselves when the administration should have guaranteed their space in the plan in the first place. 
Although progress is slow, students and faculty members remain persistent. For instance, Valentina Aquila, a professor within the Department of Environmental Science, created an email chain that links all environmental science and studies majors for better communication and exposure to opportunities circulating within the community. Despite the positives, many setbacks and unfinished projects were left behind due to the lack of commitment from AU. Students have presented projects that were approved by the Learning by Leading program. However, when it came down to funding and facilitation of implementing projects, students did not receive financial or actionable staff support. The program encouraged leadership in expanding student-run environmentally focused projects with scarce and unconstructive mentorship. Therefore, projects were rarely followed through due to financial concerns and a lack of resources. In the end, many promising projects are swept under the rug, neglected and left behind. 
The AU Community Garden and environmental advocates need more than verbal support. Although student activism is essential in building an inclusive green campus, the student effort has been one-sided and AU has been taking credit for their work without providing the support they need. Suppose AU will brand and brag about its commitment to building an environmentally sustainable space in the Bender tunnel and during campus tours. In that case, AU’s decision-making process should prioritize the garden and the needs of the students. A sustainability leader requires AU to approach with more top-down actions and united teamwork among administration, faculty members, clubs and organizations and the student body.

2022-12-08,AU,conservative,"Editor’s Note: This story contains references to sexual assault.
I was excited about the protest against sexual assault on Nov. 10. I was so happy there was something planned to bring people together to support survivors. But after reading the promotional infographics and seeing the photos everyone posted, no one even mentioned masks. A protest in honor of survivors was unsafe for the most impacted group: disabled women.
The disabled womens’ community has the highest rate of sexual assault out of any other group at 83 percent, according to a study by Thomas Weiss in Disabled World. Disabled people also make up a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths, up to 95 percent in parts of the U.S., according to Axios. The most conservative estimate shows that disabled people are 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19, and that’s only with one preexisting condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No matter the methodology, disabled people are at the highest risk for both COVID-19 and sexual assault. I thought that in a protest full of people claiming to support survivors, the most impacted community would be uplifted or, at the very least, safe. But in a sea of people wearing red in solidarity with survivors, only a handful wore masks. 
Optional masks are a segregationist policy, dictating what bodies are safely allowed in a space. In a protest setting, that means excluding the most impacted from fighting for their own rights.
According to the CDC, D.C. still has a substantial COVID transmission level. The Omicron variant makes up 99.8 percent of U.S. cases, according to GISAID. American University attests that the vaccine requirement makes unmasking safe, but the vaccine AU requires is only 50 percent effective against Omicron, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, and the efficacy wanes as more time passes. In other words, masking is how we can keep AU safe. 
The choice to not wear a mask communicates to me, as an immunocompromised individual, that I am not welcome at AU, let alone in a space for survivors nor in the space of support. My mask protects me briefly if I stand 10 feet from the protest, but that means I either have to look over my shoulder to make sure no one is coming too close or not attend at all. My unmasked peers have communicated that my safety is my responsibility, and they will do nothing to help others be safe. That sounds just like the sexual violence policy they’re advocating against. This is how I know that little real support or radical change can be found with most protest attendees.
It was clear to me as a disabled woman that most of the attendees’ support only goes so far as not to inconvenience themselves. They ask AU for bare-minimum precautions for survivors and safe, educational integration for women, but won’t provide either within the movement.
“Women on campus are in a state of fear,” said one of the protest’s speakers, according to a Twitter thread by AU student Isabelle Kravis. I agree. I am in a state of fear. I am well aware of the insufficiencies of AU’s Title IX Office. At least able-bodied women know that they can lean on their peers for support. My fear is of my peers, and I fear knowing that even the people doing the most work to uplift survivors and protect other students will not protect me. 
“I felt unsafe and excluded [at the protest],” Gretchen Venema, a disabled sexual assault survivor and senior in the College of Arts and Sciences, told me. “Seeing friends not wear masks is really harmful to me because I know that they do not value disabled people and disabled lives. It's isolating and hurtful.”
At AU’s protest, it seemed like the unmasked supporters were saying they weren’t okay with our sexual assault, but they were okay with our segregation or death. “Disability integration means an expectation of accommodations everywhere,” said Venema. “A movement that excludes disabled people is not as progressive as it thinks it is. [It shows] intersectionality is not important to them.” 
“We deeply wish we had made an announcement early into the walkout asking folks to wear masks,” said protest organizer and School of Public Affairs senior Lillian Frame, in an interview with me. “This was a failing of ours and something we’re working to better in the future.”
Frame and I are planning to work together to make future action accessible. Still, the fact that most protest attendees would have to be reminded speaks volumes about ableism within social movements.
Protesting without protecting the most impacted and vulnerable is performative at best and eugenist at worst. If any social change advocates want true justice, they must start by making their movements as survivable as possible.

2023-02-06,AU,conservative,"American University President Sylvia Burwell spoke alongside Ron Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University, and Taffye Benson Clayton, the vice president of inclusion and diversity for Auburn University, on the intricacies of free expression at universities with the goal of maintaining an inclusive and safe environment during a panel on Feb. 1 hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center.
The revised version of AU’s Freedom of Expression and Expressive Conduct policy was released in August 2022, which was a part of focus of the conversation around free speech. 
Burwell said the three key components of the new policy were nuance, practice in context, and values and mission, a part of the policy she continued to return to in the discussion.
“You have to consider those [components] in the context of values,” Burwell said. “What are the values we all hold? And that we are one community whether it is in the classroom, if it is in protests and having policies and approaches that are connected to your values.” 
Burwell said she hopes to see AU students focus on inclusion along with freedom of speech. 
“We believe we can't be a great university if we aren't inclusive, and ‘inclusive’ includes everything from issues of race, to disability, to the issues of our conservatives on campus and how they feel in the setting,” Burwell said.
Clayton discussed the importance of educating students on freedom of expression not being in conflict with inclusion, following a report from the Knight Foundation and Gallup demonstrating that college students believe otherwise.
Eighty-one percent of college students reported believing they should be exposed to all types of speech, even if it is offensive, but 76 percent of all students said diversity and inclusion frequently or occasionally come into conflict with free speech rights, according to the report.
With these findings in mind, Clayton said the approach to free speech on campuses must be inclusive and differentiated.
“Inclusive in the sense that everyone is included under the tent, and differentiated meaning we must be able to speak to the needs of diverse segments of the population very authentically,” Clayton said.
Daniels said it is the responsibility of university leaders to equip students to have difficult conversations with those of dissenting viewpoints by being committed to creating a space for that.
He called out educators who said there had not been enough done in regards to cultivating these environments for students and offered a solution of organizing speaker events featuring debates of conflicting views. 
Bamidele Idaomi, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a founding member of the Bipartisan Group of AU who attended the event. He explained this policy came at an opportune time as polarization continues to grow across the country and on college campuses.
“I think it's very good that universities are putting in the effort to making sure that there are some type of inclusive thoughts when it comes to different aisles of perspective,” Idaomi said.

2023-02-10,AU,conservative,"Sam Smith performing live in 2015 in Brussels, Belgium. 
Sam Smith performing live in 2015 in Brussels, Belgium. 
After months on end of “Unholy” filling our TikTok feeds, Sam Smith’s fourth studio album “Gloria” has arrived. 
Prior to the album coming out on Jan. 27, Smith was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on Jan. 21, and shockingly brought out their contemporary and collaborator, Kim Petras, to perform their fabled song “Unholy.” This performance radiated the essence of what Smith had intended for “Gloria” — a work that has proven to counter expectations of the artist’s typical soulful style. Most people are familiar with the four-time Grammy winner, but on “Gloria,” Smith makes an unapologetic reintroduction.
Back on their third album, “Love Goes,” we were introduced to a version of Smith beginning to celebrate themself, since they had recently come out as nonbinary. With groovy tracks like “Dancing With a Stranger” featuring Normani, we came to know Smith’s newest artistic intentions. On “Gloria,” Smith embraces their queerness, and seems to prioritize having fun with production and writing. 
To begin, the album leads with “Love Me More,” immersing the listener into the ethos of this record. “Every day, I'm trying not to hate myself,” Smith sings softly, ending the first verse with, “Maybe I am learning how to love me more.” 
Smith’s voice and lyricism pop out as the most rhythmic and luring aspects of the entire album. More importantly, this track speaks to the specific difficulties of learning to love yourself as a queer person in the limelight, where relentless homophobia and hate can feel inescapable. 
“I’m becoming the artist of my dreams,” Smith said in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music. Being queer in the music industry and public eye takes a toll emotionally, especially as a nonbinary person who pushes the bounds of gender expectations. From “In The Lonely Hour” to now, we’ve seen Smith come into their own, but as we know, it hasn’t been without tribulations. 
Even now, Smith has received backlash after releasing a music video for the disco-pop song, “I’m Not Here To Make Friends.” Throughout the video, Smith owns and displays performances of their sexuality, embracing their queerness through ostentatious fashion choices, among other things. Controversy sparked chiefly among conservative circles, claiming the video was oversexualized, while many analysts have determined these critiques to be homophobic.   
Although this album appears to be a celebration of Smith’s identity and newfound self, it does fail to excel in the artist’s typical levels of in-depth songwriting. “How To Cry” stands out as the track that reverts to Smith’s signature soul-bearing lyricism, yet it comes off as insincere placed next to “Unholy” on this record. Similarly, the title-track “Gloria” is a beautiful arrangement of religious church choir, yet it is sandwiched between “I’m Not Here To Make Friends” featuring Calvin Harris and Jessie Reyez, as well as a disappointingly cliche Ed Sheeran feature. Unfortunately, this track falls completely out of place, which is an absolute disservice as it’s the most spiritually composed ode to the constant struggle of achieving self love.
It’s impossible to look at this record and not talk about Reyez’s contribution to Smith’s full body of work. Reyez’ vocals are featured on three tracks, and Reyez has songwriting credits on “Gimme,”  which also features Koffee. On Smith’s first track featuring Reyez titled “Perfect,” a slow and low beat brings the audience to a self-acceptance anthem, highlighted by lines such as “I wear my flaws like jewelry.” Much like Smith, Reyez fuses rhythm and blues with other genres in her own music, which proves to be Smith’s symbolic choice bringing her on board this record. 
Even though “Unholy” stands out as the most famous song on this record, it still leaves something to be desired. Yet, the yearn for more from Smith means perhaps the artist will sink deeper, reflecting more on their next project. “Gloria” serves as Sam Smith’s scratch at the surface of understanding themself, which is not necessarily a bad thing. 
For now, “Gloria” is the artist's first real step into unapologetically loving themself, which is something to be applauded.

2009-04-09,AU,liberal,"The D.C. Council voted unanimously Tuesday to honor same-sex marriages performed in other states - a decision some AU students have vocally supported. 
Lawmakers expect the proposal to go to Congress for a final vote on May 5, according to The Washington Post. Tuesday's vote was the first step in a larger battle to legalize gay marriage in the District - an issue that the council expects to consider soon. 
D.C. already grants domestic partner rights for insurance benefits, hospital visits and other purposes, Council Chairman Vincent Gray said in a press release Tuesday. 
""However, the unanimous, affirmative vote today sends a clear signal that the council is prepared to stand up for the human rights of all D.C. residents no matter what their sexual orientation,"" Gray said in the release.
The council's decision sends the message that they value all relationships, AU Queers and Allies President John Marzabadi said. This could help further the cause for legalizing gay marriage, especially because it was a unanimous vote, he said. 
""The decision is a step in the right direction,"" Marzabadi said. 
While it is too soon to tell what effect the proposal will have on the AU community, it could have a noticeable effect on school policy, he said. AU is currently one of the few universities that provides domestic partner benefits for same sex couples, and a congressional decision to honor same-sex marriages in D.C. could influence the type of benefits same-sex couples see, he said. 
On a larger scale, the proposal will send a message to Congress and open up debate on the same-sex marriage act, Marzabadi said. 
""I think we could definitely see in 2009 at least three or four other states legislating or mandating same sex marriage,"" he said. ""And that's just the states that we know of that have pending legislation.""
Sam Schmidt, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, said he felt it is just a matter of time before gay marriage will become widely legalized.
""After a while the government is not going to be able to restrict a select group of people's rights,"" he said. ""It just won't outlast the movement."" 
Madison Major, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, said she hopes the proposition is the first step toward same-sex marriage. 
""I don't know about [the] near future, but yeah, I'm optimistic,"" she said. 
While D.C. is a fairly liberal city, the real issue is getting the proposal past Congress because D.C. has federal oversight in all internal matters, according to Marzabadi. 
""I think right now that's kind of a 50-50 situation,"" he said.
Queers and Allies does not have an official position on council's vote, Marzabadi said. 
""But we are in favor of marriage equality, to put it lightly,"" he said.

2009-09-10,AU,liberal,"Sept. 11, 2001 set the tone of our generation. That morning eight years ago is indelibly imprinted on our collective consciousness. As we wage two wars and confront the complexities of the Middle East, we are still haunted by the horrors of that day. But all of this begs the question: What better way to rebuild our American spirit than to rebuild the World Trade Center? 
As it turns out, this task is easier said than done -- but not because people aren't interested. Many started thinking about rebuilding the towers even as the piles of rubble still smoldered. The problem is, in the eight years since the attacks, issue after issue has bogged down the project. 
Architect Daniel Libeskind was chosen to engineer the effort, but his original proposition featuring an asymmetrical tower that recalled the Statue of Liberty has been scrapped in favor of the current realization, the centerpiece of which is a shimmering tower that begins with a square base, morphs into an octagon halfway up, and is once more a square at the top. It will rise to the exact height of the original North Tower, but the addition of an antenna brings the total height to 1,776 feet.  
On one hand, this seems a little corny. It feels as if the designers are picking the low-hanging fruit as far as symbolic numbers go, and the effort to incorporate the year of American independence feels somewhat forced. But on the other hand, some of the spirit of America lies in its willingness to enjoy a kitschy inside reference, even in the midst of rebuilding after a tragedy.  
This main building was originally given the name ""Freedom Tower"" by former New York Gov. George Pataki. It has since been re-designated 1 World Trade Center, the address of the original North Tower. While the official address is clunky and a good nickname is a fine thing,  the moniker ""Freedom Tower"" could make a person a little nervous. The concept of freedom is a wonderful thing, and it's good to live in a country where we have it. But the word ""freedom"" has, in the context of 9/11, taken on a buzzword status, ever since the explanation of ""They hate our freedoms"" began cropping up as an easy-to-process substitute for a full exposition of the web of complex international relations and conflicting ideologies that led up to this tragedy and then colored our response to it. The dignity of a new World Trade Center needs not be sullied by something that reminds us of ""freedom fries."" 
The design of the centerpiece tower itself involves a reflecting facade that is airy and ethereal and a sculpted antenna with a round base. But no design can please everybody. New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff pronounced it ""brooding"" and ""obelisk-like,"" while others look at it and see something resembling a hypodermic needle which is whimsically reminiscent of the last paragraph of Lincoln's inaugural speech, where he exhorts his nation to ""bind up the nation's wounds ... to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.""  
That's what this project is about -- binding up the nation's wounds and continuing forward, despite the sadness of that morning eight years ago and the many trials and divisions we have faced since then. Progress has been slow and often difficult, but work on the new World Trade Center has begun, ensuring that even as we rebuild and recover, those who lost their lives will not be forgotten.

2009-09-10,AU,liberal,"As I watched Ted Kennedy laid to rest at the end of August, I found myself thinking about 1987. That was the year Kennedy castigated Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. During Bork's hearings, Kennedy said, ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government."" In retrospect, many people think Kennedy's speech was the beginning of the end for Bork. Critics also charge that the harshness of his words caused of our current culture war. Maybe so. As recently as Aug. 28 of this year, The New York Times ran an editorial stating as much.
Whether or not he caused it, Kennedy certainly was on the right side of the culture war. Like all good progressives, he battled social conservatives who seek to suppress anything they personally find un-Christian, immoral or inconsistent with traditional American values. It is a struggle that still rages today.
The current Virginia gubernatorial race is rife with culture clash. The Washington Post recently reported on Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's college thesis for Regent University (Pat Robertson's school). In said thesis, McDonnell writes that working women are ""detrimental"" to families. He argues that government should prefer married couples to ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.""  He also calls a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing contraception for unmarried couples ""illogical."" He wrote that at age 34. McDonnell is starting to look like George Allen, a Virginia Republican whose 2006 Senate re-election campaign was eventually derailed when he was caught using an ethnic slur.
The Democratic National Committee has released a statement on this issue and its wording sounds familiar. It makes reference to ""Bob McDonnell's preferred Virginia,"" and pundits are already describing Democratic attacks on the thesis as ""Borking"" McDonnell. ""Borking"" is the term Republicans created for when Democrats show their backwards-looking nominees and candidates for what they really are. This entire episode illustrates why despite Democratic struggles, the Republican Party is far away from returning to power. And why? Perhaps because the GOP is a party made up of white men looking out for the interest of white men.
The problem for Republicans is that the number of white men in America continues to decline. Women outnumber them today, and in just a few decades there will be no racial majority in America. The election of a black man who campaigned on the change undercuts the decades-old GOP strategy of appealing to certain white, male fears. There are still plenty of scared white men. They are the armed nuts you see at town halls, and they would love to live in Robert Bork's America. But let us always remember Ted Kennedy. As we look around at our country as it exists now, not in a Republican fantasy of yesteryear, let us realize something. We don't live in Robert Bork's America. We live, mostly, in the America of Ted Kennedy's dreams.

2009-10-12,AU,liberal,"Clarification Appended
It’s always tough to talk about abortion. It’s a divisive issue on which many good people vehemently disagree. This is true at American as it is across America. On our campus, the Students For Life and Students For Choice organizations both thrive. Both are big; both are active. The abortion debate plays out articulately and passionately, to the credit of all involved. 
This newspaper has no plans to take sides in this struggle, especially because there is diversity of opinion among our editorial board. However, we are supportive of advancing honest and open discourse on this issue, which is why we appreciate the panel discussion AU Students For Choice hosted this past week.
Clearly, “Exposing Fake Clinics” was a pro-abortion rights affair. Wednesday’s panel featured representatives from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, the National Abortion Federation and the Feminist Majority Foundation. It’s safe to say none of these organizations advocate overturning Roe v. Wade or supporting Sarah Palin for president in 2012. Still, social conservatives can and should learn from them. The panel exposed disturbing misinformation campaigns on the part of anti-abortion rights activists, which undermine the anti-abortion cause and embolden pro-abortion rights activists. More importantly, they are harmful to American women, pro-life and pro-choice alike.
According to a Sept. 21 press release from Feminist Majority Foundation, many anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers in this country use “misinformation, fear and shame tactics to coerce and intimidate women out of considering abortion as an option.” Some call condoms a “con job,” completely misrepresenting their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and disease. Additionally, some CPCs distribute pamphlets that claim abortion leads to an increased risk of breast cancer. The World Health Organization refutes this claim completely.
To be fair, pro-abortion rights organizations can also be guilty of stretching the truth and omitting information harmful to their cause. This should go without saying. But no serious activist on either side of this issue would justify bad behavior by pointing to more bad behavior. In fact, most activists on both sides of this issue would probably agree on a few things.
Given that abortion remains legal in this country, women should be able to access a wide range of accurate information on this sensitive topic. Social conservatives should stop their scare tactics and misinformation. Social liberals should be honest about abortion’s physical and emotional consequences. Abortions are not a walk in the park. They can be gruesome and they raise troubling moral and ethical questions for an increasing number of Americans, including an increasing number of young people.
This issue is divisive and emotional. For many, gray area simply does not exist. But this is all the more reason why our campus and our country deserve an honest, substantive debate. The abortion argument should never be reduced to competing smear campaigns. Precisely because we cannot render this culture war unnecessary, America must fight it fairly. 
Clarification: The term ""pro-abortion"" was inappropriately used several times in this editorial and should have been ""pro-abortion rights."" This version of the editorial has been changed to reflect this.

• To whoever was complaining about the new SIS building: 
Please allow AU to spend money making the other majors learning facilities usable before you complain about not having LEAFY GREENS AND A WATERFALL. I hope you realize how excessive that is.

• Eagle Rants is an embarrassment to the entire university and should be abolished immediately.
EDITOR’S NOTE: No.
• I have no sympathy for people who can't get real jobs after they graduate. They didn't take advantage of the internships available in D.C.
• Dear Housing & Dining: 
Thank you for screwing up Roper so badly that our toilets barely work anymore. Glad to know that my $35k a year is going towards ""WONK"" T-shirts and not functioning bathrooms.
• I am so insecure. It sucks. I've been here only a couple weeks and already I feel like I'm going out of my mind. I finally decided to go out last night and the guy I took with me turned out to be straight. Of all the gay people here, I had to pick the straight guy. Seriously? This is a joke, right?
• To the girl in love with philosophy guy – if it's a certain class we're talking about I know who you are referring to, and he is gorgeous. Good thing I'm a guy!
• I've never hated a person in my entire life ... until I met one of my professors this semester.
• There should be a way for Eagle Rants people to meet up.  There's a lot of AU love, and such people should become face to face friends.
• I want someone I can run up to and put my arms around.
• Dump your unaffectionate, inattentive boyfriends! Best decision I ever made. They aren't worth it. And you deserve better!
• 1. To affluent law student: this is to not say you are unsuccessful but someday you will thank your parents for making you appreciate paying for things on your own.  Believe in yourself and know that you paying for things on your own will be beneficial.
2. Yes AU rules.
3.  Off campus living is nice but I can assure you that you are not alone. Even living in the Berks has made me feel alone. I stare out my window and there's no life in each apartment.

• I've been congested and coughing for the last week ... I think I've got the Wonk.
• What’s the point of a three day weekend if we aren't allowed in the damn library?
• When did all the Eagle rants get so emo? Write that stuff in your diaries everyone, seriously.
• You have broken my heart. I am numb inside and can only stare blankly at the sea of faces I come across. I am dead inside now thanks to you. Save me!
• To the person complaining about getting kicked off campus: 
My roommate and I went to the room draw last semester, and even though we both had really high lottery numbers, we got a room in Centennial. Easily. It was wide open. You obviously didn't really care that much about living on campus and just like to bitch and whine.
• If I needed another Chris Matthews to express their sourpuss attitude and liberal opinions towards the upcoming election, when the Republicans WILL take the House, I would have applied to AU.
oh, wait...
• Eagle rants is not an advice column. Eagle rants is not a relationship column. EAGLE RANTS IS NOT FOR SOLACE, IT'S HERE TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
• Whatever happened with Artemas Ward Week last year? Did that ever end up happening? If not, will we have two this year to make up for it?
• Dear everyone with relationship issues: Talk to your significant other about it. Seriously. It doesn't matter what’s bothering you. It is astounding how much easier it is to work through issues together.
• What's with the bureaucracy here at American? None of the people who work at the school or in the registrar know what's going on. Last week I was trying to get an override form for a class I needed, I asked three different people and got three different answers. So much for paying almost $50,000 a year, right?
• Why are only a small minority of the AU events made into Facebook events?  Is it that hard to make a Facebook event?  Note to people creating events at AU: If you make a Facebook group for it, then more people will show up. Pretty simple.
• I'm sick of being sick!
• Bilingual guys are very hot. I love you all.
• Where is our POTUS op-ed!?!? Eagle editors, get with it!
• To the person who posted ""To the person who has had sex in the library, you are a pig.  Go back to whereever you come from and have sex in your own goddamn library. "" I would like to say that your grammar and spelling are impeccable. Really shows some class!
• I miss the old days when I could get drunk any day of the week. Now I'm working two jobs and would rather go to bed by 11 p.m.
• Dear College Democrats,
Why would you close the doors to the event on Thursday night after it started?  Some people have evening classes and would have liked to have slipped in late without making a disturbance. Think about that in the future please.
• I'm a very quiet person, I've had people say that they think I'm stuck up cause I don't talk much, but in reality I just don't want to say something awkward and stupid.

2010-10-12,AU,liberal,"One attribute you quickly acquire as a writer is thick skin. As an undergraduate columnist in San Diego, I once shadowed syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette for the day. After a brief introduction, he asked me to follow him upstairs. He led me to his office and asked if I’d hold on just a minute. After a few moments he waved me over, pointed to his desktop and I peered over his shoulder.  
I was stunned. The first words I read were: YOU (RHYMES WITH BUCKING) (INSERT RACIST SLUR HERE). He smirked and clicked on the next one. To the biggest idiot in San Diego! He shrugged. Then held the cursor on the scroll bar for approximately 10 seconds and said wryly, “Not bad for 12:00 p.m., eh?” 
“That’s enough insults to last a lifetime,” I replied. “Just wait till the east coast wakes up,” I stupidly muttered under my breath.   
The barrage of vitriolic e-mails was not an aberration. See for yourself. Many articles or op-eds posted online elicit disparaging ad hominem attacks. At times, they’re warranted (see the tasteless Alex Knepper column last semester), and sometimes they’re not (see columns I compose). I, for example, have been referred to as a dolt (fairly accurate), and criticized for being too smart (way off base) by using too many polysyllabic words for the same column. Even the Negative Nancy’s disagree over their disappointment.  
It begs a larger question, why are we more motivated to act when we’re angry or upset than when we’re happy? Why does it take a recession before people start saving? Why does a girl have to threaten to dump her boyfriend before he starts paying attention? Why do we slander a professor for an unreasonable exam and flippantly ignore the bonus points gifted the week prior? I could go on and on. 
Are we simply irascible and yearning to be ticked off? Or is our reluctance to show equivalent approbation under positive circumstances, a societal failing in need of repair? Either way, we’ve got one giant unattractive chip on our shoulders.     
Last week I watched our volleyball team dismantle Holy Cross and encore that performance by escaping a tough Navy team. The second match was exhilarating, with the second set going to a nail-biting 34-32 before the Eagles prevailed. Yet aside from both basketball teams and a few friends/parents of the team, attendance was sparse. I’ve seen more vegetarians at Burger King.
However, I presume if AU administrators were considering axing the volleyball program (they’re not thankfully), there’d be a campaign of letters and exponentially more fans overnight. The outrage would spread instantly and suddenly we’d all be cheering as loud as Blake Jolivette (you’d know if you were there) at home games.
Perhaps we’re all wound up so tightly in our jobs, internships, homework and personal lives, it’s a chore to take a deep breath, acknowledge the good, and go out of our way to demonstrate our satisfaction like we do when we’re incensed. Perhaps it’s an aggregation of these stresses that make us aggressive drivers or induced the need for Eagle Rants (which I wholeheartedly endorse). It’s great to have a forum to blow off steam, but too frequently that venue encroaches on our typical behavior.  
Let’s face it — we take the positives for granted. 
How often do we pull a professor aside and say thanks after an inspiring lecture? How often do we tip 30 percent instead of 20 percent for excellent service? How often do we deride our employers behind close doors, while rarely appreciating them signing our checks? 
Not as often as we should. And while AU students are admirably provoked by national and international injustices — we’re widely seen as the most (politically) active in the nation — inspiration to act should come from positive circumstances too.

2010-12-06,AU,liberal,"This will be my final column as an opinion writer for The Eagle. In this space, I’ve argued for drug liberalization, urban renewal projects, and a greater focus on our long-term fiscal health. I discussed the importance of living within one’s means, lamented our dysfunctional political system, and criticized our incoherent foreign policy. 
What I never wrote much about was American University, and for that, I’m sorry. I know that I wasn’t your first, second, or even third destination when you wanted to read a view of the political scene. 
I also apologize to those who were looking for more partisanship and found my writing muddled in the middle. Actually, I take that back. I can’t stand fringe politics, Left or Right. Ideological polarization is tearing this country apart. Regardless, if you ever stumbled across my column, I do hope that you found my thoughts insightful, temperate, and, above all, reasonable. 
However, I want to devote my parting words not to opinion or policy, but to everyone and everything that made American University special during my years here. When I submit my senior thesis next week, I will conclude a journey that began in August 2007. Less than three and a half years later, I can proudly say that I wouldn’t trade any of it for the world. 
So here’s to you, AU:
To the Letts third floor of 2007-2008, where I spent countless nights in the South side lounge and started friendships that will last a lifetime. 
To Letts’ sixth floor sky lounge, where residents know not to enter if the lights are off and the two couches are pushed together. Trust me, stay away.  
To Centennial Hall, where sophomores go to pretend that they are moving up in the world and where I fell in love. 
To the four knuckleheads that I chose as roommates for the last few years, thanks for all the nonsense and the endless laughter. 
To the Terrace Dining Room, where I’m an endangered species: a senior in a sea of freshmen and sophomores. To the most underrated cafeteria on campus, thank you for feeding me.   
To the men’s basketball team, for winning back-to-back Patriot League crowns in 2008 and 2009. Facing the fourth-seeded Villanova Wildcats in the opening round of the 2009 NCAA tournament, the 13-seeded Eagles played unconscious basketball for more than half of the game. AU led by as many as 14 and held a 10-point lead with under 13 minutes to play. It was some of most inspired basketball I’ve ever seen. Somewhere, Garrison Carr is still knocking down 25-foot jumpers. 
To the now-defunct School of International Service pit, I miss your character and sheer depth. In all seriousness, it’s been exciting to watch this campus develop since 2007. The new SIS building and the Kogod School of Business addition are helping to put this university on the map. It will be interesting to see how the administration transforms the Nebraska Parking Lot in the coming decade.   
To Professor Cynthia Bair Van Dam, whose College Writing Seminar on the Politics of Education drove me to be a better writer. 
To Professor Robert Johnson, who showed me the distressing reality of our prison system and altered my stance on the death penalty.  
To Professor Alan Kraut, whose masterful lectures on the Civil War made me want to put down my pen and just listen. His oratory skills were that powerful. 
To three School of Communication professors, Rick Horowitz, Lynne Perri, and Rodger Streitmatter, who deepened my passion for journalism and media studies.
To Professor Leonard Steinhorn, my Honors Capstone advisor, whose tremendous insight and guidance have proven invaluable. 
To everyone at the American University Career Center, from Elaine Salisbury to Bridget O’Connell to Lara Ferraiolo to Chris Hughes to Susan Gordon—you’ve all been integral parts of my professional growth and career exploration process. It’s going to be hard to let go. 
To The Eagle, thank you for giving me a voice and granting me a platform. 
Farewell, AU. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.

2011-01-11,AU,liberal,"It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve.

2011-01-11,AU,liberal,"F. Scott Fitzgerald famously once wrote “There are no second acts in American lives.” When Fitzgerald, then a forgotten man on the cusp of death, wrote that back in 1940 it was true. Yet ironically enough, Fitzgerald experienced a huge revival decades later and is now considered one of the great American writers. Therefore, his story serves to exemplify one of the most persuasive and ingrained traits of 21st century America. There are no longer any one-act plays in American lives. Today, every single fleeting celebrity has their 15 minutes of fame extended indefinitely. So we must ask, how did we get here and what does it mean?
Maybe it all started with Fitzgerald, or perhaps it began with Richard Nixon. This nation’s 37th president was infamous for his ability to survive scandals and setbacks from the Checkers speech, to the 1960 election, to even earning respect after Watergate. In fact, the political arena has become one of the main stages for this “never-ending story” phenomenon. For instance, one would have thought that federal indictments would have been the end for politicos Tom DeLay and Rod Blagojevich. But no, respective stints on “Dancing with the Stars” and “The Apprentice”, brought them back and are what most Americans will probably remember them for. Even Eliot Spitzer of call girl ring fame, is set to make a return to honorable discourse as a co-host for a primetime news show on CNN. 
Of course, the other major setting for this phenomenon is pop culture. Today, D-list celebrities have their pick of reality shows to join. In fact, now with original reality shows like “The Hills” and “Jersey Shore” celebrities are born so that they can gain popularity, and then create spin-offs, which creates new stars who then create their own spin-offs, and so on and so forth. Before you know it, there is a whole colony of people who are just famous for the sake of being famous. 
There seems to be two main causes responsible for this trend in our culture. The first is our media culture demands this phenomenon and therefore created it. Think about it, if there are going to be hundreds of cable channels, then they need shows, and they need people, any people, to star in those shows. Additionally, over the past few years, our news programs have shifted to gossip in order to attract more viewers. And of course, the Internet provides a limitless vacuum of information to fill. So altogether our 24/7, TV-meets-Internet, media requires us to have thousands of celebrities in order to meet the massive insatiable demands of our instant gratification culture. 
The second cause, though, may be seen as a more positive explanation. That is, that Americans love a happy ending. In the past, a major figure like Britney Spears for instance, would gradually lose her fame and end up a wreck. Today, though, she can have a “comeback” and be the “new Britney.” Put simply, Americans have become addicted to the sweet and optimistic classic three-act structure: rise, fall, and redemption. This has so become our obsession that we are merely repeating this cycle over and over again. Which begs the question, is repeated sanitized story-telling healthy for us? I can only imagine what Fitzgerald would think.

2011-03-01,AU,liberal,"Say you’re riding the Metro. You glance around scanning for a seat, anxious to rest your legs from a long day at work. Your eyes drift down to The Eagle, eager to get your rant fix for the week. Suddenly, the rants zoom up close and personal as a stranger bumps into you, sending the paper violently into your chest. You look up angrily to reprimand the person, only to notice you’re witnessing an altercation that has nothing to do with you. 
The man was shoved. A fuming passenger begins yelling, chasing the man who bumped you with his fists raised ready to fight. 
Or say you’re going for a jog outside on a balmy afternoon. Justin Bieber kicks on your iPod as you approach a hill. You’re zoned in, ready to tackle the climb. You’re huffing and puffing by the end and you crouch down with your hands on your knees to catch your breath. As you turn to continue, you notice a woman dragging a dog on the sidewalk, the leash choking the puppy as it yelps in pain. The woman yanks forcefully as the bark becomes audible over the music. You look on disgusted and press pause on Beebs. She’s scolding the dog and in her fury, kicks it in the mouth. 
What do you do? 
Hopefully, you have never or will never encounter such a grotesque scenario. But you might. Odds are each one of us has been confronted with a similar dilemma at least a few times in our lives. We could each share a troubling anecdote about a schoolyard bully, sexual harassment, or violent parents whacking their child in public. 
Should we intervene? If so, to what extent? What’s the proper protocol? 
There’s no uniform answer. No simple one either. At times, I’ve spoken out in defense of a stranger. Others times I didn’t. Sometimes I regretted my action or lack thereof. Other times I felt proud I was brave enough to interfere to potentially resolve a conflict. 
Obviously, each scenario is unique and can’t be completely anticipated. These events are spontaneous, and it’s impossible to ascertain precisely how you’d react under the intensity of the moment. However, it’s a good idea for us to begin asking these hypothetical questions so we’re more prepared when things happen.
The Center for Women in Transition has a few tips. “In order to create a safer community, everyone can take steps to be an active bystander.” For example, “Ask yourself, ‘If I were in this situation, would I want someone to help me?’” Also, “Just distracting someone, saying something, checking in with a person can stop the momentum of something bad.” Other suggestions include the basics like calling the police.
Practice makes perfect. For those who are naturally shy or timid, positive intervention may be the first place to start. Deliver a sincere compliment to a stranger. By getting out of our comfort zones, we can adapt and feel more at ease under tenser conditions. The world could certainly use more compliments anyhow. 
Some incidences can escalate quickly and if you intervene you may face personal harm. Speaking out may be righteous and admirable or it may be unnecessary and imprudent. There’s always risk incurred in these circumstances.  
Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: ‘If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?’? But ... the Good Samaritan reversed the question:? ‘If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?’”
Your level of engagement is up to you. I’m not endorsing blanket intervention. But do take a stand for what you believe is right.

Sure the guy's an alumni, but this is absurd.

Dear AU Financial Aid Office: Please make a note of all of the students who left campus just before midnight on a Sunday evening so that they could go rally at the White House about the Bin Laden killing. Clearly they don't care about studying during finals week, and since the Metro was closed, they had enough income to spend on a round-trip cab ride. I don't have that kind of money, I'm studying hard, and I really need more financial aid. Just keep that in mind, plzkthxbai.

It's fraud the way doctor's offices try to make you think a pap smear is required to get birth control. It is NOT required! European countries find it backwards that American doctors would withhold birth control until they get to ""examine"" you. Why are women standing by this oppression? Why is women's initiative not fighting for women's equality and instead wasting their time on trying convince us that all men are rapists and drunk sex is rape. True feminists should not stand for this. Women: Did you know you are NOT required by law to get a pap smear before being given birth control? The student health canter (and likely any other health center you go to) will try and push one on you because it is an way for them to make $$$$. Are they screening you for colon cancer? Lung cancer? Lymphoma? (all of which occur more frequently than cervical cancer) Nope. They are using your female sexuality against you and charging you for pap smears when you ARE NOT required to get them. What is Women\'s Initiative doing about this (the most gender oppressive issue in our nation)? NOTHING. Take a stand.
If you are not an AU student, then that makes sense that you do not get free security. Security for an event, is a privilege for AU students because they are paying the salaries. If you are not an AU student it makes sense that you do not get any of the paid benefits students receive, such as the UES center. -resp to article

I pay full tuition to this school. The fact that I have to open my window or else I die from heat stroke is ridiculous. Also I'm dying from the allergies so having my window open does not help. Even in the third world I don't have to deal with this.

Actually you moronic Dung Beetle, people invited to attend the Washington Semester Program have grades that are probably better than yours. What they also can do is pay full freight for the semester.

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

Throughout the past two weeks, Herman Cain has weathered multiple accusations the he sexual harassed multiple women while the CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Four different women have alleged that Cain acted inappropriately toward them, while two went public this week. Yet despite the media firestorm, Cain remains a republican front runner, only a few points behind Mitt Romney. Why has Cain been able to whether the scandal? How should people react to sexual harassment allegations? Our Quick Take columnists weigh in:

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign.

•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you ""down there"", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.

•@Person in American Political Parties Class ranting about a girl in there class: omg there's a girl like that in my World Politics class. I want to bang my head on my desk whenever she asks a question (i.e. rambles on forever without making a point with far too many likes and ums)
•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!
•Confused by eye contact. What does it mean??!! I'm worried that I've accidentally been flirting with people because of my type of eye contact.

•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.

•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.

•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH."" You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.

Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

•Why are you withholding the rants from us? Its December 7th at 21:35:20 pm. Post the damn rants already. Goddamn.
•The 1% must control the weather. What else could explain the storm on December 7th happening on the same day that Occupy AU went down to K Street?
•Ah my friend, when I am writing my paper and you are singing loudly and I ask you nicely to stop, it is generally frowned upon for you to start making an equally loud sound of a different sort not five minutes AFTER I asked you to quiet down. I am not a mean person, I'm just trying to get my facts straight about the Rwandan Civil War and you're not helping.
•WHY ARE THERE NO DECEMBER 7TH EAGLE RANTS??? MY LIFE IS RUINED!
•No eagle rants on December 7th?? Sad day :(
•All I want is to literally have one week of break and to come back. I am -200% excited for home. After the first week, I will be crying myself to sleep every night wishing for mid-January to come faster. I guess I should be thankful enough to be able to come back. As for all of those out there that cannot come back because of family/financial problems, I have tremendous sympathy for you. Hang in there. Hope you'll all be back.

•If you're an Econ MASTERS student you should be able to pronounce ARBITRAGE.
•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you ""down there"", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.
•I love how upper-middle class whites concur in their smug fawning over Nicholas Kristof...nicely done ER editor
•Dear Roommate: The phone is an incredible invention. Believe it or not, you DON'T need to yell loud enough for your mother in Colorado to hear you without the technology. Indoor voice, darling.
•A jog for a first date in the winter...bad idea. Maybe during Cherry blossom time...maybe. Assuming the chick is fit and let's be honest....this is AU we're talking about so that's as likely as correctly formatted rants.
•True that to the long distance relationship comment. Absolutely the single dumbest thing a person can do while in college. #regretslaterinlife

•Dear ""#richgirlproblems"" whose trust fund hasn't come in yet,
Some of us actually have to do something I'm sure you're not aware of called ""work"" to get our money instead of waiting around for someone else's money to come in. Here's some advice while you're waiting, get some real problems.
Sincerely,
Everyone
•Dear fellow biddies, let's save our biddie-ing for the weekend. I have to study for finals.
•So I deactivated my Facebook in order to have to distractions during finals and with the multiple papers I have due..... and yet, I've spent all my time I'd normally spend on Facebook on EagleRants.... #procrastinationproblems
•@Person in American Political Parties Class ranting about a girl in there class: omg there's a girl like that in my World Politics class. I want to bang my head on my desk whenever she asks a question (i.e. rambles on forever without making a point with far too many likes and ums)
•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!
•Confused by eye contact. What does it mean??!! I'm worried that I've accidentally been flirting with people because of my type of eye contact.

•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.
•I will take your 29 pages and raise you 43 pages.  And it's only Tuesday.
•You know what I wish we had more of? Petty, shallow, pedantry to read in the Eagle Rants. It just seems to be lacking
•That awesome moment when two of the rants apply to you floor...
•YES! MEMES! Someone in Leonard has a trollface in their window. I want to meet them!!
•""Ohhhhh my gooood! Im awake!""
""Wow! Im awake too! This is awesome!""
•@ ""jogging as a first date"" responses. We both run, and at times I feel like it would be a good idea, but i prob wont end up doing it. there are better options out there. btw, did any of you guys read the other answers? your opinions varied from one extreme to the next haha.
•On the subject of favorite memes, mine's Forever Alone.  Because it's true.  And funny.
Just in case you were wondering.
•@""That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.""
AMEN. If I wasn't absolutely sure I had not written this, I would have thought I wrote it.
•My day has been horrible, but I just realized that I am so thankful for all that I have in my life, I have no right to be sad.
•@#winning...I don't believe you.
•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.
[Editor’s note: The writers of the sex column this fall and last year both used their real names. The lack of anonymity was not a deterrent for them.]
•Dear girl worried you are his booty call: If his facebook doesn't list you as his girlfriend and you are hooking up with him, you're his booty call.
•@""You're wrong to have a long distance relationship"" Sorry you're jealous that your long distance relationship didn't work out while other people's did. I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for 4 years now. 4 more years to go while as my bf just started med school. And I have no doubt at all that we will make it.
•@""All the normal people who read these"" First off, it's sad that you pride yourself on being ""normal"". Have fun with your average life. Secondly, actually eagle rants were created exactly for relationship issues and policy debates. Get a clue.
•That time where you think you might be pregnant during finals...EFF my life.
•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH."" You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.
•Women needs to quit trying to make the marginalized male population from conforming to their standards.

•@Aspiring drag queen: Athena's on facebook, friend her!
•i didn't hate AU until they got new academic regulations. NOW I NEVER WANT TO RETURN FROM ABROAD OMG.
•This I feel like is a legitimate complaint, why doenst AU have a Fall/Spring Fest type weekend, or day, where we bring a cool musical act to campus, and have them perform on the quad? Plenty of other schools have this, and it seems awesome.
•I keep seeing rants that sound exactly like they could be my ex and getting mildly concerned....
•If you came from North/Upstate NY to DC, you have NO right to complain about the lack of snow. Did you not realize you were going SOUTH?
•dear x & y...good luck
•Dear boyfriend,

•lol the poor kid wondering about the jogging date is probably more confused than ever...
•@AUConservative: I feel like that sometimes but I hail from liberal NJ so I'm used to it.
•I have major, major issues with my professor right now. Like built-up, long-term, legitimate resentment. I'm not an angry person, either.
•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!

•That awkward moment when you realize that Elian Gonzalez is no longer a cute little boy, but an extremely attractive adult.
•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

• ""...because you didnt work hard enough to get to a better school""
There's only so much you can do to compensate for a 440 math SAT score, even if you did get an 800 on the reading part and a 4.0 hs gpa. Not a matter of failing to work hard. I'm happy to be at AU because it actually is a great college, and the only time I felt disappointed was when I heard people whine about how they're not at Harvard. Disappointed in those students, not AU.
• @Editor's response to ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!"" I'm sorry you missed The Room reference and responded with N*SYNC lyrics instead. You also responded with the wrong quote to the LOTR's rant on 2/6/12. It's not your fault you aren't a nerd.

• Maybe it’s time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn’t give birth to you.
• @ranter criticizing paying for a degree that a person won’t use in the “professional world”: When did AU become a vocational school? Last time I checked, I chose to go to a liberal arts college to expand my knowledge on as many topics as I cared to learn about. Sure I will probably never use my poetry class in the “professional world”, but maybe we shouldn’t live our lives catering to what corporate America tells us to be.
• @""because you didn’t work hard enough to get to a better school: Actually many people at AU got into higher ranked schools, and chose to come to AU because it is an amazing school, an amazing location, and amazing, student body, amazing professors, amazing student clubs, amazing student activities each day, etc. But as always, haters gon hate. It speaks to their own depression rather than the actual quality of the school.
• @if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Does is not sadden you at all, the Americans define a person’s worthiness of education by their career path?
• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?
• @person saying the stay at home mom shouldn't spend money on grad school because it is selfish: How dare you. And actually if this girl greatly desires a graduate education, then not going to grad school would be selfish to her kids because who wants to have a mom with low self-esteem who is brooding about how she wishes she would have gone to grad school, but instead she saved the money to use it on the kids.  I would not want to inflict that kind of guilt on a family member.
[Editor’s Note: ]
• I've never had a valentine.
• I'm not the only one who's been staying in this semester on weekends right...??
• @Interested in You: well interested in me,
I sincerely promise I am not a douche. Is it douchey to promise that?  Anyway, be my valentine, interested in me?  :)
• STUPID CORNBALLIN' PIECE OF S#*T!
• Who lies in the shadow of the statue?
• @ I like you, like you,
thank you. that made my day, even though that could be about anyone.
• Dear @Dear Centennial 5 RA,
Yes, I do read eagle rants and yes this is the worst way. This is creepy, please cease and desist.
-Skeeved out RA
• No one explained the pledge process for me :(
• AU needs an undie run. who's with me?
• Ditto to the Anderson 6 North shower rant. I saw it too and I just wanted to die.  THE WATER TOUCHED IT AND THEN TOUCHED MY FEET. aksjks. so. gross.
• so, two people responded to my rant about how ""if you like me, show it, if you don't show it, pick a side"", and even though we go to a school of thousands, I hope to god one of those people are you. I don't think so though: I've seen your computer history, and there are no rants in it.
• You ""want to keep Star Wars pure,"" and yet you're going to see The Phantom Menace in 3D?  Fail.  There are only 3 Star Wars movies, and Han shot first.
• To the random girls I walked back with from AEPi last night: Thank you! Never would have been able to find Tenley otherwise.
• I love the ability to have food be delivered to my door as much as I hate waiting for said food to arrive.
• ""Destiny John, is a fickle b****""
Love,

• ""Guy in my Critical Whiteness class..."" We have a CRITICAL WHITENESS class?!
• Really?  You're going to go with the ""if 2 billion other people believe it, it must be true"" argument?  You can believe what you want, but that's a terrible defense.
• Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks.
• Several laptops have been stolen from the dorms recently, mine included. I am absolutely devastated by this and am desperately seeking any tips on who the culprit may be. Please post @ me if you know anything!
• Reading Eagle Rants makes me feel sorry for Nick Rangos.
• I really want to host a StarCraft tournament on campus. Anyone interested?
• My Case Competition teammates have made me embarrassed to be at AU. I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school.
• I started working out recently because I'm getting pudgy.  Sometimes, though, I'll come back from a really good, hard work out feeling all good about myself, and then I'll take my shirt off to go shower and see how fat and disgusting I still am :(
• I think people have formed a hate against me by joking and telling me I'm pretty and kind. If I were so pretty, and so nice, than why am I single? #AUFemaleProblems
• To any freshmen that feels like they don't fit in - Take it from a senior that had that same problem for four years... Just be yourself. NEVER EVER settle for anything less. Even if no one can relate to you, when your on the verge of graduating, everyone else will be worried about their future and identity while you stayed true, which is the best way to find the right career path... good luck and always keep your head up :)...
• Sometimes a lady just wants to get laid.
• I'm really worried, I just had to reassure your roommate that you be fine. I'm not sure I believed it myself.
• I don't agree with horrid weather like this unless it's going to snow for real. I'm tired of the ""will I/won't I?"" game you're playing forecast!

• To the Star Wars fan ranter: you're trying to keep Star Wars ""pure"" but you're going to see Episode I in 3D? Buh?
• @YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!
WAIT HI. You have to be quoting ""The Room"", right?
• To the person responding to my gender neutral bathroom bashing, thanks for the input.
• Editor's Note: is it illegal to impersonate the Editor?
[Actual Editor’s Note: Yes. I will find you]
• @Gender neutral bathroom person.  Did you ever consider that maybe you're the one who is closed-minded for not considering that many people have conflicts with it due to their religion and beliefs.
• Fellow Lost addicts:
Someone start a club. or a meeting. or something!
Sincerely,
The Man in Black
• ""...because you didnt work hard enough to get to a better school""
There's only so much you can do to compensate for a 440 math SAT score, even if you did get an 800 on the reading part and a 4.0 hs gpa. Not a matter of failing to work hard. I'm happy to be at AU because it actually is a great college, and the only time I felt disappointed was when I heard people whine about how they're not at Harvard. Disappointed in those students, not AU.
• @Editor's response to ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!"" I'm sorry you missed The Room reference and responded with N*SYNC lyrics instead. You also responded with the wrong quote to the LOTR's rant on 2/6/12. It's not your fault you aren't a nerd.
[Editor’s Note: Is this a Back to the Future reference?]
• I STILL THINK YOU'RE CUTE.
I'LL ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE CUTE.
THAT WEDDING BAND WON'T STOP ME.
• Wow, I can't believe the other LOST ranter posted the same quote as me *high five*
• I actually love getting eagle rants at night.  After a long day of school, work, and homework, it is somewhat therapeutic to read the rants.  Thanks for putting up with all this crap, Eagle Rants editor.
[Editor’s Note: High five!]
• If it’s not real, then what are you doing here, Jack? Why did you come back? Why do you find it so hard to believe?
• Why do you find it so easy?
• It’s never been easy!
• (((((((((((((what)))))))))))))
• oh hey eagle rants editor
whatup, we should hang out
-martin
• Thinking of transfering. Why can't AU's philosophy program offer any courses on metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, or the philosophy of language? Blargh...
• All this talk about the *huge* gay population on campus. I'm straight and single. Get at me. My number is ***-***-****
• Dear Boys in Room 446?
My roommate and I enjoyed your dancing in the window today. We would like to meet you one day. Have a great day!
• To Leonard Guy who feels he can't compete: the fact that you're so dedicated and concerned with your work is great! Have confidence, know you can do it, make plans and just try your hardest. I'm a senior so I know how you feel, but you'll be fine. it's not 6 classes, it's hard work and dedication that's key
• @There’s gotta be some way to find hookups without partying, right?: when you find it, LET ME KNOW ;)
• @ The person who said people who are happy here didn't work hard- Yeah, okay. Maybe YOU didn't work hard and are bitter about it, but some of us love AU. If you hate it here so much, work harder and transfer. Let the AU lovers be happy(:
• <3 So much love to the Rants editor for quoting N*Sync lyrics on Friday. <3
[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?]
• It makes me a little sad to think there are so many people in the world who have not and will not ever experience bacon.
• Normally I'm an average to happy person but lately I feel either completely depressed or completely turned on. What's wrong with me?
• People who believe the Earth was created in literally 6 days over 6,000 years ago ARE crazy. Sorry.
• I'm drowning in responsibilities. Go away, to-do list. Go very very far away.
• Doesn't anybody like Age of Empires II anymore?  I know it is over 10 years old, but greatness doesn't go out of style.  Or am I just one lonely AOE girl stuck in the 90s?
• @“‘As the original poster, I am going to pretend you are the guy I wrote this about. I say we should both go for it."" I am the guy you wrote this about. I want you to make the first move.
• @Guy with a drug problem because of his mom. I'm here for you. I totally and definitely get the condescending mom thing and how it can get to you. You. are. not. alone.
• ""I wish my self esteem wasn’t too low to make friends."" can I be your friend?
• @""Is it bad that even though I have a boyfriend, all I want to do is have sex with other guys? Im simply not satisfied and require the extra meat!"" Grow up and get some morals. And some honesty. If you want to mess around then you break up with your boyfriend and live the single life. Otherwise, don't break his heart.
• Cute smoker boy, if only I could get close to you... cough!
• I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.
• I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot your wife is dead!
• Maybe it’s time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn’t give birth to you.
• @ranter criticizing paying for a degree that a person won’t use in the “professional world”: When did AU become a vocational school? Last time I checked, I chose to go to a liberal arts college to expand my knowledge on as many topics as I cared to learn about. Sure I will probably never use my poetry class in the “professional world”, but maybe we shouldn’t live our lives catering to what corporate America tells us to be.
• @""because you didn’t work hard enough to get to a better school: Actually many people at AU got into higher ranked schools, and chose to come to AU because it is an amazing school, an amazing location, and amazing, student body, amazing professors, amazing student clubs, amazing student activities each day, etc. But as always, haters gon hate. It speaks to their own depression rather than the actual quality of the school.
• @if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Does is not sadden you at all, the Americans define a person’s worthiness of education by their career path?
• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?

• 9 minuets until I can get my package!
• @ religious beliefs and gender neutral bathrooms. I didn't say ""replace all bathrooms ever with gender neutral ones"". I'd just like the option to exist
• UNDIE RUN UNDIE RUN UNDIE RUN. that sounds AWESOME
• @undie run. YESSSS
I know at least two people who would definitely do it.
• If you think the 2 billion Christians in the world ALL take the Bible completely literally, then you're the crazy one. And I think you missed the point. Just be respectful of other peoples' religions, no matter what they may be, and expect them to be respectful of yours/lack thereof. The only rule is to not be an asshole. Thanks and God bless.
• One does not simply survive the phonathon...
• @""@Gender neutral bathroom person.  Did you ever consider that maybe you're the one who is closed-minded for not considering that many people have conflicts with it due to their religion and beliefs."" Um religion is a choice; being transgendered is not.
• I don't read long rants.
• Tim McBride wears patriotic boxers. I would know. I've seen them.
• Sometimes a bro just wants to get laid.
• @person wanting tips for stolen laptop: Here's a tip. Don't leave your door unlocked. And don't leave you stuff unattended at the library (as hundreds of signs warn against). I don't know your situation, but if you did leave your door unlocked or your stuff unattended, I do not feel sorry for you at all. Learn some common sense.
• @""I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school."" This is true of any business school. New york times ran stories on this issue a few months back about how business students never develop their full potential of critical thought because they are always doing group projects and never get to think independently.
• @people who think eagle writers/editors/photographers get paid: lol Are you really that clueless? Can you name one college newspaper in the country that pays its writers? It's a college extracurricular, not a career.
• @future SAHM (mom lingo for stay-at-home-mom): Don't let naysayers get you down. I also want to be a stay at home mom right after college and grad school (well, for me right after two grad degrees). I want to study anthropology and creative writing in grad school. And I know fulfilling my academic goals before I am a mom will make me a more mature and confident mother.
• Please put the rants on the left side of the website rather than the far right. It's really frustrating and annoying to have to expand the webpage in order to view the rants.
• What religion is against gender-neutral bathrooms? I can't find that in my bible...
• Jobs board is back in existence, but not functioning at all. Used cars? Please explain.

• @ ""You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.""
This, this, this, a million times this. College has made me come to the sad realization that just because someone is reasonably intelligent and educated, does not mean that they have an understanding of basic hygiene. Or maybe they're just inconsiderate.  Either way, stop being gross!
• I sent you a letter - gatita

""This is a f***ing star! I run it! I'm your boss!""
""You're Mister Stevens?""
• I left AU and since moved to California... but I still read rants sometimes :) And it makes me feel better to know I wasn't the only one that felt really alone and left out while I was there. It was soo hard to make friends and no way in hell was I joining a sorority! Although going to community college now makes me wish I didn't complain about the campus so much!

• Why do I feel awkward when I whistle in public?
• How do you tell a good friend that you don't want to room with her next year because you're terrified that never having any time to yourself will drive you insane? Is there anyway to say that and not seem horrible?
• Any one else on campus in need of roommate? Im in a pickle because my friends have a odd number, help!
• is really tired of watching drunk girls being sloppy, trashy, slutty and classless. please get your lives together so you can maintain whatever dignity you might possibly have left.
• I wonder what Eagle Rants would have been like back in 1925...
""Am I alone in thinking that this Scopes Chap isn't entirely mad?""
""It is simply unthinkable that this institution would allow Undergraduates to sully it's halls with their immaturity. They must think that collegiate life is all about 'making whoopie'.""
• to all the straight girls with boy cuts, you are all 1000% more attractive and hot.
• Just because people's opinions on the Earth's origins differ from your own doesn't mean you have the right to label them crazy. I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate them calling you crazy for believing otherwise. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
• drunkn egle ranting is the new drunkj tesxting!!

• @Star Wars purists: represent! This 3d nonsense doesn't count as star wars... The only possible motivation to see the original three is to finally see them on the big screen.... Stay true!!

• I don't know about anyone else, but I don't use the dorm bathroom soap because I'm allergic to it.. I use hand sanitizer after I leave. please don't judge. we're not all slobs.
• I crashed your plane, brothah.
• @future stay at home mom: It's funny how society has become more accepting of stay at home dads than stay at home moms. I bet no one would criticize a man who went to grad school and then stayed home to raise the kids while his wife works.  Don’t give up on your admirable plan. I plan on being a stay at home mom immediately after going to law school. I’m not even planning on taking the bar exam. Plan on getting prego the day after my last final exam ends. Haha
• Remember that time we only got rants once a week?
• You under counted the sassy.
• So many boogers. Sick. :(
• Grad school is a huge waste of money unless you need it for your career. You do realize that everything you learn in grad school you can  probably learn from books available for free at your local library? Don't drop 50k plus just for a self esteem booster.

• The bad thing about community bathrooms is that when you're sick and phlegm is in your throat you either have to walk to the bath room each time, or develop a phlegm cup.  Which do you think I did?
• I have yet to meet a person at AU with regular bandaids.  That says a lot about a campus.  They're always rainbow, or toy story...

• I cannot deal with it anymore. I just want to experiment with the other sex. I want to know what it's like, what it feels like. I am not up to the point of sex, but anything less would be awesome. I have a couple of ideas, as in friends I would feel comfortable with doing so, (like casual makeout or w.e) but I don't think they would want to in exchange. How do I fix/deal with this dilemma ?

I feel ya. Try focusing on the little changes in your physique and  really hype those up to yourself. I had really flabby arms so when I started working out and finally saw the first indications of a muscular contour, I was super happy and my hard work felt vindicated. You'll get there; just keep swimming!

• Original ranter about the smoke-free campus plan here: I was encouraged to post a rant about this by a bunch of people who were shocked that this idea was being seriously considered. I, personally, do not smoke, and dislike having to inhale secondhand smoke. However, I have mixed feelings about the smoke-free campus plan.

• Dear guy in SIS who thought his headphones were plugged in but was actually just playing music really loudly: That was hilarious and thanks for looking rightfully embarrassed when you realized your mistake!
• To straight female conservative republican. Wow I wasn't even trying to be mean with that first post. You have your whole life to be a racist, bible-quoting, million(miscalculated) mom joining, human rights offender. Why start in college? Keep pretending that your conservative boyfriend doesn't hate gay people because he's in the closet himself. Or that his huge gun makes up for his less than adequate bedroom abilities. If I could legally spit on you I would.

• @”facebook timeline advocate: I love the concept of the timeline, but there are a few really annoying bugs in it that I can’t figure out.  On the “map” feature, whenever I click on a city I have been to it only lets me add a single year. What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.
• @""To be honest, the whole concept of Greek life families really just annoys me..."" Couldn't agree more. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. Your right, where are their priorities?
• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.
[Editor’s Note: I just delete them when they use curse words]
• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!

• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.

I choose to live a healthy lifestyle and do not appreciate people who selfishly release their toxic fumes into my walking path when they could just as easily get their high from a nicotine patch and thereby avoid harming others with their decisions. I try my best not to make decisions that harm others, and I expect the same respect from others.

• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.

• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.

• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly.

• I'm sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished when in actuality it is the hard work of many others over several years who have worked to get a victim advocate on campus.

• Oh boy! the SG dumped more tuition dollars into a Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator! Excellent use of tuition money, especially since there are so many sexual assaults on campus as to overwhelm the existing resources for dealing with them. Just kidding. There are virtually no sexual assaults on campus and there are already adequate resources available.

• @I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
It's not RHA persey, I'd blame the RA's who don't bother looking up at the front desk when you walk in and offing public safety. This would all be so much easier if we just had freaking security cameras in the dorms like other colleges...

• Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.
• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.

2012-03-11,AU,liberal,"Political activist Angela Davis told students radical feminism is crucial to fighting sexism and racism in the 21st century at a speaking event on campus.
“This is a great time to talk about feminism and activism,” Davis said in her March 7 speech in MGC 1, sponsored by Women’s Initiative and the Kennedy Political Union.
Students welcomed activist Davis to with a standing ovation.
Davis, a former Black Panther and member of the Communist Party, spoke about liberal feminism and how it emphasizes social change. Liberal feminism fights against the idea of the individual as the unit of society, she said.
“The struggles were not so much about the individual, but uplifting the entire community,” Davis said.
Davis said women’s rights have improved over the last 40 years, especially in the number of career opportunities offered to women.
But she said certain demands, like birth control and childcare, are available for the first time but can too expensive for working class women.
“I think the economic issues complicate and further emphasize the social issues and vice-versa,” Davis said in an interview with The Eagle.
Davis also said this perspective must be used to examine racism and inequalities for women.
“Anyone who’s truly averse to racism also has to stand up against sexism,” Davis said. “And anyone who’s against sexism must be opposed to racism.”
In her speech, Davis pushed for feminism that does not only involve white women.
“Racism is more entrenched in the 21st century,” Davis said. She later explained that there is an unequal balance of race in the American prisons.
Although Davis advocates for equality for women, she does not believe feminism focuses only on women’s rights. Instead, she believes that feminism is comprised of many issues, including environmental and same-sex marriage.
Davis emphasized the importance of education and knowledge to activism.
“I’ve always believed that knowledge should be transformative,” Davis said in an interview.
As a professor at University of California Santa Cruz, she encourages her students to follow their own career choices.
“Not everyone needs to do the same thing to transform the world,” Davis said in the interview.
However, she emphasized the importance of helping the community. 
“My mother gave back and she constantly encouraged us to give back,” Davis said in her speech. “And I guess that’s why I became an activist.”

•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.

But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology.

There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.

•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?

And the dry stone no sound of water.

•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..

you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm ""glad"" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?

•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•""@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.

•So you always used to booty call me but now you don't answer when I booty call you, which is a bummer because I really liked having sex with you
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the dav
•goal before graduation= have sex in the library. any takers?
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" women's initiative
•@""One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today."" Story of my life. I feel so much better knowing that I'm not the only one!!
•The Eagle should learn to stop editing the work of contributing writers when it doesn't have any grammatical errors. The editor completely mangled a key sentence in my article.
[Editor's note: We edit any submissions for clarity, relativity, length and profanity, in addition to grammar and AP Style. But send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we'll look into it. Also, this editor doesn't know who you are or what you wrote, but just wants to point out that Eagle Contributing Writers are part of The Eagle staff who have written a handful of articles; content submitted by members of the AU community to the Opinion page is not written by ""contributing writers;"" it's written by people who submit content and, thus, do not have the title ""contributing writer.""]
•Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy. I know everyone wants to get a word in, but people want to read something different on their rants. :\
•Dear Editor, thanks for censoring my rant (but really), I wanted to take back what I said after I sent it in!
[Editor's note: Anytime!]
•END OF THE YEAR SEXUAL TENSION. Glad to see I'm not alone in this one.
•I'm sorry I disturbed your mom last night on the quiet floor *raises eyebrows up and down repeatedly*
•LADY MARGARET! LADY MARGARET! A kindly bridge-troll let us in... SILENCE BRIDGE TROLL!
•HI PEGGY!!!
•Why do you even come here Papaya? No body likes you.
•Cucumbers have wicked souls...
•And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?
•To everyone who responded to my postings of T.S. Eliot; thank you as your kind words really touched me (no joke). I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.
•No gorganzola on my turkey cranberry salad from the Tavern?!! Oh HELL NO!! THIS WILL NOT STAND.
•Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours.  Is this right? Just wondering?
•WHY are the einsteins employees so slow!??!!? Seriously someone needs to give them a lesson on assembly lines. I'm not hating on the dining staff, I'm simply asking for faster service.
•If I could choose to be a lesbian, I would at this point. I've had too many bad experiences with guys lately.
•What is a Pitt bomb threat? Can someone please explain this?
-confused alum
[Editor's note: This editor thinks they mean the recent string of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh.]
•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.
-a true feminist who care about true issues that are negatively affecting females
•@”@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?” Dang, being editor is complicated.  But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology. Like where you could click a rant and reply to it anonymously and then the person who originally submitted the rant could look at all the anonymous replies and reply to them. Awesomesauce
•morning rants are da bomb
•@”I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.
•It's always nice to pay for a class where the teacher doesn't teach.  Particularly an elementary mathematical modeling class where you have to find your own practice problems on the internet.
•@”What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to. Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married” This is a very logical feminist position. If only the Women’s Initiative were actually this logical.
•P.S. Please pass me elementary mathematical modeling teacher, even though you can't teach...
•Editor: About how many rants are submitted each day that break the rules and are not posted? jw
[Editor's note: Usually only a few. Depends on the day though. This editor can tell its finals season because Rants are getting angry!]
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling.  You make math tutors angry.
•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...
•If you're a guy, Take Back the Night is about realizing how many people you know are survivors and how oblivious you were.
•Loving whoever it was that posted La Cage aux Folles lyrics.
When the world spins too fast
And your bubble has burst
Someone puts himself last
So that you can come first
•Love who ever posted Billy Joel lyrics!!

•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..
•to the ranter who started with ""If you were my girlfriend"" ILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. I'm not actually desperate and I don't really want a relationship you seem like a genuinely nice guy, sometimes hard to find here
•To the lady who just called out a room of girls being too loud: rock on.
•@@where do Au students go to party? : ""Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm ""glad"" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•""@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The controversy has forced our nation into intense self-examination: of its gun policies, of race relations, of police practices. What else has this tragedy exposed? And what can we learn from it?

Perpetuating hate and injustice

Stand your ground

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

2012-11-09,AU,liberal,"• Good things come to those who wait.
• Tell your boyfriend who wants a sexually open relationship to go f*** himself.  If he loves you, and if the two of you want to start a family together, then he needs to be in a place where he can support you unconditionally.  End of story.  It sounds like he's more concerned with himself than he is with you, and that's a sign that you should kick him to the curb.  I promise that you can find a better guy out there who would love you more than he does.
• As a guy, I can tell you that there are A LOT of us who would never dream of cheating, or even want an open relationship if our partners were okay with it.  Your boyfriend sounds like a major douche, and that's not something I would normally say to someone.
• @netflix you tool: clearly you can't read. My original rant was asking for an alternative to Netflix. The person who responded recommended imdb. Then i thanked him. Try and keep up.
• @Tried to ask a girl out last night and couldn’t work up the courage….urghh maybe I’m not ready :( What is the first letter of her name? 
• ADBLOCK SUGGESTER, I LOVE YOU 
• To EVERYONE complaining about CAUS. I get why your mad but yo there where flyers everywhere. And don't act like you were sleeping. It happened so get over it
• There's a chance we could make it now; we'll be rocking til the sun goes down
• @""I can't wait to meet you""- me either ;)
• Girl desperate for her bf to propose: what he is doing is extremely manipulative, and it sounds like you're in a relationship that's hurting you more than it's helping you. As hard as this sounds, you need to break it off. There IS someone out there who will treat you better and want monogamy. You deserve so, so much better. Good luck!
• ""Turn out the light Don't try to save me Well you may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right""
• meh meh meh meh meh
• You ask the most annoying/interesting questions in class everyday. I can't make up my mind whether I hate you or not. 
• There is no such thing as bad publicity.  Way to go CAUS.
• To the cute guy with curly hair sitting in TDR with your friends on the cereal side...you're cute :)
• Liking to be dominated is not super kinky.  It's more like french vanilla.
• Wow @ all the people complaining about the CAUS making noise. I was in the library at the time and it was really not all that disturbing and 11:15 isn't exactly the dead of night. I didn't take part in this thing since I didn't know about it, but it's so lame that the rich kids here would rather pay thousands of dollars more in tuition than make some effort to fight this if it means making some noise (or disturbing poor Kerwin's sleep, as if his tuition hikes aren't going to screw us all over in our personal lives way more).
• The hot tub's too hot.
• @RE:@super bummed: I am talking about you, E.J. with two E's! When do you want meet? How's Monday ~11:45 at the dav? I'll be inside!
• Anyone saying the CAUS protest was too disruptive has clearly never heard of protesting. 
• To the people that complain about eagle rants...if you don't like them, don't read them.
• I'd love to know what ""student body"" the CAUS claims to represent when they do nothing but bash every single student who disagrees with them. Their facebook page includes comments like ""f student government"" (Newsflash: it's the group that's ACTUALLY elected to represent. Y'all just decided you're representative) and diatribes basically bashing every STUDENT group that doesn't worship at their unwashed feet. Get over yourselves and stop embarrassing this campus. 
• @""bf of 4 years said he would propose and we can get married if I agree to a sexually open marriage."" Woah woah woah. No, men don't always cheat, he's just got no self-control. He's probably cheated on you already, get out of there.
• Yes. I really miss talking to her, that’s all!: Yeah, I'm trying. It's weird when they've moved on, but you haven't. It'll come though, in time. We got this :)
• @ ""I actually really hope family values are destroyed.  Families are dumb.""  Congratulations, I think you pretty much just summarized the DNC platform.  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools. 
• @ ""When I read Liberals R Tools’ posts, I imagine a tiny little man frothing at the mouth and rolling on the ground spewing nonsense.""  That's funny - when I read liberals' posts, I imagine a dirty hippie with an attitude and a sense of entitlement.  Oh wait...that's reality.  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools.
• Can we start talking again? I know you don't want to be anything more, you have your girl. Please, I miss you in my life and your hilarious personality. Answer my texts, even if they're late at night, just answer them in the morning or whenever. I miss being the friends we were like two weeks ago. I'll take the friendzone over this zone of nothingness.  
• sorry I'm not screwing up my life, but just because you are doesn't make you better than I am.
• Learned something today small talk=friend zoned, flirting=relationship (possibly)
• Today I learned it's not just guys that participate in No-Shave-November....didn't think I needed to know that
• @""grindr suicide"":  Yeah, but maybe the people you blocked won't notice, or you can block them again, change your picture/headline so they don't notice, etc. Is the cutie worth it? ;)
• @""grindr's sketchy as anything."" I completely understand everything you've said and I really really appreciate it. It's definitely sketchy, but I don't use it for random/weird hookups cause that's not my thing.  But anyway, it's nice to know there are other quality gay guys out there. Maybe we'll meet someday, and if not, I hope at least you find one of the great guys in our ""boat.""  Thanks again. -Gay Ranter
• @more organic student-set-up-dating service: I agree! forget the student government and hall councils, you're right! my bad :P
• @open relationship proposal: what. the. actual. f*ck. He's not being ""honest,"" he's being stupid.  I don't care what you learned in whatever class, but ""it still hurts"" for a reason.  I'm a guy, and if I'm going to propose to someone, I'm going into it with the intent of "" 'till death do us part.""  Not "" 'till I eventually cheat.""  I know people do open marriages, but you don't sound too fond of it. There are PLENTY of guys out there who will want to marry you and be with you-and only you.
• I love my roommate, really, but she's such a hypocrite and completely intolerant. I respect her outrageous religious views she forces on everyone and I don't say a word when she constantly tries to up one everyone, but tonight when I was watching the Youtube video on Obama tearing up whilst thanking his staff, she storms in and goes ""He's a lying thief"". Im sorry, what? I never said a word to you! We just had a lovely evening. I've never been that blunt about things about her I don't like, but maybe I'll start to be
• does know who i is? does you listen to music? do you watch tv? DO YOU CARRY A LUNCHBOX?!
• Craig Ferguson is hilarious
• We need white voters; not just blacks and hispanics.  Saying its not a white election is racist and it only furers the discrimination that divides our nation. 
• don't stand so close to me
• Call me old-fashioned, but for me the purpose of marriage is for two people (regardless of gender identity) to proclaim to each other and their loved ones that they deeply love each other and they want to only be each other for the rest of their lives. The fact that he's saying ""most men cheat anyways"" tells me that a) he has no self control and b) he will end up cheating on you. 
• And I bet you any money that if you took advantage of the openness of this marriage, he would have a problem (no matter what he says now). You have to leave this guy. If after 4 years he still doesn't want to commit to you and only you, chances are he's not going to anytime soon. 
• Brace yourselves, the CAUS reply rants are coming...
• Yeah, Obama authorized drone strikes which killed civilians and children. It's a tragedy. But Romney would have done the same thing, and he would have taken our country back 50 years. So that's why we're celebrating. Should we be mourning the fact that some third party candidate who statistically had no chance of winning didn't win?
• Ward is full of gorgeous ladies right now. YAY
• Wooohooo a bunch more just came in. 
• wait, this must be a trap... ALL MEN GET OUT OF WARD IMMEDIATELY
• ""I should just buy the United States"" - Mitt Romney
• Eagle rants needs a trigger warning. Editors, consider that or perhaps limiting the obscenely offensive comments. (I mean, whatever happened with the whole hate speech? That isn't protected under any law, FYI)
• CAUS deserves all the hate it gets here on Eagle Rants. They are simply dogmatic, obnoxious, whiners who don't understand the mechanics of the real world. Every CAUS member I've talked to has never had to truly work for themselves and is more disrespectful of personal rights than anyone else I know.
• I think I'm getting sick for the third time this semester :(
• I really like this girl on my floor.  We went to lunch and I had a great time.  I really hope it works out this time.
• DO NOT MARRY HIM. He probably is already cheating and that's why wants an open relationship. You are young. You deserve someone who won't make you hurt. Kick his sorry a*s to the curb. 
• glad you're taking the hint and being more of a Lship biddie than a bear. 
• lol, CAUS has become the most hated entity on AU since Alex Knepper.
• You keep saying exploited... I do not think that word means what you think it means.
• Hey Everyone! I know what we should do! Since none of us have anything better to do and our lives are so meaningless that the only way for us to find joy is in *itching about EVERYTHING, irregardless of its relevance in our own lives, lets all act like a bunch of petulant children and bang on pots and pans in the middle of the night... oh wait, we already did that.  
• I sometimes, check that, ALWAYS wish I had never met you. You communist kids without a caus (haha see what I did there) are always looking for something to champion. It really is too bad that you don't see how most of the problems you want to ""fix,"" you created in the first place. 
• When I talk to you, I like to think that Darwin would be disappointed. 
• I wish I was your second derivative so I could investigate your concavities. 
• Wanna expand my polynomial? 
• All that Communism needs to make it successful is someone to feed and clothe it.
• @Open marriage girl.  Yes you are wrong to agree to that.  Statistically the younger you get married, the more likely you are to get divorced.  Wait until you find someone who's ready to commit to YOU.
• Most people who read ""The Communist Manifesto"" probably have no idea that it was written by a couple of young men who had never worked a day in their lives, and who nevertheless spoke boldly in the name of ""the workers"". ~Thomas Sowell
-Sound like anyone else we know? (cough, cough, CAUS, cough)
• Can someone explain why someone yelled ""sell your house"" at Neil Kerwin in that Caus video? Really? Sell your house? What good would that do? Herp de derp, we want tuition to go down, herp de derp, sell your house! Just no.
• There are 5 people in my contemporary Africa class paying attention right now. I have no idea what the point of his lecture is as usual. WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
• @Iwould’vewhistled  Cut the patriarchy and check your privilege.
• @Sexism Erm, no.  That's called prejudice.  You can't be sexist against men because, definitionally, 'sexism' and 'racism', and all other 'isms' imply a societal stance against a particular group.  You can be PREJUDICED against men, but then there's not much you can do about it, as a woman.  Ergo THE DIFFERENCE.
• @Ican'tstopcutting  Talk to somebody.  Do you want me to give you my doctor's name?
• @""Let's go to all the CAUS members' doors in the middle of the night and yell and scream at that. See how that feels."" Uh pretty sure they're not the ones making me go even further into debt next year and the year after to keep going to AU. Anyway I think the whole point is that it doesn't feel so good to be waken up by banging pots
• i hate having a roommate. it was fun for a while, but i just want to be ALONE. sheesh.
• @""so. sexually. frustrated"": Me too :) Let's meet up and fix that, okay?
• If you're cutting yourself - make friends.
• And if you hit the table then the record might skip might skip.
I told.
Stop hittin the table.
• @OpenMarriageGirl
If you don't like the idea of it, that's never going to change. Don't marry this guy.
• That awkward moment when you realize that Mitt Romney is Christian Grey. 
• @ berskshire blondie: if I'm thinking of the same dude, don't let his gf scare you off. Dudes always down for a sidepiece
• lol @ the video of Kerwin admitting he's only accountable to the corporate execs that make up the board of trustees. not that it's any surprise, but still

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums. And yes. He's accountable to a Board of Trustees. It's how the real world works, and it's designed to benefit you to the fullest. Get. Over. It. 
• The CAUS is annoying, skews facts to fit their worldview, underlines the obvious and managed to disturb every single person on campus tonight. I rarely side with the establishment, but seriously, come on. If you wanted to have a stake in your tuition, it make sense to go to a public university.

• ""How do you get your friends to stop coming and staying in your room every single evening/night without being rude?

How can you so enthusiastically celebrate this man's reelection? According to multiple reports you can find from The New York Times, Washington Post, etc, he personally signs off on every drone strike. This is horrific and a clear abuse of human rights on par with the Bush years. Where is the outrage?
• ""Sometimes I just want a friend. I'm lonely. But then I remember that I don't like anyone (including myself)."" I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'd definitely recommend joining a student club or group of interest to you. If you're religious, look into joining a church, temple, synagogue, etc (or if atheist/agnostic/humanist there are many secular groups). Hang in there ;)
• @""SO many people read eagle rants everyday."" True. I have no idea if you meant to be writing to me hahaha, but I hope you're doing okay. If you are who I think you are: I miss you so much come back into my life!
• @""i just wish you’d talk to me again"": I feel the same way :)
• @""Im too sexually frustated ... this sucks its like drinking is the only way to hook up with girls :("" - I'm sorry you're frustrated with that. I'm in the same boat as you are, man. Trust me, from my experience, hooking up while drunk is a BAD idea. If you want to meet a girl who you'll really like, who will be great for you, the time is not when you're both drinking and dealing with baggage and sadness from the past.
• @""My heart hurts."": I'm sorry for your pain. Mine does too :( Why does yours hurt? Hope you're doing okay!

• CAUS is destorying the opportunity to reason with the administration of American University. What are you willing to give up for a tuition freeze, CAUS? That isn't free. This is a tuition based institution. How did you go from 5% tuition increases to a tuition freeze? What happened to the 5% we can compromise on? Your extremism does not display your dedication to the cause; it displays your dedication to the CAUS. There is an important difference between the two.

He said all guys eventually cheat and at least this way he is honest with me from the start and never hides things. I know from my evolutionary psychology class that men are not programmed to be monogamous creatures. Cognitively I understand. But it still hurts. Although I think it will hurt less than not having him in my life. Am I wrong to agree to the open marriage?

Do other students have the right to quiet in the middle of the night? Nope. Do businesses like Bon Appetit have the right to fire employees who break their established rules? Nope. Does Kerwin have the right to a private life? Nope. I literally hate them and their entitled attitudes. Please leave AU. We all hate you.

By selling his house, AU would be saving millions of dollars that could go to other, more important services.

• Sports at AU kind of suck. THERE I SAID IT!
P.S.
Play the sport because you enjoy it, not to get recognition.
• Can you meet me in front of SIS at 11:45 Monday night? Thanks cutie ;) 
• We know each other, and we exchange pleasantries when we see each other. I REALLY like your friend. I want you to hook us up. Be a real bro and make this gay relationship happen.
• Dear lamb...good things come to those who wait indeed. Keep being awesome...and stop reading eagle rants and get back to work!
• Thank you, veterans. 
• @Ya naaaaasssssssty. | Was this a Simon and Martina reference? 'Cause if so, you rock. 
• have the house to myself so chill!
• @""hopefully I didn’t make it awkward last night. I know you have a boyfriend, but you’re cute and I’m cute, so we should get together soon."" You should probably give more clues as to who this is meant for...
• To all the vets out there, while I may not always agree that war is the answer, I have nothing but utmost respect for you. We civilians may not always show it, but I for one thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service. I am now and forever will be indebted to you. 
• @""America's spear"": Why do people think it's cool to glorify violence? America shouldn't be spearing people with wars and killing innocent civilians, thus creating more enemies for America, not to mention pain, death, and destruction for other citizens of the world. How about we try helping each other by eradicating disease and poverty.
• I keep having dreams that I give birth to a baby and then abandon her.  What does this mean? I would never adandom my future baby. I love babies and can't wait to have them. What's with the creepy dreams? :(
• I keep fantasizing about my boyfriend's best friend. I wouldn't never cheat on my boyfriend. But sometimes I wish the best friend would just rape me. Am I messed up in the head for wanting that? 
• relationships are so hard. but when it's worth it, you fight hard to love the other person in the way they deserve. it's exhausting, but it's beautiful, and each season of pain eventually passes. this is why i don't understand open marriage girl. you deserve someone who WANTS to love you in the way you need. that's the person you should spend your life with.
• does anyone else stay up studying until they hear a break in their roommate's snoring? because good lord this child snores loud. ain't no way i can go to sleep while she's foghorning! 
• Someone made a queer of the quad tumblr... The ofthequad urls need to stop
• Clarification. Your tuition dollars go to his SALARY, with which he can do whatever he pleases. Honestly, CAUS is literally comprised of the stupidest people I know. 
• Because this got censored: if you want tuition to stop raising, stop expecting nice things like more green initiatives, new buildings, better salary for faculty/staff, better professors, more club support, dorm renovations. If you want the experience at AU to keep improving, tuition has to get raised. Stop being selfish and only thinking about yourselves- think about the rest of the community and the students to come. Hate to break it to you, CAUS, but money doesn't grow on trees, and your antics aren't helping our endowment...
• I have no idea what this person next to me at the library is doing. They are rubbing their pen vigorously on a cinder block. Are they trying to sharpen it? I don't understand
• okay good they stopped. that was really annoying
• @""SCREW YOU UBUNTU"" come to SFC meetings, we'll help you work on it. We need members anyway.
• Obama raises taxes, plays lip service to gay rights, talks a good show, arrests protestors outside of his door, does nothing, has a MILF wife.  Has a noble prize. 
Kerwin rasies tuition, plays lip service to gay rights, talks a good show, arrests protestors outside of his door, does nothing, has a GILF wife. Does not have a noble prize.
We just need to nominate Kerwin for a Noble Prize and he could be president. 
• @lunch date/first letter: B
• to the person ranting about spanish speakers at au: porque son puros hijos de mami y papi...except the u.s. latino kids
• We don't have Veteran's Day off, wtaf is this?
• To all the veterans here at AU, thank you for all you have done defending our country. I know many of you have made sacrifices none of us here back at home could handle and yet you keep on going on. You are a constant source of inspiration, so thank you again.
• Dear Curly-Haired Freshman Boy Who Modeled in the AKA Fashion Show, you are beautiful.
• Apparently, Darth Vader is the editor of Eagle Rants. ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!""
• @""everyone responding to Liberals R. Tools: DFT—Don’t Feed the Troll.""  B*tch please.  You liberals cant help but get yourselves in a tiff over supposed ""injustices"" and non-issues.  That is the liberal nature - and why you manage to destroy everything good about the country.  
• @""Liberals R. Tools” You are an ignorant child.  But I forgive you.  You know not what you do.""  Nice try, schmuck.  You idiots have backrupted the country and turned the USA into upper-Mexico.  Don't even try to take the moral highground here, you pretentious tool.
• Wait I'm too lazy to go back and find out who E.J. and M are.  Are people from here actually gonna get together?! GOOD LUCK IF YOU TWO FOLLOW THROUGH! :)
• JUST KIDDING. I was too curious. To Texas boy: if you meet her, I'll give you the biggest bro hug ever. that's awesome.  To cutie White House girl: OMG HE FOUND YOU!! have fun you two :P
• The 20 or so core members of the CAUS are the same people involved in the new campaign to get better pay for the TDR workers and more benefits.  Welcome to the real world kiddos.  If you don't want tuition increases you can't demand additional costs that don't matter to most students.
• @ Niel Kerwin selling his house: Soooo..... are you implying that Kerwin's house costs millions of dollars in maintenance every year? That place must be HUGE!
• @ Brace yourselves, the CAUS reply rants are coming…
HAHAHAHA! I literally lol'd. I overheard them conspiring to write reply rants earlier which made this even funnier
• Dear Freshman Senator: Please realize that people don't care about your facebook statuses involving every single aspect of the undergrad senate... in fact, we think you're a worse person for even being part of that West Wing-wannabe place where dignity/friends/social standing goes to die... 
• Dear ""lonely lady"": don't say you're not attractive. Every girl is beautiful in her own way! I'd love to meet up with you!
• @""Hey you. I know you rant almost every day so I know you will read this"": I miss you too. Let's talk soon. I want you back in my life!
• I just want to know the first letter in the girl's name who you almost asked out; because it may be my friend, and if so, she likes you too!
• ""Yeah I'm trying. It's weird when they've moved on but you haven't."": I feel the same way hahaha! Hang in there, there's someone amazing waiting for both of us! :)
• ""Can we start talking again?"": I've got no idea if this is meant for me, but if it is, yes! I've really missed you!
• @""I agree! Forget the student government and hall councils, you're right!"": Let's seriously get on this!
• “Yeah Obama authorized drone strikes which killed civilians and children. Its a tragedy."": actually it's more than simply tragic. This President who prematurely received the Nobel Peace Prize has repeatedly violated Pakistani sovereignty and international law. Also, as to Romney taking us back 50 years: if moving ""Forward"" means killing hundreds of innocent men, women and children in the name of national security, please send me back to the 50s or 60s!!
• @""I agree! Forget the student government and hall councils, you're right!"": Let's seriously get on this!
• @""I just want to be with someone"": Me too! SERIOUSLY AU singles speed dating needs to happen. I refuse to believe that I can't meet a wonderful, brilliant and beautiful girl here!
• SO. MUCH. SEXUAL. TENSION. @cute girl in Colonial Latin America
• I see dead people. Seriously for real. So many dead people.
• I'm so done with caring about you. I hope you die screaming.

• @""Gay guy who claims vaginal odour is why he’s gay: Uhm, dude, as if ass smells any better? SMH. . ."" I mean I was kidding, and yeah ass doesn't smell much better. Two of the lesser evils I guess.
• AU Compliments, AU Crush and AU Confession make AU students look pathetic and insecure. GET OFF ANON AND GO TALK TO PEOPLE. 
• It's like all the dirty hipsters at this school want you to hate them. GO TAKE A SHOWER AND CUT OFF YOUR PONYTAIL.
• Editor, can we put emails here for people to send messages to instead of rants back and forth among a million people?  I'm thinking you might think that people would submit other peoples’ emails, but what if there was a way to verify that it was a person submitting their own? Like you or someone else sent an email asking to check it was intentional.  That would reduce the amount of random responses from “original” posters and vague messages.  That or I’m gonna make a Facebook page or something.  This AU speed dating has to happen.
[Editor’s Note: I recommend making a Facebook page]
• I rant, therefore I am.
• Guys of eagle rants: every guy just randomly puts his hands in his pants when you're just chillin, right? Especially in a comfy chair and especially in comfy clothes.  Whoops, I was studying in the study lounge and realized I had my hands down my pants just chilling like nbd.  I had gone in to rearrange my junk but forgot to withdraw.  Whatevs no one saw...I don't think.
• @awkward library sex: not to be a creep, but like....where and how does this happen?! Ever since ""The Prince and Me,"" I've always been curious
• @""What were people complaining about on the quad today?"" I heard mention of The Big Bang Theory and I wholeheartedly support their mission to have it cancelled.
• @""1. HIPSTERS DO NOT LISTEN TO KE$HA SO YOU ARE NOT A HIPSTER""
Methinks the lady doth protest too much.
• @I literally feel completely and utterly alone: that literally sounded as though I wrote it. Try talking to your friends maybe? I talked to mine and I think we might be getting back to normal, but I can't tell. Good luck. <3
• I wonder how many people arrange to meet up with each other over Eagle Rants, then get to their meeting place and don't have the balls to find each other
• I want to stay at AU for grd school but I know going to the same school for undergrad and grad is frowned upon. What other schools would be most similar to AU?
• I think they should bring back puppies on the quad for finals week... Someone get on this!!
• @""Looking back at welcome Week"": That's good to hear! Her first initial is ""L"", by the way.
• If you're in David Johnson's Digital Skills class and are meh on it, please drop out because I want to take it desperately!
• @ I noticed that too.. It's not a huge deal, but it makes it seem like black people don't want to be friends with anyone else. It's not like they can only find things in common with other black people, our characteristics aren't defined by the color of our skin. everyone should be friends with everyone.
• I'm in Kogod and we are definitely not Ravenclaw. I've actually heard Accounting Majors say ""I'm bad at math."" LIKE WHAT. We are definitely slytherin. Like I said before, most of us are all corporate tools.
• @""My best “friends” go off and do things without even a thought about me"" Story of my freaking life. What I started doing was doing things by myself, it may seem lonely, but I've actually met some cool people that I may not have met before.
• @ people telling me I'm not a hipster: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahahah. Only at AU would people get pissed about someone calling themselves a hipster. 
• To girl in my fractals class who sits in the front row everyday. I really want to get breakfast and study with you but I am not sure how to ask.
• I don't think people realize that the library is literally the worst place to study at. MGC after 10:30 is dead silent.
• Why do people waste money on drugs? Seriously $12 on adderall? I'd rather eat at subway twice.
• @Want to meet at the Dav on Wednesday, say around 2:00pm? How will I know its you?
• Boys in sweaters are so sexy. 
• I love hearing loud opera music from the guy at the table next to me... can you play your music a little louder? It's REALLY helping everyone study
• I'm not a slut...but my philosophy to sex is YOLO so f*** it 
• Based on the rants, isn't it obvious that the problem isn't that there aren't any willing/interested people on campus? The problem is this: you're all too scared to say anything to anyone, and about half of you have set your standards high enough that no one will ever measure up so that you won't have to worry about rejection. There you have it.
• plot twist: not everything is about you
• Kogod is not Ravenclaw. Basically everyone I've met in Kogod is straight up dumb.
• You know you've gone too long without watching Rent when every Christmas song that references Bethlehem makes you want to sing ""La Vie Boheme""...
• i hate some of the rants i've posted here. i regret a lot of them and wish i could get rid of them (editor: any way to do that if i know the dates/rants?)
• Dammit, I miss you and I'd do anything to hear your voice right now. Except contact you...  
• You are really bad at texting. You led me on. I didn't/don't have expectations. This ship is about to sail away, contact me or I'll move on.
• @YOU ARE ALL WRONG. Okay here’s the breakdown: SOC is Hufflepuff, SIS is Gryffindor, KOGOD is Ravenclaw, CAS is Slytherin. And everyone else is a squib. WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG: CAS is Hufflepuff, SIS is Gryffindor, SOC is Ravenclaw and KOGOD is the disgusting Slytherin. 
• All I want for Christmas is for Jason Segel to bone me
• I ate too much chocolate and now I have diarrhea
• If a person cries and no one is around to hear it...that's sad.
• Jim DeMint started the recession. 
• Is it weird that I find my precalc professor cute and wonder if I'm his type?
• I'm going to miss this class! You guys made thursday nights do-able. 
• To the guy who sat in on Dissident Media wearing a giant fake mustache and cowboy hat: WHO ARE YOU. I NEED TO KNOW.
• Enough of this Harry Potter BS. SPA is House Stark, SIS is House Lannister, KOGOD is just a bunch of Littlefingers, SOC is House Greyjoy, CAS is House Targayrean, Public Safety is the Night's Watch, ROTC are the Unsullied and CAUS are the White Walkers. 
• Liberals R Tools. I know you disapprove of homosexuality, but I'd go gay for you and make you my sex puppet. You are awesome!
• Hollywood wants to make a Jumanji remake. You're F'ing with my generations childhood. Don't step into the wrong hood. 
• That fear when you are on a porn site that you will accidentally click the facebook share button. THE HORROR!
• One last goodbye to the cute boy I'm crushing on. Can't believe you are studying abroad. You seriously make my heart melt. Just wanted to wish you safe travels.
• Zero hour, 9 A.M. But I'm gonna be high, as a kite by then.
• So props on whoever put Christmas lights in the tree behind Kay. I'm guessing it was the Methodists.
• Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends, up there on the sanctuary moon, are walking into a trap, as is your Rebel fleet. It was *I* who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. 
• Chill guy with the purple beanie working in the library basement lab thing...I see you, I see you. ;) too bad you just said you have a gf

2012-12-09,AU,liberal,"• Tonight at the graduate reception in mgc, there was a beautiful, sexy man in a blue suit with a light blue shirt underneath his dark blue blazer. Dark hair, dark eyes, Latino. HE WAS THE SEXIEST MAN I HAVE EVER SEEN AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. Why has it taken this long? I stalked him the whole night. He was beautiful. QUIERES CASARTE CONMIGO!?!? por favor.
• @""Only at AU would people get pissed about someone calling themselves a hipster.""
I just wanted to make a joke about Creed. 
• @""Guys of eagle rants: every guy just randomly puts his hands in his pants when you’re just chillin, right?""
Yes, I too, masturbate in public. Would you like to join me for some public masturbation? I will be in the Dav at 1:00 masturbating to crappy prog-punk rock and Christmas songs. And if any of the Dav staff are reading this, I publicly masturbate best to Hall and Oates.
• @ I mean I was kidding, and yeah ass doesn't smell much better. Two of the lesser evils I guess.
What?! What!? No.....No, no, no, no, no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no. What?! Two of the lesser evils? Who says that? What!? Nooooooooooooooooooooo. And it's ""the lesser of two evils."" What!? No. Hell, no. F' no.

• HEY GIRL, I AM EMOTIONALLY STABLE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MAN. I HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU SO LET ME DESTROY YOU WITH MY LOVE HANDLES. YOU MAKE MY ARTERIES CLOG WITH AFFECTION. I MIGHT DIE OF A HEART ATTA
• There is some serious sexual tension going on here.  Why must we work together?  Why must it be super inappropriate if we were to hook up?
• I feel guilty for being jealous of my roommate's prettiness but I can't help it. I wish I wasn't so insecure.
• @Game of Thrones references for schools
You just made my desk shift
• @""SOC is House Greyjoy.""  Ha.  Implying SOC kids actually have a backbone.  No way they're the badass vikings from A Feast for Crows.  
• The CAUS is either House Arryn (led by a whining, epileptic child) or House Stark (overly idealistic and self-defeating).  
Kogod is House Lannister.  They're calculating and they seem like they'll get ahead, but things have changed in the global order and they might not be as well off as they think.
CSA is House Martell.  You forget they exist, but they'll be the truly successful ones.
Eagle ranters are all Ser Jorah.  Pining, sad, and alone.
• I don't want to like you! Maybe you're just being overly nice, but you have a girlfriend! I don't know...  I don't want to fall for you, I can't! Why do I always fall for the guy I can't have?... I don't need this, I have too much craziness in my life, which no one could ever understand...
• I'm not sorry I like AUSG. Without them, so much at AU wouldn't happen. Sometimes even the senate does great work. :0
• What is ""ANON""? And What is AU crush? 
• CAS is Ravenclaw 
SIS is Gryffindor 
SOC is Hufflepuff
SPA is Slytherin
Kogod are the Goblins
• My LDR bf and I got into a huge fight. Hes been ignoring me all week. How long is a reasonable time for a guy to be mad? I did yell at him a lot. But I think I've been punished enough. Should I let him sulk and ignore me for yet another week? I don't want to seem needy. Help!?
• @How will I know its you? Trust me, you'll be able to tell. I'll be dressed WAY too formally 
• You're the kindest, most gorgeous girl I think I've ever seen, but you're out of my league and I know I have competition.  Whatever, I'm good to throw down.
• SOC IS SO NOT RAVENCLAW ARE YOU KIDDING ME. 
• The semesters almost over and the guy I wanted to hookup with wont answer me. All I want for Christmas is a hookup buddy

2013-01-01,AU,liberal,"• I loved being home until tonight, Christmas Eve. I fought with my mom over the stupidest thing and now she barely wants anything to do with me. I had a moment of weakness and cut myself for the first time in months. Happy holidays to me.
• Doctor Who is ruining my life. I can't stop watching it because it's brilliant, but I'm in the post-season two depression stage.
• @""WHY IS EVERY HARDCORE LIBERTARIAN I MEET SO PERSONALLY IMMORAL?"" - That's interesting, the few I've met here are to me more likeable than many of my fellow liberals. (Shoutout to the libertarians from Letts 3N last year)
• @A woman on Reddit 
I'm a gay lady on reddit too! I'm sensing a trend...
• i love you, dont kill yourself please 
• Speaking as a guy, I would never be unfaithful to a girl and I would never willingly help a girl cheat on her boyfriend either. If I found out that crap was going on, I'd lose all interest in you immediately. You can dump your boyfriend if you want to (sounds like he deserves it), but you should be honest with people about your relationship status.
• Person with the brother, you sound like a good person. Hope everything gets better for you two. :/ 
• Pot smoking hedonists? This makes me want to be a libertarian even more!
• Yeah... my brother relapsed a day later.  Sucks.  I had hope after the emergency room since he seemed so much happier, but I guess he just doesn't want to be sober right now.  The hardest thing about it is that I know he's suffering and every instinct I has says that I need to help him, but there's literally nothing I can do if he doesn't want to be sober.
• What does everyone think about putting a Cosi where the McDonalds used to be?
• Dear fellow ranters: I would like to just say that I love AU and am really glad that I have the opportunity to go here! To all those who are having a tough time this holiday: please hang in there! The season is tough but the pain you're going through now will make spring so much sweeter. PLEASE do not hurt yourselves–even if you think you're alone, you're not (you have your fellow ranters, at least)! Things will get better <3
• Thanks, Editor, for still putting rants up during the holidays. Props! 
• The only person to wish me Merry Christmas was the automatic text from Words With Friends.
• TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KILL THEMSELVES/OD: DON'T. Someone out there cares. I care. Please, please. Talk to someone you trust. It will get better, I swear to you, I've been in a similar place, you just need to know that it will get better, and take active steps to help yourself. Go to the counseling centre. Please. 
• I have so much anxiety that I can't get through more than a few pages of the new book I just got on conquering anxiety. Oh irony..
• I flew home for Christmas even though I didn't want to and I could have stayed with my bf instead. But I went home because my dad wanted me to. I get home for Christmas and none of my siblings even came over to see me. FML
• Reddit is a magical land of internet awesomeness, full of hilarious, witty people (and yes-just like everything in life-occasional downers and trolls). It's got a ""front page"" where the most popular stuff culminates, and then a ton of ""subreddits"" to fit what you enjoy, ex) ""Awww"" for cute things, or ""WTF"" for crazy weird stuff, news, pics, videos, politics, etc..go check it out.
• whoever responded with the ""come"" pun in response to the film porn club....seeing as I was going to use that same response, I tip my hat to you good sir, you clever bastard.
• @”Home for the holidays (in the boondocks) and the nearest guy on grindr is 56 years old and 7 miles away…”  Although I’m not in the boonies, I’m back home to a grindr of mostly uneducated, poser @$$hole guidos, so there’s that. I feel your pain.
• I want to feel your heart beat inside of me
• “I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break. Trying to hold on but the gnawing pain in my heart won’t go away. Help?”  No one should ever feel scared in his or her own body.  You control so much of your life, you really do have the power to change things.  Please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if it gets really serious.  Or, talk to anyone-a parent, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker…it’ll surprise you how many people really truly care for you.
• Whoever you are with the detoxing brother-you're an awesome person and an even better brother.  Friends come and go--sure you could have been partying somewhere like those kids across the street--but family lasts forever.  Props to you for helping your brother through a difficult time. 
• I totally fell in love with the girl who cut my hair today.  And then I forgot to tip her.
• I think I'll start talking to girls.  What is the point of being completely awesome and hilarious and really really really ridiculously good looking if I don't talk to anyone?
• I feel bad for the basketball players...they only got four days off from this whole  entire break. I plan on going to the first home game when we come back from break. who's with me? :) 
• @I really want to ask the cute dance team girl from across the hall out to coffee on Nov. 5 you probably should ;) hahaha yes, I am that bored that I went  all the way back to November rants...
• What does it mean if i enjoyed high school way more than I enjoy college right now?
• Drunk snapchat is the best snapchat. 
• When did you become such a shallow, self-centered, groupie? It's like I don't even know you anymore. When we met I admired how you didn't care what people thought of you. Now all you seem to care about is feeling popular and ""in"" with your friend group, since you never had that in high school. Why don't you think about the choices you're making before you keep going down this road. You can stop anytime, you just have to want to live a moral life. You used to think that personal integrity and values matter. What happened to you?
• Russian women are finnneee!
• Surgeries suck :'(
• If you are suicidal, seek help from a therapist. Preferably one that does Cognitive Behavioral therapy (because that's the best kind of therapy), but any therapist will do. Whatever problems you have are fixable, you just need some support. When you're back at AU, visit the counciling center.
• Whoever posted ""And by “sex” I mean me putting my arm around you and you squirming away because you just wanna stay friends"" Dude I legitimately lol'd. 
I've come to realize that although it's not always obvious, but there are some pretty f'ing funny people at this school. Wit. I like it.  Can the funny people be more outgoing? We'd all benefit.
• Unfortunately, short guys finish last.
• that awkward moment when you realize that everyone in your new town knows what you have been doing at college and not one of them is your friend on FB...
• I'm scared to come back to AU after abroad. It just seems so terrible now.
• I don't even want to go back to school because I have to spend hours in a room with my whole sorority and some of them are awful people.
• @""I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break."" Please, please, PLEASE don't do it. Find professional help and figure out why you're feeling like this (or if you know why, figure out why it's driven you to this point).
• And this Monday/Tuesday will mark the 22nd year I haven't had a New Years Kiss. Or a kiss at all.
• Last night I had a dream that someone raped one of my friends and stalked her afterwards.  The legal system couldn't stop him, so I killed him to give her peace.  I was sentenced to prison, and inside I killed another inmate because he was plotting to harm a guard.  Once I was released I felt like there was evil in the world that I had a duty to stop, but I came to the conclusion that I was really just a serial killer justifying my murderous needs with that mentality.  So I killed myself.  How f***ed is that?
• So on Christmas Eve, I was mugged. Well, mugged might be kind of inaccurate. It wasn't violent, but a person ran up to me and grabbed my bag and ran away. My phone, camera, money and key were in there. There's nothing to be done but I can't stop dwelling on it. It's not my fault but, I can't help blaming myself. Like, I could have been more careful or something. I've never felt so powerless. It's sh*tty.

• @How terrible is it for me to just pretend I’m single on okcupid?-- Your boyfriend is an ass and clearly doesn't care about you enough or he wouldn't want it to be open. It's not fair for him to be able to have other partners but he expects you not to- that's a classic double standard. You can find a much better guy, trust me. I know of some people who prefer open relationships, but they (in my opinion) tend to be selfish and really just self-interested people primarily concerned with their own gratification.

1) something happened to you which makes it hard for you to let loose around people without alcohol in you?
2) low confidence from any number of sources, including possible emotional or psychological trauma?

2015-09-10,AU,liberal,"Stephen Colbert. Photo by kpop im, Flickr.
My grandparents were big fans of Jay Leno. They liked his traditional monologue, his tried-and-true street bits. They think Jimmy Fallon is for “the youth.” Going by those standards, Conan O’Brien is for “the strange.” Jon Stewart was for “the liberal.” David Letterman was for ""the cynical."" But who is Stephen Colbert for? 
This is the question Colbert strove to answer in the premiere episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which premiered Sept. 8. Much has been made of Colbert leaving his crazed conservative pundit character behind in favor of a more authentic persona. In his first episode on network television, Colbert pushed the envelope just enough to show viewers that he hasn’t lost his satirical bite along the way. 
Some parts of the episode were unabashedly a part of the talk-show trope, especially during Colbert’s interview with George Clooney. There were attempts at deeper conversation, with questions surrounding Clooney’s humanitarian work in Darfur and his much-publicized marriage to lawyer Amal Clooney, as well as a short sequence of videos playing on a fake action film starring Clooney, hilariously named “Decision Strike.” But the segment was mostly fluff, interrupted at one point by the audience’s chants of “Stephen!” I could feel the pure excitement through the screen, threatening to take over the proceedings at any given moment. 
Other segments were more successful because they alluded to Colbert’s previous brand of political satire. An early bit comparing the media’s obsession with Donald Trump to an addiction to Oreos played well with the crowd, who, like myself, had been thirsting to see Colbert’s response to the bombastic Trump. In his interview with Jeb Bush, Colbert was unwilling to let the presidential candidate get away with typical political answers. Colbert threw him some softballs to start, but then compared the Bush brothers’ relationship to the dynamic between himself and his brother Jay, who sat solemnly in the audience. 
“I love my brother, even though we politically differ,” Colbert said during the show. 
Why couldn’t Jeb do the same with George? Jeb tried to slink out of the question, but Colbert waited for a substantive response, unafraid of scaring off other presidential candidates from appearing on the show. I was immediately drawn to Colbert’s commitment to getting something new from his guests, especially when that guest could become America’s next president. 
It was equally as fascinating to witness the moments when the political caricature bled into the host’s real personality, and his willingness to play off of the public’s knowledge of that character. When Jeb commented on the amount of portraits of the host in the newly renovated Ed Sullivan Theater, Colbert aptly responded, “I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit, now I’m just a narcissist.”
I could see the disappointment in the premiere on social media, mostly from dedicated fans who were struggling with the loss of a persona they looked to for the news every weeknight. Sure, this show doesn’t have the same mission that “Colbert Report” fans know and love. It won’t feel as righteous, nor will it claim to be. But it will be authentic Colbert: absurd, conscientious and sincere. The most beautiful and successful parts of the premiere--the introductory “Star-Spangled Banner” number, the startlingly fresh interview with Bush, the flurry of musical joy in Jon Batiste and Stay Human’s rendition of Sly and the Family Stone’s “Everyday People""-- were the most earnest, a quality that late-night television is desperately lacking. Perhaps that’s who Colbert’s newest endeavor is targeted at--not “the youth” or “the liberal,” but rather, “the earnest.”

2016-01-12,AU,liberal,"Caylee Watson prepares for a loosen-up swim after competing at the Patriot Invitational in November 2015. Watson is one of seven AU swimmers who have competed in the Olympics.
Twenty-three flags line the walls of Frailey Pool, each one symbolizing a country that has been represented by a student-athlete on the AU swim team. When Caylee Watson joined the team two years ago, swimming head coach Mark Davin added a new flag to represent her home -- the U.S. Virgin Islands. Just last month, Watson, now a junior in the School of Public Affairs, earned an honor much bigger than a flag: a spot on the U.S. Virgin Islands Olympic team.
Competing for AU in early December, Watson touched the wall after her 100-meter backstroke race in 1:05.21 at the Navy Long Course Invitational, hitting a season best time and topping a 17-year-old school record in the process. Her time and previous performances at World Championship events, such as the 2015 Summer World Championships in Russia, earned Watson enough FINA points to receive a call from the president of the Swimming Federation in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Watson said she texted the president of the federation after finishing her 100 backstroke swim, and he responded that the committee would meet to discuss the Olympic team the following day. That night, Dec. 12, Watson’s phone rang with the good news. She had made the Olympic roster. 
The opportunity to compete at the Olympics represents the culmination of a journey Watson began as a 12-year-old swimmer in the Virgin Islands with a 100-yard freestyle race and ultimately brought her to American University six years later. 
Life as an Eagle
Headlights cut through the dark sky as Watson and her roommates drove to practice for another 6:15 a.m. workout. Top 40 pop music filled the car while suspense and anticipation hung in the air in between the swimmers; all three athletes quietly prepared themselves for the grueling three-hour session ahead of them. Seven days had passed since the start of the January winter training, and Watson's arms ached with soreness as she departed the vehicle and readied her body for the cold pool. The collegiate swim season at AU lasts six months with a focus on the conference championships in February, but Watson keeps her mind focused on Rio. 
Pushing through the exquisite pain of a lactate threshold set, Watson took another stroke. Seven thousand yards later, she popped out of the pool, threw on shorts and a T-shirt and headed to the gym to lift. Twenty hours a week during the school year, the ‘eat, sleep, swim, class’ schedule fills Watson’s days, and she’s found success balancing her swimming commitments in the pool with her academic and extracurricular responsibilities. 
In her previous two Patriot League Championship appearances, Watson earned Top-10 finishes in multiple events, and last season broke a school record in the women’s 400-yard freestyle relay with teammates senior Paris Wood, junior Julianna Cavano and sophomore Shannon Exley. Named the team’s MVP in 2014 and 2015, Watson scored 13 points at her most recent  Patriot League Championship meet in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. and finished her fall semester with a 4.00 GPA. Her performance in and out of the pool helped her earn distinction on the Academic All-Patriot League Team, and she credits her accomplishments at AU and her Olympic qualification to Davin. 
“Mark Davin has been my best coach, and he’s got lots of wisdom and experience, and he pushes me which is good,” Watson said. “Coming to American has made all the difference. I remember freshman year, I was very nervous about coming in here and swimming in general. I was just like, ‘just hold out one year, that’s all you need, just give it a try,’ and it turned out well.” 
Davin, who coached 1996 Olympian Casey Leger for the Atlanta summer games, said the credit belongs to his athlete. 
“I do think that it’s less me, truthfully, and more her,” Davin said. “Whatever we do, she embraces all of it. She’s kind of like a sponge that’s soaking up everything. I think if you just tell Caylee, ‘this is going to help you,’ she’s all about it, always. And it’s fun to be part of it. I think she likes to be with people that are having a lot of fun and working really hard and racing really well and being good teammates and doing well academically and having a full happy life.” 
“I wanted to go to Wesleyan” 
When Davin first received an email from Watson about training at AU, he almost denied her a roster spot. One year later, the head coach changed his mind. 
“I sent him an email, and he was like ‘no, you’re too slow,’ Watson said. “And then I sent him another email another year that I was coming, and he was like, ‘welcome to the team.’”
Even before Davin’s initial hesitation, however, Watson admitted AU was not her top choice. She said she never visited the school or toured the campus prior to her enrollment but remained interested solely because of the swim team and the opportunity to study political science in the District. 
“I didn’t even want to come here, honestly,” she said. “I wanted to go to Wesleyan.”
Watson said that Wesleyan, a small school in Connecticut, appealed to her because of its size and liberal arts curriculum. After conversations with her family, however, Watson ultimately packed her bags for D.C., but not before competing on the world stage yet again. Just weeks before moving into Letts Hall to start her freshman year at AU, Watson represented the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 2013 FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. She returned to Spain last winter to compete in the Ciudad de San Sebastian meet with former teammate and 2015 School of Communication alumnus Charlie Taffet. According to Davin, Watson’s international experience helps her approach races with a different mindset than other athletes. 
“She had some world-class experience before she came here. She’d gone to some international meets and that kind of thing, and I think that as an athlete, I do believe it gives you a different outlook on what you’re doing, having had those experiences,” Davin said. “One of the reasons I set up the meet in Spain is I think the people that have made that trip, it’s changed them. Sometimes they go, and it’s just so overwhelming and so new. The second time they go, they really get it. They really start thinking about the Olympians that are there, how they’re racing, and they’re looking for more than, ‘how do I function?” 
Watson said the thought of competing in arguably the most prestigious swimming event in the world keeps her motivated through long practices, and her hard work continues to pay off. 
“I’ve definitely been more on the backstroke side this year, and I’ve been focusing a lot on rotation and making sure I’m connected even on harder sets,” Watson said. “I know I’ve been a lot more confident going into sets this year...so that’s gone well. I’ve definitely been able to do sets that I was not able to even think about doing in the past.” 
Every day at Frailey Pool, the U.S. Virgin Islands flag waves in the wind, reminding Watson where she comes from. Imagining herself competing at the Olympics in the uniform of her home country gives her added motivation at every practice. But for the next two years, Watson will also sport the red, white and blue of AU as she continues to represent the school that helped her to earn a trip to Rio.

2016-02-12,AU,liberal,"Ward 5 D.C. Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (center) has proposed a bill addressing the city's special police officers (Cuneyt Dil/The Eagle).

	Neighborhood leaders are blasting a D.C. Council bill that would give college police departments in the District the authority to patrol outside campus bounds.

	Last Wednesday, the Spring Valley/Palisades Advisory Neighborhood Commission passed a resolution 6-1 opposing the bill.

	Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie introduced the Special Police Officer Enhanced Security Amendment Act of 2015 back in December 2015. Among other provisions, the bill mandates special police officers in the city undergo additional mental health and behavioral training.

	More controversially, however, a section attached at the end of the legislation allows college police departments to submit a “public safety plan” for approval. Under such a plan, which would need approval from the D.C. police chief, campus police could exercise their authority to enforce a college code of conduct in specifically defined off-campus areas.

	The bill was co-introduced by seven councilmembers, including Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh, giving it enough theoretical support to pass the full 13-member council if it comes before a vote. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) has said that he will hold a hearing on the bill, which is assigned to his Judiciary Committee.

	“We think there’s a number of areas that are overly broad, that are ambiguous, that give us cause for concern with how those provisions are going to be applied,” Commissioner Stephen Gardner said at the ANC meeting. “Students who live off-campus are concerned that having campus police in their neighborhoods will lead to inherent conflicts between student disciplinary rules and D.C. laws”

	D.C.’s liberal marijuana laws could create that kind of conflict. In the District it is legal for a person over 21 to use marijuana on private property. But possession and use of pot violates American University policy, and the bill would extend the ability of campus police to enforce University rules off-campus.

	AU’s external community relations director, Andrew Huff, was present at Wednesday’s neighborhood commission meeting andsaid that the bill is far from what the University wanted.

	“The legislation in its current form is not the intent [of American University],” Huff said at the meeting. “American University and the presidents of other universities have no interest in expanded police power or jurisdiction.”

	If the bill became law, Gardner said he is worried about a possible increase in armed campus police.

	“We think this legislation provides an impetus for campus police officers who do not carry firearms to start carrying firearms,” Gardner said. The prospect of armed campus police officers alarmed Gardner because college police officers do not have to undergo the same kind of training as Metropolitan Police Department officers.

	“There’s a huge discrepancy between the required training of an MPD officer and a campus police officer,"" Gardner said.

	Conrad DeWitte was the sole commissioner who opposed the ANC’s resolution against the bill.

	“I understand where the universities are coming from in terms of trying to put together as best they can whatever tools they can to help combat noise in the neighborhood,” DeWitte said.

	Other neighboring ANCs that are located near universities in the city have been concerned as well. The Foggy Bottom/West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which represents George Washington University, held a special meeting last Wednesday.

	“This legislation is atrocious. It defies any kind of functional government,” Palisades/Spring Valley ANC Chair Thomas Smith said, adding the D.C. Council failed to consult with the ANCs before introducing the legislation.

	“Just for the record, we invited Councilman McDuffie or his staff person to come to our ANC meeting last month to talk about this legislation, and we never heard back,” Smith said.

2016-03-12,AU,liberal,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a crowd of AU students, staff and international media in the School of International Service Atrium on Friday morning that young people need to challenge the status quo if they hope to see change in the world.
“[Current leaders] need you to be thinking and challenging us about why we’re doing this, why we’re doing that, why we’re not doing this, how we’re doing this differently, and that doesn’t just mean speaking up,” Trudeau said. “It also means getting involved. It also means understanding that your voices are an essential part of the mix to challenge us to think about your future.”
Trudeau’s stop at AU came as part of a larger trip to Washington D.C., the first by a Canadian Prime Minister in 19 years. Earlier during his visit, Trudeau spent time with President Barack Obama at the White House, attended a State Dinner studded with appearances by politicians, celebrities and entrepreneurs and paid respects at Arlington National Cemetery.
Since his election in October 2015, Trudeau has committed his time in office to implementing his liberal ideals in Canadian policy. Trudeau became the first Prime Minister to have gender parity in his Cabinet when he chose 13 men and 13 women to fill the roles. He is also well-known for labeling himself as a feminist and supporting his stance on the issue by saying, “Because it’s 2015,” last year.
“There are lots of extraordinary women standing up for women’s rights, but I need more men to do that. It’s fighting for rights, it’s fighting for equality, it’s fighting for basic respect, and I keep having to update this, but it’s 2016 guys,” Trudeau said at today’s event.
Additionally, Trudeau discussed his commitment to take action against climate change which he also shared with Obama during their meeting yesterday.
“That idea of giving up on economic progress to protect the environment no longer makes sense because the only way we’re going to build a strong, sustainable economy is by cherishing ecosystem services and natural resources that underpin everything else,” Trudeau said.
In light of the current election cycle occurring in the United States, Trudeau said he was not concerned about an influx of Americans immigrating to Canada should people disagree with the United States’s next president and said that he would be willing to work with the person ultimately elected. He also commented on Canada’s recent decision to end its role in bombing ISIS, choosing instead to send in ground troops to help civilians build the ability to support themselves. Trudeau said that this type of diplomacy work is essential to creating long-term security and is something Canada can offer.
During his speech, Trudeau also called for a greater appreciation for diversity and creating opportunities for all kinds of people to succeed as important to developing the economy. He said that in the past, many people’s careers had a linear trajectory, but that isn’t the case today.
“Right now the career paths that we’re going to have will jump around everywhere. I mean, it’s preposterous to think that a former snowboard instructor and nightclub bouncer could end up the Prime Minister of Canada,” Trudeau said, poking fun at his own path to becoming the Prime Minister. “But the experiences we accumulate along the way of multiple career paths and multiple engagements that define us and shape us as individuals and leaders are extremely important and extremely varied and that’s one of the really exciting things for me about this generation.”
Trudeau said that he built his campaign to office based on a pure idealization of what Canadian citizens hoped their government to be, including openness and cooperation, and he plans to keep his promises and maintain Canada’s relationship with the United States.
“People need to understand that the rights and freedoms that keep us free and democratic societies aren’t always easy, aren’t always sort of knee-jerk, adapted to how we’d like the world to be, but they are essential in terms of being the countries we are,” Trudeau said.

2016-04-11,AU,liberal,"More often than not, self-sufficiency is the type of independence to be admired. When it comes to helping other countries gain this same type of independence, the U.S. plays the role of the suffocating parent—and the same goes for aid in Afghanistan. 
For example, a 2012 survey of women across Afghanistan by the charity ActionAid discovered that nine out of ten feared the departure of the international community because they felt their lives would significantly deteriorate. Since departure, violence against women has never been higher, with  87 percent of women reporting domestic abuse. And of the 5.8 million people without access to healthcare in Afghanistan, 4.4 million are women. Although international aid has helped shift the public eye to supporting these Afghani women in their communities, an emerging pattern says Afghan women need international aid in order to gain rights in their own country. 
The revolution of women in Afghanistan is a fight for their own rights, something a foreign man in a soldier’s uniform can’t manufacture. Women like Zainab, the first woman to ever run a marathon in her country at only 25-years-old, are inspiring women and children all over Afghanistan to be brave in what they love. When training, Zainab spoke about her experiences running outdoors where children would throw stones.
“Prostitutes, why don’t you stay at home? You are destroying Islam,” people would shout at her and her friend.
Most of the time, Zainab had to practice her 26-mile trek running circles around her own backyard. Attempts to play sports for women in Afghanistan, especially those in public, is hard. In the past, Zainab enrolled in a girls' taekwondo club, but shortly after police shut it down. When Zainab ran the marathon in Bamiyan, a more liberal and safer area of Afghanistan.  
“Bamiyan is a good place for this. In other places, they would be killed,” the region's governor, Zahir Tahir, said.
Recently, a mob beat a 27-year-old woman to death after arguing with a mullah, a man trained in religious law. Following this woman’s murder, for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, raising the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves; openly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets.
Through it all, women in Afghanistan are people seeking their right to run outdoors, have opinions and wear what they want. The only difference is they live in a country that a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll ranked in 2011 as one of the most dangerous places for women to live. But these women, through their own efforts and bravery, are seeking ways to have a voice. 
The Afghan Rug Project, an organization founded by James Opie in 2008, is a social enterprise that sells rugs weaved by women in Afghanistan in America or Europe. Its mission is to use rug weaving as an avenue to foster independence for Afghan women. The organization is built on the concept of exchange, expanding the business reach for these women without forcing them to rely on handouts from the Taliban, hard labor in the fields, or charity. 
With around 300 women already weaving, the Afghan Rug Project began not to solve complex political or military problems, but to address important needs of village-dwelling families harassed by members of the Taliban who roam the countryside. With organizations like this, women in Afghanistan can support themselves and their families self-sufficiently—a stepping stone for future independence.

2016-04-13,AU,liberal,"Syrian dissident and activist Ahed Al Hendi spoke to AU students about raising awareness for the Syrian refugee crisis and his work to help refugees during an event hosted by the Kennedy Political Union on April 11. 
In his opening remarks, Al Hendi, who founded the pro-democracy organization Syrian Youth for Justice and spoke on behalf of the Help Syria Now group, made clear the difference in the freedom of speech between Syria and the United States.  
“If we were in Syria, we would all be arrested,” Al Hendi said. “Because over there, it is illegal to listen to different ideas.”
Al Hendi was a student activist in Syria living under President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and participated in a series of protests for greater freedom of expression. He said that many liberal students were arrested and banned from the country for speaking out and that many of the protests were violently squashed. 
Al Hendi said he was arrested in 2007 for allegedly logging into certain websites that were forbidden by the Syrian state. He was held for 40 days as a political prisoner and escaped to the U.S. after he was released. Since then, Al Hendi has worked to connect with both Syrian refugees and civilians still living under the Assad regime. Some of this work involved sending cameras and providing internet access to Syrians in order to record the government crimes against civilians, according to Al Hendi. 
The Syrian Civil War that arose after the Arab Spring in 2011 has resulted in the arrest and killing of  thousands of students in colleges and universities across Syria for chanting for freedom, according to Al Hendi.
“Atrocities in Syria are the most heinous crimes of the century,” Al Hendi said. 
Al Hendi also said that the recent attacks on cities around the world by ISIS and other extremist groups have given rise to extremist right-wing groups in both Europe and the U.S., with both kinds of terrorist groups presenting dangers to Syrian refugees seeking safety. Negative portrayals of Syrians are also amplified by social media, and have resulted in a greater need to empower moderate voices in Syria to speak out, Al Hendi said.
In an interview with the Eagle, Al Hendi also spoke about the U.S. presidential race and comments made by Republican candidates on immigration and the treatment of Muslims. Al Hendi said that he remains optimistic about the policies that will result from the election.
“I think that the majority of Americans are welcoming [towards refugees],” Al Hendi said. “And I don’t think the Constitution will allow [the president to ban Muslims from entering the country or refuse to accept refugees].”
Al Hendi urged students who are interested in the Syrian crisis to go to syriastory.org to sign a petition and learn more about the issue.
“As a student, I believe in the power of students,” Al Hendi said. “I believe we can bring a lot of change.”

2017-10-12,AU,liberal,"“Fine messes”, “just wars”, “reliable rumors,” and American political “science.” I get a kick out of fun oxymorons. Okay, that last one isn’t so fun. It’s just painfully true. Let me explain.
Last week I stumbled upon a Ted Talk from a psychologist named Jonathan Haidt. Haidt is a New York native, a professor at NYU, and self-proclaimed liberal. He has a son and a wife, both of whom share his progressive world view. He is not a bipartisan man. Yet, in his talk, “The moral roots of liberals and conservatives,” Haidt says this: “...If we are going to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our lack of moral diversity is going to make it harder.” 
Haidt may be a Liberal, but he’s also a psychologist. He understands what it means to live in an echo chamber, and how dangerous it is to do so. Haidt’s point ends up being this: Liberals’ roles are to tear down faulty institutions and conservatives’ roles are to keep the ones that work. It’s an intricate balancing act -- Haidt even compares it to the yin and yang of Daoist mythology. 
American politics is in such a rut because too many liberals and conservatives hate each other’s guts. Now more than ever, our country is divided. Donald Trump’s election has resulted in not just a proposal for a border wall, but a real wall -- a partition between helpful conservative beliefs and helpful liberal beliefs. It’s so bad that in some parts of the country, “liberal” or “conservative” have become dirty words. They shouldn’t be. We need both. 
Just like Haidt, I’m firmly in the liberal camp. Both my parents are liberal, my father even radically so. But that doesn’t mean I should hate the other side. If the liberal’s role is to tear down the faulty institutions, then I should reserve my hate for the parts of “the other side” that need a wrecking ball and maybe even some dynamite for good measure. Apply the change not liberally (pun intended), but discriminately so.  
For example, the free market is an institution worth keeping.  Even Bernie Sanders, the patron saint of college socialists, would never propose something as radical as completely dismantling the free market. Despite its flaws, while plenty, there’s no denying the sheer efficiency of mostly unrestricted trade. The free market is the one of the most criticized aspects of America mainly because it is most successful. 
What are the institutions worth dismantling? In my opinion, there are many. The idea of traditional marriage is a good example. In 2015, the voice of the left, and even much of the right, agreed that to keep gay marriage illegal was to stay on the wrong side of history. So, it was changed. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the idea of gun control has once again sprung to the forefront of conversation. If it is popular enough, then it too shall change -- a triumph for liberalism. 
It may seem like there are exponentially more ideas worth changing than keeping. Indeed, it’s true. But this shouldn’t be misconstrued as a failure on conservatism’s part. Ideas become outdated or stop working. In the case of gay marriage, the idea was always wrong. Consequently, it’s easy to blame conservatism for everything wrong with America. After all, aren’t conservatives the ones supporting these archaic ideas? True, but they are not unique in doing so. Every established idea has had at some point popular support. Conservatives supported it, and liberals too.  
Yes, the ratio is skewed. And yes, the bad ideas often outnumber the good. But that’s not a terrible thing. That’s progress.

2018-08-10,AU,liberal,"Maria Butina, a recent master’s degree recipient from American University’s School of International Service, was arrested by the FBI on July 15. She was charged with conspiracy and acting as an unauthorized Russian agent. While she undoubtedly tried to boost her stature among her fellow students in the “my internship is cooler than yours” banter, she was still an AU wonk through and through, right? Not exactly. 
Court documents state that “although she attended classes and completed coursework with outside help, attending American University was Butina’s cover while she continued to work on behalf of the Russian Official.” The documents later affirm that, “the FBI believes that (Butina) was likely in contact with the FSB throughout her stay in the United States.” Not only did Butina use our own School of International Service as a cover for her real position as a Russian operative collaborating with their Federal Security Service, but she used one of the top international relations schools in the world to obtain her visa in August 2016. 
American University students reacted in many ways. Most students found humor in the arrest, shown in the increasingly popular “#FreeMariaButina” movement, based on the all too familiar phrase, “Wonks Support Wonks” or cultural comparisons, such as to Jennifer Lawrence in the 2018 spy thriller, Red Sparrow. 
However, for as enjoyable as the parodies have been, other students, including myself, realized that there is more to the mysterious case of Maria Butina. The news about Russia was brought, through Butina, to where we live, work and study. International news became local news. It may have even startled some to realize that they likely crossed paths with an active Russian agent. But, the unfortunate reality remains: she was sent by a government that has little regard for human rights, democracy or stability. If nothing else, Maria Butina conjured up a conversation about just that.
I am pleased to say that a few other students and I are restarting an organization on campus this fall to have these exact conversations. The Alexander Hamilton Society is a non-partisan, not-for-profit national organization with over 60 chapters focused on foreign policy and national security issues. At AU, the Alexander Hamilton Society will bring some of the leading national security professionals to debate a few of our own professors, discuss national security issues with the AU community and develop the chapter’s members into future leaders. 
But for Hamiltonians, the name given to members, not much is surprising about Maria Butina’s political influence and intelligence activities; here’s why: she is an agent of a hostile foreign power that has defied some of the most basic international norms. Russia, within the last decade, has invaded a neighboring country, shot down a commercial airliner with a surface-to-air missile,  is responsible for chemical attacks in Syria, and more recently, sent agents to execute poison attacks in the United Kingdom. Regrettably, however, many more nations and non-state actors are cut from the same cloth. The barbarity of these nations and organizations is indisputable and widespread, but the real difficulty is in calculating a response. These are the conversations that the Alexander Hamilton Society will have.
In these conversations, Hamiltonians hold a few strong beliefs, such as the notion that the United States should be a global leader that provides an example of a representative government that protects its citizens’ liberties. Hamiltonians also believe that the United States should deter the malign intentions of illiberal foreign actors, not only for our immediate national interests, but also for the benefit of humankind. 
But should the United States lead in this way? I think we should, but whatever you believe is worth a thoughtful discussion.

2021-01-02,AU,liberal,"In honor of “No Nuance November,” I posed a question on my Instagram story to my followers, asking them about their unpopular opinions. The answers I received were interesting, to say the least, and different from what’s “socially acceptable.” They ranged from believing that working class Donald Trump voters are going to be an important part of the progressive movement, to thinking that golfing should be banned. 
A person would usually respond to these ideas with, “Wow! I never saw this issue from that perspective,” which for most of us translates to, “Wow! The media usually shows a one-sided point of view that makes people share a single idea and you’ve challenged the status quo.” This is called the false consensus effect, which is the idea where we think that our own opinions, attitudes and beliefs are common, so we believe that others may feel the exact same way. When we hold a certain belief, we tend to estimate that belief to be more ubiquitous than it actually is.
With the frequent sharing of opinions and information on social media, one can be easily blindsided by the thoughts of other users or even their own friends. Limiting our sources of knowledge to those with similar views makes us subconsciously believe that we hold the “model belief” and that the opposing side is completely undesirable because they don’t “get it” and aren’t as morally superior and intelligent as we are. Subconscious actions like these prevent us from having productive, nuanced conversations and are overall counterproductive if we strive to be understood ourselves. How can we attain collective liberation if we aren’t able to converse within the communities that we reside in?
This shouldn’t be interpreted as going out to meet with a full-blown racist and discuss politics over coffee. Rather, we must prepare ourselves to enter into every issue with a possibility that we might be incorrect and that our ego bubbles should be popped. Self-aggrandizing behaviors were most apparent during the presidential election, where many white liberals coerced members of the Black community to vote for a specific candidate that made them comfortable in their own racism. It’s impossible to consider yourself an “ally” for BIPOC communities only to turn around and belittle those who don’t agree with your performative activism. 
On the other hand, the act of trying to engage in discourse with an individual that ends up making no progress is unproductive. With this uprising of online activism, white people are still asking Black people to teach them how to understand white privilege and racism. The problem with this? The information, statistics, documentaries and numerous studies had already exposed these issues in its raw form. Black individuals having to operate under this repressive system for centuries makes the act of white people asking how they can care now borderline offensive.
After reading the book, “Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race” by Reni Eddo-Lodge, I wholeheartedly agree with the opinions presented. This doesn’t apply to all white individuals, but to the number of them who refuse to accept the existence of structural racism and how they’re actively upholding it. I see an emotional disconnect that a white person displays when I explain my experiences as a Black woman. This stems from being oblivious to the fact that their skin color is the default and anything darker is “other.” 
Many Black individuals tread carefully when sharing their experiences, because once we show any signs of frustration or exasperation, people will tap into their preconceived racist notions about “aggressive” Black people who are supposedly a threat to them. Even if they claim to “hear us,” they’re not really listening. 
Nonconformists, during this social media age of “hot takes,” often have to undergo self-censorship to avoid the reprisals of challenging the beliefs of others. It isn’t fair to live with a never-questioned entitlement and to expand your superiority complex - it perpetuates a cycle of intellectual stagnancy. 
The next time that you repost information on your social media concerning current events, I challenge you to ask yourself why you’re doing so. Does it provide information of a perspective that you haven’t previously shared? Or does it conform to your preconceived ideas that you share within your circle of friends?

2021-06-10,AU,liberal,"This article is an opinion piece and does not necessarily reflect those of The Eagle and its staff.
While education is inherently necessary for its practical utility, what is the true impact of higher education? Should American University and other higher-educational institutions relegate the exploration of knowledge simply to career development, or is there a deeper and necessary aspect to education that seeks to cultivate curiosity, creativity, skepticism and, above all, critical thinking in the individual? 
These values make up the foundation upon which many medieval European universities were first established, influenced by economic circumstances, as well as the schools of classical antiquity in Athens and Rome from which the term ‘classical studies’ originates. These institutions sought to discover truth for the sake of truth and pursue knowledge because of the value of knowing. In Plato’s Apology, Socrates states that “the life which is unexamined is not worth living,” indicating that the pursuit of knowledge in its own right is invariably interlinked with the pursuit of humanity. This legacy of humanistic inquiry through art, literature, language, history and philosophy constitutes the essence of modern classical studies, which seeks to cultivate critical thinking and dialogue as a form of educational empowerment.
However, in contemporary times, many American universities have decided to stray from the humanistic roots of education. As of this year, Howard University, the only historically Black college or university (HBCU) in America with a department in classical studies, decided to end its program, despite its existence since the school’s inception. Citing educational prioritization and university resources, Howard University joins the fray of countless other American colleges and universities who have divested liberal arts and humanities programs over the course of the last several decades. Institutions such as the University of Vermont, University of Kansas, Elmira College, Guilford College and many others have systematically gutted programs in liberal arts and classics education with the veneer of “prioritization,” stifling formerly successful and worthwhile academic programs. The introduction of Howard University to the list of schools disinterested in cultivating humanistic inquiry creates a disturbing image for the future of higher education in America. 
So why are the classics worth saving? Are we not simply expelling dispensary knowledge from the university system in order to pursue an education that will be practical for young people in the workforce? Furthermore, aren’t programs such as the ‘classics’ fundamentally alienating for non-Western students and considered too esoteric to be egalitarian? 
To claim that the classics are not worth saving is to deny that learning is valuable in and of itself. Certainly knowledge is needed to produce money, to create entertainment, to erect roads and bridges, to govern,and to continue the basic functions of modern society. But what is the purpose of learning how to live if we do not also explore how we ought to live? Practical knowledge and humanistic knowledge are key components of one another if we are to create a generation of truly well rounded people. The conquest of the entire enterprise of higher education into practical application can only have detrimental effects on the future development of society. 
Beyond the fact that education in the humanities is key to understanding individual human purpose, the criticisms of classical learning as a perpetuation of the Western crimes of racialization and elitism are entirely unfounded. In fact, the opposite has consistently occurred historically — countless movements and leaders of social justice were inspired by the classical literary canon. Particularly for African American freedom movements in the United States, classical thought inspired leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Huey Newton and W.E.B. Du Bois. This is because the Western canon, more than anything, is a cultural and historical conversation about humanity- one that becomes enriched with the contributions of each new generation, culture,and civilization that interacts with it. 
The modern humanities combine the stories of Homer and the knowledge of Plato with the literature of Mary Shelly and the soaring revelations of Martin Luther King Jr. The study of modern humanities is therefore inclusive, rather than exclusive, expansive rather than narrow, and a fertile field for tolerance and social change. Remember that our founding fathers themselves were steeped in the classical tradition, reaching back to ancient Rome and Greece, as they led the American colonies to shake off the shackles of monarchical tyranny. 
The classics are an inherent and foundational component in the study of the humanities. And the intercultural dialogue that this study creates fosters in us an individual responsibility toward one another and a desire to learn for learning’s sake. I can think of nothing more liberating or egalitarian than the pursuit of knowledge for the purpose of human development. Classics studies as well as great books programs, such as the Lincoln Scholars program at American University, allow the individual to learn for the sake of learning in addition to gaining the practical education one needs in order to succeed in later careers. Moral and intellectual development, furthermore, are crucial components of education that bring the individual closer to the answer of what it means to be human, lifting them above what W.E.B. Du Bois described as the “veil” of oppression and out of what Socrates characterized as the “cave” of ignorance. And so, in the pursuit of true learning, I ask AU and all other institutions of higher education throughout the country to preserve this human community influenced by the classics.

2021-10-12,AU,liberal,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
This year’s display of sticky note messages on the inside of residence hall windows lacked the pizazz students had come to expect from their peers.
The messages, made out of hundreds of individual sticky notes, reflected a steep decline from previous years in terms of quantity, variety, and creativity, according to students familiar with the situation.
“During the Democratic primaries in 2020, everyone would spell out which candidate they were supporting,” junior Linda Estrada said. “Now it’s like a heart here, a smiley face there. How are we supposed to keep up our reputation as one of the most liberal colleges in the country with those sort of amateur tactics?”
Only 30 percent of this year’s sticky note designs have anything to do with electoral politics, according to an Eagle tally — an all-time low for the University. 
Another point of contention among students concerned is the perception that fewer students care about decorating their windows this year. 
“I remember in my freshman year someone organized the whole fifth floor of Letts to spell out a sentence going down the line of windows,” senior Delia Mathis said. “Now the freshmen claim they have more important things to do like studying for class. Give me a break!”
Students are not the only ones impacted by this trend.
“I’m really miffed that students aren’t taking their window decorations seriously,” said Celia Bennett, director of undergraduate admissions. “A robust sticky note display on the residence hall windows can help us entice prospective parents. It shows them that AU kids don’t have enough time to drink and carouse if they’re designing, planning and arranging intricate sticky note designs on their windows.” 
Students reported a conspiracy theory circulating, which implicates disgruntled George Washington University students in the demise of AU’s creative sticky note messages on windows. The connection between GWU students and the lack of creativity of AU students remains to be seen.

2022-01-06,AU,liberal,"About Sex Work AU is a new campus organization bringing awareness to students about the sex worker community in the D.C. area. 
The organization began as a group project in Adjunct Instructor Aimee Richardson’s HLTH-323 Issues in Women’s Health class. 
“We look at health and we take health for granted,” Richardson said. “Being in the AU community, we live in this bubble. Our expectation is that health is eating right and exercising and for some people, it's really just getting general care.”
In the class, students create community-based learning projects centered around women’s health. Students indicate their topic of interest, and Richardson assigned them groups from there. 
“It’s not just about learning, it’s about giving back and working with communities that need assistance,” Richadson said. 
These projects, which have been a part of the class for several years, are more than just learning about women’s health, they’re about reaching into the community, Richardson said.
“I think it’s something that's really important and something that the AU community should be interested in,” Richardson said. “Especially living in the District of Columbia where sex work is a big part of the city.”
Matilde Eckford, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences, was interested in studying the health of sex workers. But soon, the class project turned into a club. 
The About Sex Work AU club is active on its Instagram page, where they post educational infographics, including the history of the sex work industry. Additionally, the club has been tabling inside the Mary Graydon Center to reach students. 
“It’s really just showing people that [sex work] is very normal. This is a real profession,” Eckford said. 
The main goal of the organization is to destigmatize sex work through education. On their Instagram, they’ve done this by posting information on where they post educational infographics, including the history of the sex work industry.
The organization used Instagram to properly define terms within the sex work industry. For example, the club defines sex workers as individuals who accept payment in return for sexual services as well as other commonly used terms like commercial sex, clients and third parties. 
“When you learn about specific terminology, and the ways in which those terms impact sex workers, and what terms are preferred, it helps break down stigmas,” Eckford said. “Then also you can use language that is not nearly as offensive and is better for education.”
According to About Sex Work AU, stigmas are the biggest barriers to the decriminalization of sex work. For example, sex workers living with HIV are faced with negative stereotypes. On its Instagram, the club also shares statistics about sexual violence and sex workers — sex workers have an increased chance of experiencing sexual violence while working and sex workers of color, migrant sex workers and transgender sex workers are at an even higher risk. Looking into the future, the group plans to break down these stigmas with students on campus. 
“It’s one of those things where I know a lot of people have a relatively liberal attitude towards sex work, but I think not too many people know more than OnlyFans or the real issues that a lot of sex workers face,” Eckford said. 
The group plans to become an official club this semester, with hopes to reach into the D.C. community by partnering with other organizations.

2022-09-07,AU,liberal,"THE EAGLE
Last Monday, a recent Eagle article reported that after 486 days at the bargaining table followed by a week-long strike organized by the American University Staff Union, an agreement between the union and the University. 
An email sent by Provost Peter Starr set the tone for the events that unraveled during the strike, emphasizing that the University negotiated in “good faith” and expressed several times in the email their disappointment in the union’s choice to strike. With the University having an email platform that’s able to reach thousands of families, it has an unfair advantage over the union, misconstruing their message into making the AU community think the strike is reactionary and unproductive. 
What started as a smooth sailing strike soon turned into an overwhelming situation for all parties involved, including student workers such as orientation leaders and RAs. Due to the amount of staff protesting, the University had placed responsibility on student workers to conduct crowd control of the strike and help move families into the dorms in the hot weather. Many joining in on the strike may have been unaware that part-time student workers are unable to unionize, leaving student workers vulnerable to harassment and calling these workers “scabs.” The University placing workers in difficult situations like these portrays them as if they’re against the goals of the union and as union-busters. 
For many families, seeing AU staff members stand outside the freshmen dorms, demanding that their employer pay them a wage that can fund their next meal, is their first impression of the University. Unaware of the entire situation between the union and the University and being kept up-to-date mainly through President Sylvia Burwell’s emails, parents directed their anger toward the union for “ruining” their child’s first-year experience. Many staff members who were part of the strike had mentioned that they didn’t wish to be on strike and did so as a last resort. Striking within a private sector has consequences for both the employer and the employee — the employer will economically suffer and the employee stops receiving paychecks, making striking less common among unions. 
In response, the AU Staff Union had addressed during the strike and on social media that they always emphasize “students first” and had fellow faculty members take each other’s shift at their jobs when one was out protesting. Staff never forced students to join the strike and allowed them to make their own judgments and rather hope to educate them on the issues they’re fighting for.
AU administration leading the staff union strike directly impacts the bonds formed between students and staff. Many staff consider working at AU as a dream job and once they experience the work environment and inequitable pay, they are forced to find positions elsewhere, often in the middle of the semester. The majority of The Eagle editorial board noted that each of them had multiple first-year advisors or academic advisors during their time at AU. A number of advisors and other staff members went above and beyond what's required of their job positions to ensure student success, some working for decades and had made one of the lowest salaries expected of their position and tenure. 
For other families and students, it brings an interesting observation to see that a large portion of union members are AU alumni and leads one to wonder how AU truly values student success throughout their careers. A few first-year students noted that they chose AU over other schools thinking it was the “most liberal” but found out that it was more of a reflection of the students and staff rather than the administrators themselves. 
Though the AU community’s willingness to organize together toward a common goal is extremely admirable, the low effort it takes for others to blindly follow a movement without first taking the time to educate themselves can be concerning. The freshmen class look to the opinions of the student body and follow the common belief, which led to their walk-out of convocation when Burwell was introduced. Despite being a monumental action, a number of students may have viewed actions like these as a way to challenge authority for the fun of it and wrongly group all administrators as ones who make the executive decisions at the bargaining table. 
As much as the contract agreement was long overdue and felt purposely orchestrated to be announced after the strike, the fact that administration had agreed to the demands despite its advertisement as a business entity positively reflects upon them. Nevertheless, The Eagle is in solidarity with the AU Staff Union and hopes that all promises made by administration are executed in a timely manner.
We urge the AU community to continue to stand up for the injustice that staff members still endure, as they’re the ones who make AU, AU.

2023-04-12,AU,liberal,"A class-action lawsuit against American University for partial spring 2020 tuition refunds will proceed after a district court judge ruled the University is not exempt from consumer protection laws. 
The plaintiffs, who originally filed the lawsuit in May 2020, say they paid thousands for in-person learning – an experience cut short in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The plaintiffs also argue that AU broke an implied contract by continuing to advertise on-campus experiences during the admissions process, while students paid the same amount for remote learning.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia gave the go-ahead to students’ claims for partial tuition refunds, following the Court of Appeals’ reinstatement of the case in March 2022. A lower court had initially dismissed the case. 
“With respect to the breach of contract claim, the court held that ‘Plaintiffs adequately allege the Universities breached an implied-in-fact contract to provide in-person education in exchange for tuition,’” Judge Christopher R. Cooper wrote in the opinion.
AU motioned to dismiss the case by arguing the University is not subject to the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act, since it is a nonprofit that provides “training or credentialing activities.” Cooper ruled AU does not qualify as a nonprofit exempt from CPPA liability, since the D.C. Council would have explicitly included educational activities in the law if the exemption was meant to cover colleges and universities. 
“As a matter of common parlance, ‘training’ and ‘credentialing’ bear a business and professional connotation distinct from ‘educating,’” Cooper wrote in the opinion.
CPPA prevents deceptive business practices, such as breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment occurs when one party confers a benefit onto another without the proper restitution required by law. 
The Court of Appeals previously upheld the plaintiffs’ claims that AU breached a contract to provide in-person education in exchange for tuition payments. Additionally, Cooper ruled that fees charged for access to on-campus facilities, like the sports center fee, do not qualify as “membership services” under the CPPA nonprofit liability exemption. 
Cooper said in the opinion that designating such fees as membership services would be a “cryptic way” for the D.C. Council to describe the facilities and extracurriculars at universities. 
Students are seen as consumers since they are purchasing a service of personal nature, according to Cooper. Since schools like AU are marketed as liberal arts to achieve well-rounded students, Cooper said undergraduate education is still a consumer service protected by CPPA.
“To the extent American suggests, as a general rule, that all college students seek out higher education only for business or professional—rather than personal—purposes,” Cooper wrote in the opinion. “That notion is contradicted by the University’s own stated mission to ‘advance knowledge, foster intellectual curiosity, build community, and empower lives of purpose, service, and leadership.’” 
After a lower court dismissed the case in June 2020, finding AU didn’t violate any contractual promises, plaintiffs urged the Court of Appeals to revive the case. The Court of Appeals revived the case in March 2022 and found that the plaintiffs had presumably alleged AU breached the implied-in-fact contracts for in-person learning. 
Roy Willey, attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on the matter at this time when contacted by The Eagle. 
Since Cooper of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled against AU’s motion to dismiss the case, students can proceed with their COVID-19 refund claims in the lawsuit. 
“This is an ongoing legal case currently in the discovery phase, so we are unable to comment beyond that,” said Jasmine Pelaez, AU’s internal communications manager.

2023-05-04,AU,liberal,"Bridget Trogden will start as the dean of undergraduate education and academic student services on July 1, Provost and Chief Academic Officer Peter Starr announced in an email to the American University community Thursday. 
Trogden, previously an associate dean and professor in the department of engineering at Clemson University, will supersede Dean Jessica Waters, who announced her departure from the position in October 2022. Waters will remain at AU as a full-time faculty member in the School of Public Affairs. 
Trogden, who holds a PhD in chemistry from the University of Illinois, will also be a tenured professor in the School of Education.
In her time at Clemson University, Trogden oversaw efforts to implement a new curriculum with interdisciplinary and engaged learning to improve general education, according to the email. 
“A strong believer in the value of a holistic undergraduate experience, Dean Trogden has played a key role in leading curricular innovations in general education at Clemson,” Starr wrote in the email.
Trogden also led STEM efforts at Clemson and is a principal investigator on multiple grant-funded initiatives in STEM education. 
Before her time at Clemson, Trogden served as the director of Research that Reaches Out in the Office of the Provost at Mercer University. In this role, she “enhanced” retention rates and education through research that focused on local, national and global issues. Trogden also taught in Mercer University’s College of Liberal Arts, specializing in chemistry and the Honors Program. 
In the email, Starr thanked Waters for her work on AU’s core curriculum, first year advising, student wellness and more. Waters began as dean of undergraduate education and vice provost for academic student services in 2016. She earned both her B.A. and J.D. from AU. 
“I am deeply grateful to Jessica Waters for her extraordinary work as dean over the past seven years,” Starr wrote. “Throughout her tenure, she has been an instrumental part of the university’s efforts to enhance the student experience.”

2009-09-10,AU,Democrat,"As I watched Ted Kennedy laid to rest at the end of August, I found myself thinking about 1987. That was the year Kennedy castigated Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. During Bork's hearings, Kennedy said, ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government."" In retrospect, many people think Kennedy's speech was the beginning of the end for Bork. Critics also charge that the harshness of his words caused of our current culture war. Maybe so. As recently as Aug. 28 of this year, The New York Times ran an editorial stating as much.
Whether or not he caused it, Kennedy certainly was on the right side of the culture war. Like all good progressives, he battled social conservatives who seek to suppress anything they personally find un-Christian, immoral or inconsistent with traditional American values. It is a struggle that still rages today.
The current Virginia gubernatorial race is rife with culture clash. The Washington Post recently reported on Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's college thesis for Regent University (Pat Robertson's school). In said thesis, McDonnell writes that working women are ""detrimental"" to families. He argues that government should prefer married couples to ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.""  He also calls a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing contraception for unmarried couples ""illogical."" He wrote that at age 34. McDonnell is starting to look like George Allen, a Virginia Republican whose 2006 Senate re-election campaign was eventually derailed when he was caught using an ethnic slur.
The Democratic National Committee has released a statement on this issue and its wording sounds familiar. It makes reference to ""Bob McDonnell's preferred Virginia,"" and pundits are already describing Democratic attacks on the thesis as ""Borking"" McDonnell. ""Borking"" is the term Republicans created for when Democrats show their backwards-looking nominees and candidates for what they really are. This entire episode illustrates why despite Democratic struggles, the Republican Party is far away from returning to power. And why? Perhaps because the GOP is a party made up of white men looking out for the interest of white men.
The problem for Republicans is that the number of white men in America continues to decline. Women outnumber them today, and in just a few decades there will be no racial majority in America. The election of a black man who campaigned on the change undercuts the decades-old GOP strategy of appealing to certain white, male fears. There are still plenty of scared white men. They are the armed nuts you see at town halls, and they would love to live in Robert Bork's America. But let us always remember Ted Kennedy. As we look around at our country as it exists now, not in a Republican fantasy of yesteryear, let us realize something. We don't live in Robert Bork's America. We live, mostly, in the America of Ted Kennedy's dreams.

2010-04-12,AU,Democrat,"Governor already generating buzz for 2016
Gov. Jack Markell, D-Del., will be speaking today at 6 p.m. in Ward 1. 
A co-founder of FleetCall, which turned into Nextel Communications, Markell has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the “national stage” by 2016, according to The Washington Post. 
Markell was an underdog for the 2008 governor race but was able to secure the Democratic nomination against then Lt. Governor John Carney who had the endorsement of the current governor and the State Democratic Party. He eventually received 67.5 percent of the vote in the general election.
Since then, he has balanced Delaware’s budget during difficult economic times, helped bring new jobs to the state and expanded rights for gays and lesbians with new non-discrimination legislation, according to the events Facebook page. 
The College Democrats and the Roosevelt Institute are sponsoring the event. 
‘Most dangerous man’ dealt Nixon huge blow
Daniel Ellsberg, who rose to national prominence as the man who leaked the infamous Pentagon Papers, will screen a documentary based on his experiences, entitled “The Most Dangerous Man in America,” Wednesday, at 7 p.m. in the Wechsler Theater. 
Ellsberg was a defense analyst for RAND Corporation, a government-funded research firm, when he leaked thousands of pages of classified documents to The New York Times. The documents exposed secrets of the Vietnam War and led to public uproar and possibly hastened the end of the war. 
The event, co-hosted by the School of Communication, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Affairs, will be moderated by Professor James Thurber from SPA’s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.

2010-07-01,AU,Democrat,"In his first visit to AU as president, Barack Obama laid out the framework for his idea of comprehensive immigration reform July 1 — including a pathway to citizenship as well as increased accountability — but did not announce any new policy initiatives. 
About 250 invited guests filled the atrium of the new School of International Service building in its inaugural event to hear Obama’s nearly 40-minute-long speech. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, the Rev. Al Sharpton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus filled the first few rows of the atrium. AU officials, professors and a small group of student leaders were also in attendance.
“In sum, the system is broken,” Obama said. “And everybody knows it. Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling — and to the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.” 
The president said he hopes Congress can pass an immigration reform package soon, but did not address whether he had the support to pass any legislation before the end of the year. The majority of Democrats and Americans want to move forward with reform, and it’s up to Republicans to make the next move and create bipartisan legislation, he said.
While he did not offer many specifics, Obama expressed support for the DREAM Act, a bill before Congress that would provide a pathway to permanent residency for illegal immigrants who graduate from a U.S. high school and show good character. 
School of Public Affairs Dean William LeoGrande was in the audience and said he thought Obama gave a successful speech. Primarily, Obama was challenging the Republican Party to step up and support immigration reform efforts, LeoGrande said.
 “I think the White House is signaling that it really wants to try and push ahead on this issue now and not wait until after the election or next year,” he said. “But he also was very clear that there has to be Republican counterparts who are willing to cooperate in this. Democrats by themselves don’t have the votes to do this.”
Nearly half of the Main Quad and portions of New Mexico and Nebraska Avenues were blocked. Since the speech was invitation-only, students filled Ward 2 to watch. 
Rebecca Paley-Williams, a junior in SPA, watched the speech from Ward. She said she and a lot of the people with her at the watch party were annoyed the event was not open to students and the public. 
“I felt like [Obama] was coming here — this is our campus,” she said. “They probably should have let us see the speech or [provide] some sort of benefit for being a student here.” 
Sara Torneden, a sophomore in SIS, said that while she is disappointed more students were not let in to the event, she understands why the White House selected a smaller venue.  
“[The building choice] is very representative of how [Obama] wanted it to come off,” Torneden said. “He didn’t want it to be in a huge arena with hundreds of thousands of people cheering and everything. He wanted people who were interested in pursuing this in higher education to hear this and take this and motivate them to learn more about it in their studies.”

2010-09-08,AU,Democrat,"Chris Matthews said the current state of bipartisan politics is driving the nation in a downward spiral in a speech Tuesday night in Bender Arena.
Matthews, the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of the year, said the Democratic and Republican parties need to put their rhetoric aside and work together.
“Excessive partisanship, excessive commitment to the notion that anything goes, that anything you can do to win is OK ... disrupts the system. It ruins it in many ways, and nothing gets done,” he said. “The pettiness between the parties [is not] even strategic — it's just crankiness.”
He went on to explain that the key to solving our problems in American politics is to elect good leaders without looking at partisan issues.
KPU Director Josh Levitt agreed with Matthews’ assertion that the two parties need to work together.
“As Obama said, we cannot expect to solve our problems if all we do is tear each other down,” Levitt said.
In an interview before his speech, Matthews said he hopes students attending his speech could come to fully understand a few key problems in the country and find ways to change them.
“I hope that people understand the question, which is 'what’s wrong with politics today?' ” he said. “Why is it so cranky and unproductive? Maybe [they can] begin to set some standards to change it.”
Matthews, who spent many years in politics and government, transitioned to print journalism working as the Washington bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner from 1987 to 2000. He is currently the host of ""Hardball,"" a daily news show on MSNBC and ""The Chris Matthews Show,"" a weekly syndicated public affairs program.
“I’ve watched politicians from the inside, and if you do that you’re able to understand what they’re doing,” he said.
Matthews said he knows how politicians speak and work because he worked as a presidential speechwriter for former President Jimmy Carter. He uses this knowledge of politicians to better understand his guests and inform his audience.
“I think I know what the politicians are up to better than a lot of other people,” he said. “I watched politics from the inside, and if you do that then you are able to understand what they are doing from the press releases, the speeches, the positioning, the dodging.”
Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the first post-apartheid presidential election in South Africa in 1994, the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 and the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.
“Those were great moments for me, and of course all of the presidential elections are fun,” Matthews said.
Matthews believes Democrats are demoralized and disappointed with their own party, but Republicans are angry and energized by the current state of politics.
“Fear makes people angry, and this election this November 2, it’s going to be an explosion of anger,” he said.
Matthews pointed to a rise of unemployment, overflow of government spending and the national debt as a few problems currently facing the nation.
Matthews said there has been speculation in the past that he may return to politics and possibly run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, but he said he does not want to give up his jobs as a news commentator and a reporter yet.
“I thought a lot about it in this [election] cycle and it would have meant giving up what I have spent years developing,” he said.

2010-09-11,AU,Democrat,"The AU College Democrats and College Republicans both have many plans for expanding their groups on campus and becoming more involved with the D.C. community, starting with the National Day of Service and Remembrance on Sept. 11.
The College Republicans participated in the Freedom Walk. This event was created in 2005 to establish a national tradition of remembrance of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, according to College Republican President Stephen Laudone.
The College Republicans will also be working on a community service initiative at Walter Reed Hospital on Nov. 11, Veterans Day.
The College Republicans and College Democrats have also doubled their outreach efforts, with revamped websites, new Facebook groups and fan pages for members to join and stay in touch.
College Democrats President Bo Hammond said the College Democrats have added an internship board to their site for the first time. He said this has been set up to help members of AUCD get jobs, and in the past has secured internships on Capitol Hill and at WeatherizeDC, a non-profit based campaign in D.C. focusing on home efficiency.
The College Republicans have arranged several outings, starting with a meet and greet session at the Tenleytown Z-Burger, followed by a weekend trip to a Nationals game. They have also booked a number of speakers for the upcoming months, such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., sometime in September or October and former United States Senator Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in November.
The College Republicans are also co-sponsoring the Kennedy Political Union's Family Weekend event on Oct. 23. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and presidential candidate, is scheduled to speak. 
Laudone said he is focused on expanding the community service wing of his organization.
“It is important for the [College Republicans] to walk the walk on this [service] issue, so you will see us engaging more than in past years in community service initiatives of our own and with the Community Service Coalition,” he said.
The College Democrats have a themed schedule entitled, “Blue Rising.” This is a six-week period during which they have scheduled many events, starting with advertising and recruitment in the first couple of weeks.
Hammond believes that this will be the best year for the College Democrats.
“We are going to have more members and more resources than we have ever had in the past,” he said.

My roommate and I went to the room draw last semester, and even though we both had really high lottery numbers, we got a room in Centennial. Easily. It was wide open. You obviously didn't really care that much about living on campus and just like to bitch and whine.
• If I needed another Chris Matthews to express their sourpuss attitude and liberal opinions towards the upcoming election, when the Republicans WILL take the House, I would have applied to AU.
oh, wait...
• Eagle rants is not an advice column. Eagle rants is not a relationship column. EAGLE RANTS IS NOT FOR SOLACE, IT'S HERE TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
• Whatever happened with Artemas Ward Week last year? Did that ever end up happening? If not, will we have two this year to make up for it?
• Dear everyone with relationship issues: Talk to your significant other about it. Seriously. It doesn't matter what’s bothering you. It is astounding how much easier it is to work through issues together.
• What's with the bureaucracy here at American? None of the people who work at the school or in the registrar know what's going on. Last week I was trying to get an override form for a class I needed, I asked three different people and got three different answers. So much for paying almost $50,000 a year, right?

• Dear College Democrats,
Why would you close the doors to the event on Thursday night after it started?  Some people have evening classes and would have liked to have slipped in late without making a disturbance. Think about that in the future please.
• I'm a very quiet person, I've had people say that they think I'm stuck up cause I don't talk much, but in reality I just don't want to say something awkward and stupid.

2010-10-12,AU,Democrat,"AU was put on the map last week. On Oct. 7 the Tenley Campus served as the starting block for the final leg of the Sudan Freedom March, which began in New York City on Sept. 15. Thousands walked the 6.2 miles from our campus to Capitol Hill for a rally in support of “democracy and freedom from genocide and slavery?throughout Sudan.”
Last week’s rally highlighted the historic opportunity facing Sudan on Jan. 9, 2011. That day a referendum will be held on whether to split into two nations. The referendum is one of the remaining milestones of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 that ended decades of civil war in ethnically and religiously divided Sudan. Another referendum will be held the same day in Abyei state, one of the disputed areas along the north-south border, to decide whether it will join the North or South. 
The referendum was spotlighted on Sept. 24 when President Barack Obama participated in a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that focused on Sudan. The message from Obama to Vice President Osman Ali Taha, who was representing Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, was clear: The referendum must be held on schedule or there will be consequences. 
Will that alone do the trick?  Unlikely. The South (Abyei in particular) contains most of the country’s oil reserves. The Government of the North — led by Bashir, who has been indicted twice by the International Criminal Court for war crimes — is unlikely to let the South secede smoothly. Although he has pledged to honor the outcome of the referendum, the prospect of an independent South will mean revenue losses for the North. Voter manipulation — practiced with impunity during Sudan’s national elections in May — will be a real threat.
There are yet more obstacles to a timely referendum. The North’s ruling party — the National Congress Party — wants the border officially demarcated before the referendum, even though that isn’t required by the CPA. Voter registration was recently delayed until mid-November. The commission overseeing the referendum was only officially constituted on Sept. 15. The Southern government is trying to repatriate the hundreds of thousands of Southerners living in the North. Citizenship policies remain unresolved. With only three months until the referendum, the road ahead is foggy.
I have not mentioned Sudan’s main humanitarian crisis: Darfur. In September, I visited the Woodrow Wilson Center to hear Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the lead prosecutor of the ICC. In his discussion of his case against Sudanese government officials, Ocampo noted that Darfur and the referendum are not separate. In fact, a former Interior Minister charged with managing the Janjaweed and later the Humanitarian Affairs Minister is now the governor of South Kordofan, a border state next to Abyei and potential flashpoint like Darfur. One of the key actors in Darfur and closest confidants of President Bashir is positioned at what could be the eye of the storm. 
For AU students interested in conflict, political development and humanitarian affairs in Africa the Sudan referendum is significant. If it is stalled or manipulated the South will be deprived the right to self-determination. If mishandled, the chance of another civil war, and violence spread to the Democratic Republic of Congo and other neighbors, is possible. U.S. security interests are also at stake. Combating terrorism in the Horn is well-served by an empowered South. 
What can be done from our end?  U.S. pressure on the parties is imperative. Economic incentives and disincentives, along with the prospect of normalized relations, are important carrots and sticks. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have recently ramped-up this effort. This should continue. A bill introduced last week by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., — the Sudan Peace and Stability Act — shows congressional interest. Urging your elected officials to prioritize Sudan or teaming with an advocacy group is a great way to help further this objective.
There are less than 100 days until Jan. 9. Sudan should stay on the front-burner until then — and beyond.

2010-12-06,AU,Democrat,"Something wicked this way comes — it lurks in our skies, awaiting the return of innocent college students from winter break. It will drop around the beginning of February, wreaking havoc not only upon Washington, but the rest of the East Coast as well. 
People will rush to the grocery stores and Terrace Dining Room, which will run out of food within a week. The Metro system will shut down and cars will be inoperable, making the only viable mode of transportation cross-country skiing. Classes will be canceled day after day, while a civil war breaks out at Dupont Circle. 
Civilization as we know it will cease to exist and D.C. will descend into chaos, buried under a thick blanket of fluffy, white snow. 
Snowpocalypse 2011 is coming — are you prepared? Heed The Eagle’s warning and use this guide to start a survival kit before it’s too late.
Powdered milk
Since the Eagle’s Nest and local stores will face a milk shortage, be sure to pick up at least five industrial-size boxes of powdered milk. Even if the pipes freeze, use the abundance of snow outside to your advantage and mix it in for a truly ice-cold drink.
Hot Pockets
Stockpile as many frozen entrees as will fit in your freezer. Hot Pockets are the best bet because of their nutritional superiority and tendency to make you too nauseous to eat more. Not only will you have enough food to last through the crisis, but you’ll gain some extra padding against the bitterness of winter as well.
10-layer cake
Celebrate the impending end of the world by eating one layer of cake for each day of being trapped on campus. For more creative types, you can decorate each layer with the circles of Hell as you descend further into cabin fever.
Alaskan dog sled
Though snowshoes and cross-country skis will work for a while, save your legs and invest in an Alaskan dog sled with a few strong Huskies. It’s fast, fun and furry — and you’ll look that much cooler arriving at the 2,000-person Dupont Circle snowball fight on a wintry chariot.
Well-stocked entertainment system
Nothing fends off boredom like a five-day Mario Kart tournament. Pit Democrats against Republicans, East Coast natives against West Coast natives, School of International Service majors against School of Public Affairs majors — you get the idea — for the title of Snowpocalypse King. If holding such an event off campus, don’t hesitate to include alcohol to make each game truly warm, fuzzy and much more memorable.

2011-01-11,AU,Democrat,"It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve. 
Big Brother has proven inept and can’t be trusted. It’s about time we stick up for ourselves and start advocating transparency.

2011-02-09,AU,Democrat,"Political strategist Ed Gillespie has been involved in Washington politics since his college days.
The former Republican National Committee chairman began at the bottom of the food chain. He worked as a Senate parking lot attendant while he was a student at the Catholic University of America.
Gillespie spoke at AU Feb. 7 about his own career and the future of his party in what he calls a “center-right nation.”
“The great thing about going to school in D.C. is being able to intern. The great thing about politics is that it’s a meritocracy and you can work your way up,” he said.
Gillespie, chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the state level is an important arena for politicians.
“It is a training ground for new Republicans. There are innovative ideas and policy proposals, as well as working to increase diversity.”
After winning a historic 690 new state legislative seats in 2010, Gillespie has high hopes for future Republicans.
“There are great opportunities in the Senate and whether President Obama re-elected or not, we’re likely to hold the House given the size of the margin and the nature of redistricting,” Gillespie said.
He predicted eight to 10 Republican candidates in the 2012 primaries.
“There are a lot of really good potential candidates that are going to run, bringing new faces to the party,” Gillespie said.
The most important issues in the election, he believes, will center around government spending, the economy and jobs.
“The most important factor will be what is the unemployment rate,” Gillespie said. “The real overarching dynamic is where are the jobs? Do people feel like they’re coming back?”
He said Republicans should recruit minorities and female candidates.
“It’s a long term concern, a demographic challenge. We need to do better with minority voters, most acutely with Hispanic voters,” Gillespie said.
But independent voters are important too, he said, saying the “overwhelming” support of this group was crucial to the 2010 victories.
Gillespie also said he believes the tea party movement will assimilate into the mainstream Republican Party, comparing them to Catholic Democrats joining the party in the 1980s and the Ross Perot supporters in the 1990s.
“Growing pains are better than shrinking pains,” he said.

Howard Dean confused AU with a cross-town rival during a Feb. 8 speech.
The former Democratic National Committee chairman had discussed immigration last week with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich at George Washington University.
Dean told the GWU audience Americans need to be welcoming to immigrants.
But at AU, Dean made a gaffe.
“Raise your hand if you have Native American blood in you,” Dean said at AU. “Everybody else is an immigrant, everybody else had someone in their family who scrubbed floors so you could be here at George Washington.”
Chuckles broke out and Dean joined in, realizing his mistake. But the School of Public Affairs Undergraduate Council, the sponsors of the event, had the last laugh when they presented Dean with an AU mug as a parting gift.
“And it says American University on the inside,” said one College Democrat member. “So you’ll always know what you’re drinking from.”
Besides that faux pas, Dean spoke about the current youth grassroots movement, saying change comes from the ground up — not down from the presidency.
He said while President Barack Obama should not have a problem getting out the youth vote in 2012, much of his younger base from 2008 is disenchanted with the administration’s performance thus far.
“It’s natural for you at your age to be very idealistic,” Dean said. “But it’s also natural for you to be easily disappointed.”
Dean also predicted a victory for Obama in 2012 based on this generation’s diversity and acceptance of others.
He described the audience as “the first multicultural generation.”
Dean also spoke about the war in Afghanistan, saying he supports the war but has some reservations about pulling troops out.
He said he is worried about how Afghan women will be treated if the U.S. leaves the country.
“I’m a politician because I believe deeply in social justice,” Dean said. “When we leave, women will be treated worse than slaves.”

2011-03-03,AU,Democrat,"Former D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee said the state of the U.S. public education system today “sucks.”
Rhee spoke to students March 2 in a panel event sponsored by the Roosevelt Institute at AU, after a screening of the documentary “Waiting for Superman,” a film about the nation’s public schools system. 
 “We are supposed to be living in the best country in the world,” Rhee said to a packed audience. “The land of opportunity, and whether or not kids get a good education is dependent on luck and the spinning of the wheel.”
The documentary says Rhee simultaneously drew praise and criticism during her tenure as chancellor. During that time she cut over a hundred jobs in the D.C. Central Office and closed 23 schools in D.C.
Her alliance with former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty made waves during the mayoral election earlier this fall. Rhee resigned after Vincent Gray was elected.
Rhee talked about her stance on teachers’ unions, saying she was surprised that President Barack Obama has advocated for holding accountable and even firing underperforming teachers. 
“I don’t think you can overstate the importance that he has had over the debate of teacher quality over the last two years,” Rhee said.
She said while Obama has held teachers more accountable, Republicans primarily criticize the teachers’ unions. A Democrat herself, Rhee said that stance needs to change. 
However, she said she has seen Republicans, Democrats and independents alike calling for reform, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and her fiancé, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a Democrat.
“Democrats have been resistant about saying that within the last 10 years and I think that with some of the stuff that’s going on in Wisconsin, it is actually a different dynamic that’s happening there,” she said. “I think that you can hold unions accountable and draw very strong distinctions in what they ought to be doing and fighting for.”
Zachary Kolodin, director of the Future Preparedness Initiative for Roosevelt Institute, also served on the panel and said it is not productive to vilify the unions. 
He said that while the recession and deep deficits across the country have hit budgets hard, money should still be directed towards education.
“In Wisconsin, there’s a real demonization of unions and public employees and I think that reflects something real in our economy,” Kolodin said.  It’s really not the unions’ fault that America is such a ruthless place for the middle class right now.”
But Rhee said that in New Jersey, thousands of dollars are spent per child with disappointing results. 
She said that the root of the problem doesn’t come from poor districts or lazy parents, but the poor performance of teachers and attitude in the central office. 
“Once we as a school district do everything that we’re supposed to be doing, then we have the right to go to the parents and the kids and hold them accountable too,” Rhee said.
Rhee has continued her crusade against the unions by establishing her own interest group called StudentsFirst. 
Rhee said she believes that the failure of the system now is that there are advocates for adults but none for kids.
“The education landscape over the last few decades has been driven by special interests groups: textbook manufacturers, teachers unions, testing companies, et cetera,” she said. “We don’t have a system that is set up to protect children, we have a system that is set up to protect adults and their jobs.”

2011-08-12,AU,Democrat,"Though public officials reached a deal on the debt ceiling Aug. 2, many student government presidents from across the country are unhappy with the deal.
Before the agreement was made, more than 120 student government presidents from 40 states, including AU Student Government President Tim McBride, signed a letter demanding Congress come up with a solution to raise the national debt ceiling and prevent the U.S. government from defaulting on its loans.
The letter, asking “Do We Have a Deal Yet,” says the student government presidents support the proposals of the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Gang of Six, a group of senators containing three Republicans and three Democrats. There are no particular provisions of those recommendations the group supports, but it does urge congressmen to accept a “bipartisan framework,” according to Andy MacCracken, executive director of the D.C. Student Alliance and former SG president.
Now that a default has been avoided, the group is disappointed the deal includes the founding of a commission to continue to debate debt reduction that is tasked with finding more cuts by November. 
“It’s very unfortunate that our leaders kicked the can down the road even farther,” MacCracken said. 
Though the group has no “grandiose” ideas that their opinions will suddenly cause bipartisan cooperation on the Hill, a few of the students, including MacCracken, were granted a conference call with President Obama and members of his staff on July 26 and a meeting with staff in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office on Aug. 1 regarding the letter.
“That speaks volumes to the impact we’ve already started to have,” MacCracken said.
Student leaders will continue to advocate to members of the new commission to reduce the deficit. 
They want politicians to focus “on what the ramifications are going to be for the next generation as opposed to what short-term benefits might be for the next election,” MacCracken said.
The student presidents’ main hope is to encourage students to get involved and take a stand on debt negotiations by calling their representatives or senators and getting their opinion heard, McBride said.
Some of those student government presidents held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. July 21, garnering media attention from CNN, NPR, ABC, FOX, and the Huffington Post.
“We’re not telling our leaders what to do,” MacCracken said. “We’re just telling them to lead.”
The difference between this lobbying group and others is that they are not asking for favors, according to McBride, who signed the letter July 12. Instead, these student leaders are still looking for a deal that will not bankrupt the country that some of these students will one day lead.
“We have a unique message that needed to be heard,” McBride said.
As Obama echoed in the conference call, students have the most to lose from any failed debt reduction negotiations. 
“Young people will shoulder the consequences of gridlock during a time that requires bold action,” the letter reads. “Your decisions will determine what kind of country we will inherit.”

2012-02-07,AU,Democrat,"Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler is surprised Maryland hasn’t moved to legalize same-sex marriage sooner. 
A state senate committee is expected to vote on a Gov. Martin O’Malley’s same-sex marriage bill in the next few weeks.
“Ten years ago, people would think, ‘there's no way in the world,’ ‘it's like walking around on Mars,’ ‘there's no way same-sex couples are getting married in this country,’” Gansler said at a speaking event Jan. 31 in MGC 3, sponsored by AU College Democrats. “Ten years from now, they are going to look back at it as if it was some sort of quaint debate: ‘You know that was weird. Remember when they didn't let same-sex couples get married?’""
Gansler also called the issue a “Republican” one, saying that he believes Republicans see homosexuality as choice and “believe that they can be changed to no longer be homosexual.”
“There’s no issue — it seems to me right now — that’s a social issue that’s more Republican,” Gansler said.
Lawmakers also remain undecided on whether the state should recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
""There's five states in the middle where we say marriage is between a man and a woman, so we don't allow same-sex marriages in the great state of Maryland,” Gansler said in his speech. “But we will, and we are silent on what we are going to do about these other marriages [same-sex marriages from other states].”
Gansler testified in favor of same-sex marriage at a Maryland senatorial hearing Jan. 31, a move Gansler considered risky.
""I knew if I talked to my political people — as you see everyone is over-coached these days — they'd say that was a really stupid idea politically,” Gansler said. “But I thought it was the right thing to do, and I get paid less than paralegals that work at big law firms, so I thought, ‘you know, what if I'm going to be doing this job, I might as well do what's right.’"" 
The State Senate legalized same-sex marriage in February 2011 but it failed in the State House that March. Gansler hopes both chambers will pass the bill this year.
Gansler was elected attorney general in 2006 and is in his second term. He is also the president-elect of the National Association of Attorney Generals, the assembly of all the attorney generals in the United States.
Gansler teaches as an adjunct professor in AU’s Washington College of Law, where he teaches Criminal Trial Advocacy. 
He supports the unionization of AU adjunct professors, saying it gives adjunct professors an opportunity for competitive pay. 
“If in fact it passes, the next issue is: What will the union do for the adjunct professors?” Gansler said.
He encourages students to vote whenever they can, but also to take their time in college to pick a side of the political spectrum.
“I don't think people should pick a party based on what their parents are, but they should understand the issues and figure out which party is more aligned with their views,” Gansler said. “And then get involved the party.""

• @[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?],
Really I just love the occasional N*Sync throwback. Gotta love JT with the terrible frosted tips. Oh the 90's...
• @I started working out recently,
I feel ya. Try focusing on the little changes in your physique and  really hype those up to yourself. I had really flabby arms so when I started working out and finally saw the first indications of a muscular contour, I was super happy and my hard work felt vindicated. You'll get there; just keep swimming!

• I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS.
• We have unlimited juice?! This party is gonna be off the hook!
• Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won't give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it's just smoke!
• NOBODY ON CAMPUS LOOKS LIKE ADELE.
• I removed myself from all social media the other day to get away from all the supercritical people that judge every single thing you say. Honestly, although I feel out of the loop now, I feel liberated (and less distracted). Plus, I now know who my real friends are!
• Original ranter about the smoke-free campus plan here: I was encouraged to post a rant about this by a bunch of people who were shocked that this idea was being seriously considered. I, personally, do not smoke, and dislike having to inhale secondhand smoke. However, I have mixed feelings about the smoke-free campus plan.
• Drop. Your. Sword.
• It's called a lance...hello.
• I love my conservative friends.
a liberal
• I'm not complaining about GCH since I love them, but technically we already paid for them with our Student Activity fee.
• @""other Starkid fan, Wanna meet at the Dav at 2:30 on Thursday? I’ll wear my rocket ship shirt."" YES!! I'll be the one rolling on the floor like Lauren Lopez.  But actually, I am so bad at planning clothes so I'll just carry a sign that says ""That's Absurd!"" on it :)

• To the girl on the fifth floor of hughes that is always naked with her curtains open:
thank you.

Men everywehre
• This is a campus with students who are actually conservative, think they are liberal, say they are moderates, vote democrat, and at the end of the day are disgustingly apathetic and unsure of themselves.
• Dear guy in SIS who thought his headphones were plugged in but was actually just playing music really loudly: That was hilarious and thanks for looking rightfully embarrassed when you realized your mistake!
• To straight female conservative republican. Wow I wasn't even trying to be mean with that first post. You have your whole life to be a racist, bible-quoting, million(miscalculated) mom joining, human rights offender. Why start in college? Keep pretending that your conservative boyfriend doesn't hate gay people because he's in the closet himself. Or that his huge gun makes up for his less than adequate bedroom abilities. If I could legally spit on you I would.
• My RA tells me to watch out for EI guys on my floor because they steal laptops. But just the other day we catch a mysterious man in his mid 30s walking our floor, looking around. I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
• I was so mad when I found out how much we were paying for Gym Class Heroes. WE COULD HAVE BROUGHT LIL B! Now you touring heavy and your show cost 30 G's! DAMN BASED GOD, YOU DOING EVERYTHING!

• @gentlemen get screwed over. Maybe she just wasn't into you. She's allowed to not be into you.
• I also find myself becoming more conservative here, but I'm not sure if it's just that a lot of the liberals here are really obnoxious.
• Reading some of these rants makes me wonder if I was ever actually like this while being an undergraduate.

• no....you're douchy.
• What qualifies someone as a ""Public Figure""?? I feel like there are so many people's full names used on here that it seems like anyone does.
• I agree about the Adele chick. She's in my class and I want to play with her boobs. :)
• Sorry editor...it's kinda why fat people are fat tho...they stay home and eat. #reality
• Why do none of my friends want to discuss politics?! I feel like I am suddenly at the wrong university
• The fact that Eagle Rants has an editor is maybe the most hilarious thing since Hope-Change
• I know I'm driving everyone crazy, but I can't stop talking about you. You are my drug
• @”facebook timeline advocate: I love the concept of the timeline, but there are a few really annoying bugs in it that I can’t figure out.  On the “map” feature, whenever I click on a city I have been to it only lets me add a single year. What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.
• @""To be honest, the whole concept of Greek life families really just annoys me..."" Couldn't agree more. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. Your right, where are their priorities?
• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.
[Editor’s Note: I just delete them when they use curse words]
• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!
• I think I am the Adele
• @hipster girls are gross: You have it all wrong. Hipsters smoke weed. Goths smoke cigarettes.
• I HATE SOCIAL GREEK LIFE. There I said it. It separates everyone into different groups and the rest dont have a group (not that they want one...). Everyone fights for equality and no cliques or bullying but thats what greek like does (a lot of the time, not generalizing).
• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.
• Was it rude to protest Brewer? Yes. You know whats ruder? Racism.
• Dear Eagle's Nest,
I would like to bring your attention to the current dearth of ice cream selections. Never have I seen a more disappointing sight than the empty shelves of the ice cream freezer. One question: Why?
Sincerely,
Jamaican Me Crazy

• @""In this world, gentlemen get f***ed"": good job standing by your beliefs, I guess, but be careful not to take an isolated incident and extrapolate too much.

• Why can't Eagle Rants be clever and contain basic English. I've read other schools rants (UNC-Chapel Hill) and they surpass us in ranting. It must say something when a student bodys' rants are from illiterates and numbskulls. Can't there be a smart rant every once in a while. Do you guys even know the meaning of a rant?
• Yes. We hate fat people at the gym. Please stay home. And eat.

Stand your ground

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The controversy has forced our nation into intense self-examination: of its gun policies, of race relations, of police practices. What else has this tragedy exposed? And what can we learn from it? Our quick take columnists weigh in:

Perpetuating hate and injustice

Stand your ground

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.

Do what you  want to do, and if they ever get married, they can plan their weddings whatever way they want.  This will be a memory that will last forever.  Don't let your wishes and memories be shaped by what other people want you to do.



•Stop with the biddie hate, being a biddie is fun, try it sometime.
•@ ""Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough?""
That's just man's natural defense mechanism against needy women.
•@ Guy who wore biking spandex into The Dav.
Of all the people you had to bend over in front of you chose me. I have one question. WHY?!
•@Allison DuBois: I’m not saying that they didn’t use it in court, I’m saying that mostly everyone that she claims to have worked with openly deny that fact or say she wasn’t helpful at all, not just in court. One officer even stated that she was trying to get information off of him. This all draws one huge FAKE sign in my head.
•@Allison DuBois cont’d: mind DNA? You’re really just throwing anything out there to try and make sense. If she had some new kind of DNA, why doesn’t she let scientists test her DNA? Or study her brain for a few days until she gets a vision? That would surely give us some answers and probably lead to a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the brain. But no, she just writes books and goes on tour and tells people how to do it herself. And no, one guy at the University of Phoenix who studies psychics doesn’t mean anything.
•@Allison DuBois cont’d: If you want to believe its real, you must first believe that souls and ghosts and goblins exist. It doesn’t matter how much you watch “Ghost Hunters” and think that's real too, there is absolutely zero scientific evidence that any of that stuff exists. What is easier to believe, that this woman really has supernatural powers, or that she is deceiving everyone to further her career? No, there’s no way ANY human would do the latter, right? Just like every other fairy tale, I will believe its real when there is actual, empirical, scientific evidence for it.
•@Allison DuBois (one last time): If its Allison's policy that nobody can say she worked with them, then that should really be another red flag. And yes, I can create visions in my head whenever I want. I can call them dreams too if I felt like. And your comparison with washing hands before delivering babies doesn't work because its actually testable and verifiable.

•I posted a rant regarding Sarah McBride that was not hateful, just simply posing the other side of the argument and how I don't necessarily understand it but that got censored.. so I think your censoring rules are bogus you just censor anything bad regarding McBride
[Editor's note: When it comes to this topic, Sarah is being considered a private figure. No one deserves to have everyone comment on their gender and sexuality.]
•My roommate/best friend is possibly transferring next semester to a better school but hasn't gotten a letter yet.. I have to leave without knowing if I'll see her next year and I don't know how to tell her how amazing she is and how much she has changed my life
•All McBride did as SG president (as it seems by the Eagle article) is work towards issues with LGBT.. while important, really? that's all he did? kind of biased..
•If I wasn't at AU, I'd still be at University of Maryland (I transferred). It makes me sad when people bitterly complain about AU. You guys really have no idea how good you have it.
•Nice spamming,SG senators. As someone who DOESN'T work for the Eagle, and used to be a senator, I'll second their report- You guys are awful. You take credit for things you had barely anything to do with, you pass moronic resolutions (TAMPON, anyone?) and you generally think this is an episode of West Wing. So yeah, hop off. But also, I believe there were TWO SG reporters and they were both really nice. The other one had to leave to take a SG position. But let's give credit where credit is due- good work Zoey too!

•OP of roommate transferring- I know, I can't tell her how upset I am because I want her to go where she is happy so it's a really difficult position.. she leaves tomorrow and I still haven't said anything.. sigh
•my roommate has stopped doing laundry, she is just spraying her shirts with a perfume mixture now.
•@""""The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?"" Are you stupid? No.""- clearly someone doesnt get the humor in this. the original ranter was implying that the scenario which takes place (hot guy who turns out to be gay) is very reminiscent of an AU situation
•@""animal- free food is often cheaper and provides something that everyone can enjoy."" mmhmm cuz TDR's tempeh is just soooo delicious... uh, NOT. Spoiler, not everyone enjoys squished soy cubes. We evolved to have our taste buds enjoy meat because it gives us the protein and salt we need. TDR is the reason I STOPPED being vegan. Ick.
•@Wish I could just have a hook up... Hey, I'm in the same boat. It seems as tho the men-folk really have  only school on the brain... FOR LIKE THE FIRST TIME EVER!
•I miss my dog, but I'm not going home this summer.. Waaaaahhh
•It's three in the morn' and I'm lookin' for the porn.
•Either the editor didn't post my rant, or I just forgot to submit it. Probably the latter, but I'm not sure. I was pretty sleep-deprived.
•Went to a Nats game this weekend, watched the WONK campaign evaporate my tuition dollars before my eyes. Seriously, what kind of self-respecting university advertises themselves that much at a ballpark? WONK needs to burn in hell.
•Gender identity disorder is the formal psychological term for those who are transgender/transsexual. It will be called gender dysphoria in the DSM-5, and will still cover these topics. Personally, I do not believe it should be considered a ""disorder"", the same way homosexuality isn't considered a disorder (though it used to be), but there are certain benefits with it being a diagnosable disorder, including that insurance companies will cover things like gender reassignment surgery. There's debate about the topic among psychologists and just people in general.
•@why am i so lonely?
I used to feel that way until I found God and rediscovered  my faith in Jesus Christ.  God made you in his own image.  He will never leave you alone.
•@girlfriend needs to grow up: Instead of criticizing her, try explaining logically what  she did and how it negatively affected you. Speak in terms of “I feel x and y”, rather than “you always do x and y”. If you accuse of things she will be less likely to listen to you. Positive affirmation is always better at changing behavior than negative affirmation. I recommend the book “The Truth About Love” by Dr. Patricia Love PhD for more relationship tips.
•I also thought the werewolf rant was some twilight reference. Now I looked it up on wikipedia and saw that it is a real thing. To answer your question seriously OP, yes AU is very accepting of all types of conditions and lifestyles. You will love it here. Hope to see you next year!
•I like it when u call me big pa-pa.
•You laugh at my dreams and you don't accept my life goals. It really upsets me and makes me feel less valued.
•@way out of control promotion of “sexual assault awareness” ranter: I completely agree. Whenever I have friends visit me at AU, they think AU is a college full of rapists. AU probably has a much much lower rate of date rape that most of other colleges in the country (for one, because so much of the population is gay). The whole overdramatization of the rape awareness campaigns are actually hurting real victims by making AU look stupid and by turning the whole issue of date rape into a cry wolf situation.
•Why does no one reply to the Gary Johnson rants? Ron Paul gets some love. Come on now. There is no way I am the only Gary Johnson supporter at AU. He embodies the best of both parties. Fiscal responsibility from the republicans and civil liberties and equality from the democrats. Gary Johnson 2012!
•Woah, woah, woah. Someone is dating their big??? WTF??? That is the worst greek incest.
•@Editor- So if I publish an op-ed saying that I'm very secure in my gender, and my personal opinion is that there are psychological explanations behind gender identity disorder, are you going to censor the rants disagreeing with me? What Sarah did is beautiful, and brave, and I'm happy for her, but I think that those who had issues with her op-ed deserve to be heard the same way she got an opportunity to be heard. Don't encourage an atmosphere of division here by only publishing one side.
•I know Sarah, and she's been wonderful and receptive to answering people's questions about her transition. Eagle Rants is an excellent platform for people who don't know her, and have confusions. If you don't publish the negative (but not hateful...) rants, these people who don't know anything about transgendered people won't have the opportunity to have other people answer and respond. You're basically facilitating ignorance about this... I'm really disappointed in the Eagle.
•the editor just answering nope= complete BS.. you know you're wrong, McBride gave up the privacy by posting the article and just replying with nope is a cop out because you know you should've posted those rants
•Are you sad to see the editor of Eagle rants go?
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•Sarah McBride is a private figure who you can't negatively comment on.
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•I don't think the issue of on campus food is about the variety of food... it's more about the price. There is a ridiculous  mark up on everything on campus. My bank account can't handle it!
•On my to do list I made last night for the rest of finals, I've only been able to cross one thing off so far. This is not good.
•I think it's wonderful that Sarah was able to come out to a very accepting environment and I am very proud of her decision. However, if you're going to uphold her status as a non-public figure don't publish ANY rants about her.
•OK, I can understand the Student Union being upset about the fact that students have no say with regards to raising tuition and what's going into the McDonald's, but I really don't have sympathy re: being a dry campus. That's been a policy for a loooong time; you should've known that when you signed on.
•The idea of the unpaid internship is a completely immoral concept and a violation of labor laws. AU (and all other colleges) need to stop encouraging immoral corporations to take advantage of desperate students and needs to stop giving ""college credit"" for ""internships"". College is for learning. Not for paying 3k to AU in order to work for free as an envelop licker.
•As a redhead, I'm so sick of the word ""ginger."" Ugh.
•I once had to fart really badly in a literature class. So, ladies, I am single and available. #realtalk
•From NYT : “When I lived in D.C., it astounded me that the nation's best and brightest college students, hoping to go into politics, worked for senators and congressmen unpaid. Not only was this surprising because of the amount of work D.C. interns actually did on the Hill, but also because it meant that only the wealthier college students could afford to work these unpaid ""jobs"" and, therefore, meet the people and get the experiences that would be integral if they chose to continue on in politics. And we wonder why our politicians tend to come from the ""1 percent.""”
•Did anyone else read the New York Times article “The Outsources Life” about how we are outsourcing intimacy in the form of hiring therapists/life coaches/wantologists because we view sharing our problems with friends as burdening them? When did we become too busy to care for others? Thoughts?
•@Person ranting about Sarah McBride's Op/Ed, she wrote that to appropriately explain, as outgoing president, what was happening.  The AU community deserved an explanation about this public figure.  She did not write it to be criticized for her feelings and decisions.  And what do you care if she did or not?  It's her life, not yours.
•@""AU really isn't vegan-friendly at all...."" FALSE. We were ranked 10th this year. Check yo self.
•I made the best rants of the year TWICE and I am embarrassingly proud.
[Editor’s Note: Kudos!]
•Dear one girl sitting with all of AEPi in the library: I don't know what weird, deep psychological need you're trying to fulfill, but you just look pathetic and you're not cute. P.S., everyone is annoyed by how loud you guys are being.
•If you whine about not getting a place to replace McDonalds look no further than the fanatical green movement on this campus. The reason no company took the lease is because there is a clause for carbon neutrality. Do not let the eagle article trick you into thinking companies pulled out do to a lack of interest from corporate. It is due to these idiotic green eagles that we can not have a normal place to eat at on our campus.
•@Editor: Ohhh editor, let us call a spade a spade and admit. You like Sarah or support the situation they are going through so you are avoiding dissident press. I have no qualms with it but do not postulate you are doing it for some moral inclination, being her privacy. Coming out like that was no private matter and you have not posted rants that did not even attack Sarah but rather ask provocative questions about trans sexuality. Just admit it.
•All I seem to be doing lately is playing with fire.
•@Person who asked a question about a cow: You shouldn't get spoiled milk, you'll be buttering it up if you do it right.
•@Hate -I probably am a terrible person. I would still like to have a discussion in person so we can end the year like the friends we once were.
•Has anyone ever told you that you're a passive-aggressive low life? It's no wonder you have a whopping two friends here. Have fun abroad because I never want to see you again after what you've said. La chatte!
•Amie Krupnick? YOU BET.
•I have three roomates. I love two of them dearly but we all hate the third one. How can we convince her to move ouuuut?
•Go SG!
•Im thankful for the blog.
•Fun fact. Racism is still funny.
•As a woman, I'm all for gender equality, but do you think next year Women's Initiative we can tone it down a bit? My grandmother came to pick me up and I'm trying to explain to her I don't go to a school of rapists. If she passes out....
•I am so grateful for your blog post.Much thanks again. Want more.
•The myAU Portal is totally broken right now. Great. It's not like I need to see what my grades are or anything.
•I had too much sex this semester.
•I don't know how to tell you how much your friendship has meant to me this year. It's too important to do it over text message, and if I say it in person I might end up hugging you and crying, even though I am neither a hugger nor a cry-er. Thanks for putting up with my brattiness, and for helping me get swoll.
•Impeach the Eagle Rants Editor!
•I missed puppy day :(
•Hey Eagle Rants editor, if I make an inappropriate comment toward some random transgender person without mentioning a specific name, will you still censor me? What if this person doesn't even exist? And what if my comment is not geared toward all transgender people, but just this one person who I won't name? Will you still censor me then?
[Editor’s Note: The Eagle does not publish hate speech, so probably not.]
•Seeing as how The Eagle keeps censoring Sarah rants, I say we need  another Free Speech wall so that all expressions can be heard without fear of censorship.
•Thank you ever so for you article.Thanks Again.
•I asked you to do ONE thing, and I gave you plenty of time to do it, and you didn't. You suck.
•Where are the May 7th eagle rants???
[Editor’s Note: Editor’s got finals, too, you know.]
•@ @Women's Initiative (who stated a prospective student was worried if sexual assault was an issue on the campus), If statistics such as 1 in 4 were lower, there would be no need for the programming. Stop sexual assault, not the prevention.

• Sooo, why were the Thursday night Eagle Rants to weird? Seriously, they made no sense to me.
• @""Wow, Biden was a real jackass in the debate tonight.."" Well, Republicans should be seriously embarrassed at how disrespectful, condescending, and immature the majority of your presidents are. In words of Michael Kelso, ""BURN."" 
• Patience is a Virtue. SO CALM YOURSELVES. Rants will be up when they are up. 
• @person who will transfer due to lack of friends: You should check out the Methodist-Protestant Community. Our services are lots of fun and the pastor is pretty badass, and there's always free food (Oreos, Goldfish, hummus, big honkin block of cheddar cheese, the works) after services. Consider this my personal invitation to you to join us 7pm on Sunday at Kay (and it really, REALLY doesn't matter I you're Protestant, Christian, or even religious, you're welcome anyways). If it weren't for the Methodists, I'd have transferred a long time ago. 
• Ummm was it just me, or were you flirting with me all evening?
• YES to Biden calling Ryan out on his BS. Dems need more of that. Of course Republicans are going to whine about his interruptions, ironically, considering last week's debate. 
• Study lounge door handle currently broken. Been stuck in here for 4 hours. Everyone is sleeping or went home for the break. Someone please save me.

In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is kind.
• Can't tell if there was actually blood all over Ward or someone is just the funniest eagle rants troll in a longggggg time.
• Why was there blood on ward's steps? Was it because of scissor man?
• My boyfriend is the most amazing, hilarious man to walk the earth....until a sporting event comes on, when he gets so aggressively angry that i get scared. I already avoid being around him if I know some big game is going to be on. But since there is practically always something sports related on, sometimes Im there. Worst is when we're in the car and he listens over the radio, and becomes such an aggressive drivr that I genuinely think we won't survive. What should I do? I'm afraid this is how an abusive relationship begins
• I hope Miranda July knows she has a great looking ass.
• I want to tell my roommate I am in recovery for an eating disorder in order to get her to stop saying triggering things (""ha ha! I haven't eaten all day isn't that funny? I'm not even hungry!"") But it might just make things worse. I don't want to set her off. After all, I used to say things like that before I snapped and decided being a robot running on fumes was better than being human.
• @Im not happy here, and there is no one here i can really talk to about it. I would give anything for a relaxing weekend at home. I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Why can't we know each other?!
• I have trouble making friends here too and i don't why
• Ryan's complete lack of foreign policy knowledge made me want to scream. 
• I hope everyone realizes that the Eagle Rants editor is a normal person with a life. And every time the current one gets 'fired' because they don't post rants on time, the person who replaces them does exactly the same thing. Just be happy with what we've got.

• Loving this new GOP ""disrespectful"" line. Give me a break. 
• My slam went home for break and I'm stuck here.
• Was there really a self-inflicted scissor accident at Ward or did someone just bring joy back to Rants?  Either way, I laughed, thanks.
• @TDR Coffee Ice Cream Ranter: At least you have some selection of ice cream to consume daily. People who do not have dietary restrictions eat up the pints of rice ice cream just because they can, and then people like me have to wait for ages for another opportunity to have some. It's really a downer.
• Thank you so much for reminding me Downton Abbey airs in the UK before the US. Project Free Tv here I come... Guess I know what I'm doing with my Fall Break.

2012-11-08,AU,Democrat,"President Barack Obama won re-election in the 2012 presidential campaign against Gov. Mitt Romney on Tuesday after garnering the electoral votes of several major swing states. The president received noteworthy support from college age students as 60 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 cast their ballots for Obama. 
In addition, more young people voted in this election than in 2008.  People between the ages of 18 and 29 accounted for 19 percent of those who voted in the election, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.
Battleground States
Obama won 11 of the 14 swing states, including Virginia, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada.
Both the Obama and Romney campaigns expect Florida to narrowly favor the president.

Maryland and Maine passed ballot measures Tuesday allowing same-sex marriage. Washington state is projected to pass a similar ballot measure, but results had not been finalized as of Nov. 8. Minnesota voters also rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. 
Marijuana Initiatives 
Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, and medical marijuana may be legalized in Massachusetts and Montana, pending final vote counts.  However, Oregon and Arkansas voted against legalization of marijuana. 
Puerto Rico may become the 51st State of America
Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood for the first time. According to the Constitution, Congress would still need to decide whether or not to accept Puerto Rico as a state before it can join the union.
Warren Unseats Brown 
Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren defeated Republican Senator Scott Brown in the Senate race.  The Warren-Brown race gained publicity after Brown’s repeated accusations that Warren illegitimately claimed to have Native American ancestry to advance her career. Brown was elected to replace the deceased Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime Democrat in the Senate. Warren helped create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, a major cornerstone for the Obama Administration, and was a favorite among Democrats to head the new agency. 
Mourdock Defeated by Donnelly
The Democrats gained another seat in the Senate with the victory of Joe Donnelly over Republican Richard Mourdock.  Mourdock was severely criticized after he said that pregnancy as a result of rape was “something God intended.”
McCaskill Defeats Akin
Claire McCaskill defeated Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate Race.  Akin’s campaign had its share of controversy. When he was asked whether abortion should be allowed in the case of rape, and he responded that “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down.”  He went on to say that the rapist, not the unborn child, should be punished.

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

2012-11-09,AU,Democrat,"Two filmmakers want you to know that the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lies. 
At least, that’s what filmmaker Oliver Stone and AU Professor Peter Kuznick’s new documentary series wants you to believe. Stone and Kuznick screened an episode of their 10-part documentary series, “The Untold History of America,” and answered questions about the upcoming show and book at Ward on Nov. 8.
Stone is known for making politically charged films, so the pairing for the documentary makes perfect sense. His film “W,” which highlights the personal issues of President George W. Bush, made a splash in 2008, while his earlier military-driven films “Born on the Fourth of July” and “Platoon” were nominated for Oscars in the late ‘80s (with “Platoon” actually taking home the golden statue for Best Picture in 1986). 
Kuznick introduced the series as a “history of the American empire” ranging from World War I to present day, including the presidency of Barack Obama.  
The series, beginning Nov. 12 airing at 8p.m. on Mondays on Showtime, aims to “puncture the common American myths,” Kuznick said. It began as one documentary, based on the 1944 Democratic Convention when President Harry Truman was chosen to be on the ticket above the favorite, Henry Wallace.
The general idea behind exposing this injustice was to highlight the fact that had Wallace, a vocal supporter of equality and peace, been chosen, he could have gone on to become president and avoided Truman’s mistakes.
The first episode, shown at the event on campus, was about Truman’s decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The episode argues that Truman lied to the American people, making them believe that the bombs were necessary to win the war when the Japanese had surrendered three months earlier.
Kuznick and Stone have been working on the project for about eleven years, 11 of which were for filming, since the movie required extensive research. During that time, they also collaborated in the classroom, with Kuznick teaching a course titled “Oliver Stone’s America” at AU. 
The documentary project started when Stone sat in on one of Kuznick’s class and heard the story of Wallace. Stone was immediately hooked, saying he “could not get the story out of his head for years.”
Stone was raised in a conservative household and dropped out of Yale University to volunteer in Vietnam. Kuznick pointed out that several of Stone’s friends from the war claim that he even saved their lives. 
In regards to handling criticism, Stone said he is “empathetic towards these political figures, not sympathetic…and there’s a difference.”
The project was important to Stone because he “felt the urge to do something while [he] is still alive.”
“Only 12 percent of Americans are proficient in U.S. history, and the little that people do know, it’s often wrong,” Kuznick said. “That’s what we’re trying to combat.”
“It’s better to know the truth before you die,” Stone said, “or at least some version that’s a little closer to the truth.”

2012-11-13,AU,Democrat,"Any movie directed and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg is going to carry high expectations on its shoulders.
“Lincoln,” Spielberg’s latest creation, is an epic movie chronicling President Abraham Lincoln’s time in the White House in January 1865, just months before the end of the Civil War. The focus of the film revolves around the vote on the 13th Amendment, the abolishment of slavery, in the House of Representatives and Lincoln deciding whether or not to negotiate with Confederate delegates to end the war immediately. The question about which to do may seem obvious in hindsight, but its complexity becomes apparent while watching, leaving even the viewer conflicted.
The complexity of the situation becomes apparent to the viewer while watching how Lincoln handles himself and his decisions. Lincoln is played by renowned actor Daniel Day-Lewis (“There Will Be Blood”). Day-Lewis’ portrayal of Lincoln is superb: brutally honest and humorous, yet soft-spoken and good-natured. Having a British actor playing one of America’s most iconic and well-known people, let alone presidents, is a risky idea. But Day-Lewis lives up to Lincoln’s legacy.
The remainder of the star-studded cast lived up to their roles as well. Sally Field (“The Amazing Spider-Man”), who has acted in an array of award-winning films and television programs, plays Mary Todd Lincoln (Lincoln calls her Molly in the film). Field does a terrific job conveying the paranoid and deeply depressed feelings the former First Lady deals with daily after the death of her son Willy. Her depression adds to the realistic feel of the movie, particularly in scenes that show the interactions between Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln.
Another major character is House Representative Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones (the “Men in Black” series). Stevens, historically one of the most powerful Republicans during Lincoln’s time, is portrayed as a cynically funny and righteous leader, and the scenes depicting the relationship between Lincoln and Stevens are some of the most pivotal and well-remembered.  Unfortunately, the appearance of heartthrob Joseph Gordon-Levitt (“Looper”), playing Lincoln’s son Robert in the film, is short. With his name so high on the bill, one would expect him to be in the movie a bit more often. 
One of the more surprising elements of “Lincoln” is its humor. It is easy to forget how funny Lincoln was when his inspirational and thought-provoking speeches are the ones remembered in history (not that this is a bad thing in the least).
Also, Lincoln’s Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn, of the“Bourne” series) has some of the funniest lines of the movie, as do the men Seward hires to sway Democrats in the House into voting for the 13th Amendment. While the subject matter of the film is not funny in the least, Spielberg’s choice to lighten up the film was a good one because it keeps the viewer attentive throughout.
The film’s runtime, at two and a half hours, is a bit lengthy even for the most avid Lincoln fan. The lighting and the camerawork of the film were also questionable at times. Some of the scenes had buildings that looked too modern, and there were even instances where the weather changes drastically without an explanation.
The language used throughout the film was tremendously verbose, and the subject matter shared between delegates of the House of Representatives is not exactly common knowledge. These combined factors could potentially confuse the audience.
In the end, “Lincoln” is a film worth seeing for its historical significance and its honest look into the world of one of America’s most beloved presidents.

2012-12-11,AU,Democrat,"by Jonathan Miller
You may have more in common with your member of Congress than you think, especially around this time of year. Students and lawmakers alike want to finish up the year and head home for the holidays. But there’s a final exam standing between Congress and the holidays, and America’s citizens are ready to give the body an “F” if it doesn’t pass.
That exam is coming in the form of the “fiscal cliff” - the combination of arbitrary, automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases coming at the end of the year that could cripple the economy. It all started last year when Congress picked 12 of its members to try to find a deal to secure America’s long-term financial future. Consumer confidence had dropped dramatically, and a credit ratings agency dropped our country’s rating.
It seemed the only thing that could make members of both parties work across the aisle was an alternative so terrible it would be untenable to both parties.
That alternative is coming closer to reality, and unfortunately, it is your generation that will have to pay the highest price.
The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that if we do not avoid the fiscal cliff, the $7 trillion combination of spending cuts and tax increases could send the economy hurtling back into recession for years to come. Unemployment, especially among young people, will rise even further. Education will suffer among the harshest spending cuts, losing about $4.8 billion in funding.
Our leaders have had more than three years to address these issues. Imagine if you had that long to prepare for a test. Yet rather than hunkering down in the library, or in their case the Capitol Building, to solve this crisis, leaders of each side avoid meeting to talk about potential solutions.
We need real solutions. These solutions begin with both parties understanding they need to work together to stave off this crisis. No Labels, a growing grassroots movement of hundreds of thousands of Republicans, Democrats and independents is working to facilitate cooperation. Since last year, we’ve been advocating for leaders in all negotiations to put everything on the table and ensure all interested parties are at the table. You can be a part of this movement and sign on at NoLabels.org
These solutions can also help fix the underlying problem: the way Washington does business. We need to find real and permanent ways for our leaders to come together to govern for the future because our nation’s financial situation is not the only problem America faces. We need our leaders to come together and find solutions in immigration, energy and infrastructure policy. As Washington’s current stalemate has shown, we can’t afford to wait for Congress to find bold, pragmatic across-the-aisle solutions.
Changing Washington won’t happen quickly. But even you would have a hard time cramming three years' worth of work into one night. What we can do now is commit ourselves, and hold our elected officials accountable, to the idea that progress is only made when our common national interest is the priority. That is what No Labels is all about.

2013-03-07,AU,Democrat,"You gotta hand it to the Republicans: they’re the best politicians in town.
They figured out how to manufacture leverage — and use it, too. They’ve found their rhythm, and they sure are grooving to the beat of their own drum.
See, the plan goes something like this:
Allow President Ronald Reagan to quadruple the national debt, largely by increasing defense spending (against the USSR, which was crumbling from within).	
Let President George H. W. Bush continue such disastrous economic policies, and then turn tail and run from him when he suggests something as heinous as raising taxes to pay for his exploits (like that undeclared war).
And then, make the debt the defining issue of the 1992 campaign and, when the other side wins, pounce on the new Democratic president by saying he’s not doing enough to reduce the deficit.
Furthermore, use the deficit as a wedge issue to take back the House in the midterm elections, and force a series of budget cuts that send the president off-message and prevent him from investing in health care, education, science and technology.
Sound familiar? That’s because it is.	
History does in fact repeat itself, and the GOP response to President Barack Obama’s budget proposals is proof of this.
The GOP said nothing — nothing! — when President George W. Bush fought two wars, signed into law a costly expansion of Medicare and cut taxes all at the same time. He doubled the national debt in eight years.
But once Obama got elected, the debt was suddenly the biggest issue we had to address. Some even took to calling it a “national security issue” (kind of like how the USSR was a national security issue in 1984).
The best line yet was Gov. Mitt Romney’s “road to Greece” gimmick.
It is pathetically ironic that the very policies that put Greece “on the road to Greece” — not paying their debts (read: “not passing the debt ceiling”) and austerity (read: “drastic budget cuts”) – are the same policies Republicans are advocating.
In 2010, America elected a gang of lawmakers who don’t understand basic economics. Americans tricked into voting for these people on the basis of a mythical “national security issue.”
And these people are working against their voters’ interests, most recently by failing to stop the sequester.
For all their talk of “job creators” and the need for more businessmen in government, Republicans don’t seem to understand that a CEO can’t provide jobs for his employees if consumers don’t have the money to buy his product or houses to put it in.
Indeed, in a recession, the government is the single most important spender and investor, because it is the only entity that can spend and invest. It did so in 1932, and has done so in every recession ever since.       	
In reality, Republicans in Congress don’t want to solve our debt “problem.” Why would they want to give up prime leverage? If history is any guide, they’ll want to use it again when the next unassuming (Democrat) schmuck strolls down Pennsylvania Avenue.        
The sequester, which Macroeconomic Advisers LLC estimates will ultimately cost 700,000 American jobs, is just the latest riff in the GOP’s tempo.        
It provided the GOP’s desired endgame: instead of talking about how to invest in our children’s future or repair our disintegrating infrastructure, we’re talking about which programs – like Social Security and Medicare – can be cut.        
So, the next time you enter the voting booth, remember that it’s not the deficit. It’s a game of political musical chairs, and it matters a helluva lot who sits in the chairs and who plays the music.

2013-03-07,AU,Democrat,"March 3 marked an important day for Kenyans. It was the day of the anxiously anticipated and crucial presidential election. This was Kenya’s first presidential vote since 2007, when evidence of vote rigging set off ethnic clashes and violence that killed over 1,000 people across the country.
I visited Kenya for the first time this January. While the elections were only two months away, there was a tension present in Nairobi. The bustling city was covered with presidential propaganda — billboards, posters and graffiti everywhere. 
At the embassy, where my father works, anticipation was also high. Not only was the outcome of the elections crucial for future U.S.–Kenya relations, but the threat of violence was also a concern among American diplomats. 
Throughout our trip, my father often asked Kenyans what their opinion was about the upcoming election. While emotions ranged from hopeful to worried, the one thing they all shared in common was a need to vote. 
One taxi driver told us that he would need to take at least three matatus (privately owned and crowded minibuses) to get to his voting location, while others would venture home to their own polling place  outside of downtown Nairobi to cast their ballots. 
When he asked me if everyone in the U.S. voted during the re-election, he was shocked when I told him many American’s don’t vote. He joked that Kenya was more of a democracy than the U.S. 
That got me thinking: is there truth behind that statement?
Kenya’s government is far from perfect. Uhuru Kenyatta has held a commanding lead of 40 percent to 55 percent over the second-place candidate, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s prime minister. Kenyatta has been accused by the International Criminal Court of financing death squads. 
However, Kenya is one of the most industrialized and democratic countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and this year’s election is the most complicated in its history. New positions have been created to change the winner-takes-all nature of Kenyan politics. These include governorships, Senate seats and even female county representatives. 
While many Kenyans still vote along ethnic lines, civic groups have tried to make this election about issues, integrity and plans, not ethnic groups. 
While their democracy and government may not be perfect, the election has impressed me and demonstrated a true desire for peace, stability and democracy. 
Like in the U.S., Kenyans are not required to vote. However, voter turnout on March 4 was tremendous, starting hours before dawn with lines of voters stretching nearly a mile long. In Nairobi’s Kibera slum, people waited nine hours on their feet to cast their vote. 
Voting was peaceful, albeit for some isolated violence on the coast but nothing compared to the riots of 2007.
While Kenya still has a long way to go in terms of ethnic tension and government, we Americans, who complain when we have to wait in line to vote and often don’t take advantage of the privilege we have, can learn from Kenyan citizens. 
The right to vote is one of the most sacred we have. While people flooding the polls in Kenya might not mean that this particular election is corruption-free and perfect, it shows that they want change and to take part of their government. Can we say the same here, where a color divide led many to not even vote? 
Only time will tell what Kenya’s fate is, or if the predicted victory of Kenyatta will spark violence. However, Kenyans are headed in the right direction, and their determination will take them far. 
Let’s hope Americans will one day also have the determination to wait in line, want to vote and celebrate a privilege many do not have.

2014-02-13,AU,Democrat,"D.C. mayoral candidates who participated in a debate at AU pose for a picture on Feb. 12.
Candidates for D.C. mayor took center stage to discuss issues such as adequate education, job growth and gentrification at a debate at Katzen Arts Center Feb. 12. The event was hosted by the Kennedy Political Union. 
D.C. Councilmembers Jack Evans (Ward 2), Tommy Wells (Ward 6) and Vincent Orange (Ward 5), as well as former State Department special representative and AU alumna Reta Jo Lewis, community activists Andy Shallal and Carlos Allen are vying for the Democratic Party nomination. The election is slated for April 1. 
As the candidates offered their vision for the city’s future, nearly all touched on the failed leadership of incumbent mayor Vincent Gray, who is currently facing allegations of running a “shadow campaign” that illegally funneled money for his 2010 mayoral campaign, according to an ABC report. 
“We’re distracted with so many other issues,” Shallal, the founder of Busboys and Poets, said. “The corruption, the shadow campaign and all these things, it’s really hard to focus on the issue of statehood.” 
Both Gray and Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser did not show up to the debate. Bowser had a community event and could not attend, a staffer said after the debate. 
Candidates sparred over a marijuana decriminalization bill that would transition possession from a criminal charge to a $25 civil fine for up to an ounce of marijuana while lowering public smoking sentences to just 65 days. 
Wells, who authored the bill, said approximately 90 percent of all marijuana-related arrests are of African-American men, a crime which may hinder their ability to find jobs or housing in the future. 
“Decrim is just the first step,” Wells said. “It’s a smart thing to do, it’s a matter of social justice, and that’s what we need to do.”
Orange said he believes the bill is flawed because it fails to address work drug testing and urged the council to reconsider. 
Evans also pledged his support for decriminalizing possession, but disagreed with Well’s efforts to decriminalize public smoking altogether.
“Most people we talk to just didn’t want to see that happen,” Evans said of public smoking. “I believe decriminalizing marijuana like we did is a step toward legalizing it.” 
Candidates also discussed how to better include college students in the fabric of the city. Both Lewis and Wells supported a loan-forgiveness program that would help retain young talent in the city after graduation.
“If you are out there being the activist you always have been, I want to make sure you have a path to go help our young people, go help our non-profits, go help our elderly,” Lewis said. “We should be assisting you as you assist the citizens of the District of Columbia.” 
As the city balances economic growth and preserving cultural heritage, nearly all candidates agreed that housing prices were too steep and threatened historic communities. The city has veered from its plan to expand affordable housing to tens of thousands of people, Orange said.
“We’re a $12 billion organization, we have $1.7 billion in our rainy day fund, we’re coming off a $320 million surplus, and we project a surplus for the next five years,” Orange said about D.C. government funds. “The money is there, take care and do the job we said that we were going to do.”

2014-08-12,AU,Democrat,"Current Political Communication students surround former SOC professor Dotty Lynch.
Dotty Lynch, a School of Communication executive in residence and prominent figure in the D.C. political scene, passed away early Sunday evening at a D.C. hospital.
The recently retired 69-year-old passed away after complications from melanoma, according to a Washington Post article. 
Lynch made an impact in Washington as one of the first pollsters to introduce the gender gap issue to political office hopefuls. In the mid 1980s, Lynch analyzed national politics as CBS News’ political editor, according to Lynch’s SOC faculty page.
After a career advising White House hopefuls, a Kennedy administration, surveying for the Democratic National Convention and working with CBS News, Lynch joined SOC’s faculty in 2006. Lynch merged politics and communication in the classroom and became instrumental in the creation of the SOC and School of Public Affairs masters in Public Communication program, Rose Ann Robertson, SOC’s associate dean for academic administration, said.
Robertson recognized how Lynch’s expertise and versatility became essential as a professor.
“Dotty was one of a kind,” Robertson said. “She was a journalist, a pollster, a political analyst and an extraordinary teacher. She conveyed to her students the excitement about the political process that she felt every day.”
Lynch’s passing was met with a Twitter outpouring in remembrance. Bob Schieffer, Diane Sawyer and Gwen Ifill were among the famous names that gave their condolences.
RIP Dotty Lynch, as smart as she was good as she was generous to all of us in and around politics. #wayfarertoast

2016-01-12,AU,Democrat,"Vincent Gray (courtesy Gray 2014 campaign).

	If former mayor Vincent Gray runs for the D.C. Council this year, a new poll shows he has a strong shot at winning either the at-large or Ward 7 seats that are up for grabs.

	Thirty-two percent of Democratic primary voters citywide said they would vote for Gray, giving him a 12 percent lead over incumbent at-large Councilmember Vincent Orange. Further worrisome for Orange is that 4 in 10 residents responding in the same poll said they have an unfavorable opinion of him, with 28 percent favoring him.

	Meanwhile, if Gray runs in his home turf of Ward 7, he would beat incumbent and former political pal Yvette Alexander. The poll showed Gray currently holding 48 percent support, with Alexander at 32 percent. A third candidate, activist Ed Potillo, placed with 6 percent, and 14 percent of residents remained unsure.

	Supporters of Gray funded the poll through a political action committee headed by Gray’s 2014 campaign manager, Chuck Thies. The PAC raised $7,920, with all money raised going to expenses related to the poll, according to Thies, and is no longer accepting donations. The poll, conducted by the firm 
	Public Policy Polling, interviewed 1,569 likely Democratic primary voting Washingtonians between Jan. 5 and Jan. 7, according to a press release.



	Poll of citywide likely Democratic primary voters in potential at-large race.




	Poll of Ward 7 likely Democratic voters in potential ward race.

	The results are a sure boost to Gray, who has openly been 
	mulling a return to politics since the federal investigation into his successful 2010 mayoral campaign ended. That legal cloud hung over Gray’s entire mayoral term, and many say it led to his downfall in his reelection bid against current mayor Muriel Bowser in 2014.

	In December, U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips announced his office would close the nearly five-year long probe without charging the former mayor on allegations that he knew of an 
	illegal shadow campaign. Businessman Jeffrey Thompson pleaded guilty in March 2014 to secretly funnelling $653,000 to aid Gray’s campaign and said Gray knew about it. However, prosecutors were unable to bring a charge against the mayor proving he had such knowledge.

	In a statement following the U.S. Attorney’s decision on Dec. 10, 2015, Gray said, “Justice delayed is justice denied, but I cannot change history. I look forward to getting on with the next chapter of my life, which will no doubt be dedicated to service.”

2016-03-12,AU,Democrat,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a crowd of AU students, staff and international media in the School of International Service Atrium on Friday morning that young people need to challenge the status quo if they hope to see change in the world.
“[Current leaders] need you to be thinking and challenging us about why we’re doing this, why we’re doing that, why we’re not doing this, how we’re doing this differently, and that doesn’t just mean speaking up,” Trudeau said. “It also means getting involved. It also means understanding that your voices are an essential part of the mix to challenge us to think about your future.”
Trudeau’s stop at AU came as part of a larger trip to Washington D.C., the first by a Canadian Prime Minister in 19 years. Earlier during his visit, Trudeau spent time with President Barack Obama at the White House, attended a State Dinner studded with appearances by politicians, celebrities and entrepreneurs and paid respects at Arlington National Cemetery.
Since his election in October 2015, Trudeau has committed his time in office to implementing his liberal ideals in Canadian policy. Trudeau became the first Prime Minister to have gender parity in his Cabinet when he chose 13 men and 13 women to fill the roles. He is also well-known for labeling himself as a feminist and supporting his stance on the issue by saying, “Because it’s 2015,” last year.
“There are lots of extraordinary women standing up for women’s rights, but I need more men to do that. It’s fighting for rights, it’s fighting for equality, it’s fighting for basic respect, and I keep having to update this, but it’s 2016 guys,” Trudeau said at today’s event.
Additionally, Trudeau discussed his commitment to take action against climate change which he also shared with Obama during their meeting yesterday.
“That idea of giving up on economic progress to protect the environment no longer makes sense because the only way we’re going to build a strong, sustainable economy is by cherishing ecosystem services and natural resources that underpin everything else,” Trudeau said.
In light of the current election cycle occurring in the United States, Trudeau said he was not concerned about an influx of Americans immigrating to Canada should people disagree with the United States’s next president and said that he would be willing to work with the person ultimately elected. He also commented on Canada’s recent decision to end its role in bombing ISIS, choosing instead to send in ground troops to help civilians build the ability to support themselves. Trudeau said that this type of diplomacy work is essential to creating long-term security and is something Canada can offer.
During his speech, Trudeau also called for a greater appreciation for diversity and creating opportunities for all kinds of people to succeed as important to developing the economy. He said that in the past, many people’s careers had a linear trajectory, but that isn’t the case today.
“Right now the career paths that we’re going to have will jump around everywhere. I mean, it’s preposterous to think that a former snowboard instructor and nightclub bouncer could end up the Prime Minister of Canada,” Trudeau said, poking fun at his own path to becoming the Prime Minister. “But the experiences we accumulate along the way of multiple career paths and multiple engagements that define us and shape us as individuals and leaders are extremely important and extremely varied and that’s one of the really exciting things for me about this generation.”
Trudeau said that he built his campaign to office based on a pure idealization of what Canadian citizens hoped their government to be, including openness and cooperation, and he plans to keep his promises and maintain Canada’s relationship with the United States.
“People need to understand that the rights and freedoms that keep us free and democratic societies aren’t always easy, aren’t always sort of knee-jerk, adapted to how we’d like the world to be, but they are essential in terms of being the countries we are,” Trudeau said.

2016-08-09,AU,Democrat,"AU alum Sarah McBride speaks at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. 
This year’s Democratic National Convention was significant in more ways than one. Just hours before Hillary Clinton became the first woman to accept a major party’s nomination for president, AU alum Sarah McBride carved out her own place in history, becoming the first openly transgender person to speak at a national political convention on July 28. 
McBride’s journey to the convention stage included a term as SG president from 2011-2012. She credits her transition from Tim to Sarah, which she publicly announced in an Eagle op-ed at the end of her presidency, as the beginning of her life as her “authentic self.” Just over four years later, the Democratic LGBT Caucus honored the 25-year-old with a national platform to share her story -- an experience she called a “whirlwind.” 
“I was mostly nervous about making sure that I did the transgender community proud, that I did right by them,” McBride told the Eagle on the Monday following her speech. “Obviously, no one trans person is a reflection of an entire community, but I did hope that I represented them well.”
McBride said she aimed to accomplish two goals with her speech: humanize the transgender community and educate the public on “what it’s like to be transgender.” With just one week to prepare, McBride placed her personal story within the broader context of the election, urging viewers to support Clinton’s candidacy for president. 
“I wanted to make sure I underscored the humanity of this issue,” McBride said. “I think so often transgender people feel unseen and are treated as though they are unworthy and unvalued.”
McBride began her political career in Delaware. She worked on Gov. Jack Markell’s bid for governor and the late Beau Biden’s two campaigns for attorney general. At the time, she believed that her passion for politics and her gender identity were “mutually exclusive.” This made life as her “authentic self” incompatible with her dreams, something that quickly changed after she came out. 
“I think people so often think, ‘oh, well, no one wants to hear from me and my story’ or ‘my voice isn’t important,’’” McBride said on coming out at AU. “But it is, and it really can make a difference.”  
She later became the first transgender person to intern at the White House and graduated from the School of Public Affairs in 2013 with a degree in political science. The most emotional moment of her speech, however, wasn’t about her transition, her political career or her internship. It was McBride’s reflection on her marriage to Andrew Cray, a transgender man, in 2014. He died of a terminal illness five days after their wedding. Her Huffington Post essay chronicles her relationship with Cray -- one that she said fuels her advocacy for transgender equality.
“For me, his death really underscored the urgency of this fight,” McBride said. “There’s a whole host of unfinished work for trans people and for LGBTQ people.”
At the age of 25, her passion for politics and her gender identity has merged seamlessly into a nationally recognized persona. She told The Eagle that the media attention hasn’t stopped since the start of the convention -- something she’d never imagined possible just four years ago when she came out at AU.
“I think it has been a testament to how things have changed and the goodness of people that the response of those in the arena and from the audience at home has been overwhelmingly positive,” McBride said.  
McBride recently became the National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group in D.C. She’s working toward electing Hillary Clinton in November and believes that all universities, like AU, must implement non-discrimination protections to shield transgender students from prejudice.
“We need to push those [schools] forward so that no student fears discrimination or harassment or bullying simply because of who they are,” McBride said.

2016-09-13,AU,Democrat,"Last Thursday, Student Government launched the AU TurboVote campaign in an effort to register every student to vote in time for the general election in November.  
SG is relaunching its partnership with TurboVote, a national platform specifically aimed at young people with the goal of increasing their civic engagement. 
After signing up online, the TurboVote application provides individualized information and updates for upcoming elections, voter registration and absentee ballots.
“The AU TurboVote campaign is one of the most ambitious voter registration plans ever in a college across the country,” said Valeria Ojeda-Avitia, Director of the Kennedy Political Union and coordinator of AU TurboVote.
The campaign has 25 campus partners, including the Undergraduate Business Association, the Interfraternity Council and the Intercultural Greek Collective, with the intention to expand, according to Ojeda-Avitia. TurboVote is also committed to non-partisanship, and the campaign is collaborating with both the AU College Democrats and AU College Republicans. 
“Voting is one of the most important facets of being an American citizen, and AUCRs is proud to do its part in encouraging civic duty by participating,” President of AU College Republicans Tom Herbert said.
The campaign will be tabling on campus throughout September, with heightened campaign efforts expected on National Voter Registration Day, scheduled on Sept. 27. 
Individuals can access TurboVote online, and can also become an AU TurboVote Ambassador and help spread the message. Ambassadors work to register voters and visit AU clubs and Greek life organizations to help groups register, according to TurboVote Ambassador Yazan Hanouneh.
""I became a TurboVote ambassador to ensure that every AU student has the opportunity to vote even while they're far from home,” Hanouneh said. “Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or something else, it is important to be civically engaged and participate in the system of democracy that keeps our nation running. In the end, this work is worth it since we'll have a more representative government that all students will feel like they helped elect.""

2017-01-11,AU,Democrat,"This article originally appeared in The Eagle’s December 9 print edition.
Looking back on this election, it has been a rough year and a half to be a Republican woman. Facing ridicule from every side, listening to your party’s nominee criticize women and trying to choose between compromising your values and voting for necessary change at the ballot box was maddening.
However, it is over now. The next President of the United States will be Donald Trump, and it is time for the nation to face that reality and move forward with a positive agenda for change.
Although I did not vote for or support Donald Trump during his presidential run, I wish him the best in office and I truly hope he governs well. Praying for his failure at this point does not hurt his reputation, but the American people as a whole. That is why we must be cautiously optimistic: we must support him and guide him on a path toward righteousness while at the same time be willing to criticize his administration when necessary.
Further, President-elect Trump will be complemented by both a Republican House and Senate, not to mention 33 Republican governors, 26 states under the control of both GOP executive and legislative branches and six state legislatures controlled by Republicans with Democratic governors. This is the GOP’s moment, and the party must deliver if it wants to maintain and grow party support in 2018 and 2020.
To do this, I recommend the following conservative policy proposals to limit government power, control spending, cut government waste and prove that success can be achieved under a Republican government.
Step 1: Reform the criminal justice system
One of the most corrupt institutions in American government is the criminal justice system. It is designed to over-incarcerate low-level, nonviolent offenders. Upon leaving prison, these offenders cannot successfully find a job due to their criminal records and become dependent on less-than-legal means to make ends meet. Often, they are reincarcerated and enter a viscous cycle known as “recidivism.” 
This issue disproportionately impacts minority groups, and it must be stopped. Moreover, the entire system costs a tremendous amount of unnecessary tax dollars (an additional $42 million in 2017 from FY2016) and needs to be consolidated and reformed immediately. To address these issues, a bi-partisan coalition of representatives has already proposed several bills to reform them.
Another way to improve the criminal justice system would be to expand programs that assist ex-felons in finding jobs after leaving prison. Companies like Apple, Hilton Hotels and Chick-fil-A hire returning citizens to begin reintegrating former felons into society. By using public-private partnerships with these and other companies and vocational organizations, the government can prevent the cycle of incarceration from continuing to plague our system, destroy the family and consume our tax dollars. 
Step 2: Simplify the tax code and loosen ridiculous regulations
There are areas in Trump’s tax proposal where taxes among certain higher-level income groups will be higher than under Clinton’s plan, according to the Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a center-left tax policy group. This is significant because Clinton claimed she would use taxes to crack down on the upper class.
Scholar Leonard Burman notes, “Trump’s 33 percent top rate kicks in at a fairly low income level for singles: $127,500 in 2017.” The Trump tax plan could generate more levels of revenue. It would remove personal exemptions and tax breaks which would consolidate the current 74,608-page-long federal code, making it more fair. If he implements this plan, it will cut the burden of taxpayers while not letting off the wealthier economic groups from contributing a sizable amount of income in taxes. 
It would also consolidate and simplify the tax code. By simplifying the code, this would allow Americans to better understand how the federal government collects tax dollars. If Trump goes through with implementing this plan, it would save Americans a lot of time, money and headaches trying to understand all the loopholes and tax breaks in the system of which big businesses take advantage.
Step 3: Create an environment inclusive to all Americans
Often, the political left claims that the GOP is waging a “war on women.” However, 42 percent of Donald Trump’s voters were women, especially college-educated white women, 49 percent of which voted for the billionaire. This happened despite Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emphasis on Trump’s history of bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monumental question is why these women still voted for him, and unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll have an answer until we actually ask these voters. Usually, these types of allegations kill political careers, such as was the case with Anthony Weiner. And yet, it has not derailed Trump.
The GOP needs to emphasize the benefits of limited government for minorities. While protections are necessary to ensure that discrimination is prevented, all people can be most empowered by freedom, not the state. The GOP has this platform, but it does not use it. To better project this ideal, Republicans should be more open to comprehensive immigration reform that opens the door to increasing legal immigration. Further, women could greatly benefit from voluntary Personal Care Accounts that encourage financial saving for leave time. Pre-tax dollars would be saved in this PCA, and it would be used to replace or supplement income during periods of leave. This would help the problem of paid leave or medical issues. Women and minorities in the GOP also need to be louder and prouder, stand up in the name of limited government and run for office.
Although I remain cautiously optimistic, I truly hope that the Trump administration is successful in its endeavors-not just for Republicans, but for all Americans. If he fails, we will all have to live with the consequences.

2017-03-10,AU,Democrat,"Former Sen. Russ Feingold and SIS Dean James Goldgeier in an interview entitled “The Undermining of the Legitimacy of the American Government"" on March 1. 
Students and faculty came together in the Abramson Family Founders Room where SIS Dean James Goldgeier welcomed special guest, former Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, as part of the Dean’s Discussion series on March 1. Each semester, Dean Goldgeier invites an expert to campus so they can have a one-on-one interview discussing critical topics relating to international affairs. 
Senator Feingold was a Democratic senator for 18 years. He is most well known for having a strong code of ethics and for being vocal on sensitive issues, at times when other senators were working in opposition to his views. He was the only senator who voted against the PATRIOT Act when it was first proposed in 2001. 
Feingold recently joined the AU community as a distinguished executive in residence. In this role he will teach a series of spring courses in a SIS skills institute, which is meant to introduce students more to the professional world of international service. His course is titled “Diplomatic Challenges and Skills: Case Study—Great Lakes Region of Africa,” and it regards conflicts that occurred throughout the past two decades within the African Great Lake Region, as well as Feingold's own unique perspective regarding American International Affairs with the region. 
The title of the Dean’s discussion was “The Undermining of the Legitimacy of the American Government.” The format of the talk included a 30-minute interview between Goldgeier and Feingold, followed by a half-hour of open questions from the students to Feingold.
Goldgeier began the interview by asking Feingold about what he had tried to do for Wisconsin in his almost two decades as its representative. 
“I've made a career as a senator going to all 72 counties in the state every year and having a town meeting,” Feingold said. “I want to talk to everyone, whether the county has just 4,000 people, or many times more.” 
Following this, Goldgeier asked Feingold what he foresees political campaigns will look like in the future and what problems he has seen arise after the most recent election season, regarding flaws in the voting system itself, and flaws regarding the legality of certain campaigning measured.
The senator said there are four main areas of campaigning that need huge reform: the right to vote, campaign finance, the electoral college and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“An institution of massive concern is the electoral college,” he said, “Two out of the last three presidents didn't win nearly enough votes to get elected but they kept the position anyways.”
After discussing the parts of campaigns that were troubling to him, the senator and the dean talked about the recent presidential election.
“Trump is a big problem,” Feingold said. “The attack of his on the media is really disturbing. We have to protect these institutions. When the president of the United States says the press, the media, is the enemy of people, we have to draw the line.”
Following the interview, many students lined up to ask questions. One question came from Alex de Ramon, a freshman in SIS, who asked Feingold about the path the Democrats should take in the 2018 and 2020 election.
“The hardcore direct talk of Trump appealed to some people,” Feingold said. “I just don't how some people could vote for him after some of the stuff that he has said. Going forward, I think that it would be a huge mistake for the Democrats to try to be a middle party. We need to make a strong message about our democracy.”

2017-03-11,AU,Democrat,"Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., addresses students at an event co-sponsored by the Kennedy Political Union and AU College Democrats.
At 70-years-old, African-American Congresswoman Barbara Lee still hopes to “save the world.” The representative of the 13th district in California spoke in honor of Women’s History Month on Thursday night at an event arranged by AU College Democrats and the Kennedy Political Union. 
Lee was born in a segregated city, El Paso, Texas, in 1946. She said she remembers the days when abortions weren’t safe or legal, and when white people wouldn’t sell or rent homes to black people.
Lee, however, was not always politically active. As a young woman, she refused to register to vote.
“I said no, I’m a revolutionary,” Lee said.
Lee enrolled in Mills College with two small children, on public assistance, to study social work. As a community worker with the Black Panther caucus, Lee invited Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to congress, to speak. Chisholm, dismayed by Lee’s skepticism, urged her to “bring a folding chair to the table,” and register to vote.
“She said no, you’ve gotta get on the inside,” Lee said, who went on to work for Chisholm’s historic presidential campaign in 1972.
Lee attributes her strength to her “very modest, very matter of factly,” activist mother -- the first of twelve students integrated into the University of Texas at El Paso.
“She said… don’t you dare think you’re not as good as another guy,” Lee said. “You’d better fight to let them know you’re here to stay.”
Congresswoman Lee arrived an hour late to the event because she was held up by a vote in the House of Representatives.
“This is what happens on Capitol Hill: you get late votes,” Lee said. “Thank goodness we got out!”
Most students waited the extra hour, eager to hear the congresswoman speak.
“If everyone was more like Lee, the world would be a better place,” AU senior Nick Guthman said.
Lee advised students to follow their conscience, and to know their “bottom line.”
For Lee, that’s war. She made a name for herself as the sole representative to vote against the Iraq War in 2001. Lee has continued to rally against war to this day.  
Sophomore Shaan Chilukuri pointed to Lee’s pattern of voting against the status quo, like the Patriot Act of 2001, as proof of her “anti-establishment, trailblazing” political style. 
“The military has enough money,” Lee said. “They’re wasting it. They want more funds to take it away from schools and education to build more missiles and more bombs. That’s not how you create world peace.”
Lee has also co-sponsored legislation to create a U.S. Department of Peace. The legislation, which has accrued 30 co-sponsors, would examine alternatives to war and violence.
“We have a Department of War, why not have a Department of Peace?” Lee said. 
In terms of the new administration, Lee was irate. She dismissed Paul Ryan’s knowledge of healthcare and criticized President Donald Trump’s plan to cut foreign aid by 36 percent. 
“I see what this Trump administration is doing, trying to roll back all of the gains that my mother and my grandfather and my ancestors fought for,” Lee said. “We’re not gonna let that happen.”

2017-05-09,AU,Democrat,"AU alumna and Peace Corps volunteer Katherin Sibel with students in Paraguay.
AU alumna Katherin Sibel spends her days speaking Guarani, the national language of Paraguay. That’s where she’s stationed as a Peace Corps volunteer, managing several women’s agribusiness projects and social development programs within the Latin American community. 
In February, the Peace Corps named AU a top provider of volunteers from medium-sized schools. Sibel, who graduated from the School of International Service in 2015, is one of 54 from AU serving in the Peace Corps right now.
In fact, AU has indoctrinated Peace Corps’ mission within the classroom since the early 1960s, and continues to do so today.
“As a volunteer, I find myself doing various activities throughout the weeks with different peoples and groups in the community,” Sibel said in an email. “This ranges from planting in gardens and farms, trash cleanups, teaching English and other skills needed with Paraguayans of all ages.”
Twenty-two of the 54 representing AU are education volunteers, and 13 are health volunteers, Emily Webb, Public Affairs Specialist at Peace Corps, said in an email. Others are serving as agriculture, youth development, or community and economic development volunteers. 
Revisiting a focus on undergraduates
Although AU has historically produced high numbers of Peace Corps volunteers, in February 2016, without a clear explanation as to why, Peace Corps decided to end its master’s international degree program, which AU offered through SIS. 
Numerous undergraduates have asked Stephen Angelsmith, Director of Peace Corps Programs at SIS, over his five years with AU about how they can get involved as a volunteer.
Over the last two years, the Peace Corps and SIS developed a new certificate program, the Peace Corps Prep, to give undergraduates a pathway to the Peace Corps, Angelsmith said. 
“The new certificate program is a series of courses, that at the end of graduation, you will also earn a Peace Corps Prep certificate,” Angelsmith said. “It’s a social organization to prepare students for international service.” 
Twelve undergraduate SIS students started the certificate program in February, while about 35 students applied. Ideally, the students should apply at the beginning of their sophomore year. However, all grade levels are encouraged to apply since much of the course work in SIS already crosses over into the certificate’s requirements, Angelsmith said.
Having the certificate is not a guarantee for acceptance into the organization, but going through the series of courses at SIS will greatly improve a student’s chance for being accepted, Webb said.
Angelsmith, who served in Turkmenistan 10 years ago and is now a returned volunteer, said the certificate is a shared experience of coursework and service. Furthermore, the new curriculum provides SIS undergraduates with professional skills and intercultural competencies to possibly join the Peace Corps after graduation, Angelsmith said.
Designed for SIS undergraduate students, he said the certificate will broaden students’ education and experience so that they may implant creative, individual development projects across the globe. 
Opposing opinions 
However, not all faculty and students are fond of the Peace Corps.
AU Professor Daniel Esser said that he and many of his students have mixed opinions about the usefulness of the program. Some see value in the grassroots approach of the Peace Corps’ mission, while others see the Peace Corps as more beneficial to the volunteer than the host country, he said.
For that, Esser agrees.  
Esser said that he’s seen little evidence that Peace Corps volunteers substantially help with development efforts for other countries. By design, the program is not at all sustainable, he said, because the volunteer arrives, works on a project, and then leaves. There may be exceptions, but not much, he said. 
“The stereotypical volunteer is a Democrat, middle-class white person,” he said. “And at twenty-two years old, we’re sending fairly skill-less volunteers.” 
Angelsmith said he is aware of what dissenters say about sending over wealthier volunteers, as opposed to those in lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Since the Peace Corps is unpaid, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may not be able to volunteer, or feel as though they have access to the program, Angelsmith said, because of the loss of income over two years. 
However, he said the Peace Corps offers benefits that fray the costs of being away from home. 
“Peace Corps volunteers are not being paid a salary at home, but you have health insurance and student loans can be deferred,” he said. “The Peace Corps pays for everything while you are volunteering.”
Another aspect for future volunteers to consider is how much time they are away from family and friends, Angelsmith said. 
Sibel, who will be closing service on Dec. 7 of this year, said that social media has helped her stay connected with family and friends at home, if internet service is available.
Her advice for new Peace Corps volunteers is to take full advantage of being immersed in a new culture and country. 
“When you first get into your site, enjoy making connections for the first few months or year,” Sibel said. “Get to know the people, and get into the language, culture, and community vibe. The more vulnerable you are in sharing with the community that is hosting you, the more at home you will feel.”

2017-07-10,AU,Democrat,"Valentina Fernández, student trustee, Neil Kerwin, former University president, and Shyheim Snead, former student trustee. 
Rising junior Valentina Fernández is sitting in a conference room inside the President’s Office Building, awaiting the next Board of Trustees meeting. Although she is surrounded by influential university donors and decision makers, she doesn’t shy away from sharing her ideas and upholds herself with the professionalism she learned from being a student government senator.
As the first Latinx student trustee, Fernández is determined to make her voice heard on behalf of the student body.
“I couldn’t believe that I got the position, honestly,” Fernández said. “I knew it was something I wanted and felt prepared, but there was still that sense of, ‘Am I qualified enough to do this?’”
Fernández is the first Latinx student trustee on the University’s board of trustees, a position she assumed on May 18. She brings to the role stints as vice president of AU College Democrats and financial services director under former SG President Devontae Torriente, and plans to bring new insight into the role from her previous experience in AUSG and AU College Democrats.
She decided to get involved with the Board of Trustees last year after she reached out to Shyheim Snead, the previous student trustee. He told her about his experiences on the Board, such as interviewing candidates for the 15th University president and educating the campus on how the Board of Trustees functions. 
Fernández soon realized that their interests aligned and she felt that this position would be a perfect fit for her.
“The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this is the place for me,” Fernández said. “I think it was a good way to combine my knowledge of campus culture and my involvement that I had learned from other leadership roles into helping the university in the long term.”
Snead then became Fernández’s mentor, teaching her about how the University functions and watching board meetings on the major issues that the AU community faces. Serving a student trustee is a two-year commitment: Fernández spent the past year shadowing Snead before assuming the role herself on May 18. 
Fernández said his influence set the standard for how to behave on the Board and how to speak with eloquence on behalf of students.  He also showed her that the position is much different from a student government role in that although she speaks on behalf of students, she also has to think about the University’s best interests from the administration’s perspective.
Snead said he was fortunate to have mentored Fernández and appreciated her hard work and dedication. 
“Valentina brought with her a host of on campus experiences and connections that have informed her views and will undoubtedly serve her well in the boardroom,” Snead said in an email.
Upon becoming student trustee, Fernández said she worried that she wasn’t qualified enough to work with the influential alumni, donors and CEOs on the Board, but to her surprise, they made her feel welcome and took her ideas seriously. 
“I think that once I stepped foot into the position, I was really overwhelmed but surprised at the same time because I think it was the first time that I was exposed to a room of that many influential people,” Fernández said.
As student trustee, she plans to facilitate more discussions between students and the Board. She believes that by using social media to promote Board activities, hosting coffee talks with student leaders and notifying students when trustees are on campus, she can make the position more transparent and increase communication between students and the administration.
“I think there’s a big disconnect about what students think the Board is doing and what the Board thinks students are doing, and that’s where a bunch of miscommunication happens,” Fernández said. “I think when students have someone that represents them on the Board, they are more willing to listen to what’s going on and understand how things are being broken down.”
As the first Latinx person to assume the position, Fernández plans to contribute ideas from her personal experiences to the Board. Fernández said race has become the largest issue on campus, following a series of racist incidents targeting black women last September and again in May.
She believes that it is her responsibility to offer new ideas that would not have been included if she wasn’t a Latinx person. 
“When my identity comes into play, what can I contribute to the conversations that are happening?” Fernández said. “When can I speak up, especially when it comes to conversations on race?”
Snead, who is African-American, is confident that Fernández will represent her community while heightening the accessibility of the role.
“It is my hope and confidence that she will work to strengthen the bridge between students and the Board of Trustees, both in terms of transparency, information and accessibility,” Snead said.

2017-09-12,AU,Democrat,"Activist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai will speak at AU on Sept. 25 in Bender Arena. 
The Kennedy Political Union has named Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist, the 2017 Wonk of the Year. She will speak in Bender Arena on  Sept. 25, beginning at 8:15 p.m., according to a KPU press release.
Yousafzai is from northern Pakistan and was shot by the Taliban when she was 15 years old while coming home from school. Once she recovered, she traveled the globe as an advocate for girls’ education. 
She was named one of “The 100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine and released her best-selling book, “I Am Malala"" in 2013. In 2014, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.
“Malala is internationally known for her courage and advancing the right of everyone to receive an education,” Shyheim Snead, director of Kennedy Political Union, said in a statement. “She is one of the most inspirational and influential leaders of our generation and embodies the integrity and values that the community aims to achieve.”
KPU will offer free tickets for students on Eventbrite at the following times:
The event, which is co-sponsored by the Muslim Student Association and Women's Initiative, will be presented and moderated by University President Sylvia Burwell. Yousafzai is the fifth recipient of the Wonk of the Year award, with former Democratic National Convention chairwoman Donna Brazile taking the prize in 2016. 
Wonk of the Year is given to someone who demonstrates ""engagement, focus, intelligence and passion,"" according to the KPU release. The event was pushed back to the fall semester after KPU faced scheduling conflicts in April. 
“It is truly an honor to host Malala Yousafzai on our campus,” Burwell said in a statement. “She’s an incredibly brave individual with demonstrated commitment to meaningful change … The AU community is excited to celebrate her courageous and remarkable story.”

American University ranks as the university with the most politically active students, according to Princeton Review’s yearly rankings.  
Princeton Review, a college admission services company, ranked the university as No. 1 in the category, based on student ratings of their own levels of political awareness, according to the organization’s website. Last year, AU ranked as No. 4 in the category, Washingtonian reports.
AU also ranked in other categories of the review, including “Most Active Student Government,” “Nobody Plays Intramural Sports,” “Financial Aid Not So Great” and “College City Gets High Marks.”
For more than a decade, George Washington University ranked on the most politically active list, ranking as No.1 for four consecutive years, according to the GW Hatchet. But this year, the school dropped off the list.
Campus political organizations, including AU College Democrats and Student Government, shared their excitement with the Eagle on the new title. 
“Like most students, we're extremely proud of AU being ranked the #1 politically active school,” AU College Democrats said in a statement. “With [the] 2018 Midterms around the corner, we can't wait to get started to tap into all the political excitement on campus and get students engaged with campaigns across the country through our phone banking and canvassing efforts.”
Alex Behle, the current student government secretary, told The Eagle he wasn’t surprised the University ranked high for politically active students. 
“AU students are setting an example for how to not only engage locally, but to effectively advocate for issues facing communities across the globe,” Behle said. “This ranking affirms what every AU student already knows—our campus is leading the nation in creating purposeful change. We’re proud to see AU stand among the most elite universities in the nation.”

2018-09-11,AU,Democrat,"Fact PAC is working to give candidates the information they need to succeed.
In response to what he sees as mounting frustration to the political climate and administration of President Donald Trump, senior Noah Levy decided to take action by starting Fact PAC, a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates across the nation. 
“I would be taught throughout university that the far right is rising worldwide and it’s kind of like, what can we do?” Levy said. “Meanwhile, I’m in an environment where most of my friends, they post articles on Facebook and they get angry at the Trump administration and that’s all you can do. So I was just very inspired by kind of using my anger and putting it into action.”
Fact PAC works to provide free database and behavioral scientific consulting to Democrats nationwide who cannot afford it, Levy said. The organization, which is operated remotely online, compiles data on precincts and districts most relevant to a candidate and analyzes it for their use. Fact PAC obtains the data from that state’s Secretary of State’s website, he said. 
“We show historical voter data on the aggregates of all these precincts in their district within the past few election cycles for things like the numbers on Democratic voter turnout, Republican voter turnout, the amount of registered people in both parties,” Levy said. 
The group shows the concentration of voters geographically by creating heat maps, he added, calling it “a really important insight to provide to candidates.”
When it came to the process of starting a political action committee, Levy said he found that a good deal of thorough research and reading was required. However, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) makes it very easy to start a political action committee, he said. 
Fact PAC’s decision to work on a volunteer basis also made the process easier. The FEC’s website has forms to start a political action committee, which can be filled out and submitted electronically. They are vetted and approved every two to three business days, according to the site. 
The organization is operated by a staff of seven people, comprised of Levy, AU student Sarah Duval, four Cornell University students, and a treasurer who is not affiliated with a university. 
Fact PAC currently has nine partner campaigns, one of which is Brittany Dement, a mayoral candidate in Auburn, Alabama. 
“City politics is something I’ve always wanted to get my feet wet in,” Levy said. “I know how personal it can be for people and I know how much power someone who’s the mayor could have.”
Getting leaders such as Dement elected is the central goal for Levy’s organization. He encourages students to put themselves out there and fight to elect the right candidates. 
“I believe in better leadership by better decision-making as opposed to a strict platform of beliefs because I think the world is constantly changing,” Levy said. “If you really want to get something you just have to be willing to send that message, or send that email.”

2019-03-08,AU,Democrat,"John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate, has been named the 2019 Wonk of the Year, the Kennedy Political Union announced today. 
The politician will speak to students about the future of the U.S. and bipartisanship on March 21 in Bender Arena at 7 p.m.
Kasich began his career in 1978 as a state senator and later became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, notably serving 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee.
After leaving Congress in 2000, Kasich returned to politics in 2010 when he ran for governor of Ohio. He served two terms in the office before leaving the governor’s mansion in January. He is currently a senior political commentator for CNN.
In 2016, Kasich became a household name when he ran for the Republican nomination for president. Kasich “presented himself as a moderate alternative to front-running candidates,” KPU wrote in its press release. During his presidential run, he received the Republican endorsement from The New York Times but ultimately did not have the votes to beat Donald Trump, the party’s eventual nominee. 
“With a perspective unique to a public servant experienced in both the public and private sector, leadership on all levels of government, and work with major media organizations, Kasich will bring thoughtful discussion to American University on the topic of bipartisan solutions and the future of American politics,” KPU wrote in its press release. 
While many analysts place Kasich in the moderate wing of the party due to his views on immigration and other issues, critics have noted Kasich’s conservative record on abortion rights, same-sex marriage and cuts to public education, among other actions. 
Kasich once strongly opposed same-sex marriage, but following the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal in all U.S. states in 2015, he said the country needed to accept the decision and “move on.”
According to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Kasich signed 17 anti-abortion measures into law between 2011 and 2016. Those measures defunded Planned Parenthood and banned abortions from public hospitals as well as from receiving public funds. Ohio Right to Life has credited Kasich for the decline in abortions in the state.
The University has recently introduced initiatives promoting bipartisanship, including the launch of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics last fall. The institute, which is focused on creating bipartisan policy solutions, launched with a September event featuring former Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee). 
Previous Wonk of the Year recipients include Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist Malala Yousafzai, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, former First Lady Laura Bush and former President Bill Clinton.
The event, co-hosted with AU College Republicans, will require an Eventbrite ticket and valid AUID for students, faculty and staff. Doors will open at 6:20 p.m.

2019-04-13,AU,Democrat,"On March 26, the Trump administration released a statement saying it would further expand the Mexico City Policy, otherwise known as the Global Gag Rule (GGR). This is a policy that cuts U.S. funding from non-governmental organizations (NGO)s to hinder their ability to use any funding towards abortion as a family planning service overseas. The GGR feeds into health inequities, prevents non-profit organizations from serving the communities they work in and places the lives of millions in danger. 
This is the second time the Trump Administration has expanded the GGR. Although the GGR was originally imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it initially only restricted NGOs from using U.S. funds for abortion services. In 2017, Trump announced that the GGR would cut U.S. funding for NGOs that used their own money and funding not provided by the U.S. for family planning services. On March 26, Mike Pompeo declared another expansion of the GGR, one that entails cutting funding from NGOs that provide non-U.S. funding to other organizations that “support or promote abortion” as a family planning service. This is all in an effort to end all “backdoor funding schemes.”
Secretary Pompeo and the Trump administration have used family planning as a political issue to retain the support of anti-abortion groups and individuals. What Pompeo and the Trump administration won’t mention is that they have also decided to cut funding for other health issues including HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Zika, tuberculosis and nutrition programs. Despite how the Trump administration wants to frame it, access to family planning services is a health issue. 
According to Advocates for Youth, the NGOs that are on the ground can’t decide whether or not to provide necessary treatments with every coming administration. The information simply doesn’t reach them in time. Thus, even when the GGR isn’t in place, the NGOs are operating like it is. The direct impact of this policy causes NGOs to stall the programs they have running, lose donations of valuable materials (including condoms and contraceptives) and lose the ability to expand their HIV prevention and treatment services to better serve the communities they work in. As Sen. Jeanne Shaheen,D-N.H., said, ""Further expanding the global gag rule puts international organizations in an impossible position: provide women the full scope of reproductive health care services or deny critical funding that saves lives. That is unconscionable.""
Women’s rights are human rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are human rights. Access to healthcare is a human right. Now more than ever, it’s imperative that we stand up to the Trump administration and use our voices as the catalysts for this movement. You may not think you can make a difference because of your age. I urge you to hold strong because, when young people set their minds to something, the results are monumental. Our voices are heard, laws are reformed and societal change happens. From the student-led sit-ins of the civil rights movement to Malala Yousafzai's international contributions to girl’s education, history has shown us that youth activism is a powerful force. So, I  urge you to call your local representatives and senators, visit them on the Hill, and push them to pass the Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights (H.E.R.) Act.
With the H.E.R. Act, we would indefinitely repeal the GGR. Through the GGR, the U.S. and the Trump Administration are constraining the ability of NGOs to use their own money for their family planning services and their ability to monetarily contribute to other organizations. At a time when progress on HIV and AIDS has halted, it is imperative that Congress work together to pass the Global H.E.R. Act. The Global H.E.R. Act is a bipartisan and bicameral initiative, garnering support from Democrats and Republicans alike. It was recently reintroduced to Congress by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Nita Lowey and has received support from Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. 
Let Congress know that we will not sit idly by as millions are denied the care they need. Infringement on the rights of the few is infringement on the rights of all. Let them know that young people’s voices matter. They say AU is one of the most politically active campuses in the country, so let’s act like it.

2019-05-02,AU,Democrat,"A new workers’ rights organization at AU launched in January with the goal of spreading awareness of workers’ rights activism taking place across Washington and at AU.
The Works AU, founded and led by Residence Hall Association chief of staff Tom Lebert, seeks to promote workers’ rights activism by AU students by directing them to events around the city. 
“One of the things that I wanted to alleviate was activists on campus not knowing about [protests and events, and] not having an open platform for this type of information,” Lebert said. “I wanted to create that.”
The Works AU primarily operates through its social media accounts and newsletter, through which it recaps the latest legislative trends and shares links to local activist events. While based at AU, Lebert said that given the intangibility of some of the groups’ actions, his group’s focus is on the broad issue of workers’ rights and even includes national legislation.
AU students have a long history of workers’ rights activism, with the Student Worker Alliance leading numerous efforts to protect Aramark workers on AU’s campus under alum Carlos Mark Vera’s leadership.
Vera was able to mobilize students around the #ExploitedWonk campaign, culminating in an April 2016 rally outside Letts and Anderson Halls. But, following Vera’s graduation, the movement has not been as prominent in student life. The Student Worker Alliance, which did not respond to a request for comment, has not been active on social media since early 2018, leaving the University without a dedicated student group for workers’ rights.
The controversial firing of Aramark employee Anthony Randolph in September, reported on by The Eagle, brought renewed interest toward workers’ rights. Randolph was later reinstated to his position at AU. 
“I think one of the issues that we have is that there wasn't like a very coordinated campaign to protect Anthony's rights,” said sophomore Sam Sherwood, one of The Works AU’s original team members. “We might not have had as big of an impact as we could have had if we had a more coordinated organization.”
Sherwood said he believes that the group, despite its broader focus, could help develop an interest in workers’ rights on campus.The issue re-emerged during the recent Student Government executive board elections, when candidates spoke about the importance of rehiring workers under a new food provider and preserving their pensions. 
To further student interest in the cause, The Works AU recently held its first event on campus in coordination with AU College Democrats on April 8, at which about 30 attendees were invited to write letters to their representatives about three workers’ rights-related bills related to family medical leave and the gender pay gap. 
“The idea for an event like this came about during the government shutdown,” Lebert said. “One of the first things that we got involved with was sharing action and events protesting the government shutdown.”
While attendees were eager to write their letters, awareness of the organization remains low. 
“I'm very passionate about AU College Democrats,” said freshman Katia Portela at the event, who said she had not heard of the group until that evening. “I am particularly passionate about workers’ rights after Anthony Randolph.”
His Lebert said that for now, his group is focused on local D.C. activism.
“We’re just trying to boost these unions and local workers’ rights groups and get the word out to students,” he said.

2019-09-11,AU,Democrat,"The University’s new bipartisan Sine Institute of Policy and Politics named political veteran Amy Dacey as its inaugural executive director in June. 
Dacey previously led Emily’s List and the Democratic National Committee. She also worked on presidential campaigns, such as John Kerry’s in 2004. Because of these experiences, Dacey said she has a “360-degree view of policy and politics” that will help further Sine’s goals of finding new policy solutions.
“I think these are all the different players and sectors that come together when they make policy,” Dacey said, “So I do feel like having those different perspectives from my own personal career path will bring a lot to what we’re trying to do here at the Sine Institute.”
President Sylvia Burwell announced the establishment of the institute last September on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” 
“What we’re hopeful for is that our students, our scholars and practitioners - people who are experts across media, government and the private sector - can come together and shape policy, as well as the leaders of tomorrow,” Burwell said on the show.
School of Public Affairs Dean Vicky Wilkins said the hiring committee looked for someone who could increase the Sine Institute's visibility on campus and beyond. Wilkins said they wanted someone who had experience in “institution-building” and bringing people together.
Wilkins said that not only did Dacey’s political experiences impress her, but her most recent experience as a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard intrigued her, as well. In that role, she educated students on politics and policy, just as the fellows at Sine do.
“What resounded with everyone I spoke to there [Harvard], including students, was her level of student engagement and her ideas about how to bring students in and how they could be involved in the institute,” Wilkins said. “It really excited me and made me see that she was the right person.”
Looking toward the future of Sine, Dacey said she has big plans. She said she hopes to bring in international voices to talk about how policy affects us “outside our borders.” Dacey also said one of her main goals is to hire an engaged and diverse group of fellows for this upcoming spring. 
“I think it is a great opportunity and I am excited about this program at American University,” Dacey said. “It is a University-wide initiative, so the collaboration that will take place between all the different schools and colleges and their expertise is exciting.”

2019-12-12,AU,Democrat,"AU professor Daniel Gade in the School of Public Affairs is running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 election.
A professor in the School of Public Affairs is running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 election.
AU professor Daniel Gade is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, former White House veterans-affairs advocate and disability rights activist. He was wounded in combat twice and lost his right leg. After earning a Ph.D. in public policy and public administration from the University of Georgia, he taught political science at the United States Military Academy for several years before coming to AU in January. 
“I am a career servant,” Gade said. “From the time I enlisted in the army at 17 years old, I’ve been a servant of the Constitution. I view service in politics, and particularly, in this case, service in the United States Senate, as an extension of my decades of service to the country.”
Since he launched his campaign in August, Gade raised funds at the same rate at his opponent Scott Taylor, who is considered the established Republican candidate.
His campaign is still in the early stages since the primary vote is not until June, but Gade said that he is now focusing on fundraising and garnering media attention. He released a campaign advertisement last month and was featured in news articles, blog posts and radio shows. 
Gade said that he has not faced any backlash for his campaign yet.
“Reception has been uniformly positive,” he said. “People are really hungry for non-politician political servants. Voters are sick of our political class.”
Gade’s governing principles and the platform of his candidacy are to promote free-market systems, maintain a strong national defense, promote limited government and protect individual liberties and civil rights, according to his website. 
“Getting government out of people’s lives allows them to thrive on their own terms,” he said. “That’s where societies thrive, because societies are an aggregation of political and economic choices.”
If he wins the Republican primary, Gade would face the Democratic two-term incumbent Mark Warner in the general election. The most recent data from the Cook Political Report said that the general election is likely to fall in favor of Warner. 
When Gade is not performing his professorial duties or orchestrating his campaign, he enjoys biking and CrossFit. He is a father of three, including a 17-year-old daughter and two younger twin boys. 
Gade says that, as a senator, he’d like to change the “divisiveness and nastiness” in today’s political climate.
“I’m willing to sit down and talk face to face, but there are some people in this political climate who are not willing to do that,” he said. “Politicians just see the R or the D, but don’t see the A for American. They need to focus on the A first.”

2020-02-04,AU,Democrat,"AU Student Union Board invited Jaboukie Young-White to perform stand-up for AU students on Jan. 26.
American University’s Student Union Board welcomed comedian Jaboukie Young-White, best known for his work on “The Daily Show,” to Constitution Hall, on Sunday, Jan. 26. 
Jaboukie performed a stand-up set, entertaining a large crowd of students. His act was an expressive parody, poking fun at some of the major problems in the ongoing news cycle. Whether it was his jokes on trendy food items, phone addiction or living in cities – Jaboukie actively kept the audience engaged in stories that were more meaningful of a bigger societal picture. 
Opener Charlie Bardey performed before Jaboukie’s set, joking about his “weird vibes,” his daily life with his therapist and his sex life as a gay man. Bardey interacted with the crowd, performing multiple side-bars in his introduction, and even researched some things that AU students joke about, such as the Terrace Dining Room. 
Following Bardey, Jabokuie walked on stage with roaring applause. Jaboukie joked about many topics that AU students could relate to, such as living in cities, riding public transit and getting into college. One joke he told was about how he and a close friend in high school took pictures of already-graded tests and were able to cheat their way through their AP European History class to the point where their scores were starting to influence the grading curve. Laughingly, Jaboukie said he and his friend, “were in class like, ‘we love Euro.’” 
Jaboukie’s act also touched on many deeper topics. He talked about what it has been like living in the current political and social environment. He shared stories about living as a gay person in the U.S., and what the Democratic primary has come to, saying, “It’s hard to swallow everything.” He engaged the crowd with a PowerPoint slide presentation where he compared mainstream foods, such as Oat Milk, to famous actresses. 
Jaboukie’s jokes were more telling of the current political environment, rather than his sense of humor. He often joked about contemporary issues, which have sparked debate throughout the world, such as phone addiction, social media, and 23andMe. He also made light of his diverse background growing up in a religious Jamaican family in New York, and what it is like living in the U.S. as a minority.
He closed the night with a story about being robbed on his walk home. The robbers took his phone and ran; however, they came back and asked for his passcode. At the end of the story, Jaboukie managed to get his phone back, saying “If you’re annoying enough, you can do anything.”
Jaboukie said during his set that he was uncertain about what the future of politics and social issues looked like, but he looks to comedy as another way of thinking about the issues that are impeding students’ newsfeeds and social lives.

2020-02-06,AU,Democrat,"On Jan. 26, Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Dr. Fanta Aw sent the AU community an email regarding mental health resources on campus. The email, masquerading as an attempt to reach out to students searching for support, had an accusatory tone and was punctuated by statistics that functioned to place blame on students for the state of counseling services on campus. It seemed that rather than taking steps to address students’ requests concerning these resources, the administration chose to place that burden back on the struggling students asking for help.
Beyond the absurdity of responding to demands for change by assigning blame, the email and the represented view of administration completely ignore the conversation AU students are trying to have. At the core of this issue, the fact remains that the administration, time and time again, prioritizes its image over the necessary and tangible needs of its students. As the new Hall of Science is slowly constructed and plans for a future training facility are shared, it’s only fair for students to wonder when their necessity for more therapists will be met. 
One of the statistics cited in the email was the fact that 97.5 percent of students who have accessed the Counseling Center would recommend it to other students. Off-campus therapy can be an immense financial strain on any student and many insurance plans cover little to none of those costs. With the Counseling Center being the only free resource AU students have access to, it makes complete sense why they would recommend it to their peers. All this means is they would rather their friends have some hope of treatment, even if it won’t be for another month, than none at all. This statistic cannot and should not be mistaken for any vote of confidence beyond the fact that the Center itself exists. 
What the other statistics fail to recognize are basic symptoms of mental illness. Therapy is a grueling process that forces you to examine and discuss extremely uncomfortable things. Beyond the notion that canceled and missed appointments are a fact of everyday life, getting out of bed to talk about your darkest thoughts is a feat in and of itself. Belittling students and diminishing that to “choosing not to show up for appointments” is an admission that the administration simply does not recognize mental illness to be the tangible problem that it is. 
While the administration should certainly be focused on transforming mental health resources, it should also be more transparent as to where the numbers they base so many claims on are coming from. Are they collected from the tedious survey that the Counseling Center forces everyone to take at the end of their sessions? Knowing a bit more about where this data came from could give students a deeper understanding of this information.
The email also makes a point to disclose cancellations that are “same-day."" It seems contradictory that students should have to wait for three weeks to get an appointment while so many appointments are being missed or canceled. If the Counseling Center could set up a system similar to that of advising, it would both allow students to get appointments significantly sooner and make up for the “waste” of canceled counseling time. Creating a system that allows students to go in and choose appointments as they open up facilitates the process for all parties involved. 
Vice President Aw concluded the email with a plea to students to ensure that counseling services are “utilized thoughtfully.” This phrasing implies some sort of hierarchy of mental health needs as if certain students who are “only” mildly depressed should not take away appointments from students who are severely depressed. This implication is dangerous and only further discloses the reckless attitude that the administration displays towards the mental health needs of students.
Administration is continuously planning for the future, a future with more science majors or higher-ranked sports teams. This careful planning comes at the cost of the students who are here now and who are struggling to find support on a campus that wilfully ignores their needs. Perhaps instead of placing the burden on students to somehow fix the failings of the Counseling Center, the administration could learn from schools similar in size to AU who have comparatively successful resources. It could form focus groups to glean the needs we have that it clearly doesn’t respect or understand. 
Since the email was sent, AU’s student body has responded with outrage. With responses from Student Government, AU College Democrats and the overall student body enumerating by the day, it is imperative that the administration recognizes their shortcomings in sending that email. In a period of our lives as transformative and uncertain as our undergraduate years, feeling supported by the institution where we sleep, eat and learn is essential. 
As the national movement to normalize mental illness in schools gains traction, this email proves that AU is falling behind. It is imperative that AU administration joins this conversation and finally makes the needs of its students its primary priority.

2020-04-10,AU,Democrat,"Halfway through a debate hosted by AU College Democrats on April 8 between candidates for Student Government president and comptroller, the Zoom call used as the debate’s platform was disrupted by anonymous trolls sharing pornographic images and harassing messages. 
“The debate was going so well, discussions were being had and hard questions … were being asked of the candidates, and they were providing the answers,” said Julia Larkin, AU Dems president and the target of some of the harassing comments. “Now, all that’s being talked about is not the issues that we’re facing as students on campus, it’s this stupidity.”
“Zoom bombings” have become a common occurrence in the U.S. following the transition to online classes, Inside Higher Ed reported. This trolling strategy involves gaining admittance to Zoom meetings and disrupting them with inappropriate behavior or content. University classes seem to be primary targets, Inside Higher Ed noted. 
About 90 minutes into the debate, the discussion was interrupted when someone in the call began screen sharing pornographic images, Larkin said. The perpetrator was quickly removed from the call, but a few minutes later, four or five other accounts began posting harassing and disruptive comments in the chat. Moderators were unable to lock the call, as the app notified them that too many people were involved to make the change.
“All of a sudden … chaos just broke out in a chat section and that's when people started writing disparaging comments … about me and … about sexual violence,” Larkin said. “Around that same time, as we were trying to kick those people out of it, someone else started screening pornographic images again so we just decided to end the Zoom altogether.”
AU administrators later clarified to Larkin that locking a call should only be impossible with meetings over 300 people. It is unclear why the debate, which had about 80 attendees at its peak, was subject to this limitation. 
All of the candidates and a large number of viewers rejoined afterwards for a continued debate no longer sanctioned or moderated by AU Dems. 
“I commend a student, Leanna Faulk, who jumped in to moderate because students still wanted to hear from us,” said Joshua Dantzler, a candidate for president. Larkin added that she had intended to invalidate the Zoom meeting ID to prevent more trolls, but the number of people who rejoined prevented her from closing it. 
Candidates have responded on Facebook to the “Zoom bombing,” calling it unacceptable, yet unsurprising. 
AU Dems leadership, including Larkin, Vice President Emily Coneybeare and Campaigns Director Ian Malone, have called for the student body to not give the trolls the attention they seek by continuing to discuss the disruption. Instead, they ask that students and candidates follow through on their outrage and work to make campus a more inclusive and aware community, most immediately by concentrating on the substantive aspects of the debate. 
Before and after the disruption, candidates spoke in depth on a variety of topics. Internal SG issues such as transparency, communication and trust with the student body were discussed, as well as potential points of advocacy for SG members, like mental health, Title IX disputes, continued racism on campus and students’ financial concerns. 
“It’s really sad that we were having a really live spirited conversation about the future of AU and somebody who had nothing better to do just decided that they were going to crash the debate,” said Jacob Robbins, a candidate for comptroller. He expressed hope at the overall reaction of students to the incident.
Presidential candidate Jeremy Ward said he agreed with Larkin’s statements. 
“This isn’t a moment to talk about solidarity on Facebook posts ... when misogyny and sexist comments are made, where are you?” he said. “That’s very important when you’re running for leadership in AUSG. What are your platforms to deal with misogyny and sexism on campus?”
Larkin said she spoke with an official from the Center for Student Involvement, who said they planned to talk to the information technology department about the disruption. 
“American University officials are aware of this unfortunate incident and inappropriate behavior and are in the process of reviewing,” Stacie Burgess, director of public affairs, wrote in an email to The Eagle. 
Larkin said she hopes that those who attended the debate and saw the disruption don’t just act performatively against such mistreatment. 
“It’s very easy to write on Facebook and it’s very easy to be mad about a situation that was put right in front of your face,” she said. “But when you’re in class and you see a fellow student, who’s a man, mansplaining something to another female student, that’s your opportunity to stand up and do something about it. This isn’t just an isolated incident. Women on this campus face sexism from their fellow students and classmates all the time. It’s not fair.”

2020-05-09,AU,Democrat,"The U.S. Department of Education released its final regulations controlling how schools handle campus sexual assault cases under Title IX, extending rights given to those accused of sexual misconduct.
Title IX, which went into effect in 1972, is a federal law that protects against sex discrimination in education. In November 2018, the Department of Education, headed by Secretary Betsy DeVos, released its initial proposal on “improving” schools’ responses to sexual harassment and assault. It received over 124,000 public comments, which were reviewed by the Office for Civil Rights, a sub-agency of the department. 
The finalized regulations, released on Wednesday, give students accused of sexual harassment or assault the right to a live hearing and the ability for the student’s advisers to cross-examine accusers in order to “restore due process in campus proceedings.” However, opponents of the new rules say they may discourage survivors from coming forward. Some AU students think the University should take steps to make the process less traumatic for accusers.
“American, much like colleges and universities nationwide, believes it is imperative to carefully and thoroughly review the final regulations, the Department's aggregated response to the nearly 125,000 comments submitted, and the other data and information included by the Department,” AU spokesperson Stacie Burgess said in a statement to The Eagle.
The new Title IX rules also include dating violence as a type of sexual harassment and require schools to offer options such as dorm room reassignments or no-contact orders.
In 2017, AU removed the hearing process and switched to an investigative model, in which an investigator determines whether or not the respondent is responsible. Former Title IX Program Officer Regina Curran previously said that the University switched to the model due to the significant stress that the hearings were causing for students involved. 
However, AU and other colleges and universities will have to comply with these regulations by Aug. 14, as they are enforceable by law, unlike the Obama-era guidelines issued in 2011 and 2014. If schools choose not to comply with these regulations, they could lose federal funding.
Rachel Abraham, a rising senior in the School of Public Affairs, went through the process of filing a complaint with AU’s Title IX office. She said it was one of the worst experiences in her college career, and she thinks giving the accused more rights, such as cross-examination, is dangerous and invalidating. 
“This has given them an elevator, and you’re sort of stuck in this hole and you still don’t have a ladder or rope to get you out,” Abraham said.
Zachary Swanson, a rising sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes students are going to be less willing to report complaints with the Title IX office if the process retraumatizes students through a more criminal-like trial.
“There is already a notable and provable chilling effect in the criminal justice system regarding sexual assault because victims don’t want to have to go through a long, drawn-out legal process,” Swanson said.
Other regulations allow Title IX officials to decide whether to use preponderance of the evidence or a “clear and convincing standard,” suggest mediation as an alternative method of mediation, and do not enforce Title IX offices to investigate assault or harassment that occurs off campus in a non-sponsored setting like an apartment or, in AU’s case, a fraternity house. 
Abraham said her friends who have gone through traumatic situations mostly experienced them in apartments or fraternity houses off campus. Abraham said that if the University is really trying to keep their students safe, they should consider that not everything, especially sexual assault, happens on campus or at school-sponsored events.
While these rules are enforceable by law, the University can choose not to opt in to some of the suggestions. Washington College of Law adjunct professorial lecturer Ian Harris said one way could be to utilize the lower evidentiary procedure as suggested in the Obama-era guidelines. He said as an attorney, he knows it can be difficult to prove sexual assault even with the lower standard of evidence, let alone a stricter standard.
“The preponderance of the evidence is used in most civil cases where judges are actually trained to adjudicate cases,” Harris said. “There is no reason that a more stringent standard should be utilized for cases at universities where many students and adjudicators lack evidentiary knowledge or tools to seek out evidence.”
The release of these changes initiated outcry on social media from students. Rising junior and former AU Democrats President Julia Larkin created a Change.org petition for AU to “uphold survivors’ rights and reject DeVos’s harmful Title IX policies.”
Without the ability to protest on campus, Larkin said her anger propelled her to create the petition, which received over 365 signatures as of Saturday.
“The University needs to come up with some sort of plan, some time very soon, as to how they are going to adapt to these rules and how they can adapt to it in a way that is still survivor-centric that is going to protect people who come forward,” Larkin said. “If no response from the University comes out within the next few days, the distrust and a wall is already built.”
Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw said the University will do everything they can do within the law for survivors to still feel safe and comfortable coming forward. 
“We’ve made significant improvements within not only the process but continuing our commitment to education, like Empower AU. Those will not go away,” Aw said. “If anything we’ll continue to redouble our efforts around that.”
Larkin also helped new AU Democrats President Rhett Martino, a rising sophomore, plan a Day of Action on Friday. Martino said the petition Larkin created was a great first step, but they wanted to encourage more student activism to let the University know that students think these policies would be harmful.
“Step one is to sign the petition. Step two is to send an email to your representative in Congress and we really outline how to do that,” Martino said. “Step three is an email to American University, specifically to the Office of Campus Life, Dr. Fanta Aw and the Title IX office.”
Aw said she has received those emails and ensures students that the University is looking over every single line of the over 2,000 pages of regulations. Even though the timetable is “aggressive” and comes in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she said the University is assessing the full measure of implementation. 
These regulations come at a time when AU has three open federal investigations into potential sexual violence violations of Title IX — the most in D.C. In addition, Curran recently left her position as Title IX program officer. Currently, there is an interim program officer and deputy Title IX officers.
“We will continue to do everything we can, around what we know to be good practices while understanding that this is indeed a federal law,” Aw said.

2020-06-02,AU,Democrat,"Update: The original version of this article included a statement from Brooke Frischer that did not include the end of a quote about how black Americans have told people for years to support them. The end of her statement was paraphrased in the updated article.
Three days following George Floyd’s death, after a police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes in Minneapolis, almost three of which Floyd wasn’t responding, the American University NAACP released a statement asking the University to end relations with the Metropolitan Police Department. 
“We are calling on American University to use its institutional power by following in the footsteps of the University of Minnesota and ending our University’s relationship with the Metropolitan Police Department,” the statement said.
According to the statement, this call to action was inspired by the recent deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and many others at the hands of police officers. AU NAACP said it is not releasing any media statements at this time.
Shortly after Floyd’s death, University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel announced the university is highly limiting their relations with the Minneapolis Police Department. 
In her statement, Gabel said that the university has “a responsibility to uphold our values and a duty to honor” those affected by police brutality. This came after the university’s Student Association demanded that action be taken. 
The AU Black Student Union published a collective statement with the Black Student Unions of the District of Columbia Universities. It included a list of demands that requested reducing the number of youth arrests and requiring all MPD officers to undergo unconscious bias and de-escalation training. 
AU BSU declined to comment. 
AU Democrats also declared their support for the separation between the University and MPD. 
“We cannot pretend that police officers are subject to the same laws as the citizens they are supposed to be protecting,” the statement said. “Our country should not pick and choose who we hold accountable under the law, especially when it comes to vicious crimes, such as murder.” 
AU Dems spokesperson Brooke Frischer said she is an ally for black people and the organization recognizes the violence that has recently occurred.
“We know that we have a duty [as a predominantly white organization] to call out injustices,” Frischer said. “We don’t want to be the people constantly asking black people how to support them when we know how to support them.” 
That's because black people have told others for years how to support them, Frischer said.
AU spokesperson Stacie Burgess detailed what a separation might mean. AUPD predominantly resolves on-campus issues, making MPD, in many cases, nonessential. 
“AUPD rarely needs assistance from MPD,” Burgess said. “In one case, the department took proactive action steps to actively reduce MPD presence on campus by working with the Counseling Center to change protocols.” 
Burgess said that university police departments in D.C. rely on memorandum of understandings, which are supervised by the MPD. This allows access to writing reports, sharing information and conducting background checks. 
“These licensing, commissions and connectivity to law enforcement networks are critical to our mission of serving our AU community,” Burgess said. “Severing our relationship with MPD would require a change in D.C. regulations.”

2020-07-05,AU,Democrat,"The Mary Graydon Center, pictured in 2016. 
President Sylvia Burwell announced the creation of a new office on Thursday that will handle complaints related to racism, discrimination, harassment and sexual assault. 
The Office of Equity and Title IX will replace the current Title IX office. It will receive additional funding compared to its predecessor, and the staff will grow to include five full-time members, according to Seth Grossman, Burwell's chief of staff and counselor. The office will also enhance education and training in anti-discrimination for students, staff and faculty. 
Prior to the creation of the Office of Equity and Title IX, complaints from students, staff and faculty were all handled in different offices. Students reported to the Title IX office, while Human Resources handled staff complaints, and the Provost and Dean of Faculty offices dealt with faculty complaints. The new Office of Equity and Title IX will handle complaints from all members of the AU community. 
Burwell said in her email that the creation of the office will “provide a direct avenue for individual concerns to be promptly and meaningfully addressed; enhance our approach to preventing and responding to discrimination, harassment and sexual assault complaints; and provide everyone in our community with a space to be heard.”
The new office aims to bring together responsibilities, currently spread out across the University, including anti-discriminatory training, handling Title IX complaints and responding to instances of racism and discrimination. 
“Often, the complaints involve different types of discrimination. Separating those out prevented the University from having an approach to address multiple grounds of discrimination,” Grossman said. 
All students, faculty and staff, including the new office’s staff, will receive training in the fall, according to Grossman. That includes specialized training for different groups like members of sports teams and Greek life organizations. Details of the training will be worked out by the new office and its assistant vice president.
A new assistant vice president for equity and Title IX officer will lead the office, and the University is currently searching internally and externally for candidates, Burwell wrote. According to Grossman, the new assistant vice president, who will also hold a position in the president’s cabinet, will be in place when the office launches on Aug. 14, or shortly thereafter.
Despite recent student outcry over how the University handles instances of discrimination and sexual violence, Grossman said that the creation of this office is not directly in response to calls for increased University support for victims. The new office, which is a part of AU’s Inclusive Excellence plan, has been in the works for about a year. 
“The office is in response to feedback we’ve gotten over a long period of time about complaints about how complaints related to Title IX and instances of racial discrimination have been handled,” Grossman said. “This is critical and has informed the work of the office.”
Some students say that the University can do more to support victims in the community. Jeremy Ward, executive director of AU Democrats, is concerned that since the old Title IX office was “not effective,” he’s unsure if adding responsibilities to the office will help streamline complaints and adjudication.
“They have to have honest conversations with many different communities on campus and those conversations need to start now instead of waiting for the office to be established because a lot of whatever work is done by that office is going to be set up on how it is created,” Ward said. 
Student leaders are also calling for more steps to be taken.
“I definitely believe this is a great step in the right direction for AU. But the work is far from over,” said AUSG Comptroller Justin Levine, who is serving as interim president. “It’s vital to believe the students who came forward and shared their stories on campus, but it's also important to discuss what’s next.”

2020-07-06,AU,Democrat,"Students celebrate the announcement of Sharice Davids as the winner of a Kansas congressional race at an AU Dems watch party Tuesday. 
Correction: Edu Nogues' name has been updated with the correct spelling.
All members of the executive board of American University College Democrats resigned from their positions last week, after pushback about a lack of representation of students of color in leadership positions.
The group’s president, vice president, chief of staff, treasurer, communications director, director of activism, director of diversity, equity and inclusion, and social chair stepped down. In statements posted on Facebook and Instagram, each expressed their reasons for stepping down, most of which centered around the need for more representation of people of color in their organization.
“To truly put this organization in the place I want to see it go, BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] voices must be amplified in leadership, and that must start from the top,” former president Rhett Martino said in a Facebook statement on June 29.
Martino said in a statement to The Eagle that resignations were made as a step to “meet the magnitude of the problem.”
“Personally, I believe that I was elected to enact reform on campus in this organization's capacity, and continuing to occupy the seat as head of this organization is not what I currently want to do if that means less representation for marginalized communities in AU Dems leadership,” Martino said. 
In a statement that AU Dems published on Wednesday, Jeremy Ward, previously a deputy diversity, equity and inclusion director, was appointed as the executive director for the duration of the summer, and he will be hosting town halls during this transitional period to determine the next steps for the organization.
In an interview with The Eagle on Wednesday, Ward said that the entire executive board, including the members that had already resigned, had a Zoom call to discuss the resignations and decided to appoint him as the executive director. 
“I just want to speak to as many people as possible and understand their opinions on how the club has made them feel unwelcome, unvalued and tokenized, at times,” Ward said. “Then we’ll compile that report and send a list of recommendations that we’ll make public to the student body.”
While there are long withstanding issues with diversity, Ward said, there have been people in the organization who have tried to implement change.
However, former Vice President Christopher Bastida, who was one of the three students of color on the executive board, was the first to post a statement of resignation. In an interview with The Eagle, Bastida said that the organization had not made proper changes toward more representation during his time there.
“In light of the discussions taking place over social media over the past days both regarding AU Dems and the overtly racist climate that is our campus, and what I can only describe as an unsettling, disturbing, and lackluster response from certain others on this executive board, I am left with no hope for the future of this organization as it stands,” Bastida said in his statement.
Bastida said in the interview that the group's leaders should apologize for their ""history and past actions.""
Bastida said that he coordinated his resignation with Edu Nogues, the former chief of staff. Following the resignations of other board members, Bastida said that he questions how genuine they are. He said he feels as though the resignations are in response to the controversy and “not necessarily in response to the wrongdoing of those individuals and other individuals in the organization.”
Nogues said in his statement that while he joined Bastida in his resignation, he knows that Martino recognizes the challenges that the club faces, and he is optimistic about the future of the club. In an interview with The Eagle, though, he said that there were many instances when the board members could have made changes but chose not to.
“Don’t get me wrong, the e-board tried to improve it many times,” Nogues said. “But after every statement that came out in order to make the club more diverse and address race issues, I kept getting calls, messages and complaints telling me that the statements are performative.” 
The most concerning thing, Nogues said, is that when the board was hiring the new campaign directors, it took on only white students for the role, despite multiple students of color applying for the four positions.
“It felt like we were making a lot of statements, but when we had an actual chance, we weren’t doing anything about it,” Nogues said.
In an Instagram post on Tuesday, AU’s Black Student Union announced it was canceling its Summer of Justice partnership with College Democrats following criticism of AU Dems from Black students on social media. The organization urged AU Dems to look within the club and address its problematic history, instead of hiding behind BSU's efforts. 
BSU did not respond to a request for comment. 
Thrisha Mohan, a rising sophomore at AU, was part of a group of people who were considering running for the executive board in the spring. While she ultimately decided not to run, Zuby Chowdhury, who’s Asian American, ran for president and lost by a small margin to Martino. 
Mohan said in an interview that both she and Chowdhury applied for a campaign director position. However, despite Chowdhury losing in a runoff election by 5 percentage points, and other qualified applicants being people of color, none of them received the position. 
After expressing grievances on social media, Aaditi Narayanan, the former diversity, equity and inclusion director, set up a phone call with Mohan to discuss how to improve diversity. Mohan said that the call seemed pointless, given that the organization had an opportunity to give leadership to people of color, but chose not to.
“My point to them was that I am not sure nor do I care why they made that decision, but the fact that they did is exclusionary toward a lot of qualified POC candidates, which is reflective of the organization as a whole and a problem that they knew had existed prior,” Mohan said.
Chowdhury said in an interview with The Eagle that from the moment she became a campaign fellow for the organization prior to her run for president, she was exposed to the toxicity of AU College Democrats.
“As soon as I took the position of fellow, it started going downhill for me because it was the most ridiculous grunt work position ever,” Chowdhury said. “Having really excited students who are intelligent and capable of doing a lot of things for an organization that is supposed to be progressive, just doing fundraising research was really demeaning in my eyes.”
The issues within the club became more and more apparent to her once she decided to run for president, Chowdhury said, and she heard from many people that the club is not a safe space for people of color.
Diamond Terrell, who served as AU College Democrats’ vice president from May to September 2019, said in a message to The Eagle that, as the only Black woman on the board at that time, she was constantly faced with tone policing, condescension and disrespect. She resigned from the role when she realized that the “organization was past the point of reform.” 
“Despite my calls for changing the organization from within, there was no direct action; it has all been performative,” Terrell wrote. “Historically, the organization has made little to no effort to diversify their ranks beyond white feminists, lacking intersectionality at every turn.”
Terrell added that she hoped students would recognize the flaws in the group, instead of supporting it for its past partnerships with Black student organizations. 
“I don’t want my words to get misconstrued, so let me make it clear: more than ever now, multicultural groups on campus are the organizations that need to be most supported,” Terrell wrote.
Issues with representation also extend to the national organization of College Democrats of America. In an open letter to the group published on Tuesday, state federations, called for the immediate resignation of the current president and demanded that people of color will serve and be represented on the next national board.
Bastida said that resignations within AU Dems leadership are necessary to make way for students of color to serve. He said that former board members should not run again. 
“The other resignations that have transpired [Tuesday] morning and that will likely come, I really cannot speak as to their motives,” Bastida said. “However, I am confident in mine and that I am leaving a system that is built to benefit white students.”

2020-10-09,AU,Democrat,"American University students voiced a variety of concerns following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, who will replace late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if confirmed by the Senate. 
From a shortlist of conservative political figures such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Trump ultimately decided on Barrett, who is known for her conservative stances on abortion, the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ+ rights, amongst other issues. 
The Executive Board of AU College Republicans said in a statement that they support the nomination. 
“In this time of unprecedented tumult and uncertainty, it is especially imperative that the Supreme Court be at full capacity, to remain a steady defender of the Constitution,” the AUCR Executive Board wrote in a statement released Oct. 2. “We strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett and look forward to her many more years of service to the United States of America and our sacred Constitution.” 
College Republicans declined to comment further. 
Many students said they are concerned that if she is confirmed, she will threaten the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision—a landmark case that protects a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction—and the Affordable Care Act. 
Jeremy Ward, the executive director of AU College Democrats, said that Barret’s nomination “shows that the Republicans don't care about health care.”
Roseanna Yeganeh-Kazemi, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, was also concerned. She cited Barrett’s use of religion to justify and support her legal opinions, such as with cases involving LGBTQ+ rights or abortion, as especially threatening, considering that the U.S. has no established religion. 
“We pride ourselves on that concept that we have a separation of church and state, and the fact that in a lot of opinions she's written and a lot of her stances she brings in Catholicism, which I think is a major problem,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
Several students said they were frustrated that Republicans plan to confirm Barrett with only a month until the general election. In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with eight months left until the election, but his nomination was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. 
“Then fast forward four years later, Justice Ginsburg's body is probably not even cold yet, it's just hours after she passed, and McConnell is saying that we are going to have a replacement,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
While some were upset, many students said they were not shocked, given the long-term political power the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers would acquire if Barrett is confirmed. 
“I was expecting President Trump to make a decision very quickly; I was expecting the Senate to be [quick] to confirm her,” said Ali Siddiqi, a freshman in the School of International Service who has been following Barrett’s rulings since she was on the shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. “She had no scandals or allegations to which the Trump campaign would want to deviate from, especially with Brett Kavanaugh. They want a clean judicial pick.”
Barrett’s confirmation hearing is set to start Oct. 12, and it is not yet known exactly how COVID-19 might affect the proceedings.

2020-10-13,AU,Democrat,"AU alum Sarah McBride speaks at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. 
Sarah McBride, an American University alumna and former Student Government president, is expected to become the country’s first openly transgender state senator after winning her Delaware Senate Democratic primary race in September.
McBride overwhelmingly won in the primary, and given the makeup of her district, she is a heavy favorite to win the seat in November. 
“The best way that I can do justice by the LGBTQ community is to do right by my district, and to work my heart out and to be the best state senator I can be for every single resident of the first senate district. That's how I honor and uphold the responsibility I have to the broader LGBTQ+ community,” said McBride, in an interview with The Eagle.  
Democrat Harris McDowell III, the longest-serving legislator in Delaware history, is retiring and endorsed McBride.  
“This moment calls for a politics that is centering our people and our communities and that is really focused on the issues that matter most to people and making progress on them,” McBride said. “I think that we have a responsibility to feed this moment with full action that makes a real difference in our family's lives.”
Her campaign has been focused on health care, paid family and medical leave and education. If elected, she said her immediate priority would be to get her state through the coronavirus crisis. 
“This campaign has reinforced for me that people are hungry for conversations in our politics that are rooted in kindness and compassion, and it's reinforced for me the desire for change and progress. The desire for progress on issues ranging from better health care to education to the environment,” McBride said. 
Despite the historic nature of her campaign, McBride emphasized that her gender is not the focus of her campaign. 
“I’m not running to be a transgender state senator, I’m not running to make headlines,” McBride said. “I’m running to make a difference in my community.” 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, McBride’s campaign did a lot of door-knocking and face-to-face interaction with voters. Despite now having to virtually interact with voters, she said her campaign has not slowed down, and she is still able to have meaningful conversations with voters.
She said, being a millennial herself, she has also made it a priority to engage with and listen to young voters throughout the course of her campaign. 
“It means making sure that when we're talking to voters, we're actually including young voters in that universe and that we're truly, meaningfully, listening to young voters as we are having those conversations with voters across the district,” McBride said. 
While Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 3-to-1 in Delaware’s first senate district, McBride said she is not taking any chances. 
“I'm not taking anything for granted. I am working my heart out over the next few weeks to talk to as many voters as possible,"" McBride said. ""Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, we're leaving no stone unturned.”

2020-12-03,AU,Democrat,"With the tumult of the current political environment, especially during and following the election, American University students expressed heightened stress levels as well as difficulty balancing schoolwork with monitoring election results.
“The only time [I] really looked away from The New York Times map and the CNN video [was] just [to] sleep, so I kind of struggled with balancing homework and election stuff,” said School of Public Affairs freshman Lisa Liubovich in an interview during election week. “I think I already have trouble paying attention in class, but this is just like a cherry on the sundae. It’s very difficult to pay attention when everything is happening right now.”
Sophomore Solomon Dubner, who spent much of his time leading up to the election working on Maine Senate Democratic candidate Sara Gideon’s campaign, agreed. 
“You have this huge monumental event that is going to shape the lives of millions of people around the world, and you’re just glued to the TV,” Dubner said. “That one-page reflection paper, that stats assignment that you have, is going to seem pretty trivial.”
Jeffrey Volkmann, the executive director of the Counseling Center, explained how easier access to constantly-updated digital news could increase stress and ultimately cause a student to lose focus.
“The way the time period works right now, where we’re all in front of screens, I think for many people, there was some sort of [news] like The New York Times or something up at all times on their screen,” Volkmann said. “So while you’re in class, you’re getting this information, it’s impacting you emotionally, and then you’re also trying to focus on the content, and I think that’s a pretty difficult thing right now.”
Some stress among students was alleviated by some professors’ leniency during election week, including optional attendance, asynchronous activities and extended deadlines for assignments.
The Counseling Center also released resources to help students cope with election-related stress, such as an Election Stress Survival Kit and expanded drop-in hours and intake appointments throughout election week.
In order to de-stress, Volkmann suggested setting boundaries, eating meals regularly, exercising, listening to music and other forms of self-care. 
“I think a lot of conversation has been dictated by what’s happening with elections,” he said. “There can be some time made to talk about things other than the election to schedule space for yourself so that you’re not just focusing on what’s taking place in the world [and] taking breaks from the internet for periods of time.”
Dubner echoed this sentiment and emphasized the need for free time in addition to focusing on the election and work.
“At some point, you need just an hour to unwind, watch TV [or] read a book, and I think the main thing was, I didn’t have time to do that. I did have enough time to get my work done to a good enough quality, I’d like to think, and to do my best for the Gideon campaign,” Dubner said. “But I think the biggest problem was after I had time to do that, there was time for nothing else, which was kind of hard to balance [with] work, school and [my] personal life.”

2020-12-07,AU,Democrat,"Along the lines of American exceptionalism, the United States has proven to be exceptional in the worst ways. For a long time now, our nation has been performing low in general humanity and high in the number of police brutality reports, incarceration rates and impoverishment numbers.
In fact, no other wealthy country has the horrible public health infrastructure and social safety net that we do. As supposedly the world’s only superpower remaining, half a million Americans are homeless and 34 million are impoverished. 
Despite the incompetence and general buffoonery of President Donald Trump’s administration, before 2020 it was still widely reinforced that the United States reigned supreme in global matters. The emergence into the new year was a turning point in which no one could any longer place a muzzle on our crises. By Nov. 3, in the face of a pandemic-induced economic recession, 1,130 coronavirus deaths per day and a chaotic presidential election, it felt like the nation was on the verge of collapse.
Somehow, we’re still hanging onto our semi-functional democracy, and yet, internal conflict, failing socioeconomics and institutional backsliding are all indicators of a failing state.
The United States is a reflection of the violence caused by institutional inequality and poverty. The establishment injustice has made bitter racial and cultural schisms to the point where Black Americans feel criminalized at birth, and Indigenous Americans and people of color are painted by the same stroke.
Conflict zones, where the government fails to provide and leaves groups to fight over basic resources like water and minerals, aren’t found in far-off war-torn worlds; they’re found in our own country. Prime examples like the Navajo Nation; Flint, Michigan; and Baltimore, Maryland are a tribute to hundreds of years of neglect by those in power. 
Adding to these ongoing issues, the comparison of the disconnect between the poor and wealthy today versus 18th and 19th century western Europe put together by French economist, Thomas Piketty, seems to echo in modern America. In the 18th and 19th centuries, even as wages rose, private wealth controlled by the top of a rigid class hierarchy dwarfed national income. Similarly enough, in 1965, a CEO’s paycheck was 20 times the average worker’s salary, and by 2018 CEO compensation was 278 times the typical worker’s earnings. 
In order for the rich to remain on top, the movements of class conflict need to be managed by bringing them to a local level where it’s easy to subdue. In theory, if a conflict reaches and arouses the majority, they lose control.
Unfortunately, conflict being popularized isn’t enough to make change, to make change means securing institutional reform. 
During the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests across the country this past year, the demands for reform were popularized but not implemented. The reason is easy to understand: our country rests on the laurels of laws laid down centuries ago; true reform cannot happen until those same laws are rewritten.
Some die-hard Democrats could argue that the election of President-elect Joe Biden changes the direction that our nation is heading in. But, establishment politics aren’t enough to solve this crisis. To save a failing state, the republic needs to be reconstituted — looking objectively at the blue duo of Biden-Harris, that isn’t going to happen during their term.
Our nation requires fundamental change if we want to remain a legitimate state. We can’t keep cycling through the same worn-out politics and expect there to be a change. 
To achieve the goals that America is in desperate need of, change needs to be made in the bedrock of how we address racism, true separation of church and state, LGBTQ+ rights, education, taxes based on income and restore equity in social services and public health.
To create real change, we need to start from the beginning.

2020-12-07,AU,Democrat,"Allan Lichtman is a professor in American University's College of Arts and Sciences.

After correctly predicting Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, American University professor Allan Lichtman is celebrating his 10th correct prediction of the outcomes of the presidential races since 1984. 
Although Lichtman predicted that former Vice President Al Gore would win the presidential election in 2000, he stands by his prediction. He notes that Gore won the popular vote while Bush won the electoral college in a contentious Supreme Court battle. 
Lichtman has said that he believes the results of Florida make the 2000 election stolen, as there was a large portion of the Black community whose votes were suppressed. After this election, Lichtman changed his evaluation to account for the electoral college. 
Three years before his first prediction, Lichtman met Vladimir Keilis-Borok, a Russian seismologist who would later go on to become his “Odd Couple” pairing in correctly predicting presidential elections. Each brought something to the table to create a unique predicting method.
Keilis-Borok wanted to pair his knowledge of earthquake behaviors with Lichtman’s vast understanding of the American presidency to establish what we now know as the “13 Keys to the White House.” 
“The key to our collaboration was to reconceptualize presidential elections in geophysical terms,” Lichtman said. “Not as Republicans versus Democrats…but as ‘Stability,’ when the White House party keeps the presidency and ‘Earthquake’ when the White House party loses.” 
The 13 keys are all true or false, where true favors the re-election of the party holding the White House, and false favors the opposition party. Six or more false answers result in an “Earthquake.” 
The keys include whether there is a significant third-party candidate, how the short- and long-term economy is doing, and whether the incumbent is charismatic.
As Lichtman is a lifelong Democrat, being objective has major impacts on accuracy and success, he said. 
“The secret to being a successful forecaster is putting aside your own political preferences,” Lichtman said. “If you let your prediction be tainted by your preferences, then you would be useless as a forecaster.” 
In 2016, Lichtman received backlash for his prediction that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump would win, as polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton up double digits in several battleground states. He did note that his prediction was not impacted by Trump specifically, but because the keys swayed against the incumbent Democratic party. No matter who the Republican nominee was, according to his system, they would have won. 
Lichtman said that he believes the coronavirus pandemic has had a monumental impact on Biden’s victory. 
“The COVID pandemic was pivotal in turning this election against Trump,” Lichtman said. “However, it wasn’t just the pandemic, it was the failed response to it.”
With more than 14 million cases of COVID-19, over 280,000 deaths and millions of people filing for government assistance, the pandemic has put a strain on almost every U.S. citizen. 
The professor was very critical of Trump’s reaction to this November’s election results. 
“What we are seeing from Trump and his enablers since the election represents the worst moment in the history of the U.S. presidency,” Lichtman said.

2020-12-09,AU,Democrat,"D.C. celebrated a historic milestone this past summer in the fight for statehood when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would admit certain portions of D.C. as the 51st state. 
Regardless of the outcome, this was a significant achievement for those fighting for statehood, including those in the American University community. Noah Wills, a 2018 alum of the School of Public Affairs, now president of Students for D.C. Statehood, said the bill’s passing in the House was “the pinnacle of the statehood movement.” 
“I felt the excitement from the generations of student leaders and advocates before,” Wills said. “It was a testament to their determination. I’ve only been involved in the movement for about six years, but I’m happy to have contributed something to the past generations’ work.”
Votes were mainly along party lines, with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting the bill. However, the Republican-majority Senate hasn’t taken the bill up for a vote due to unpopular support.
H.R. 51 would declare the state, which currently has a non-voting member of Congress, two senators and a voting representative. The bill would also declare that the state consists of all District territory, with the exclusion of some federal buildings and monuments. The excluded territory would be known as the “Capital.”
ANC 3D07 Commissioner-elect Christian Damiana, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and president of AU Students for D.C. Statehood, shared in the excitement of the moment. 
“When it comes to statehood, progress has been very slow, and the success is rare,” Damiana said. “When success does come, it’s very powerful. We’ve seen more of this over the past few decades with small successes like D.C. getting more budget autonomy.”
Wills said that D.C.’s lack of representation is contrary to the ideals the country upholds. He said that is what drew him to the movement.
“I was astounded when I first heard that the capital of the United States, as a beacon of democracy in the world, doesn’t give its own residents the right to Congress,” Wills said. “I used my four years at American University to study the issue and to learn about why we are where we are, what the arguments for and against it are and why it hasn’t happened yet.”
Through D.C. Students for Statehood, Wills focuses on mobilizing high school and college students through education and advocacy — work he has continued since leading AU’s chapter of the organization. 
Damiana said a goal of the organization is to spread this message of what statehood would mean. 
“A lot of AU students will not stay in D.C. for the rest of their lives,” Damiana said. “Students come to D.C. and learn how important statehood is. Then, when they go back to their home states, hopefully, they’ll tell their family, friends and their representatives and senators how D.C. desperately needs statehood.”
As for the near future, statehood’s support has been on the rise among voters. In polls conducted by Data For Progress, 43 percent of voters supported statehood in September 2020 compared to 35 percent in early 2019. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed support for D.C. statehood, but for now, much is riding on the runoff Senate races in Georgia, where two additional Democratic seats could mean sure progress for the movement. 
Wills and Damiana hope to see more substantial change in the future as they continue to work toward their shared goal.
“D.C. statehood is a pathway to economic justice, to labor rights and to saving our environment and eventually passing the Green New Deal,” Damiana said. “Many of these things will never be able to pass the U.S. Senate without statehood. Statehood would be the clearest showing of what D.C. residents can do for America if we let them.”

2021-01-06,AU,Democrat,"In this October 2019 file photo, Trump supporters demonstrate during the March for Trump.
Correction and update: This article has been corrected since it was first published to clarify that an AU-branded bus photographed transporting National Guard personnel was not previously owned by the University. It has also been updated with comments from a University-wide email sent by President Sylvia Burwell Thursday.
In a University-wide email sent Thursday evening, President Sylvia Burwell called on the American University community to “address the systemic challenges on display and to care for each other,” following a pro-Trump insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. 
Burwell also said that the effects of these events on communities of color and systemic racism must be confronted too. 
“The events at the Capitol were the antithesis of our AU community’s values of dignity, justice, inclusion, and truth,” she wrote. “While we reckon with the challenges of this moment, we will continue to act in pursuit of those values. That includes the antiracism work fundamental to our university, and the overall pursuit of knowledge, truth, community, and progress that is central to our mission and critical to further our democracy.”
Burwell wrote that the University will continue to monitor events and adjust security precautions if necessary and that AU is focused on risks that may arise around the presidential inauguration. She urged students to take care of both their physical and emotional well-being and to download apps such as the AU Rave Guardian Safety app and to make use of resources like the Counseling Center and Kay Spiritual Life Center. 
While most staff are currently working remotely, Burwell said in her email that the University is supporting the team members and making alternate arrangements for those whose presence is still required on campus. 
On Wednesday, Burwell condemned the right-wing rioters on Twitter, calling their actions “a threat to democracy.”
Burwell denounced the mob, tweeting, “There is no place in our society for violence or attacks on our democratic institutions and the people who diligently serve our nation. We condemn the rioters and stand united in support of our democracy and those defending it.” 
Today's reprehensible actions at the U.S. Capitol are an unacceptable threat to democracy. There is no place in our society for violence or attacks on our democratic institutions and the people who diligently serve our nation.
Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw tweeted Wednesday that the events marked ""a sad and distressing day in America.""
“AUPD has increased patrols and visibility on campus and on our off-site locations,” said Assistant Vice President of University Police Phillip Morse in an email to The Eagle. “This has been done as a precaution and to give confidence to our community should they be using our facilities. We will continue to monitor events and adjust our security precautions as necessary.” 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser instituted a 12-hour curfew following the forced entry of right-wing rioters into the Capitol Building and chambers, starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday and lifting at 6 a.m. Thursday. Media and other essential workers are exempt from the order, Bowser said. 
Bowser also extended a public emergency order Wednesday, leading up to the inauguration.
The mob forced the Capitol into lockdown and halted the count of electoral votes, forcing lawmakers and staff to evacuate. According to the Associated Press, one person was shot inside the Capitol Building.
Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Dustin Sternbeck said the woman shot had died, according to CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
WMATA announced Wednesday that Metrorail and Metrobus services would end services at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively, in the “interest of public safety.” 
Lisa Stark, a University spokesperson, clarified that an AU-branded bus photographed transporting National Guard personnel to the Capitol was not previously owned by the University.

The few classes at American University and Washington College of Law meant to be held in-person following the beginning of the spring semester will be held online through Jan. 24 due to “security concerns,” University officials announced in an email on Tuesday. 
While most courses were already planning to meet online, a few exceptions for certain classes are still impacted. In addition, the officials asked community members to avoid AU’s campus — especially via public transportation — until Jan. 25. 
University officials and the Office of Information Technology also requested that faculty members increase security for their online classes and other meetings held via Zoom by limiting access to only those with AU email accounts. They also advised faculty to carefully manage access for meetings with external personnel. Officials hope that these changes will prevent instances of “Zoom bombing,” where hostile users connect to a meeting to disrupt it, as AU College Democrats experienced during a Student Government debate in April. 
“With the ongoing security concerns in Washington, DC following the January 6 events at the US Capitol and in preparation for any potential incidents in the lead-up to the January 20 presidential inauguration, all AU class meetings, including at the Washington College of Law, will be fully online through January 24,” the officials wrote. [Emphasis from original]. 
The guidance from Acting Provost Peter Starr, Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw and Vice President and Chief Information Officer Steve Munson follows the insurrection at the Capitol on Wednesday and an email from Aw on Monday advising students to avoid downtown D.C. due to safety concerns surrounding the presidential inauguration and possible increased coronavirus spread from the crowds. 
They also encouraged faculty to set up recurring Zoom class meetings with the additional security guidance, and directed anyone with questions to the OIT Help Desk at helpdesk@american.edu. 
On Monday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asked Americans to participate virtually in the presidential inauguration instead of coming to the District. Bowser also enacted an order last Wednesday to extend a state of emergency until Jan 21.

2021-02-13,AU,Democrat,"Multiple American University alumni began their positions in the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following the historic inauguration on Jan. 20.
Michael LaRosa, who earned a master’s in political science and government from the School of Public Affairs, serves as the press secretary to First Lady Jill Biden. Most recently, LaRosa worked as the chief spokesperson and traveling press secretary to Jill Biden during the 2020 campaign. 
LaRosa attended AU immediately after completing his undergraduate degree at Seton Hall University. LaRosa spent his days on Capitol Hill working full time as an executive assistant to former Rep. Melissa Bean, D-Ill., and his nights taking graduate classes. 
“In my second year of graduate school, I took a class called Voting Behavior. It had a profound impact on how I processed why people vote and what factors they consider before making up their minds,” LaRosa said. “It developed my understanding of voters, how they reason, and the importance of the media and campaigns on voter attitudes which ultimately affect how they vote.”
LaRosa said his classes had a substantial impact on his career. He and his favorite professor, Masaki Hidaka, who taught The Presidency, are still in touch today. 
“He has the right combination of being responsive, responsible, generous, loyal and smart. And I think that's what you need in his role,” Hidaka said. “You have to believe in the person you work for, and so I know that he believes in Dr. Biden, and that is going to make him even better at his job.”
After receiving his master’s degree from SPA, LaRosa worked as a producer for “Hardball with Chris Matthews” for six years and then went on to work for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as deputy director for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. 
Shuwanza Goff, who earned a master’s from SPA, is also familiar with working in the House. 
Goff serves as the White House deputy director of legislative affairs and liaison to the House. Goff spent most of the past 12 years working in various capacities for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. 
Goff broke racial barriers in 2019 as the first Black woman to serve as floor director. 
Goff’s work in the House has earned her the reputation of a highly experienced and talented individual who has become an expert on the legislative process, Hoyer said in a press release on Nov. 23. Pelosi also released a statement following Goff’s nomination. 
“Over twelve years of working for Leader Hoyer, Shuwanza has distinguished herself as effective and experienced and has earned the bipartisan respect of Members and staff across the aisle and across the Capitol,” Pelosi said.“In the White House, she will continue to be an effective force, as she coordinates and strengthens the work of the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress to deliver For The People.”
Thomas Winslow, who earned a bachelor’s from the School of Communication, is Biden’s senior adviser to the deputy chief of staff. Winslow worked as the chief of staff to the campaign manager during Biden’s campaign.
Melanie Nakagawa, who earned a law degree from the Washington College of Law, is Biden’s senior director for climate and energy. Before joining the Biden administration, Nakagawa, who also earned a master’s from the School of International Service, worked for Princeville Global as the head of climate initiative. 
Prior to Princeville Global, she served as a strategic adviser for then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s Policy Planning Staff. 
Following Nakagawa’s appointment, Kerry congratulated her on Twitter.
“Thrilled to see Melanie Nakagawa joining the NSC on climate,” he tweeted “She's seen and done so much on this issue, from the Senate and to the State Department, and will be a terrific team member addressing the climate crisis.”

2021-03-09,AU,Democrat,"GOP strategist and TV political commentator Ana Navarro spoke about her experiences in politics, media and current events at a Kennedy Political Union event on Thursday. 
The School of Communication and the American University College Republicans co-hosted the conversation with Navarro, which was moderated by SOC professor Jane Hall. Central to the discussion were Navarro’s thoughts on the future of the GOP — a future, she says, that will be without party unity, at least in the short term. That’s not to say that Democrats don’t have their own internal issues, she said. 
“If we’re going to be fair, I think there’s a lot of diversity of thought within the Democratic Party as well. Their divisions, their cracks, their systems — are about ideology, they’re not about personality,” Navarro said in a student media interview before the event. “In the Republican Party, the division and the schism we are seeing right now, it’s not about principles, it’s not about convictions, it’s not about policy issues — it’s about Donald Trump.”
Navarro said she is not sure what will happen to anti-Trump Republicans as the GOP moves forward. Navarro belongs to the prominent group of Republicans, often termed “Never Trumpers,” who broke away from the party following the then-candidate’s nomination in 2016. 
“The purity test that some want to apply [within the GOP] is, ‘do you support Donald Trump or not,’ and so for me, that’s no longer a political party,” Navarro said in the student media interview. “The people who are with Trump think those of us who want should no longer be in the Republican Party and, go I guess die somewhere, knit, pickup golf? Maybe not golf.” 
Now with President Joe Biden’s administration in power, Navarro said that she and her colleagues in multiple networks realized how many topics they can discuss without Trump dominating their time. News has been very U.S.-centric since Trump took office, and Navarro is looking forward to discussing other topics on her shows. 
“We are again as a media talking about things like the Iran deal, talking about things like Syria, talking about things like the Paris Climate accord,” Navarro said in the interview. “We’ve been constantly responding to a 24/7 Twitter live president, and that was to the detriment of looking beyond our borders to what is happening in the world that also affects us.”
During the event, Navarro spoke about her moral reasoning and decision process behind voting for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential election, despite being a life-long Republican. 
“There was no choice because I’m a human, I’m an American, I’m an immigrant, I’m a Latina, I’m a woman — before being a Republican,” Navarro said. “I’m not going to vote for somebody who I think is just completely unfit, morally, and frankly, intellectually, just because of a party label.”
Navarro also said that she has dealt with a lot of hate — including daily racist and misogynist attacks on social media — and faces constant threats for being vocal about her support for the Biden-Harris administration. Even some of her good friends would turn their faces when seeing Navarro at the same restaurant, she said. 
As an outspoken female political commentator, Navarro advocated for more women to join the field. Especially with more awareness about gender inequality brought up in the #MeToo movement, she said she has noticed some changes within the primarily male-dominated media industry. 
At CNN, for example, where Navarro said most hosts have historically been male, more women are being brought on than ever before. 
In response to a question from AUCR about how to engage in civil discourse with those who hold opposing views, Navarro spoke about her experiences critiquing then-President Barack Obama on CNN with her colleague and former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile, who Navarro described as an Obama defender and advocate.
“Oftentimes after debating vigorously, we’d go have drinks, and oysters, or whatever watering hole in Washington, and people would walk in and marvel because they have just seen us fighting on TV,” Navarro said. “And I just think you make a conscious decision, ‘okay, I am going to talk to this person. … I’m going to try to listen to what they say and tell them how I feel.’ I do draw a line on conspiracy theorists and white supremacists and racists and bigots.”

2021-05-12,AU,Democrat,"Editor's note: The subheading of this story has been corrected with proper spelling of Brock's name.
Outgoing Student Government President Eric Brock’s call to establish a community advisory board over the American University Police Department in February has made progress over the last month, including meetings with University leadership and more concrete plans in development. 
While the plan is still in its early stages, Fanta Aw, vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence at AU, confirmed that Brock’s idea is under consideration after being submitted to Douglas Kudravetz, the outgoing CFO and vice president who oversees AUPD. 
The next step, Aw said, is to develop a more detailed proposal. 
Brock’s plan for the Police Oversight Committee involves three steps. First, implementing a community oversight board over AUPD that would provide accountability and an avenue for community members to make their voices heard on the role of the department. After step two — accountability — is achieved, the majority of the board could vote on a possible step three: defunding the department.
The oversight board would be a transition, Brock said. 
“As a community, we come to the consensus that there needs to be community accountability for AUPD, which then establishes the community oversight for AUPD, then handles all the oversight, handles all the policy recommendations, it moves it out of HR into a more community-oriented format,” Brock said. “Then, that’s where it starts to come to the question — when you’re talking about policies, you’re also talking about defunding.”
According to Brock’s plan, the board would be made up of students, faculty and staff who can formally advocate for changes to AUPD. It would provide a space for the community to share their experiences with the department and to suggest changes and adaptations to benefit the campus as a whole. 
Ideally, Brock said he wants the board located high in AU’s power structure, rather than being relegated to a small, relatively powerless SG committee that he believes administrators could easily ignore. Both the University’s vice president of campus life and the chief financial officer need to sit on it, as their presence in a room with students and faculty will have more of a “bite,” he said. Brock hopes that decisions made in this context will be binding.
But what do oversight and defunding look like? Brock acknowledged that the words mean different things to everyone, but his vision involves moving money from what he terms a more “militarized” AUPD into student programs, the health center, counseling center and the Center for Diversity and Inclusion. Most importantly, he wants to see more investment in students.
However, he’s not interested in collecting signatures or campaigning on the issue again. Brock was elected to advocate, he said, and he’s not concerned about student buy-in, especially during a pandemic. Instead, if you’ve got an opinion, he encourages you to reach out directly.
“For far too long, we’ve waited for the University to take action that would protect Black students,” Brock said in an email to The Eagle. “I don’t think we need to campaign for buy-in. In fact, I think it’s long overdue. And the conversations in the Black community have reflected that for generations.”
It’s absolutely vital, he said, that affinity organizations, students of color and especially Black students are given the platform to oversee and advocate for change surrounding AUPD. Communities of color are disproportionately policed across the U.S., and protests against AUPD in recent years underline the issue. 
Brock isn’t the only student leader calling for the implementation of an oversight board. Christian Damiana, the ANC 3D07 commissioner and a junior in the School of Public Affairs, said he’s “absolutely” in favor of the idea.
“Even when things are going well, there’s still things that students will have opinions about and should be given an opportunity to share,” Damiana said. “First off is how much money is being spent on AUPD. Are those resources that could be better allocated elsewhere?”
While Damiana doesn’t have a firm position on defunding, he believes that students deserve the opportunity to voice their opinions. He’s also concerned about the relationship between AUPD and D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department, an organization dogged by controversy over police brutality and misconduct in recent years. 
The MPD did not respond to The Eagle’s request for comment. 
Damiana also hopes that the proposed board might include local residents, not just campus community members. Some have had experiences with AUPD, he said, and although most see the department positively, its presence affects much of the surrounding area. 
Interested students should reach out to him, the ANC and President Sylvia Burwell’s office, Damiana said.
Police defunding and abolition have also garnered support from several student organizations. The Asian-American Student Union, Latinx and American Student Organization, Muslim Student Association, AU College Democrats and AU PRIDE cosigned a statement in August, stating that the University “must set an example of what inclusion truly means and abolish AUPD.”
The statement notes disparities in the University’s budget. AUPD and Parking and Commuter Services operated with over $8 million in the fiscal year 2020 while the Office of Campus Life, which is home to 17 different offices including the Counseling Center, received $17 million.
“It’s about reallocating funds to prevention methods because really, the police department is reactionary,” said Jeremy Ward, president of AU College Democrats. “The social services are more preventative. It’s shifting, on campus, money from a reactionary department to an underfunded, preventative department.”
Unlike the existing campus police advisory board at the University of Michigan, which staffs two students, two faculty members and two staff members, Ward said that he would like to see an oversight committee with a larger operating staff.
“The composition of the panel has to look like the University,” Ward said. “That being said, you want to have affinity groups at the table. NAACP should be at the table, BSU or other Black groups, other minority groups and organizations that often don’t get the spotlight. You also want to have students who may not be in on-campus leadership. It has to span different classes. Members of HPAC and the counseling center should be there.”
The conversation of police abolition has been at the forefront since, and even before, the nationwide movement in the summer of 2020. Brock said that while defunding is a possibility in the future, all he’s asking for right now is oversight and a seat at the table. More, he hopes, will come later, once student voices are reliably included in institutional decision-making. 
Brock’s proposal is flexible — a vital component of negotiating with the University, he said. He’s learned that it’s all about compromise, even if that means keeping plans relatively vague for a period. 
Once the University provides him with more comprehensive information about AUPD, such as its budget and policies, Brock plans to get more specific with his request. However, he doesn’t plan to compromise on everything. 
“We’re not interested in defunding small amounts,” Brock said. “We’re not abolishing, but we’re also not interested in getting bargaining chips, right? We want to make sure that this is a proportional amount that actually creates a smart investment in our students, specifically our BIPOC students.”
Brock’s term as student body president has recently ended. While he hopes students will continue the initiative, he recognizes that’s not a guarantee. He’s planning to continue working on the proposal, and has meetings scheduled with University stakeholders, he said. 
“I hope after this pandemic that people really start to question these systemic issues as they have this past summer, and really sit down and start to think, ‘We can use this organization, we can use these sugar-coated positions to really change the dynamics on campus, we can organize in a way that we used to as a people in terms of the civil rights movement,’” Brock said.

2021-08-02,AU,Democrat,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
Despite its reputation for politics and international affairs, American University boasts a growing population of science majors. A tight-knit community of five, the science students spoke with The Seagle at the grand opening of the new science building last week.
“Sophomore year, I spent $26.99 on a hard copy of Mary Wollstonecraft’s ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Women’ just so I could use the front cover to conceal my Calculus textbook,” rising senior Daniya Newman said. 
While Newman lamented financial losses, others grieved the loss of time spent trying to fit in with their peers. 
“My first year at AU, I struggled to make friends. As an alternative to Greek life, I familiarized myself with common topics in international relations,” neuroscience major Travis Massey said. “I started with the anarchical structure of the global order and spiraled from there, eventually publishing a piece in AU’s undergraduate research journal ‘Clocks and Clouds’ on the long-run viability of democratic peace theory.” 
Massey looks forward to pursuing his goal of becoming a chemist without the pressure to fit in with the IR majors. 
Other student interviewees included Yasmin Ayad and Nick Johnson, both of whom are data science majors and occupy a unique space between the “in” and “out” groups. While Ayad completes her homework in the bathroom, Johnson opts not to complete it at all. 
“The decision to forgo homework entirely was very hard,” said Johnson, “but ultimately worth the public humiliation it would have cost me to pull up an Excel sheet in public.” Ayad nodded in agreement. 
“But was it worth the internal humiliation of succumbing to the external pressures of the student body and in turn becoming somewhat of an undriven cattle roaming aimlessly towards a false promise of reward?” Massey added. 
Johnson’s face turned red. “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just trying to play devil’s advocate.”
When President Sylvia Burwell finally snipped the ribbon and unveiled the bright halls of the new building, the students erupted with applause. They marveled at their newfound place of study, beaming at the sight of empty tables devoid of IR students and CLEG majors. 
Undoubtedly, the day marked a new beginning for all five science majors alike. 
During editing, The Seagle was informed that there are only four science majors, as “Nick Johnson” and “Nicholas Johnson” are the same person.

2021-10-12,AU,Democrat,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
This year’s display of sticky note messages on the inside of residence hall windows lacked the pizazz students had come to expect from their peers.
The messages, made out of hundreds of individual sticky notes, reflected a steep decline from previous years in terms of quantity, variety, and creativity, according to students familiar with the situation.
“During the Democratic primaries in 2020, everyone would spell out which candidate they were supporting,” junior Linda Estrada said. “Now it’s like a heart here, a smiley face there. How are we supposed to keep up our reputation as one of the most liberal colleges in the country with those sort of amateur tactics?”
Only 30 percent of this year’s sticky note designs have anything to do with electoral politics, according to an Eagle tally — an all-time low for the University. 
Another point of contention among students concerned is the perception that fewer students care about decorating their windows this year. 
“I remember in my freshman year someone organized the whole fifth floor of Letts to spell out a sentence going down the line of windows,” senior Delia Mathis said. “Now the freshmen claim they have more important things to do like studying for class. Give me a break!”
Students are not the only ones impacted by this trend.
“I’m really miffed that students aren’t taking their window decorations seriously,” said Celia Bennett, director of undergraduate admissions. “A robust sticky note display on the residence hall windows can help us entice prospective parents. It shows them that AU kids don’t have enough time to drink and carouse if they’re designing, planning and arranging intricate sticky note designs on their windows.” 
Students reported a conspiracy theory circulating, which implicates disgruntled George Washington University students in the demise of AU’s creative sticky note messages on windows. The connection between GWU students and the lack of creativity of AU students remains to be seen.

On Nov. 6, 2021, Congress voted to pass the bill, a bipartisan deal that aims to rebuild infrastructure across the country, as well as expand access to services such as drinking water and internet access. 
The infrastructure bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden on Nov. 15. According to a statement released by the White House, the legislation will add an average 1.5 million jobs per year for the next 10 years.
Claire Whitman, a junior in the School of International Service and the president of the American University College Democrats, said she is in favor of the infrastructure bill.
“I’m from a rural state,” Whitman said. “I think we can really see the impacts of rural broadband of crumbling roads and bridges, that’s very basic infrastructure, but also some of the more modern technological investments.”
Whitman said the fact that the infrastructure bill passed in such a bipartisan manner was a big deal to her.
According to the White House, D.C. is expected to receive over $1.2 billion in funding toward the improvement of public transportation over the next five years.
Dr. Andrew Ballard, an assistant professor of government in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes it is good Congress collects and redistributes money toward projects that are beneficial to the public.
“That said, there are all sorts of infrastructure problems in the United States that didn’t make it into this bill,” Ballard said. “So there’s always more work to do. And this is kind of how policymaking in the United States is set up, that it is a lot easier to have incremental changes rather than extremely large changes.”
The passage of the infrastructure bill comes as Build Back Better, a framework created by the Biden Administration, heads to the U.S. Senate for debate and a vote.
Build Back Better, which passed the House of Representatives on Nov. 19, promises to combat climate change, provide universal and free preschool and expand the U.S.’s affordable health care program.
Sal Cottone, a freshman in the SIS and a member of the Sunrise Movement at AU, a youth-led organization dedicated to fighting for climate and environmental justice said both the infrastructure bill and Build Back Better need to be passed together.
“If we kept the infrastructure bill as is, we would have saw nothing towards climate change, it would have actually funded more fossil fuel production and in turn, would have basically went against everything that we were fighting for, which is why we have Build Back Better, which in our opinion, needs to be passed hand in hand with the infrastructure bill,” Cottone said. “You can’t just have one or the other, they both have to go hand in hand.”
While Cottone is worried that Democratic Senator Joe Manchin will vote no on the Build Back Better bill, he remains hopeful.
“In general, I’m hopeful because even if he votes no, I know our generation will rise up like we’ve been doing and even in a bigger fashion, because this is the first step to combat the climate crisis,” Cottone said. “And if it’s voted no on that, we have nothing left.”
The Sunrise Movement at AU is currently on their third week of organizing a sit-in protest for the Build Back Better bill. 
According to Whitman, both the infrastructure and Build Back Better bills address the impacts that these investments have on people’s lives.
“As a Democrat, and as a student who represents the Democratic Party on campus, I’m pleased to see that the party is making these investments, because I think that's really what they were elected to do.”

2022-01-10,AU,Democrat,"American University’s Disabled Student Union is petitioning University administrators to require frequent coronavirus testing of all faculty and students in the name of equal and safe education for community members with disabilities.
The petition says that the University’s lack of enforcement of safety measures limits students’ access to the right to a safe and equal education guaranteed to them in Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. By testing community members at least twice a month, the University could help to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable students in the process, according to DSU.
According to DSU President Katherine Greenstein, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs,  DSU met in December and expressed a number of frustrations with the University’s existing testing policies.
“Our members were feeling very frustrated, because we’ve spent two years watching our community kind of be seen as disposable,” Greenstein said.
After expressing these frustrations, a member suggested students take matters into their own hands and write a petition. 
“I drafted it in a night … I had to write it, I got a bunch of people to look over it, I posted it,” Greenstein said. “And then it’s been kind of a whirlwind since because it picked up quite a bit of attention.”
The petition now has over 1,600 signatures and has garnered support from a number of campus organizations, including the AU College Democrats and the SPA Undergraduate Council. Sixteen members of the American University Student Government Undergraduate Senate later signed their own letter of support for the petition. 
“Not only does mandated testing provide additional protection for the health of the student body and the DC community, but it follows suit with universities such as George Washington University, Cornell University and others who have implemented similar measures to increase campus safety,” SG Senate representatives wrote in their letter.
The Disability+ Faculty and Staff Affinity Group, co-founded in part by Tanja Aho and Anna Cook, also expressed its support for the petition, helping to publicize it and garner support. 
“We believe that the Disabled Student Union is absolutely correct in asking AU to step up and do better and provide more safety and protection for its students through regular testing. To us, the safety of students and, of course, the faculty and staff as well should always come first before any other considerations,” Aho said. “And if we want to resume in person classes and be back in community, we need to do so in a safe way that protects all of our community members.”
In a recent question and answer session with SG President Chyna Brodie, Brodie said that the University is unable to mandate frequent testing due to limitations posed by its partnership with external testing party ShieldT3 and a lack of an in-house lab at the University to process testing results. 
“​​This petition … does not represent viable change here at American University because it fails to acknowledge the capacity of our school to conduct primary COVID-19 testing compared to other university systems,” Brodie said in the Q&A. 
In an email to The Eagle, Elizabeth Deal, University spokesperson, wrote that the administration is “requiring testing for all AU community members … before and once returning to campus/affiliated AU buildings.”
“We continue to employ a comprehensive approach using all available tools, while following the data to mitigate risk. We will also continue to review and adapt our policies and protocols as necessary to ensure the ongoing safety of our community,” Deal wrote. “We have offered testing since the start of the academic year and the data shows our community is utilizing testing, particularly during higher risk periods, such as travel and during surges.”
Cook said in an interview with The Eagle that she feels privileged to be working remotely and knows many faculty and staff members who still feel unsafe. 
“It’s not just something on this student's mind, it was also something on the mind of faculty and staff as well, especially when we were talking about meeting students face to face in small offices,” Cook said.
Greenstein emphasized the positive impact that mandatory testing would have on DSU members and on the University as a whole.
“Our organization was anxious, our members were anxious, we were struggling, because it is hard to handle being scared for your life and trying to learn at a collegiate level at the same time,” Greenstein said.
For Greenstein, the decision to start the petition was a sign that they were no longer willing to wait for the University to take action. 
“The University should be including marginalized communities in discussion of policy and disabled people especially should be especially privy to conversations surrounding public health,” Greenstein said. “This is what affects us. That is the whole point. And the fact that we weren’t included in that discussion, the fact that our voices haven't been heard in that discussion is why the petition became necessary in the first place because they weren't listening to us.”

2022-02-10,AU,Democrat,"In an Advisory Neighborhood Commission Meeting for ANC 3D on Feb. 2, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton answered questions about her activity in Congress and advocacy for D.C. statehood.
The district’s non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives answered questions about the “Build Back Better” plan, pushing priorities forward while Democrats retain Congressional control, mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on the city and her efforts to achieve D.C. statehood.
Norton outlined her efficacy as a representative and detailed how she has helped the district in Congress recently. 
“I was rated the most effective House Democrat by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, and last Congress, I was rated the second most effective non-full committee chair among House Democrats,” Norton said. “This Congress, of the 80 bills I have introduced thus far 18 have moved, at least through committee and two have been signed into law.”
Attendees were asked to submit their questions for Norton before the meeting, most of which covered activities in Congress and their impacts on district residents. 
Unifying Democratic control under the threat of losing control of Congress is a priority for 2022, but is limited by the filibuster, Norton said. 
“The House has passed my D.C. statehood bill and my bill to give them air control over the D.C. National Guard, but they can't pass because of the filibuster,” Norton said. 
However, Norton’s provision to increase the annual D.C. tuition access grant awards from $10,000 to $15,000 in the D.C. Appropriations Bill is likely to succeed despite the filibuster. 
With regards to D.C. statehood, Norton said it feels “very close, yet very far away right now.” Fifty-four percent of the American people support D.C. statehood, and understanding this and mobilization are key to getting statehood passed, Norton said.
“The biggest hurdles to pass are the filibuster and getting Americans activated on this issue,” Norton said. “Republicans in the House and Senate have introduced more than 20 bills and amendments this Congress to overturn D.C. policies. Six members have tried to overturn D.C. vaccine policies of all things. I will defeat all these efforts just as I have defeated virtually every effort to overturn D.C. laws in more than a decade.”
Many of the questions from the public centered on the power Congressional legislation has over the district, and Norton made it clear that D.C. interests are her main priority. 
“As a matter of home rule, I don’t weigh in on council legislation,” Norton said. “My job is to defend in Congress whatever legislation Congress passes, so if I weighed in, that would be held against the district, whatever passes.”
Norton detailed the way the country’s COVID-19 policies have failed and expressed frustration with the misinformation and disinformation that have, “caused many needless deaths,” in response to a question about how these policies will continue to impact locals. 
“I’m very concerned that we are no better prepared to confront new challenges in this pandemic or future pandemics. Our healthcare workforce is exhausted and quitting in large numbers and we have an underfunded and fragmented public health system,” Norton said. “COVID will likely be around forever and we will need to be prepared to relax and scale up public health measures based on what the virus does.”
Norton closed by answering several more locally based questions from members of the ANC 3D neighborhood and providing questioners with relevant contacts in her office.

2022-04-11,AU,Democrat,"Congressman and American University alumnus Jim McGovern (MA-2) discussed his career and the political issues facing the country at an event hosted by the Kennedy Political Union on Wednesday.
School of Public Affairs Dean Vicki Wilkins moderated the event and asked McGovern questions about his life, political work and perspective on current events. 
McGovern began by describing his experience as a student at AU, looking back on the people, places and opportunities that shaped his undergraduate years. 
“I loved every minute,” he said. “I had some great courses, I made some great friends who are lifelong friends to this day, I had incredible discussions and I had this incredible internship with George McGovern that’s still among my most cherished memories on Capitol Hill.” 
Upholding this culture of activism, McGovern mentioned how he led a protest against his graduation speaker, economist George Gilder, where he convinced several students and their parents to turn their backs to the stage during Gilder’s speech. 
“He had written some pretty controversial things, like there was no discrimination against Black women,” he said. “We all had black armbands on and we stood and turned our backs in protest when he spoke.” 
McGovern said that losing his first congressional campaign in 1994 taught him important lessons that helped him win on his second bid, despite little support from his personal and political circles. 
“When I announced [my run] both times, nobody thought it was a good idea,” he said. “I had never run for anything in my life other than class treasurer when I was a senior in high school, so there was not a lot of establishment support.” 
McGovern said his decision to run again in 1996 was fueled by a desire to run a better race the second time and a belief that he was more equipped for the job than the incumbent candidate. 
“The most important thing was that I wanted to do it,” he said. “It enabled me to get up every day in spite of the odds and campaign my heart out.” 
McGovern has won reelection in each subsequent term since his first successful bid in 1996. Some highlights of his career include starting the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, which provides school meals to nearly nine million of the world’s poorest children, and the Innovative Approaches to Literacy Program, an initiative that strives to improve literacy skills for children and students from birth through 12th grade. 
Another pivotal moment in his career took place on Jan. 6 of last year. McGovern was inside the Capitol Chamber overseeing the certification of the electoral college when the crowd of insurrectionists infiltrated the building. 
“It was really a terrorist attack, not just on the building, but on our democracy,” McGovern said. “I was in the chair, I took over for Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, and I was hearing shouts in the corridor … I was getting texts from my daughter saying ‘Where are you? What are you doing?’” 
McGovern said the emotional effects of what he witnessed that day still linger. 
“When I walk to work and I see the Capitol building, I still get emotional when I think about what it symbolized, and to see people ripping it apart,” he said. 
Speaking of the rioters, McGovern said, “Looking at their faces, if you asked me to describe what hate looks like, I would tell you it is what I saw in the eyes of these people.” He added that the rioters were there “to nullify and overturn the will of the American people.”
McGovern expressed dismay at his Republican colleagues who continue to downplay the events of that day. 
“I serve with people who say that the people who attacked us were patriots,” he said. “I can barely look at them, I can’t get into an elevator with them … 140 Capitol police officers were injured, staffers were traumatized … so to glorify any part of that day to me is sick.” 
McGovern also warned against letting history repeat itself, saying another coup “will happen again” if those involved are not held accountable. 
Asked how Congress can move forward, McGovern said that the upcoming midterm elections are a “crossroads” for protecting democracy against a future of “authoritarianism” and “fascism.” 
“If Republicans win the House or the Senate in the midterms, that is a reward to Trump, it’s a reward to those who are the ones who were cheering on those who wanted to nullify the election,” he said. “I think that strengthens their ranks, and it means the Republican party moves more and more in that direction.” 
Despite the circumstances, McGovern said he still holds hope that democracy will prevail, but added that protecting democracy is contingent on people being politically active. 
“It's not enough for us to be able to think good thoughts or to be able to argue in a classroom over policy,” he said. “If you really care about this stuff, you’ll find a way to put your energy into something of service.” 
Born into a family of small business owners, McGovern developed an interest in politics after seeing the economic challenges that his parents faced running their liquor store in Worcester, Massachusetts. Once he became a student at AU, McGovern worked his way through the ranks, interning in the office of Senator George McGovern, to whom he isn’t related, before graduating with a B.A. in history and working in the office of Democratic Congressman Joe Moakley. 
McGovern was asked to share some tips with students looking to build a career in politics. His advice: “Just run.” 
“Lightning can strike,” he said. “If you wanna do it, do it, and give it your best.”

2022-07-05,AU,Democrat,"A mural commemorates the history of Tenleytown
Many incumbents emerged victorious in citywide primaries and progressives succeeded in council races in the D.C. primary election held on June 21. The election centered around issues such as housing and homelessness, policing and crime, education and transportation.
Although the June 21 election was the primary election, D.C. is historically a Democratic stronghold and Democratic primary winners almost always go on to win the general election.
Mayor Muriel Bowser won the Democratic nomination for mayor again, likely making her the second ever D.C. mayor to hold the office for three or more terms, with Marion Barry being the first. Bowser won 49 percent of the vote, beating out more progressive challengers such as Robert White, who trailed her by only 10,000 votes, with close to 41 percent of the vote.
In Ward 3, progressive Matthew Frumin secured the nomination for the seat left open by former Councilmember Mary Cheh. In the weeks leading up to the election, several other progressive candidates strategically dropped out of the race in order to avoid splitting the progressive vote and afford Frumin the votes necessary to win against more moderate Democrat Eric Goulet.
In another open race, in Ward 5, progressive Zachary Parker, secured a win against his six competitors, winning approximately 44 percent of the vote. Brian Schwalb is set to succeed Karl Racine as D.C. attorney general, who served as the city’s first elected attorney general. Until 2015, D.C.’s mayor appointed the city’s attorney generals.
Progressive Ward 1 councilmember Brianne Nadeau retained her seat, winning 48 percent of the vote, as did Charles Allen who ran unopposed for the nomination in Ward 6.
Incumbents won their races across the rest of the district Eleanor Holmes Norton won 87 percent of the vote, securing the Democratic nomination for the D.C. delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives primary. Phil Mendelson held onto his position as D.C. council chair, but defeated candidate Erin Palmer only by about 8,000 votes. Anita Bonds, councilmember-at-large, won her primary, a citywide race, with a plurality of the vote.
Turnout in the election was at a decade high, at around 32 percent, approximately 130,000 of D.C.'s around 410,000 eligible voters. Primary election turnout had not been above 30 percent since 2010, when 37 percent voted. In the 2020 primary, turnout was slightly lower than this year, at 28 percent, and in 2018, only 19 percent of eligible voters turned out to polls. 
According to the D.C. Board of Elections website, two thirds of votes were cast via mail-in or special ballot. Election board spokesman Nick Jacobs told the Washington Post that about 30,000 ballots were submitted via drop box or mail on Tuesday alone, and the board was “stunned at the magnitude.”
Few Republicans ran in the primaries, however, those who did, such as David Krucoff in Ward 3, or Giuseppe Niosi for the at-large seat, were virtually unopposed and will face their Democratic opponents in the general election this November.

2022-09-06,AU,Democrat,"This article is an opinion piece and does not necessarily reflect the views of The Eagle and its staff.
Global warming inspired a global movement. Activists from New York to New Delhi are united in calling for decarbonizing the earth’s electricity. Efforts to address the inequities created and deepened by climate change, collectively dubbed “climate justice,” is a growing movement of its own. Yet, this movement is missing a critical component: Addressing the power structures through which our electric grid is administered.
We must transition to renewable energy, but the vision for who will shape the transition is underdeveloped. The management of our electric grid in the United States is undemocratic. Taking on the fossil fuel industry is a wider task than most people realize. Yes, it requires taking on oil companies and yes, it involves taking on sellout politicians. But we can do both of these things, and control over the transition will still largely be in the hands of monopolies and other unrepresentative institutions that manage the electric grid.
Tackling global warming means rethinking our electricity generation, so developing a new vision for our electricity management is paramount. A talented group of almost two dozen American University students is working on doing just that. The Energy Democracy Coalition (EDCO) is a student-run filmmaking non profit organization based right here at American University. By highlighting a diverse array of community efforts to re-think who controls the grid, EDCO’s goal is to show people around our country and the world how they can take power over the grid and save the planet. So what is EDCO’s vision for the future of the grid?
Empowering communities to have a say in how they get their electricity, often referred to as “energy democracy,” is the core of EDCO’s vision because energy democracy is an angle for climate action that bypasses federal gridlock, cuts emissions and empowers communities in one fell swoop. 
How does energy democracy work? The key is scalability and decentralization. The chief frustration of the climate movement today is its inability to swing the world’s major institutions towards substantive action decisively. By scaling down efforts to a community-by-community approach, things change.
Let’s do a thought experiment: Imagine what it would take to make the whole U.S. stop contributing to climate change. It’s a massive, overwhelming task. It requires that we electrify almost three hundred million cars, heat a hundred and forty million homes without gas, redesign air travel, rethink maritime shipping and the list goes on. At the nationwide scale of reference, fighting climate change seems almost impossible.
Now, let's imagine something else. Picture instead what it would take to make just your hometown carbon neutral. Suddenly, the world shrinks, and the impossible tasks of climate action crystallize into manageable goals. Electricity, for example, is often the largest emissions contributor. A single institution likely administers your electricity, be it a utility company or a co-op. Transition that institution from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, and you’ve already come a long way in reducing emissions.
If individual responsibility is the great myth of the climate movement, then the power of community action is the climate movement’s best-kept secret. The same institutions that engage in price gouging, racism, monopoly control over public goods and unaccountable leadership hold the keys to climate action. From Boulder, Colorado to Jackson, Mississippi and beyond, grassroots efforts to take back the grid are already leading to reduced electricity bills, corporate accountability and empowered communities. By amplifying these efforts, we can create a climate-vision that is encouraging rather than burdensome.
Democratizing the grid is decentralized because the grid is managed differently around the country. In some cases, energy democracy means holding electricity cooperatives accountable to their bylaws, electing representative new leaders and re-centering community interests. In other cases, energy democracy means the municipalization of utility companies. Municipalization means the electricity is managed by elected leaders rather than unaccountable bureaucrats. It can also mean fighting monopolies through deregulation and allowing for competitive, renewable options to cut costs and emissions.
Deregulation and municipalization appeal to opposite ends of the political spectrum and display the versatility of energy democracy. Because energy democracy is focused on community needs and efforts, it defies myopic political characterizations of “left versus right” and creates a vision for climate action that anyone can get excited about. Sharing this vision for rethinking our energy grid can give the climate movement the makeover it needs.
Energy democracy brings people together to reclaim power, making it politically effective. Even climate skeptics are interested in having more control over their lives and their wallets. Energy democracy does just that while building a framework for climate action that replaces stagnation with empowerment and abdication with action. 
If you’re interested in EDCO’s vision for energy democracy and want to get involved, we need your help. Whether your forte is in social media, filmmaking, research or advocacy, we hope you’ll join our team.

2022-10-10,AU,Democrat,"Protestors gather outside of the Supreme Court on Friday, June 24. 
Following the Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, national uncertainty has persisted about how abortion access may change and how states may suffer disparate impacts. As the midterm elections loom, voters will weigh abortion as a definitive issue when electing future decision-makers.
The Dobbs v. Jackson decision returned legislative power over abortion to Congress and state governments. Since then, states have imposed abortion bans and restrictions, several more are underway and further such laws may be implemented if the Republican Party gains sufficient control in state legislatures. Federal bans and restrictions are also possible, though not at all likely under the current Congress. 
Research from Pew Research Center suggests that the issue of reproductive rights will be an important issue in the midterm election. Voter registration has surged among women, which points to the fact that abortion is a mobilizing issue for voters.
In D.C., abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy, but since the district does not have statehood, the future of abortion rights in D.C. differs from states throughout the country.
Congress controls aspects of D.C., as it is a federal district. Though D.C. does have a city council, Congress has exclusive control over the district, according to the Constitution.
As the midterm elections approach in November, which party holds Congress could impact abortion rights in D.C. and nationally.
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has proposed a 15-week federal abortion ban, which would ban all abortions after 15 weeks, with limited exceptions carved out for rape, incest or threats to the bearer’s life. This ban cannot pass in the current Democratic-controlled Senate, but this could change if control shifts to the GOP in the midterm elections.
Any abortion legislation, either in its own bill or as a rider on unrelated legislation, would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president.
In 2011, former President Barack Obama signed a law that had an abortion-related rider attached to it. In signing the bill, the rider portion went into effect, banning local D.C. dollars from going to abortions for low-income people in the district. 
Additionally, abortion-related measures previously passed by D.C. City Council would be void if faced by anti-abortion legislation, D.C. local news reporter Chelsea Cirruzzo said in an interview with The Eagle. 
Potential abortion restrictions in D.C. would disproportionately impact Black residents. In 2015, more than 60 percent of abortions in the district were sought by Black residents. 
Abortion is still legal in D.C. and the broader DMV area. Despite this, there may be barriers even to legal abortion, such as potential costs.
An abortion through Planned Parenthood in D.C. can range in cost from $578 to $2,008. While financial assistance is available, this is an additional hoop abortion-seekers must jump through.
Organizations such as DC Abortion Fund also provide financial assistance to abortion-seekers. Such nonprofits rely on fundraising through events and campaigns, as well as one-off donations to provide this type of support. Other regional abortion funds include the Baltimore Abortion Fund and the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund.
Another barrier abortion-seekers must overcome is having to face anti-choice protesters in order to physically enter clinics. 
The Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force provides volunteer escorts, also known as “clinic defenders,” to reproductive health clinics in D.C., Maryland and Virginia.
“It is a scary moment, for a lot of people, that moment of walking into the clinic. Because the narratives that are out there about abortion are often so demonizing and scary,” said one local clinic defender, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons. “And so we're out there to make sure that protesters don't get out of control, don’t get too close to the patient. Or if they do have those conversations, to be able to say, ‘Hey, it's okay, we can just go inside.’”
At AU, students with reproductive health concerns may seek guidance from the Student Health Center and the Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services.
According to Dr. Ariel White, the university physician at the Student Health Center, the center provides “comprehensive reproductive health services for all students, regardless of gender identification,” as well as pregnancy counseling. The center does not provide abortions, but can refer students to the appropriate resources.
The Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services can provide counseling and supportive services, including for students who have experienced sexual assault, said its director, Dr. Jacquelin Darby. These services are all confidential.
“Our main goal is to support students and make sure that they are well, and so we will work to continue to do that,” Darby said.

2023-03-09,AU,Democrat,"Kogod Dean David Marchick, left, and Seth Goldman, right, kick off the new speaker series
Seth Goldman, founder of Honest Tea, Just Ice Tea and Eat the Change, opened the Kogod School of Business Gamechangers in Sustainability series alongside Kogod Dean David Marchick on Feb. 22. Goldman’s talk focused on his renewed insights on helping people and the planet. 
Every student was given a copy of Goldman’s 2013 graphic novel, “Mission in a Bottle,” a telling story of the joys, trials and challenges of his company creations, and every chair had tea, snacks and a coaster for attendees. 
“I appreciate us having the book here for people. Somebody brought the book up to me and said ‘you know this reads like a horror story,” Goldman said.
Goldman’s tea journey began in the late 1990s when he couldn’t find any “just sweet enough” drinks in a cooler after a run. Then, his first company, with the help of his former professor Barry Nalebuff, who co-wrote “Mission in a Bottle,” was born. Shortly after Goldman created “Honest Tea,” Coca-Cola purchased the company. However, in the spring of 2022, Coca-Cola discontinued Honest Tea.
Undiscouraged, Goldman, Nalebuff and celebrity chef Spike Mendelsohn, created and launched Just Ice Tea, only 90 days after Honest Tea ceased manufacturing. Now, Just Ice Tea is supplied at Whole Foods and other grocery stores across the country.
Along with Goldman’s best-selling tea, his 2017 company Eat the Change explores the impacts food has on communities and the environment and continues to experiment with other plant-based products.
“Eat the Change is founded around a call to action,” Goldman said. “What we do, what we eat is the single biggest environmental act we take every day.”
Although tea is what he specializes in, he continues to explore mushroom-based jerky snacks and cosmic carrot snacks — a snack attendees got a chance to try. 
Throughout the event, Goldman kept true to his “mission in a bottle,” the social impact issues he and his companies stand with. There was a short, educational video featuring a recent visit to his fair-trade tea supplier in Mozambique and the impact he and his company have there.
“Every time we buy a pound of tea leaves, a portion of the sales goes back to that community and they can invest in the schools you saw or buy an ambulance, whatever the community deems their needs are. You can have such a huge impact in a community like that,” Goldman said.
Goldman’s persistence, and his passion for his company, the people and the planet, were evident in every answer. 
“It’s meaningful to be the best-selling team in the natural foods industry, but the goal is to democratize this. Not just healthy, wealthy people should have access to organic and healthier drinks,” Goldman said.

The Sierra Club was not always inclusive to marginalized groups in the past, according to Cruz. Founded for wilderness exploration by John Muir in 1957, the club used to be invitation only. Cruz reckoned with the organization’s racist and exclusive past, which included pushing Indigenous peoples off their native lands. 
“Before the great national parks, the lands belonged also to people that had been much better stewards than us and or anybody that came after them,” Cruz said. 
Cruz said he received criticism for venturing outside the bounds of the environmental movement. He wants to include “voting rights, working rights, reproductive rights, labor rights and housing rights” in the organization’s work. These issues all intersect with the environmental movement, according to Cruz. 
“I hope that Sierra Club supporters concerned about whether we focus on a narrow definition of environment can find a way to broaden our idea of the Sierra Club,” Cruz said. 
Cruz is the first Puerto Rican and Latino president of the organization. When the organization was founded, his father and grandfather would have been excluded from participating in the organization. 
“Things are very different today thanks in large part to people of color and white allies who fought to open the doors of these organizations to people like me, but it doesn't mean that there is no discrimination in the environmental movement,” Cruz said. “For many years, I was the darkest in the room with a cute Spanish accent.”
Now, the Sierra Club is taking steps towards environmental justice by adopting the principles of democratic organizing, according to Cruz. These principles include “Be Inclusive, Emphasis on Bottom-Up Organizing, Let People Speak for Themselves, Work Together In Solidarity and Mutuality, Build Just Relationships Among Ourselves and Commitment to Self-Transformation,” according to the Sierra Club website. 
It takes more than reckoning with the past to change the future, according to Ariana Lippi, a first-year graduate student in SIS. Lippi volunteered with the Sierra Club in New York before starting her graduate program at AU. 
When Lippi volunteered on the sustainable finance committee of the Sierra Club in New York, she found it difficult to create change and mobilize in the organization due to leadership and bureaucratic processes. Although Cruz pointed out the chapter has a new president, Lippi believes there is an “infrastructure problem” in the organization. 
“I do think that there is so much that could be done to make it more inclusive,” said Lippi in an interview after the event. “I think environmentalism overall, the environmental movement in the U.S. is not inclusive towards people of color, trans people, just different identities and youth as well. There's a very white, old guard in that movement.”
Lippi wished the organization could improve its outreach since it is mostly volunteer based. There was a long application process she went through to become a volunteer. She thinks this process can be cut down or eliminated. Cruz said the organization now does student coalition training, but he recognizes that is not enough.
“I think it's the people and the old school organizing that can get us there,” Cruz said.

2009-09-10,AU,Republican,"As I watched Ted Kennedy laid to rest at the end of August, I found myself thinking about 1987. That was the year Kennedy castigated Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. During Bork's hearings, Kennedy said, ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government."" In retrospect, many people think Kennedy's speech was the beginning of the end for Bork. Critics also charge that the harshness of his words caused of our current culture war. Maybe so. As recently as Aug. 28 of this year, The New York Times ran an editorial stating as much.
Whether or not he caused it, Kennedy certainly was on the right side of the culture war. Like all good progressives, he battled social conservatives who seek to suppress anything they personally find un-Christian, immoral or inconsistent with traditional American values. It is a struggle that still rages today.
The current Virginia gubernatorial race is rife with culture clash. The Washington Post recently reported on Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's college thesis for Regent University (Pat Robertson's school). In said thesis, McDonnell writes that working women are ""detrimental"" to families. He argues that government should prefer married couples to ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.""  He also calls a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing contraception for unmarried couples ""illogical."" He wrote that at age 34. McDonnell is starting to look like George Allen, a Virginia Republican whose 2006 Senate re-election campaign was eventually derailed when he was caught using an ethnic slur.
The Democratic National Committee has released a statement on this issue and its wording sounds familiar. It makes reference to ""Bob McDonnell's preferred Virginia,"" and pundits are already describing Democratic attacks on the thesis as ""Borking"" McDonnell. ""Borking"" is the term Republicans created for when Democrats show their backwards-looking nominees and candidates for what they really are. This entire episode illustrates why despite Democratic struggles, the Republican Party is far away from returning to power. And why? Perhaps because the GOP is a party made up of white men looking out for the interest of white men.
The problem for Republicans is that the number of white men in America continues to decline. Women outnumber them today, and in just a few decades there will be no racial majority in America. The election of a black man who campaigned on the change undercuts the decades-old GOP strategy of appealing to certain white, male fears. There are still plenty of scared white men. They are the armed nuts you see at town halls, and they would love to live in Robert Bork's America. But let us always remember Ted Kennedy. As we look around at our country as it exists now, not in a Republican fantasy of yesteryear, let us realize something. We don't live in Robert Bork's America. We live, mostly, in the America of Ted Kennedy's dreams.

2010-04-12,AU,Republican,"The lack of access to healthy and affordable food is not a problem unique to Third World countries. Millions of Americans live in impoverished urban communities without the luxury of a supermarket that others may take for granted. These areas, sometimes called “food deserts,” present limited choices in the way of nutritious food options for their residents.
When the small convenience store down the street becomes the main source for household groceries, families typically pay higher prices even in the absence of essential fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Moreover, economic conditions in some poor neighborhoods foster the dominance of fast-food restaurants. The demand for their speedy service, tasty products and relatively cheap prices is strong. Unfortunately, a steady diet of burgers and fries only hastens the slide to obesity and increases the risk of diabetes.
How can we possibly address these issues? How can we encourage people to make better choices with their time and their health?
The roadblocks ahead are immense. Real estate prices in the areas in question swell the cost of doing business. On a broader level, the Farm Bill legislation, amended every five years, essentially determines what products consumers may access on a large scale. Constantly subsidized and overproduced foods, such as corn, soybeans, wheat and rice, provide crucial ingredients for a number of highly processed items crowding America’s store shelves.
We must fashion a wholesale change in the way the government engages the food industry, starting with more subsidies for fruits and vegetables. This measure will give producers the incentive to boost their supply and eventually drive down the cost of these healthier items. Such a shift in policy would serve as a constructive model in helping consumers help themselves.
In 2008, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance banning the construction of new fast-food restaurants in a low-income ward. In fact, a number of cities and towns have instituted similar laws in recent years. Food zoning, however, is not the right answer to the dilemma presented here. Preaching the importance of exercise or a moderate diet is perfectly worthwhile (even banning trans fats has its merits), but actively prohibiting certain businesses from poor communities is divisive and counterproductive; it is a heavy-handed tactic that does not bolster food choices and ignores the jobs these restaurants bring to the neighborhood.
Conversely, New York City offers a more effective and less intrusive means to encourage development and lure new businesses to food deserts. An array of zoning law adjustments and tax credits has been established for grocery stores that carry a significant amount of fresh dairy, meats and produce. Granting developers the room to work under normally tight building restrictions and giving tax exemptions for approved stores can diversify options for the poor and diminish the travel time once required to reach distant supermarkets.
Another avenue to improve the accessibility and affordability of healthy foods in urban areas is the growth of community-supported agriculture and community gardens. Community-supported agriculture builds partnerships between area farms and poor communities. Farms deliver produce to neighborhoods that purchase a portion of the crops at the beginning of a growing season as a collective group. Community gardens bring opportunities for environmental education, fresh produce and aesthetically pleasing landscapes.
Pragmatic ideas and grassroots level changes are out there. It’s time we enact them to fight the widespread problems of obesity, diabetes and limited healthy food choices in poor urban areas.

2010-07-01,AU,Republican,"In his first visit to AU as president, Barack Obama laid out the framework for his idea of comprehensive immigration reform July 1 — including a pathway to citizenship as well as increased accountability — but did not announce any new policy initiatives. 
About 250 invited guests filled the atrium of the new School of International Service building in its inaugural event to hear Obama’s nearly 40-minute-long speech. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, the Rev. Al Sharpton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus filled the first few rows of the atrium. AU officials, professors and a small group of student leaders were also in attendance.
“In sum, the system is broken,” Obama said. “And everybody knows it. Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling — and to the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.” 
The president said he hopes Congress can pass an immigration reform package soon, but did not address whether he had the support to pass any legislation before the end of the year. The majority of Democrats and Americans want to move forward with reform, and it’s up to Republicans to make the next move and create bipartisan legislation, he said.
While he did not offer many specifics, Obama expressed support for the DREAM Act, a bill before Congress that would provide a pathway to permanent residency for illegal immigrants who graduate from a U.S. high school and show good character. 
School of Public Affairs Dean William LeoGrande was in the audience and said he thought Obama gave a successful speech. Primarily, Obama was challenging the Republican Party to step up and support immigration reform efforts, LeoGrande said.
 “I think the White House is signaling that it really wants to try and push ahead on this issue now and not wait until after the election or next year,” he said. “But he also was very clear that there has to be Republican counterparts who are willing to cooperate in this. Democrats by themselves don’t have the votes to do this.”
Nearly half of the Main Quad and portions of New Mexico and Nebraska Avenues were blocked. Since the speech was invitation-only, students filled Ward 2 to watch. 
Rebecca Paley-Williams, a junior in SPA, watched the speech from Ward. She said she and a lot of the people with her at the watch party were annoyed the event was not open to students and the public. 
“I felt like [Obama] was coming here — this is our campus,” she said. “They probably should have let us see the speech or [provide] some sort of benefit for being a student here.” 
Sara Torneden, a sophomore in SIS, said that while she is disappointed more students were not let in to the event, she understands why the White House selected a smaller venue.  
“[The building choice] is very representative of how [Obama] wanted it to come off,” Torneden said. “He didn’t want it to be in a huge arena with hundreds of thousands of people cheering and everything. He wanted people who were interested in pursuing this in higher education to hear this and take this and motivate them to learn more about it in their studies.”

2010-09-08,AU,Republican,"Chris Matthews said the current state of bipartisan politics is driving the nation in a downward spiral in a speech Tuesday night in Bender Arena.
Matthews, the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of the year, said the Democratic and Republican parties need to put their rhetoric aside and work together.
“Excessive partisanship, excessive commitment to the notion that anything goes, that anything you can do to win is OK ... disrupts the system. It ruins it in many ways, and nothing gets done,” he said. “The pettiness between the parties [is not] even strategic — it's just crankiness.”
He went on to explain that the key to solving our problems in American politics is to elect good leaders without looking at partisan issues.
KPU Director Josh Levitt agreed with Matthews’ assertion that the two parties need to work together.
“As Obama said, we cannot expect to solve our problems if all we do is tear each other down,” Levitt said.
In an interview before his speech, Matthews said he hopes students attending his speech could come to fully understand a few key problems in the country and find ways to change them.
“I hope that people understand the question, which is 'what’s wrong with politics today?' ” he said. “Why is it so cranky and unproductive? Maybe [they can] begin to set some standards to change it.”
Matthews, who spent many years in politics and government, transitioned to print journalism working as the Washington bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner from 1987 to 2000. He is currently the host of ""Hardball,"" a daily news show on MSNBC and ""The Chris Matthews Show,"" a weekly syndicated public affairs program.
“I’ve watched politicians from the inside, and if you do that you’re able to understand what they’re doing,” he said.
Matthews said he knows how politicians speak and work because he worked as a presidential speechwriter for former President Jimmy Carter. He uses this knowledge of politicians to better understand his guests and inform his audience.
“I think I know what the politicians are up to better than a lot of other people,” he said. “I watched politics from the inside, and if you do that then you are able to understand what they are doing from the press releases, the speeches, the positioning, the dodging.”
Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the first post-apartheid presidential election in South Africa in 1994, the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 and the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.
“Those were great moments for me, and of course all of the presidential elections are fun,” Matthews said.
Matthews believes Democrats are demoralized and disappointed with their own party, but Republicans are angry and energized by the current state of politics.
“Fear makes people angry, and this election this November 2, it’s going to be an explosion of anger,” he said.
Matthews pointed to a rise of unemployment, overflow of government spending and the national debt as a few problems currently facing the nation.
Matthews said there has been speculation in the past that he may return to politics and possibly run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, but he said he does not want to give up his jobs as a news commentator and a reporter yet.
“I thought a lot about it in this [election] cycle and it would have meant giving up what I have spent years developing,” he said.

2010-09-11,AU,Republican,"The AU College Democrats and College Republicans both have many plans for expanding their groups on campus and becoming more involved with the D.C. community, starting with the National Day of Service and Remembrance on Sept. 11.
The College Republicans participated in the Freedom Walk. This event was created in 2005 to establish a national tradition of remembrance of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, according to College Republican President Stephen Laudone.
The College Republicans will also be working on a community service initiative at Walter Reed Hospital on Nov. 11, Veterans Day.
The College Republicans and College Democrats have also doubled their outreach efforts, with revamped websites, new Facebook groups and fan pages for members to join and stay in touch.
College Democrats President Bo Hammond said the College Democrats have added an internship board to their site for the first time. He said this has been set up to help members of AUCD get jobs, and in the past has secured internships on Capitol Hill and at WeatherizeDC, a non-profit based campaign in D.C. focusing on home efficiency.
The College Republicans have arranged several outings, starting with a meet and greet session at the Tenleytown Z-Burger, followed by a weekend trip to a Nationals game. They have also booked a number of speakers for the upcoming months, such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., sometime in September or October and former United States Senator Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in November.
The College Republicans are also co-sponsoring the Kennedy Political Union's Family Weekend event on Oct. 23. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and presidential candidate, is scheduled to speak. 
Laudone said he is focused on expanding the community service wing of his organization.
“It is important for the [College Republicans] to walk the walk on this [service] issue, so you will see us engaging more than in past years in community service initiatives of our own and with the Community Service Coalition,” he said.
The College Democrats have a themed schedule entitled, “Blue Rising.” This is a six-week period during which they have scheduled many events, starting with advertising and recruitment in the first couple of weeks.
Hammond believes that this will be the best year for the College Democrats.
“We are going to have more members and more resources than we have ever had in the past,” he said.

• To the person complaining about getting kicked off campus: 
My roommate and I went to the room draw last semester, and even though we both had really high lottery numbers, we got a room in Centennial. Easily. It was wide open. You obviously didn't really care that much about living on campus and just like to bitch and whine.
• If I needed another Chris Matthews to express their sourpuss attitude and liberal opinions towards the upcoming election, when the Republicans WILL take the House, I would have applied to AU.
oh, wait...
• Eagle rants is not an advice column. Eagle rants is not a relationship column. EAGLE RANTS IS NOT FOR SOLACE, IT'S HERE TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
• Whatever happened with Artemas Ward Week last year? Did that ever end up happening? If not, will we have two this year to make up for it?
• Dear everyone with relationship issues: Talk to your significant other about it. Seriously. It doesn't matter what’s bothering you. It is astounding how much easier it is to work through issues together.
• What's with the bureaucracy here at American? None of the people who work at the school or in the registrar know what's going on. Last week I was trying to get an override form for a class I needed, I asked three different people and got three different answers. So much for paying almost $50,000 a year, right?
• Why are only a small minority of the AU events made into Facebook events?  Is it that hard to make a Facebook event?  Note to people creating events at AU: If you make a Facebook group for it, then more people will show up. Pretty simple.

• Bilingual guys are very hot. I love you all.
• Where is our POTUS op-ed!?!? Eagle editors, get with it!

• I miss the old days when I could get drunk any day of the week. Now I'm working two jobs and would rather go to bed by 11 p.m.
• Dear College Democrats,
Why would you close the doors to the event on Thursday night after it started?  Some people have evening classes and would have liked to have slipped in late without making a disturbance. Think about that in the future please.
• I'm a very quiet person, I've had people say that they think I'm stuck up cause I don't talk much, but in reality I just don't want to say something awkward and stupid.

2010-12-06,AU,Republican,"The Rat is clearly more evolved than us. While we huddle in our dorm rooms next to whatever bottle of liquor we still have stored for winter, desperately trying to avoid stepping out into the frozen tundra, they will somehow survive and thrive, coming out to meet us next spring with a hope that this season will bring a bountiful harvest of garbage.
Now is the time to stamp them out, before they consolidate power. Our best weapon against them? The Nutcracker, the famous ballet that I assume is the first musical based on a tool we use to feed ourselves (“Mac the Knife” of course is the second). Here are the recommendations:
Eliminate the Monarchy
Apparently the leader of the mice in the ballet is the Mouse King. Honestly, I don’t know why the mice resorted to an autocratic regime. I’m not even sure how a mouse would justify his dominion. Perhaps he is the divine providence of the Mouse God, who I assume looks like Mickey. But that’s not important. What is important is taking down a king, and history has taught us many ways to accomplish this. We could read them the Constitution — I’m sure the College Republicans would chomp at the bit for the chance — or possibly construct a tiny mouse Magna Carta. Admit it, you’re thinking about it and it’s adorable.
Do NOT use Edible Soldiers
They tried to fight rats with gingerbread soldiers. That’s a worse strategy than the Surge. Unless the gingerbread has rat poison in it, in which case it’s genius. Why didn’t the Nutcracker think of that? This ballet is full of plot holes.
Know when to retreat
After the Nutcracker defeats the Mouse King, the soldiers retreat to their own castle, which is apparently filled with candy and sweet tea and a boat pulled by dolphins. Honestly, you probably won’t find that on campus. The closest thing would be to go back to huddling in your dorm room with the bottle of liquor. For dolphins, I suggest Animal Planet.

2010-12-06,AU,Republican,"Something wicked this way comes — it lurks in our skies, awaiting the return of innocent college students from winter break. It will drop around the beginning of February, wreaking havoc not only upon Washington, but the rest of the East Coast as well. 
People will rush to the grocery stores and Terrace Dining Room, which will run out of food within a week. The Metro system will shut down and cars will be inoperable, making the only viable mode of transportation cross-country skiing. Classes will be canceled day after day, while a civil war breaks out at Dupont Circle. 
Civilization as we know it will cease to exist and D.C. will descend into chaos, buried under a thick blanket of fluffy, white snow. 
Snowpocalypse 2011 is coming — are you prepared? Heed The Eagle’s warning and use this guide to start a survival kit before it’s too late.
Powdered milk
Since the Eagle’s Nest and local stores will face a milk shortage, be sure to pick up at least five industrial-size boxes of powdered milk. Even if the pipes freeze, use the abundance of snow outside to your advantage and mix it in for a truly ice-cold drink.
Hot Pockets
Stockpile as many frozen entrees as will fit in your freezer. Hot Pockets are the best bet because of their nutritional superiority and tendency to make you too nauseous to eat more. Not only will you have enough food to last through the crisis, but you’ll gain some extra padding against the bitterness of winter as well.
10-layer cake
Celebrate the impending end of the world by eating one layer of cake for each day of being trapped on campus. For more creative types, you can decorate each layer with the circles of Hell as you descend further into cabin fever.
Alaskan dog sled
Though snowshoes and cross-country skis will work for a while, save your legs and invest in an Alaskan dog sled with a few strong Huskies. It’s fast, fun and furry — and you’ll look that much cooler arriving at the 2,000-person Dupont Circle snowball fight on a wintry chariot.
Well-stocked entertainment system
Nothing fends off boredom like a five-day Mario Kart tournament. Pit Democrats against Republicans, East Coast natives against West Coast natives, School of International Service majors against School of Public Affairs majors — you get the idea — for the title of Snowpocalypse King. If holding such an event off campus, don’t hesitate to include alcohol to make each game truly warm, fuzzy and much more memorable.
Remember that Snowpocalypse 2011 is deadly in many ways — do not, under any circumstances, walk under campus buildings that seem to be in danger of collapsing. And please, enjoy battling the Snowpocalypse responsibly.

2010-12-06,AU,Republican,"This will be my final column as an opinion writer for The Eagle. In this space, I’ve argued for drug liberalization, urban renewal projects, and a greater focus on our long-term fiscal health. I discussed the importance of living within one’s means, lamented our dysfunctional political system, and criticized our incoherent foreign policy. 
What I never wrote much about was American University, and for that, I’m sorry. I know that I wasn’t your first, second, or even third destination when you wanted to read a view of the political scene. 
I also apologize to those who were looking for more partisanship and found my writing muddled in the middle. Actually, I take that back. I can’t stand fringe politics, Left or Right. Ideological polarization is tearing this country apart. Regardless, if you ever stumbled across my column, I do hope that you found my thoughts insightful, temperate, and, above all, reasonable. 
However, I want to devote my parting words not to opinion or policy, but to everyone and everything that made American University special during my years here. When I submit my senior thesis next week, I will conclude a journey that began in August 2007. Less than three and a half years later, I can proudly say that I wouldn’t trade any of it for the world. 
So here’s to you, AU:
To the Letts third floor of 2007-2008, where I spent countless nights in the South side lounge and started friendships that will last a lifetime. 
To Letts’ sixth floor sky lounge, where residents know not to enter if the lights are off and the two couches are pushed together. Trust me, stay away.  
To Centennial Hall, where sophomores go to pretend that they are moving up in the world and where I fell in love. 
To the four knuckleheads that I chose as roommates for the last few years, thanks for all the nonsense and the endless laughter. 
To the Terrace Dining Room, where I’m an endangered species: a senior in a sea of freshmen and sophomores. To the most underrated cafeteria on campus, thank you for feeding me.   
To the men’s basketball team, for winning back-to-back Patriot League crowns in 2008 and 2009. Facing the fourth-seeded Villanova Wildcats in the opening round of the 2009 NCAA tournament, the 13-seeded Eagles played unconscious basketball for more than half of the game. AU led by as many as 14 and held a 10-point lead with under 13 minutes to play. It was some of most inspired basketball I’ve ever seen. Somewhere, Garrison Carr is still knocking down 25-foot jumpers. 
To the now-defunct School of International Service pit, I miss your character and sheer depth. In all seriousness, it’s been exciting to watch this campus develop since 2007. The new SIS building and the Kogod School of Business addition are helping to put this university on the map. It will be interesting to see how the administration transforms the Nebraska Parking Lot in the coming decade.   
To Professor Cynthia Bair Van Dam, whose College Writing Seminar on the Politics of Education drove me to be a better writer. 
To Professor Robert Johnson, who showed me the distressing reality of our prison system and altered my stance on the death penalty.  
To Professor Alan Kraut, whose masterful lectures on the Civil War made me want to put down my pen and just listen. His oratory skills were that powerful. 
To three School of Communication professors, Rick Horowitz, Lynne Perri, and Rodger Streitmatter, who deepened my passion for journalism and media studies.
To Professor Leonard Steinhorn, my Honors Capstone advisor, whose tremendous insight and guidance have proven invaluable. 
To everyone at the American University Career Center, from Elaine Salisbury to Bridget O’Connell to Lara Ferraiolo to Chris Hughes to Susan Gordon—you’ve all been integral parts of my professional growth and career exploration process. It’s going to be hard to let go. 
To The Eagle, thank you for giving me a voice and granting me a platform. 
Farewell, AU. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.

2011-01-11,AU,Republican,"It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve. 
Big Brother has proven inept and can’t be trusted. It’s about time we stick up for ourselves and start advocating transparency.

2011-02-09,AU,Republican,"Political strategist Ed Gillespie has been involved in Washington politics since his college days.
The former Republican National Committee chairman began at the bottom of the food chain. He worked as a Senate parking lot attendant while he was a student at the Catholic University of America.
Gillespie spoke at AU Feb. 7 about his own career and the future of his party in what he calls a “center-right nation.”
“The great thing about going to school in D.C. is being able to intern. The great thing about politics is that it’s a meritocracy and you can work your way up,” he said.
Gillespie, chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the state level is an important arena for politicians.
“It is a training ground for new Republicans. There are innovative ideas and policy proposals, as well as working to increase diversity.”
After winning a historic 690 new state legislative seats in 2010, Gillespie has high hopes for future Republicans.
“There are great opportunities in the Senate and whether President Obama re-elected or not, we’re likely to hold the House given the size of the margin and the nature of redistricting,” Gillespie said.
He predicted eight to 10 Republican candidates in the 2012 primaries.
“There are a lot of really good potential candidates that are going to run, bringing new faces to the party,” Gillespie said.
The most important issues in the election, he believes, will center around government spending, the economy and jobs.
“The most important factor will be what is the unemployment rate,” Gillespie said. “The real overarching dynamic is where are the jobs? Do people feel like they’re coming back?”
He said Republicans should recruit minorities and female candidates.
“It’s a long term concern, a demographic challenge. We need to do better with minority voters, most acutely with Hispanic voters,” Gillespie said.
But independent voters are important too, he said, saying the “overwhelming” support of this group was crucial to the 2010 victories.
Gillespie also said he believes the tea party movement will assimilate into the mainstream Republican Party, comparing them to Catholic Democrats joining the party in the 1980s and the Ross Perot supporters in the 1990s.
“Growing pains are better than shrinking pains,” he said.

2011-03-03,AU,Republican,"Former D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee said the state of the U.S. public education system today “sucks.”
Rhee spoke to students March 2 in a panel event sponsored by the Roosevelt Institute at AU, after a screening of the documentary “Waiting for Superman,” a film about the nation’s public schools system. 
 “We are supposed to be living in the best country in the world,” Rhee said to a packed audience. “The land of opportunity, and whether or not kids get a good education is dependent on luck and the spinning of the wheel.”
The documentary says Rhee simultaneously drew praise and criticism during her tenure as chancellor. During that time she cut over a hundred jobs in the D.C. Central Office and closed 23 schools in D.C.
Her alliance with former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty made waves during the mayoral election earlier this fall. Rhee resigned after Vincent Gray was elected.
Rhee talked about her stance on teachers’ unions, saying she was surprised that President Barack Obama has advocated for holding accountable and even firing underperforming teachers. 
“I don’t think you can overstate the importance that he has had over the debate of teacher quality over the last two years,” Rhee said.
She said while Obama has held teachers more accountable, Republicans primarily criticize the teachers’ unions. A Democrat herself, Rhee said that stance needs to change. 
However, she said she has seen Republicans, Democrats and independents alike calling for reform, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and her fiancé, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a Democrat.
“Democrats have been resistant about saying that within the last 10 years and I think that with some of the stuff that’s going on in Wisconsin, it is actually a different dynamic that’s happening there,” she said. “I think that you can hold unions accountable and draw very strong distinctions in what they ought to be doing and fighting for.”
Zachary Kolodin, director of the Future Preparedness Initiative for Roosevelt Institute, also served on the panel and said it is not productive to vilify the unions. 
He said that while the recession and deep deficits across the country have hit budgets hard, money should still be directed towards education.
“In Wisconsin, there’s a real demonization of unions and public employees and I think that reflects something real in our economy,” Kolodin said.  It’s really not the unions’ fault that America is such a ruthless place for the middle class right now.”
But Rhee said that in New Jersey, thousands of dollars are spent per child with disappointing results. 
She said that the root of the problem doesn’t come from poor districts or lazy parents, but the poor performance of teachers and attitude in the central office. 
“Once we as a school district do everything that we’re supposed to be doing, then we have the right to go to the parents and the kids and hold them accountable too,” Rhee said.
Rhee has continued her crusade against the unions by establishing her own interest group called StudentsFirst. 
Rhee said she believes that the failure of the system now is that there are advocates for adults but none for kids.
“The education landscape over the last few decades has been driven by special interests groups: textbook manufacturers, teachers unions, testing companies, et cetera,” she said. “We don’t have a system that is set up to protect children, we have a system that is set up to protect adults and their jobs.”

2011-03-07,AU,Republican,"Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf called for a new discourse about Islam in America on Feb. 28, saying the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks violated the religion itself. 
Rauf founded the Cordoba Initiative, which addresses the topic of healing U.S. Muslim relations after 9/11. 
Rauf made headlines this fall when he became the center of the highly publicized ground zero mosque debate. 
“We were found to be a convenient tool for the extreme right of the Republican Party for the midterm elections,” Rauf said.
9/11 not only had human casualties, but violated Islam itself, Rauf said. 
He said he took the attacks personally, saying that members of his congregation were among the first responders.
Rauf also said that the site was not to be an actual mosque, but rather a community center similar to the YMCA or Jewish centers that include athletic, educational and religious activities. 
The imam said that the point of the “Cordoba house” was to establish an American Muslim identity and catalyze a turning point in the discussion of Islam in America.
But the perceived conflict between being Muslim and being an American citizen was addressed long before the 2010 midterm elections, Rauf said. 
During the 2008 election, rumors circulated that Barack Obama was Muslim, eliciting some negative sentiment and fears. 
Rauf commended former Secretary of State Colin Powell for tackling the rumors head-on when he asked, “Is there anything wrong with being Muslim in America?”
Rauf also said he was astounded that the president's recent comments at the State of the Union received applause from both sides of the aisle, when he said, “We are committed to the conviction that American Muslims are Americans too and part of our American family.”
The School of International Service sponsored Rauf's appearance at AU.

2011-08-12,AU,Republican,"Though public officials reached a deal on the debt ceiling Aug. 2, many student government presidents from across the country are unhappy with the deal.
Before the agreement was made, more than 120 student government presidents from 40 states, including AU Student Government President Tim McBride, signed a letter demanding Congress come up with a solution to raise the national debt ceiling and prevent the U.S. government from defaulting on its loans.
The letter, asking “Do We Have a Deal Yet,” says the student government presidents support the proposals of the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Gang of Six, a group of senators containing three Republicans and three Democrats. There are no particular provisions of those recommendations the group supports, but it does urge congressmen to accept a “bipartisan framework,” according to Andy MacCracken, executive director of the D.C. Student Alliance and former SG president.
Now that a default has been avoided, the group is disappointed the deal includes the founding of a commission to continue to debate debt reduction that is tasked with finding more cuts by November. 
“It’s very unfortunate that our leaders kicked the can down the road even farther,” MacCracken said. 
Though the group has no “grandiose” ideas that their opinions will suddenly cause bipartisan cooperation on the Hill, a few of the students, including MacCracken, were granted a conference call with President Obama and members of his staff on July 26 and a meeting with staff in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office on Aug. 1 regarding the letter.
“That speaks volumes to the impact we’ve already started to have,” MacCracken said.
Student leaders will continue to advocate to members of the new commission to reduce the deficit. 
They want politicians to focus “on what the ramifications are going to be for the next generation as opposed to what short-term benefits might be for the next election,” MacCracken said.
The student presidents’ main hope is to encourage students to get involved and take a stand on debt negotiations by calling their representatives or senators and getting their opinion heard, McBride said.
Some of those student government presidents held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. July 21, garnering media attention from CNN, NPR, ABC, FOX, and the Huffington Post.
“We’re not telling our leaders what to do,” MacCracken said. “We’re just telling them to lead.”
The difference between this lobbying group and others is that they are not asking for favors, according to McBride, who signed the letter July 12. Instead, these student leaders are still looking for a deal that will not bankrupt the country that some of these students will one day lead.
“We have a unique message that needed to be heard,” McBride said.
As Obama echoed in the conference call, students have the most to lose from any failed debt reduction negotiations. 
“Young people will shoulder the consequences of gridlock during a time that requires bold action,” the letter reads. “Your decisions will determine what kind of country we will inherit.”

2011-11-08,AU,Republican,"Just as one might wake up with a hangover after New Year’s, the government wakes up with a hangover at the beginning of a new fiscal year, said Heritage Foundation economic expert Alison Fraser.
Comparing the fiscal year to New Year’s Day, Fraser spoke about the current state of the economy at an AU College Republicans event Nov. 1
“Our hangover for the federal government is our debt,” she said. 
Fraser spoke to an audience of around 15 students in the University Club. Her organization, the Heritage Foundation, conducts conservative public policy research.
Fraser also discussed specific economic problems facing the United States and potential solutions to these problems.
“We are seeing a dramatic increase in the size and scope of our debt,” she said.  
America’s debt will only get worse with the direction the United States is headed in now, she said.  
“Our lesson learned, if any, from the EU’s experiences is that we are just a couple of years behind having to deal with the same issues,” she said.  
After explaining the issues, Fraser talked about solutions that the Heritage Foundation has supported in the past.  
“I would do it all on the spending side without raising taxes,” she said. “Rather than taxing the rich, I would rather take away their benefits,” referring to Social Security and Medicare.
Taxes make economic growth more difficult, she said.
“We’ve got to do this in a way that makes everyone’s future brighter,” Fraser said.
Fraser encouraged the students in attendance to talk to their parents and grandparents about these issues over Thanksgiving. 
She challenged students to ask them, “What are you going to do to help me?” 
“A lot of these solutions are going to rely on us having a conversation,” she said. 	
The solutions Fraser proposed seemed to resonate with many of the students at the event.  
“I really think she made a lot of sense,” said Ella Davis, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. “She had some really good ideas for the economy in the long term.”  
Charles Merrick, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, had a different opinion. 
“I generally liked the speech,” Merrick said. “I didn’t necessarily agree with things, but they made their points well.”  
Merrick said he was invited to the event by some of his Republican friends and attended because of his interest in economics.  
“It’s important to be open to other opinions,” he said.

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

Throughout the past two weeks, Herman Cain has weathered multiple accusations the he sexual harassed multiple women while the CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Four different women have alleged that Cain acted inappropriately toward them, while two went public this week. Yet despite the media firestorm, Cain remains a republican front runner, only a few points behind Mitt Romney. Why has Cain been able to whether the scandal? How should people react to sexual harassment allegations? Our Quick Take columnists weigh in:

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.

2011-11-13,AU,Republican,"CNN anchor John King likened the current Republican primary campaign to a civil war and drew parallels between President Barack Obama’s re-election bid and former President George H.W. Bush’s failed bid in 1992 during his talk Nov. 9 in Ward 2.
“By every statistical, historical model, Barack Obama loses,” King said. “You cannot find a historical, statistical model that says he wins. But that doesn’t mean he’s not going to win.”
King, now covering his seventh consecutive U.S. presidential campaign, illustrated an electoral landscape full of nuances and unpredictability. He warned students not to trust the traditional methods people use to predict elections.
King also spoke candidly about the shortcomings of certain media networks, including his own, and urged students to get their news from outside of the main Washington, D.C., media outlets to broaden their horizons at the Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event.
Reflecting on the Republican primaries
King outlined the framework of the Republican campaign as a tug of war for control of the heart and soul of the Republican Party. 
“The easiest way to sum it up right now is Romney versus the rest,” King said. “On paper, Romney will be the Republican nominee.” 
King said Romney is taking advantage of the “crowded field” of Republican candidates because it will split the votes to his right. 
“The last thing he wants is a one-on-one,” King said.
The only other candidate who is equal to Romney in electability on paper is Texas Governor Rick Perry, but he has to step up his campaign to remain competitive and be a leading contender, according to King.
“You don’t win Texas if you’re a dope,” King said.
King’s remarks proved to be true. Perry has been widely criticized and quickly discredited in the media for his bumbling gaffe in the Nov. 9 Republican debate when he couldn’t name the third federal agency he would cut.
King also addressed the peculiar aspects of primary elections, taking note that “lily-white” states like Iowa and New Hampshire play an influential role in weeding out candidates because they are the first two states to hold primaries.
And with the added eccentricity of independents now allowed to vote in the New Hampshire primaries, King hypothesized, “If the vote is really close, mischief could decide the race in New Hampshire.”
2012 election repeat of 1992 election?
King said Obama in the 2012 election reminds him of George H.W. Bush in the 1992 election, without going so far as to say the outcome will be the same. 
Despite coming off of foreign policy victories, Bush faced a faltering economy and disenchanted voters, and Bush ultimately lost the race.
“George H.W. Bush was one of the most respected presidents in my lifetime,” King said. “And the American people said, ‘Thanks for trying. See you later.’ That could well happen to [Obama].”
King also laid out the central attack Republicans would launch at Obama: the promise of hope and change that never came. 
The Republicans will emphasize high unemployment and home foreclosure rates and what seems to be the apex of gridlock in Washington when Obama promised post-partisanship as main arguments, according to King.
Obama faces other challenges as well. King said part of Obama’s appeal during his first presidential bid was that he was ""new."" Now that Obama’s novelty has worn off, King predicts an uphill climb.
“He’s a used car now,” King said. “So it’s a tougher sell for him this time.”
Although he listed all the factors that would hurt Obama’s chances, King called Obama a “pretty damn good politician” and left the outcome of the presidential race wide open.
“Remember the arithmetic,” King said. “We’re all equal — one vote. So whoever organizes the best wins.”

•@""(but of course I have to come back...)"" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.

•@person annoyed about sniffling: It is my biggest pet peeve when people are annoyed at people who sniffle. It's a frickin bodily function, it's not a bomb exploding in your face.

[Editor’s note: Thanks for the laughs!]
•editor, I'm sorry your so sad. in al honesty these rants SOMEWHAT remind me of last year. I think it's just last year we had police blotter, collegeacb, and more active userson LAL that funny stuff around campus got posted on here.

•@jog on first date
DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER ASK A GIRL TO GO ON A JOG AS A FIRST DATE!!! I DONT CARE IF SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE NEEDS TO JOG, OR LOOKS LIKE SHE JOGS BY HERSELF ALL THE TIME!!

•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?

-Poetry
-Public policy debate
-Being a dick
-Etc...

•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!

[Editor’s note: First, sexual harassment is against University policy and the student conduct code. Even though “nothing ended up happening,” as you said, you have every right to talk to someone, whether it be a friend, counselor or AU staffer, and to report the incident if you want to. If you want more information on sexual harassment and assault at AU, you can look through AU’s resource page: http://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/sexualassault/. If you’re just looking to talk, maybe try the Counseling Center at 202-885-3500. I’m sure other ranters have ideas as well.]

One of the key parts of racism is one group having power over another.  Sure, you could argue that we have a black president but let's be real, there still is a huge amount of discrimination against black people in many parts of our country.  Clearly, AU DOES need to change the Dean's list.

•I actually saw Neil Kerwin walking through campus the other day, and almost died of shock
•I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone is from the same state, has the same political views, and the same provincial world view. At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world. And not just a couple students, but in every single class at AU. So glad I chose AU.
•I hate that you're flirtatious by nature. It creates feelings in me I know you don't share. I'm really happy to be your friend and am proud to know you trust me with your issues. But now I have feelings for you, and that can't be good for either of us.

•Dear Big, I know you read eagle rants so listen up. You chose me, remember? And I chose you? We were so happy that first semester. Then you went abroad and I tried so hard to make time for you, despite my personal issues. Then you came back and acted like nothing changed. I worked so hard to try and talk to you, but you were ""too busy"". This semester I'm abroad and have emailed you, messaged you, skyped you... with no responses. What did I do to make you not like me? I just want to get an answer.

2012-02-07,AU,Republican,"Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler is surprised Maryland hasn’t moved to legalize same-sex marriage sooner. 
A state senate committee is expected to vote on a Gov. Martin O’Malley’s same-sex marriage bill in the next few weeks.
“Ten years ago, people would think, ‘there's no way in the world,’ ‘it's like walking around on Mars,’ ‘there's no way same-sex couples are getting married in this country,’” Gansler said at a speaking event Jan. 31 in MGC 3, sponsored by AU College Democrats. “Ten years from now, they are going to look back at it as if it was some sort of quaint debate: ‘You know that was weird. Remember when they didn't let same-sex couples get married?’""
Gansler also called the issue a “Republican” one, saying that he believes Republicans see homosexuality as choice and “believe that they can be changed to no longer be homosexual.”
“There’s no issue — it seems to me right now — that’s a social issue that’s more Republican,” Gansler said.
Lawmakers also remain undecided on whether the state should recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
""There's five states in the middle where we say marriage is between a man and a woman, so we don't allow same-sex marriages in the great state of Maryland,” Gansler said in his speech. “But we will, and we are silent on what we are going to do about these other marriages [same-sex marriages from other states].”
Gansler testified in favor of same-sex marriage at a Maryland senatorial hearing Jan. 31, a move Gansler considered risky.
""I knew if I talked to my political people — as you see everyone is over-coached these days — they'd say that was a really stupid idea politically,” Gansler said. “But I thought it was the right thing to do, and I get paid less than paralegals that work at big law firms, so I thought, ‘you know, what if I'm going to be doing this job, I might as well do what's right.’"" 
The State Senate legalized same-sex marriage in February 2011 but it failed in the State House that March. Gansler hopes both chambers will pass the bill this year.
Gansler was elected attorney general in 2006 and is in his second term. He is also the president-elect of the National Association of Attorney Generals, the assembly of all the attorney generals in the United States.
Gansler teaches as an adjunct professor in AU’s Washington College of Law, where he teaches Criminal Trial Advocacy. 
He supports the unionization of AU adjunct professors, saying it gives adjunct professors an opportunity for competitive pay. 
“If in fact it passes, the next issue is: What will the union do for the adjunct professors?” Gansler said.
He encourages students to vote whenever they can, but also to take their time in college to pick a side of the political spectrum.
“I don't think people should pick a party based on what their parents are, but they should understand the issues and figure out which party is more aligned with their views,” Gansler said. “And then get involved the party.""

What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.
• @""To be honest, the whole concept of Greek life families really just annoys me..."" Couldn't agree more. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. Your right, where are their priorities?
• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.
[Editor’s Note: I just delete them when they use curse words]
• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!
• I think I am the Adele
• @hipster girls are gross: You have it all wrong. Hipsters smoke weed. Goths smoke cigarettes.
• I HATE SOCIAL GREEK LIFE. There I said it. It separates everyone into different groups and the rest dont have a group (not that they want one...). Everyone fights for equality and no cliques or bullying but thats what greek like does (a lot of the time, not generalizing).
• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.

• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.

• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.

• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]

• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.

• For the last time, Student Government has NOTHING to do with tuition money!
• @""To the ranters making Breaking Bad references, I want to sweet raw love to all of you!""
As the original poster from yesterday, this makes me so excited I just want to throw a pizza on the roof! But don't worry, I'll save the dipping sticks. ;]
• @I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer.
I have been ranting about this to my friends and everyone I know for every single day of my life...MARRY ME PLS???
• Smoking's a choice; if smokers want to smoke, let them.  This is an awfully controlling thing to try to shove down people's throats, just saying.
• ""@“Drop. Your. Sword.” Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!""
And don't forget: Never get involved in a land war in Asia!
• @ a girl- Might as well have said ""You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week. So I guess you picked today. Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays."" Quit hating! She's concerned about her boyfriend, don't judge her choice to wear sweatpants.
• @Alanis Morissette lyrics
I love you. That is all.
• You sir have also lost the Game.
• Wait you mean smoking is bad for you??? I can't believe no one told me that before!!! I am obviously going to quit right this second now that I know that!
• Woman, I ain't your man, so stop acting like I am!
• “And if you ACTUALLY knew what you were talking about, you’d know that unless a person’s habits and actions are affecting their, or another’s, day to day life, they dont have a problem. But good try.” LoL are you serious here? Are you aware sex involves two people? That means the actions are affecting BOTH the individual with the sluttiness issues AND the people they are sleeping with. That meets your criteria to the letter honey. But good try.
• ""And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with, hm? What one particular element comes to mind, hm? Hmm?""
""Aaaah, wire."" XD
• @ Hey guess what?: Hellz yeah, seems like people cant keep their mouths shut and private business to themselves
• @”I have to wonder, why is there no on campus river? I feel like my tuition should pay for such a thing.” You have no idea how often I think the exact same thing. We should least get a little steam thing going.
• Can everyone just live and let live? Just quit judging people and just BE? But I guess then there wouldn't be any Eagle Rants...
• Last semester, I had a great time at AU without out-of-class friends.  This semester, I got some and had a blast hanging out with them.  Then they randomly quit talking to me.  Now I feel super down on myself and am not having a good time at all.  Hopefully being around people who actually like me back home over break will help my confidence, because I feel really sh*tty right now...
• @”Again, can we please put the Eagle Rants tab on the website on the LEFT side of the screen, so we don’t have to expand the website each time we open the eagle website in order to access the rants.” Agreed. This is three seconds of my life WASTED each day when I have to expand the webpage. Eagle staff, GET ON THIS.
• @”I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer. That’d be cool. But God could have made pokemon real but instead was like “Nah man. Malaria.” T_T” You’re the kind of guy I wanna marry. A) Are you single? B) Where can I find you?
• @ ""I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked."" If you come to the wrestling room in JFC on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 AM, you will have come to the right place.
• Does anyone else watch TV shows on Netflix, and then once you start a show you become obsessed with it and can’t do your homework until you have finished the whole season? #bing tv show watching problems
• sweatpants girl here, thanks for everyone's advice. It was all very helpful. I've talked to my bf about it and we've come to a compromise. :)
• Can we have a vending machine full of Clif bars? Is that even remotely possible?
• @""Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.""- Handily enough, theres a whole article about this! Right here! Online! Under the ""News"" section!
• @""what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.""
We're a loosely-military training group.  I'm a Marine officer candidate myself, and I design the workouts.  They will broadly strengthen all elements of functional fitness.  Do and don't be intimidated by us at the same time.  We welcome all fitness levels (many civilians are part of the group), but we WILL kick your ass :).  We're done until after break, but you won't regret joining us at 6am on the 20th.  All are welcome.
• ""we don’t judge or insult you for not joining."" Hmm.... I wonder how the term GDI came about??
• @""does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?""
I know it existed as of last semester, at least.  I'm pretty sure it's still going on now.  HOWEVER, I run a completely different club, and I can tell you from experience that those ""official"" email addresses usually don't get checked very often.  Your best bet is to find someone who's in it already that can give you the details.
• How about all the confident and attractive people just keep having lots of great sex with each other, and all the nervous virgins can keep calling women ""sluts"" and f***ing themselves?  Problem solved!
• I'm sick and tired of being judged for being male. I'm actually one of the men who is NOT a terrible person.
• I didn't get a Little. :'( I guess I'll just walk the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
• I've cordially invited many people to my pants party but as of yet no one has RSVP-ed. What should I do?
• No matter, how much I try, I cannot will myself to finish this paper.
• Re the leggings as pants debate, and this also applies to the girl with the boyfriend who doesn't like her frequent sweatpants-wearing: I used to be a anti-leggings gal. Now, I love them. They are mega comfortable. If you by a good quality pair (which doesn't have to be anywhere near expensive), they won't be so tight and revealing. And my boyfriend loves when I wear them, so wins all around!
• lol thyroid - cute.
• I just got rescued by the search and rescue raptor. Yay for being home!
• Dear freshmen who thinks they have more credits than me. You dont. You're just like everyone else at this school who thinks their smart. STFU or GTFO
• @people complaining about 30 year old guy walking around in a building: did you care to see if he worked for AU as facilities or maintenance? did you see if he had been claimed by someone? because I work at a front desk and I have seen strangers ask residents to claim them and the resident will. so double check among yourselves before blaming the people at the desk.
• @• ""I’m sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished..."" If you actually read the email, it wasn't talking about the creation of a victim's advocate position, it was talking about the recent development of confidentiality for that position... which just happened this year.  Also, the email opened up with ""For years.""
• I WANNA MAKE LOVE WITH YOU!
• Regarding the smoking issue:Its irrelevant whether or not smoking is addicting or dangerous. I'm sorry, but if you really are so terrified of second-hand smoke that you cant stand to be around it, then you should have gone to a non-smoking school, instead of making everyone conform to you. This is a matter of liberty. People have the right to do what they want to their body. You do not have the authority to limit people's free choices. Plain and simple.
• @""Where are the AC fans?"" I am a fan of air conditioning.
• Dear Person who quoted Pete's Dragon, I love you.
• Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
• Can we go back to weekly rants?  As much as I enjoy the daily rants, 1) The Rants were all around better when they only came out once a week and 2) I'm sick of these ""hey post the rants already"" rants.
Signed,
A Disgruntled Ranter
• why, why, WHY? cant you just respond
• I was watching Kenan and Kel tonight, and the plot was them trying to get to a double date on time. Their date was to see a movie called Teen McBride. Anytime it was brought up, I only heard Tim McBride... #AUproblems
• @""sweetie, if you want silence don’t sit outside the mud box and don’t tell me what to do cause im a freshman, i probably have more credits than you anyways.""...honey, talk to me in 4 years when you grow up and think twice before you throw lip, because you don't know who you may cross.
• Banana,
Thursday night I met you on LAL. you seemed really cool. thanks again for the genuine conversation.
Apple
• Well all the friends that you knew in school, they used to be so cool, now they just bore you. Well look at them now, already pulling the plow - so quick to take to grain like some old mule.
• @virtually no sexual assaults on campus: Come to Take Back the Night, I (double-dog) dare you. Amazing how your perspective changes when you see that girl from class go up to the microphone.
• So over people hating on Women's Initiative. They go hard in the paint, get over it.
• drunk eagleranting is the bestest eagleranting
• So ready to live with people who understand that mental health is a real thing.

• Someone needs to start a petition or awareness campaign or something to cut down on the excessive amount of long-distance relationships (half) on this campus.
• Jose for #
• To my photo TA: If you get any hotter, I may go insane
• LISTEN UP. AU will never be smoke free, not at least until we get our campus plan approved. Where do people go when they can't smoke on campus? The neighborhood directly around campus. This is the same neighborhood that hates AU and the students. As long as the university wants to get the campus plan approved, the campus will never go smoke free. It would be a very stupid decision. (Don't get me wrong though, I totally support a smoke-free campus!)
• @""Is Women’s Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a “rape culture”?"" ARE. YOU. JOKING. ME?? GTFO.
• To the person who responded with a hash tag about straight female conservative republican. I'm glad you people are demonized on campus. How dare you try to deny legitimate members of our society the right to marriage? Or to spend countless tax dollars on drug testing the poor to satiate your appetite for humiliation of those less fortunate than yourself? I've got a hash tag for you. #scum
• I""m just going to let you go, I like you enough to not want you to get hurt by me.
• @ whoever commented on my @5th week at the counseling center.
Thank you! Things are going very well. It's all about attitude and learning to help yourself rather than having someone else help you. It's rather exciting. Good luck with you too! Just remember to trust yourself, be yourself, and believe in yourself! (little words of wisdom I tell myself everyday to keep going, it sounds cheesy I know) LOVE YOUR LIFE everyone! It gets better :-)
• To the girl whose dog just had puppies and who let her sorority sisters take them out on the quad: Those little bundles of joy made my day, and you are amazing. I would love to have one if I could in my dorm! XP They were really so adorable. :']
• to awful lotta high class honkeys: please quit your whining - at least sometimes. it's getting old.
• Gov. Brewer ""deserves to be protested,"" while at the same time we should welcome a ""saint"" with open arms who named a sitting US Senator and Presidential candidate after a sex act... Way to go AU. Disgusting.
• TY TY RAH RAH!! ;) you fine like dynamite.
• T,
YOU'RE SEXY AND I KNOW IT!!
-curiousgal
• So excited to have the room to myself! Zumba every day!!!
• Is there a way I could get an e-mail when rants are posted. Am I too obsessed?
• Please post rants are at a more consistent time (like 5 each day). This week's times have ranged 4:34 pm to 9:30 pm. I need consistency in order to plan my daily schedule of activities. Thanks.
• omg you suck for not responding to my texts. i'm just bored and want you to come have sex with me, sheesh.
• Guys at TDR were making fun of us for staying on campus during Spring Break, calling us nerds.  Not to sound elitist, but I don't think I'm going to be taking life advice from a TDR worker.
• To the kid in my lit class who always disrespects the teacher: I'm not saying I love everything about her. But I'm putting time and money into that class, and if you don't shut up FAST, we will have a problem. PS: your paper was terrible and it DIDN'T fit the assignment. true story. stop whining.

After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The controversy has forced our nation into intense self-examination: of its gun policies, of race relations, of police practices. What else has this tragedy exposed? And what can we learn from it?

Perpetuating hate and injustice

Stand your ground

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

2012-05-01,AU,Republican,"The House of Representatives voted to maintain low interest rates for federal student loans after President Barack Obama traveled to three college campuses advocating for the extension. 
The vote came to the House floor on April 27, two days after the president visited universities in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa to speak to students about the importance of keeping interest rates on federal student loans from rising. If Congress fails to vote on maintaining low interest rates on federal Stafford loans, the rates will double on July 1.
Because the bill takes funding away from Obama’s health care law, the White House announced that the president will veto it.
While on flight to Boulder, Obama addressed student journalists in a conference call about the federal loans that 7.4 million students are currently paying off.
“I know what this is like, because when [First Lady] Michelle [Obama] and I graduated from college and law school we had enormous debts, and it took us a lot of years to pay off,” the president said. “So that’s probably why I feel this thing so personally.”
On average, students who take out loans for college graduate with $25,000 in debt, he said. But AU students graduated with an average debt of $35,206 in 2010, which is more than $10,000 higher than the national average and holds the record among D.C. universities,  The Eagle previously reported. 
The unemployment rate for Americans without a college degree is twice as high as that for those who have one, so college needs to be more affordable, Obama told students. Higher education should be available to everyone, and making it less affordable will only give the middle class fewer ladders to climb, he said.
“Republicans in Congress have voted against new ways to make college more affordable for middle class families, even while they’re voting for huge tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” he said. “Tax cuts that, by the way, would have to be paid for by cutting things like education and job-training programs that give students new opportunities to work and succeed.”
The president encouraged students to contact Congress about the issue and to speak out on Twitter, using the hashtag, “#dontdoublemyrate.”
Recent AU graduates are struggling to pay off their student loans, even with the help of their parents.
Former SG president Andy MacCracken is one of those students. With $50,000 in undergraduate debt and an expected $20,000 loan for his graduate degree, he doubts he will be able to buy a home or start a family within the next 10 years because of the cost of paying back his loans. MacCracken, now the associate director of the National Campus Leadership Council, is mobilizing students to talk to the White House about the importance of reducing student debt.
AU graduate student Tara Ashraf received two scholarships and help from her parents to afford her undergraduate education, causing her to graduate without any student debt. Still, she believes the cost of college in the United States is too high – especially in comparison to European universities.
“I had a Spanish professor who said that for all of his schooling, including his Masters, he paid $7,000,” Ashraf said. “It’s outrageous how much we have to pay here for an education that doesn’t even come close to education systems that other countries have.”

2012-05-05,AU,Republican,"•@Wedding troubles: it is your and your boyfriend's wedding, not your brother's or sister's.  Do what you  want to do, and if they ever get married, they can plan their weddings whatever way they want.  This will be a memory that will last forever.  Don't let your wishes and memories be shaped by what other people want you to do.



•Stop with the biddie hate, being a biddie is fun, try it sometime.
•@ ""Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough?""
That's just man's natural defense mechanism against needy women.
•@ Guy who wore biking spandex into The Dav.
Of all the people you had to bend over in front of you chose me. I have one question. WHY?!
•@Allison DuBois: I’m not saying that they didn’t use it in court, I’m saying that mostly everyone that she claims to have worked with openly deny that fact or say she wasn’t helpful at all, not just in court. One officer even stated that she was trying to get information off of him. This all draws one huge FAKE sign in my head.
•@Allison DuBois cont’d: mind DNA? You’re really just throwing anything out there to try and make sense. If she had some new kind of DNA, why doesn’t she let scientists test her DNA? Or study her brain for a few days until she gets a vision? That would surely give us some answers and probably lead to a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the brain. But no, she just writes books and goes on tour and tells people how to do it herself. And no, one guy at the University of Phoenix who studies psychics doesn’t mean anything.
•@Allison DuBois cont’d: If you want to believe its real, you must first believe that souls and ghosts and goblins exist. It doesn’t matter how much you watch “Ghost Hunters” and think that's real too, there is absolutely zero scientific evidence that any of that stuff exists. What is easier to believe, that this woman really has supernatural powers, or that she is deceiving everyone to further her career? No, there’s no way ANY human would do the latter, right? Just like every other fairy tale, I will believe its real when there is actual, empirical, scientific evidence for it.
•@Allison DuBois (one last time): If its Allison's policy that nobody can say she worked with them, then that should really be another red flag. And yes, I can create visions in my head whenever I want. I can call them dreams too if I felt like. And your comparison with washing hands before delivering babies doesn't work because its actually testable and verifiable.

[Editor's note: Aw, thanks, Eaglet!]
•I posted a rant regarding Sarah McBride that was not hateful, just simply posing the other side of the argument and how I don't necessarily understand it but that got censored.. so I think your censoring rules are bogus you just censor anything bad regarding McBride
[Editor's note: When it comes to this topic, Sarah is being considered a private figure. No one deserves to have everyone comment on their gender and sexuality.]
•My roommate/best friend is possibly transferring next semester to a better school but hasn't gotten a letter yet.. I have to leave without knowing if I'll see her next year and I don't know how to tell her how amazing she is and how much she has changed my life
•All McBride did as SG president (as it seems by the Eagle article) is work towards issues with LGBT.. while important, really? that's all he did? kind of biased..
•If I wasn't at AU, I'd still be at University of Maryland (I transferred). It makes me sad when people bitterly complain about AU. You guys really have no idea how good you have it.
•Nice spamming,SG senators. As someone who DOESN'T work for the Eagle, and used to be a senator, I'll second their report- You guys are awful. You take credit for things you had barely anything to do with, you pass moronic resolutions (TAMPON, anyone?) and you generally think this is an episode of West Wing. So yeah, hop off. But also, I believe there were TWO SG reporters and they were both really nice. The other one had to leave to take a SG position. But let's give credit where credit is due- good work Zoey too!
•lol @DG salute. Their little groin to butt line thing is basically tetris with sorority girls... not attractive.
•@I wish I hadn't wasted so much time in the beginning of the semester trying to be friends with one group of people: I feel the exact same way. Next year I hope to be a lot more outgoing and meet a lot more people.
•??????!! ??????!! :) (I don't speak enough to tell you to have a good time but hope you did! I'm leaving in a month!!)
•@Werewolf syndrome:  Better be careful.  On Cinco de Mayo we're going to have the largest full moon of the year.
•@. I’m just an average guy w/ Werewolf syndrome -- I'm an AU student and I don't care if you have hypertrichosis.
•So, if Sarah McBride is a girl now, is she still allowed to be in SigEp?
[Editor's note: She disaffiliated.]
•@Wish I could just have a hook up for finals week, I need some way to get rid of all this stress... Tell me about it. I totally agree.
•You are being watched. The government has a secret system: a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know because I built it. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything. Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you. Crimes the government considered irrelevant. They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. But I needed a partner, someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. You'll never find us, but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up...we'll find you
•@person mad at editor for censoring McBride rants Why not just post your comments on the actual article? You can create a fake email address when making your screen name. I'm not defending censorship, but worth a try?

•Rolie Polie Olie is back on the air. Don't lie, you know you loved it as a kid. It's on Disney Junior channel. FTW.

•How come people tell you not to stand in front of an emergency exit when if there was an emergency surely you would run through it?
Why did Sally sell seashells on the seashore when you can just pick them up anyway?
In libraries, do they put the bible in the fiction or non-fiction section?
Why are both of Spongebob's parents round like sea sponges while he is square like a kitchen sponge?

•Sarah McBride is brave and awesome, but people at this university need to check their privilege. She is a trans female who is white & upper-middle class, and that was probably the biggest reason why she was accepted with such fervor.

I give you a week before you snap.
•OP of roommate transferring- I know, I can't tell her how upset I am because I want her to go where she is happy so it's a really difficult position.. she leaves tomorrow and I still haven't said anything.. sigh
•my roommate has stopped doing laundry, she is just spraying her shirts with a perfume mixture now.
•@""""The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?"" Are you stupid? No.""- clearly someone doesnt get the humor in this. the original ranter was implying that the scenario which takes place (hot guy who turns out to be gay) is very reminiscent of an AU situation
•@""animal- free food is often cheaper and provides something that everyone can enjoy."" mmhmm cuz TDR's tempeh is just soooo delicious... uh, NOT. Spoiler, not everyone enjoys squished soy cubes. We evolved to have our taste buds enjoy meat because it gives us the protein and salt we need. TDR is the reason I STOPPED being vegan. Ick.
•@Wish I could just have a hook up... Hey, I'm in the same boat. It seems as tho the men-folk really have  only school on the brain... FOR LIKE THE FIRST TIME EVER!
•I miss my dog, but I'm not going home this summer.. Waaaaahhh
•It's three in the morn' and I'm lookin' for the porn.
•Either the editor didn't post my rant, or I just forgot to submit it. Probably the latter, but I'm not sure. I was pretty sleep-deprived.
•Went to a Nats game this weekend, watched the WONK campaign evaporate my tuition dollars before my eyes. Seriously, what kind of self-respecting university advertises themselves that much at a ballpark? WONK needs to burn in hell.
•Gender identity disorder is the formal psychological term for those who are transgender/transsexual. It will be called gender dysphoria in the DSM-5, and will still cover these topics. Personally, I do not believe it should be considered a ""disorder"", the same way homosexuality isn't considered a disorder (though it used to be), but there are certain benefits with it being a diagnosable disorder, including that insurance companies will cover things like gender reassignment surgery. There's debate about the topic among psychologists and just people in general.
•@why am i so lonely?
I used to feel that way until I found God and rediscovered  my faith in Jesus Christ.  God made you in his own image.  He will never leave you alone.
•@girlfriend needs to grow up: Instead of criticizing her, try explaining logically what  she did and how it negatively affected you. Speak in terms of “I feel x and y”, rather than “you always do x and y”. If you accuse of things she will be less likely to listen to you. Positive affirmation is always better at changing behavior than negative affirmation. I recommend the book “The Truth About Love” by Dr. Patricia Love PhD for more relationship tips.
•I also thought the werewolf rant was some twilight reference. Now I looked it up on wikipedia and saw that it is a real thing. To answer your question seriously OP, yes AU is very accepting of all types of conditions and lifestyles. You will love it here. Hope to see you next year!
•I like it when u call me big pa-pa.
•You laugh at my dreams and you don't accept my life goals. It really upsets me and makes me feel less valued.
•@way out of control promotion of “sexual assault awareness” ranter: I completely agree. Whenever I have friends visit me at AU, they think AU is a college full of rapists. AU probably has a much much lower rate of date rape that most of other colleges in the country (for one, because so much of the population is gay). The whole overdramatization of the rape awareness campaigns are actually hurting real victims by making AU look stupid and by turning the whole issue of date rape into a cry wolf situation.
•Why does no one reply to the Gary Johnson rants? Ron Paul gets some love. Come on now. There is no way I am the only Gary Johnson supporter at AU. He embodies the best of both parties. Fiscal responsibility from the republicans and civil liberties and equality from the democrats. Gary Johnson 2012!
•Woah, woah, woah. Someone is dating their big??? WTF??? That is the worst greek incest.
•@Editor- So if I publish an op-ed saying that I'm very secure in my gender, and my personal opinion is that there are psychological explanations behind gender identity disorder, are you going to censor the rants disagreeing with me? What Sarah did is beautiful, and brave, and I'm happy for her, but I think that those who had issues with her op-ed deserve to be heard the same way she got an opportunity to be heard. Don't encourage an atmosphere of division here by only publishing one side.
•I know Sarah, and she's been wonderful and receptive to answering people's questions about her transition. Eagle Rants is an excellent platform for people who don't know her, and have confusions. If you don't publish the negative (but not hateful...) rants, these people who don't know anything about transgendered people won't have the opportunity to have other people answer and respond. You're basically facilitating ignorance about this... I'm really disappointed in the Eagle.
•the editor just answering nope= complete BS.. you know you're wrong, McBride gave up the privacy by posting the article and just replying with nope is a cop out because you know you should've posted those rants
•Are you sad to see the editor of Eagle rants go?
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•Sarah McBride is a private figure who you can't negatively comment on.
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•I don't think the issue of on campus food is about the variety of food... it's more about the price. There is a ridiculous  mark up on everything on campus. My bank account can't handle it!
•On my to do list I made last night for the rest of finals, I've only been able to cross one thing off so far. This is not good.
•I think it's wonderful that Sarah was able to come out to a very accepting environment and I am very proud of her decision. However, if you're going to uphold her status as a non-public figure don't publish ANY rants about her.
•OK, I can understand the Student Union being upset about the fact that students have no say with regards to raising tuition and what's going into the McDonald's, but I really don't have sympathy re: being a dry campus. That's been a policy for a loooong time; you should've known that when you signed on.
•The idea of the unpaid internship is a completely immoral concept and a violation of labor laws. AU (and all other colleges) need to stop encouraging immoral corporations to take advantage of desperate students and needs to stop giving ""college credit"" for ""internships"". College is for learning. Not for paying 3k to AU in order to work for free as an envelop licker.
•As a redhead, I'm so sick of the word ""ginger."" Ugh.
•I once had to fart really badly in a literature class. So, ladies, I am single and available. #realtalk
•From NYT : “When I lived in D.C., it astounded me that the nation's best and brightest college students, hoping to go into politics, worked for senators and congressmen unpaid. Not only was this surprising because of the amount of work D.C. interns actually did on the Hill, but also because it meant that only the wealthier college students could afford to work these unpaid ""jobs"" and, therefore, meet the people and get the experiences that would be integral if they chose to continue on in politics. And we wonder why our politicians tend to come from the ""1 percent.""”
•Did anyone else read the New York Times article “The Outsources Life” about how we are outsourcing intimacy in the form of hiring therapists/life coaches/wantologists because we view sharing our problems with friends as burdening them? When did we become too busy to care for others? Thoughts?
•@Person ranting about Sarah McBride's Op/Ed, she wrote that to appropriately explain, as outgoing president, what was happening.  The AU community deserved an explanation about this public figure.  She did not write it to be criticized for her feelings and decisions.  And what do you care if she did or not?  It's her life, not yours.
•@""AU really isn't vegan-friendly at all...."" FALSE. We were ranked 10th this year. Check yo self.
•I made the best rants of the year TWICE and I am embarrassingly proud.
[Editor’s Note: Kudos!]
•Dear one girl sitting with all of AEPi in the library: I don't know what weird, deep psychological need you're trying to fulfill, but you just look pathetic and you're not cute. P.S., everyone is annoyed by how loud you guys are being.
•If you whine about not getting a place to replace McDonalds look no further than the fanatical green movement on this campus. The reason no company took the lease is because there is a clause for carbon neutrality. Do not let the eagle article trick you into thinking companies pulled out do to a lack of interest from corporate. It is due to these idiotic green eagles that we can not have a normal place to eat at on our campus.
•@Editor: Ohhh editor, let us call a spade a spade and admit. You like Sarah or support the situation they are going through so you are avoiding dissident press. I have no qualms with it but do not postulate you are doing it for some moral inclination, being her privacy. Coming out like that was no private matter and you have not posted rants that did not even attack Sarah but rather ask provocative questions about trans sexuality. Just admit it.
•All I seem to be doing lately is playing with fire.
•@Person who asked a question about a cow: You shouldn't get spoiled milk, you'll be buttering it up if you do it right.
•@Hate -I probably am a terrible person. I would still like to have a discussion in person so we can end the year like the friends we once were.
•Has anyone ever told you that you're a passive-aggressive low life? It's no wonder you have a whopping two friends here. Have fun abroad because I never want to see you again after what you've said. La chatte!
•Amie Krupnick? YOU BET.
•I have three roomates. I love two of them dearly but we all hate the third one. How can we convince her to move ouuuut?
•Go SG!
•Im thankful for the blog.
•Fun fact. Racism is still funny.
•As a woman, I'm all for gender equality, but do you think next year Women's Initiative we can tone it down a bit? My grandmother came to pick me up and I'm trying to explain to her I don't go to a school of rapists. If she passes out....
•I am so grateful for your blog post.Much thanks again. Want more.
•The myAU Portal is totally broken right now. Great. It's not like I need to see what my grades are or anything.
•I had too much sex this semester.
•I don't know how to tell you how much your friendship has meant to me this year. It's too important to do it over text message, and if I say it in person I might end up hugging you and crying, even though I am neither a hugger nor a cry-er. Thanks for putting up with my brattiness, and for helping me get swoll.
•Impeach the Eagle Rants Editor!
•I missed puppy day :(
•Hey Eagle Rants editor, if I make an inappropriate comment toward some random transgender person without mentioning a specific name, will you still censor me? What if this person doesn't even exist? And what if my comment is not geared toward all transgender people, but just this one person who I won't name? Will you still censor me then?
[Editor’s Note: The Eagle does not publish hate speech, so probably not.]
•Seeing as how The Eagle keeps censoring Sarah rants, I say we need  another Free Speech wall so that all expressions can be heard without fear of censorship.
•Thank you ever so for you article.Thanks Again.
•I asked you to do ONE thing, and I gave you plenty of time to do it, and you didn't. You suck.
•Where are the May 7th eagle rants???
[Editor’s Note: Editor’s got finals, too, you know.]
•@ @Women's Initiative (who stated a prospective student was worried if sexual assault was an issue on the campus), If statistics such as 1 in 4 were lower, there would be no need for the programming. Stop sexual assault, not the prevention.

Eagle Rants: July/August 2013





Eagle Rants: June 24, 2013





Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




Editor's Note: This summer, starting today, Eagle Rants will be posted only every Monday. Also, we have switched Eagle Rants editor as of today.
•@AU Vigilante: You're a little late to the party, dude.  But welcome.  Don't wear a cape; being a super hero isn't about you, it's about the people you're protecting.
•If Sarah McBride is not a public figure then you shouldn't be posting positive rants about her either.  No rants that identify non-public figures remember?  So post 'em all or none at all.
•I want to study abroad, but I have a feeling the women won't take kindly to the close examination. Ha, Drum hit. Badum Tish!
•@""I'm scared to let you go. But I'm also scared to let you in.""
Let him/her in.  Life is easier when you have someone to share it with.
•@ "" I'm not ashamed to be excited to go home and hang out with my parents on Friday and Saturday nights""
I give you a week before you snap.
•OP of roommate transferring- I know, I can't tell her how upset I am because I want her to go where she is happy so it's a really difficult position.. she leaves tomorrow and I still haven't said anything.. sigh
•my roommate has stopped doing laundry, she is just spraying her shirts with a perfume mixture now.
•@""""The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?"" Are you stupid? No.""- clearly someone doesnt get the humor in this. the original ranter was implying that the scenario which takes place (hot guy who turns out to be gay) is very reminiscent of an AU situation
•@""animal- free food is often cheaper and provides something that everyone can enjoy."" mmhmm cuz TDR's tempeh is just soooo delicious... uh, NOT. Spoiler, not everyone enjoys squished soy cubes. We evolved to have our taste buds enjoy meat because it gives us the protein and salt we need. TDR is the reason I STOPPED being vegan. Ick.
•@Wish I could just have a hook up... Hey, I'm in the same boat. It seems as tho the men-folk really have  only school on the brain... FOR LIKE THE FIRST TIME EVER!
•I miss my dog, but I'm not going home this summer.. Waaaaahhh
•It's three in the morn' and I'm lookin' for the porn.
•Either the editor didn't post my rant, or I just forgot to submit it. Probably the latter, but I'm not sure. I was pretty sleep-deprived.
•Went to a Nats game this weekend, watched the WONK campaign evaporate my tuition dollars before my eyes. Seriously, what kind of self-respecting university advertises themselves that much at a ballpark? WONK needs to burn in hell.
•Gender identity disorder is the formal psychological term for those who are transgender/transsexual. It will be called gender dysphoria in the DSM-5, and will still cover these topics. Personally, I do not believe it should be considered a ""disorder"", the same way homosexuality isn't considered a disorder (though it used to be), but there are certain benefits with it being a diagnosable disorder, including that insurance companies will cover things like gender reassignment surgery. There's debate about the topic among psychologists and just people in general.
•@why am i so lonely?
I used to feel that way until I found God and rediscovered  my faith in Jesus Christ.  God made you in his own image.  He will never leave you alone.
•@girlfriend needs to grow up: Instead of criticizing her, try explaining logically what  she did and how it negatively affected you. Speak in terms of “I feel x and y”, rather than “you always do x and y”. If you accuse of things she will be less likely to listen to you. Positive affirmation is always better at changing behavior than negative affirmation. I recommend the book “The Truth About Love” by Dr. Patricia Love PhD for more relationship tips.
•I also thought the werewolf rant was some twilight reference. Now I looked it up on wikipedia and saw that it is a real thing. To answer your question seriously OP, yes AU is very accepting of all types of conditions and lifestyles. You will love it here. Hope to see you next year!
•I like it when u call me big pa-pa.
•You laugh at my dreams and you don't accept my life goals. It really upsets me and makes me feel less valued.
•@way out of control promotion of “sexual assault awareness” ranter: I completely agree. Whenever I have friends visit me at AU, they think AU is a college full of rapists. AU probably has a much much lower rate of date rape that most of other colleges in the country (for one, because so much of the population is gay). The whole overdramatization of the rape awareness campaigns are actually hurting real victims by making AU look stupid and by turning the whole issue of date rape into a cry wolf situation.
•Why does no one reply to the Gary Johnson rants? Ron Paul gets some love. Come on now. There is no way I am the only Gary Johnson supporter at AU. He embodies the best of both parties. Fiscal responsibility from the republicans and civil liberties and equality from the democrats. Gary Johnson 2012!
•Woah, woah, woah. Someone is dating their big??? WTF??? That is the worst greek incest.
•@Editor- So if I publish an op-ed saying that I'm very secure in my gender, and my personal opinion is that there are psychological explanations behind gender identity disorder, are you going to censor the rants disagreeing with me? What Sarah did is beautiful, and brave, and I'm happy for her, but I think that those who had issues with her op-ed deserve to be heard the same way she got an opportunity to be heard. Don't encourage an atmosphere of division here by only publishing one side.
•I know Sarah, and she's been wonderful and receptive to answering people's questions about her transition. Eagle Rants is an excellent platform for people who don't know her, and have confusions. If you don't publish the negative (but not hateful...) rants, these people who don't know anything about transgendered people won't have the opportunity to have other people answer and respond. You're basically facilitating ignorance about this... I'm really disappointed in the Eagle.

2012-08-10,AU,Republican,"Rooted in a world where big business controls politicians to the point where stump speeches sound like late-night infomercials, “The Campaign” is a fitting satire for the scandals of modern politics.
This is a movie that thrives on its premise. Set in North Carolina, incumbent congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell, “The Other Guys”) is a glad-handing, philandering fool who has run unopposed for the last few elections. After Brady becomes embroiled in a sex scandal, a pair of multinational corporation-owning businessmen named the Motch brothers, played by Dan Aykroyd (“War, Inc.”) and John Lithgow (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”), decide it's time to install a new congressman more favorable to their business interests. They back Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis, “The Hangover”), a cardigan-wearing wuss who speaks in an effeminate Southern drawl, to challenge Brady.
While the fun of the movie is watching the two candidates sink lower and lower to try to hurt one another's election chances, the real heart is seeing the political race depicted as a complete farce. Neither candidate has anything of worth to say, with Brady throwing out patriotic rhetoric (his slogan is “America, Jesus and freedom”) while Huggins adopts a vague back-to-values platform that insists “It's a mess!” without ever defining what exactly the mess is.
Because of this, the movie is technically non-partisan. Both candidates are Republican, but no actual Republican ideology is ridiculed. Instead, the political hopefuls compete with each other through alpha-male posturing, trying to prove who the better father, husband and breadwinner is. Before he even begins the race, Huggins gets a total life makeover with gun racks and oil paintings of eagles hung on his walls. He even has to replace his two pugs with a brown lab and a golden retriever because those breeds tested better with focus groups.
The most important question for a comedy, though, is: is it funny? Yeah, it's pretty funny. You probably won't be dying in your seat with laughter, but you'll be entertained. Ferrell is great in his role as he combines his reprised roles of President George W. Bush and Ron Burgundy. Galifianakis’ skill at playing naïve characters is used in a different way than usual, but it still works. The two roles are rooted in each comedian's sense of humor, so fans of either will be pleased. The supporting cast has some great performances as well. Unfortunately, Lithgow and Aykroyd as the Motch brothers don't seem to be savoring their roles and, consequently, come off as dull.
The movie does rely a bit too heavily on gross-out humor. Some of it comes with the territory since the plot deals in part with sex scandals, but it seems like a crutch occasionally. If you have two rich wells of political humor and character-driven humor to draw from, why have so many jokes about genetalia?
It could be because, as a straight-up comedy, the movie is weaker than the highest points of Ferrell’s and Galifianakis’ respective careers. If you're going to “The Campaign” expecting to pure hilarity on par with “Anchorman”, you'll be slightly disappointed. However, if you're in the market for a topical political satire that will make you laugh throughout, “The Campaign” is an excellent candidate.

2012-10-13,AU,Republican,"• Mind your own business, certain people
• Sooo, why were the Thursday night Eagle Rants to weird? Seriously, they made no sense to me.
• @""Wow, Biden was a real jackass in the debate tonight.."" Well, Republicans should be seriously embarrassed at how disrespectful, condescending, and immature the majority of your presidents are. In words of Michael Kelso, ""BURN."" 
• Patience is a Virtue. SO CALM YOURSELVES. Rants will be up when they are up. 
• @person who will transfer due to lack of friends: You should check out the Methodist-Protestant Community. Our services are lots of fun and the pastor is pretty badass, and there's always free food (Oreos, Goldfish, hummus, big honkin block of cheddar cheese, the works) after services. Consider this my personal invitation to you to join us 7pm on Sunday at Kay (and it really, REALLY doesn't matter I you're Protestant, Christian, or even religious, you're welcome anyways). If it weren't for the Methodists, I'd have transferred a long time ago. 
• Ummm was it just me, or were you flirting with me all evening?
• YES to Biden calling Ryan out on his BS. Dems need more of that. Of course Republicans are going to whine about his interruptions, ironically, considering last week's debate. 
• Study lounge door handle currently broken. Been stuck in here for 4 hours. Everyone is sleeping or went home for the break. Someone please save me.
• When you connect to your friend in an unnatural and weird way is when you know you love each other.
• eagle rants are a rude wake up call to me. they just highlight how racist and sexist everyone at AU is. stay classy y'all.
• @""I wish the girls at AU weren’t so God-awfully hideous.""
In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is kind.
• Can't tell if there was actually blood all over Ward or someone is just the funniest eagle rants troll in a longggggg time.
• Why was there blood on ward's steps? Was it because of scissor man?
• My boyfriend is the most amazing, hilarious man to walk the earth....until a sporting event comes on, when he gets so aggressively angry that i get scared. I already avoid being around him if I know some big game is going to be on. But since there is practically always something sports related on, sometimes Im there. Worst is when we're in the car and he listens over the radio, and becomes such an aggressive drivr that I genuinely think we won't survive. What should I do? I'm afraid this is how an abusive relationship begins
• I hope Miranda July knows she has a great looking ass.
• I want to tell my roommate I am in recovery for an eating disorder in order to get her to stop saying triggering things (""ha ha! I haven't eaten all day isn't that funny? I'm not even hungry!"") But it might just make things worse. I don't want to set her off. After all, I used to say things like that before I snapped and decided being a robot running on fumes was better than being human.
• @Im not happy here, and there is no one here i can really talk to about it. I would give anything for a relaxing weekend at home. I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Why can't we know each other?!
• I have trouble making friends here too and i don't why
• Ryan's complete lack of foreign policy knowledge made me want to scream. 
• I hope everyone realizes that the Eagle Rants editor is a normal person with a life. And every time the current one gets 'fired' because they don't post rants on time, the person who replaces them does exactly the same thing. Just be happy with what we've got.

• To the veteran who's having trouble with his/her benefits: I know some people who can help you with that.  Meet me in Ward 101 at 11:30am this Sunday if you want.
• @Democrats should be embarrassed: Nah, man, I love Joe Biden. He's hilarious and right on the money.
• Loving this new GOP ""disrespectful"" line. Give me a break. 
• My slam went home for break and I'm stuck here.
• Was there really a self-inflicted scissor accident at Ward or did someone just bring joy back to Rants?  Either way, I laughed, thanks.
• @TDR Coffee Ice Cream Ranter: At least you have some selection of ice cream to consume daily. People who do not have dietary restrictions eat up the pints of rice ice cream just because they can, and then people like me have to wait for ages for another opportunity to have some. It's really a downer.
• Thank you so much for reminding me Downton Abbey airs in the UK before the US. Project Free Tv here I come... Guess I know what I'm doing with my Fall Break.

2012-11-08,AU,Republican,"President Barack Obama won re-election in the 2012 presidential campaign against Gov. Mitt Romney on Tuesday after garnering the electoral votes of several major swing states. The president received noteworthy support from college age students as 60 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 cast their ballots for Obama. 
In addition, more young people voted in this election than in 2008.  People between the ages of 18 and 29 accounted for 19 percent of those who voted in the election, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.
Battleground States
Obama won 11 of the 14 swing states, including Virginia, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada.
Both the Obama and Romney campaigns expect Florida to narrowly favor the president.
Same-Sex Marriage
Maryland and Maine passed ballot measures Tuesday allowing same-sex marriage. Washington state is projected to pass a similar ballot measure, but results had not been finalized as of Nov. 8. Minnesota voters also rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. 
Marijuana Initiatives 
Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, and medical marijuana may be legalized in Massachusetts and Montana, pending final vote counts.  However, Oregon and Arkansas voted against legalization of marijuana. 
Puerto Rico may become the 51st State of America
Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood for the first time. According to the Constitution, Congress would still need to decide whether or not to accept Puerto Rico as a state before it can join the union.
Warren Unseats Brown 
Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren defeated Republican Senator Scott Brown in the Senate race.  The Warren-Brown race gained publicity after Brown’s repeated accusations that Warren illegitimately claimed to have Native American ancestry to advance her career. Brown was elected to replace the deceased Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime Democrat in the Senate. Warren helped create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, a major cornerstone for the Obama Administration, and was a favorite among Democrats to head the new agency. 
Mourdock Defeated by Donnelly
The Democrats gained another seat in the Senate with the victory of Joe Donnelly over Republican Richard Mourdock.  Mourdock was severely criticized after he said that pregnancy as a result of rape was “something God intended.”
McCaskill Defeats Akin
Claire McCaskill defeated Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate Race.  Akin’s campaign had its share of controversy. When he was asked whether abortion should be allowed in the case of rape, and he responded that “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down.”  He went on to say that the rapist, not the unborn child, should be punished.

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

2012-11-09,AU,Republican,"• rape is a helluva drug.
• I wrote this song a real long time ago - a real long time ago - back in 94
• People on here are honestly so pathetic, cuddling, relationships, and hookups through eagle rants? 
• I hate my life 
• Tried to ask a girl out last night and couldn't work up the courage....urghh maybe I'm not ready :(
• I would've whistled as you walked by, but we were on the silent floor ;)
• Why did CNN completely ignore the over a million votes that Gary Johnson got? Wtf
• Number of Yemeni civilians killed by Obama's drone strikes: 60-163 
Number of Yemeni children killed by Obama's drone strikes:24-34
Source: Bureau of Investigative Journalism
• When you're feeling terrible just remember; Edward Furlong made an album of terrible songs.
• You may be right. I may be crazy. But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.
• @Super bummed..........I think you're talking about me, you're from Texas, right? I was wondering why you hadn't texted me! I had really wanted you to :)
• There are absolutely some women and some men who hate other men strictly because they are male.  This is sexism.  Just because it isn't common doesn't mean that it doesn't occur.  
• @pandora for tv shows: it's called netflix you tool
• Dear CAUS- If you're going to hold a protest how about not doing right next to my room while I'm trying to do homework. 
• CAUS- I'm all for freedom of assembly but respect your peers and don't bang pots and pans at 11 PM. That does not get the administration's attention, it just annoys other students. 
• wish that i believed in fate. wish i didn't sleep so late. 
• C'mon CAUSE, it's quiet hours!
• Why does Shepard Smith still work at Fox News? He must have the patience of a saint.
• @Congrats, liberal tools: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought equal rights, pay equity, addressing health disparities, and accepting ALL  families WERE FAMILY VALUES. 
My bad.
(Also, I'll take that veiled insult as a point of pride.)
• There is such a large population of student-athletes who are participating at the club level at AU and they continually go without any praise/coverage/respect. This semester the Equestrian Team placed 5th on the east coast and the Women's Rugby team won the Potomac Rugby Union Championship... Cmon Eagle, I thought you were a ""campus"" newspaper. 
• CAUS I don't who's your chief organizer for protests and such but fire them because judging from LA quad residents's statuses you might have lost a good chunk of support because of tonight's stunt
• @""Hope the taste of division and destruction of family values is nice for you"" I actually really hope family values are destroyed.  Families are dumb.
• @Young Justice fan, Nope you are not alone :)  Signed a fan of cartoons and great animation
• 23 rants posted the day after the election? AU you confuse me
• Eagle Rants bored me today :( Where'd the fun go...?
• I'm thinking people didn't rant much on the 7th... Or their rants just didn't meet the requirements ....??? Where'd everyone's random thoughts go?? 
• I love how quiet hours only matter to people when the CAUS is outside yelling. My floor sounds like that every night
• Re: Assissins Creed commercials. American Revolutions weren't singing ""America the Bueautiful"". Just sayin
• Can't wait to go to Colorado for Christmas break and smoke a shiz ton of legal weed. Boo yaaaaaa
• so. sexually. frustrated.
• When I read Liberals R Tools' posts, I imagine a tiny little man frothing at the mouth and rolling on the ground spewing nonsense. 
• I am so kinky, and no one would ever be able to tell. I like a guy dominating me.
• To the kids who woke me up by protesting high tuition outside of my window, I need sleep so I can wake up and go to my two jobs tomorrow to support myself and pay for school. As an American you have the liberty to choose where you go to school. If you don't like how much you pay, get out.
• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums. And yes. He's accountable to a Board of Trustees. It's how the real world works, and it's designed to benefit you to the fullest. Get. Over. It. 
• The CAUS is annoying, skews facts to fit their worldview, underlines the obvious and managed to disturb every single person on campus tonight. I rarely side with the establishment, but seriously, come on. If you wanted to have a stake in your tuition, it make sense to go to a public university.
• The Marxists need to go away. Go debate about the merits of the 4th Internationale vis-a-vis the Comintern away from my Rants.
• finally an election not won by the rural white people 
#obama2012 #coalition of young ,women , latino and black voters
• weather people are people rejected from the porn industry. and they've mastered the magic of the magic 8 ball

• “I feel you, closure is just what I need. It would be great to just stop all those feelings, you know?"" - Yes. I really miss talking to her, that's all! She was just a huge part of my life, there's still a void I've been trying to fill. I think maybe talking to your ex would help you find that closure. I hope to find that for myself.
• ""I totally support the single’s get together or speed dating idea!  Hall councils, student government? Get to it. *clap clap*"": No, let's make this single's dating service something we students set up organically! *Spontaneous order*! But seriously. . . let's get on this, okay?
• @""Can someone at the Eagle explain why AU students going to an Obama rally get coverage, while Republican students have been doing the same stuff and get no coverage"": AMEN! Thank you for noticing this!!!!
• @""And more often than not, they have quite a sexual drive under that nice religious guy exterior. Anyway, good luck!"" - Speaking as one of the ""nice religious guys"", I can tell you that whoever made this observation is 100% correct. We're looking for love, for the woman who will draw us closer to God. . . and not all of us believe in pre-marital chastity :)
• Dear ""<3 hot single girl"": If we flirt with you, ask you for coffee, etc, we're NOT gay. Short of initiating sex with every girl he meets, what does a straight guy at AU have to do to convince you ladies that we're not all gay?! Seriously! - Exasperated Straight Male
• @""whatever floor"" girl in McDowell: I can't wait to meet you :)
• ""How do you get your friends to stop coming and staying in your room every single evening/night without being rude? It's becoming and a habit and it's starting to get annoying…"" - I think I know who you are. Just ask them to stop, explain you have work sometimes or are really tired. Offer to grab lunch or coffee with them during the day. They should understand.
• ""If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal."" - Yup. @RulingPoliticalClass
• Seriously AU: SPEED DATING let's make this happen okay?
• ""I am so sick to my stomach for what tomorrow will be like at AU. I'm devastated for the country but everyone else will be celebrating."" Agreed. Can we set up a conservatives' support group? I feel like AUCRs is already becoming that :/
• Dear President Obama's supporters:
Number of Pakistani civilians killed by Obama's drone strikes: 475-885
Number of Pakistani children killed by Obama's drone strikes: 176
Source: Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
How can you so enthusiastically celebrate this man's reelection? According to multiple reports you can find from The New York Times, Washington Post, etc, he personally signs off on every drone strike.

You do not want to get raped.  
• Im going to get so much flack on here for this, but its not rape if you want the sex to happen (and you give consent). We can argue all day about what constitutes consent, but in that moment both parties SHOULD know when a yes is really a 'yes"" and a no is really a 'gtfo with that NO'. If you don't know then neither of you should be having sex.

2012-11-13,AU,Republican,"Any movie directed and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg is going to carry high expectations on its shoulders.
“Lincoln,” Spielberg’s latest creation, is an epic movie chronicling President Abraham Lincoln’s time in the White House in January 1865, just months before the end of the Civil War. The focus of the film revolves around the vote on the 13th Amendment, the abolishment of slavery, in the House of Representatives and Lincoln deciding whether or not to negotiate with Confederate delegates to end the war immediately. The question about which to do may seem obvious in hindsight, but its complexity becomes apparent while watching, leaving even the viewer conflicted.
The complexity of the situation becomes apparent to the viewer while watching how Lincoln handles himself and his decisions. Lincoln is played by renowned actor Daniel Day-Lewis (“There Will Be Blood”). Day-Lewis’ portrayal of Lincoln is superb: brutally honest and humorous, yet soft-spoken and good-natured. Having a British actor playing one of America’s most iconic and well-known people, let alone presidents, is a risky idea. But Day-Lewis lives up to Lincoln’s legacy.
The remainder of the star-studded cast lived up to their roles as well. Sally Field (“The Amazing Spider-Man”), who has acted in an array of award-winning films and television programs, plays Mary Todd Lincoln (Lincoln calls her Molly in the film). Field does a terrific job conveying the paranoid and deeply depressed feelings the former First Lady deals with daily after the death of her son Willy. Her depression adds to the realistic feel of the movie, particularly in scenes that show the interactions between Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln.
Another major character is House Representative Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones (the “Men in Black” series). Stevens, historically one of the most powerful Republicans during Lincoln’s time, is portrayed as a cynically funny and righteous leader, and the scenes depicting the relationship between Lincoln and Stevens are some of the most pivotal and well-remembered.  Unfortunately, the appearance of heartthrob Joseph Gordon-Levitt (“Looper”), playing Lincoln’s son Robert in the film, is short. With his name so high on the bill, one would expect him to be in the movie a bit more often. 
One of the more surprising elements of “Lincoln” is its humor. It is easy to forget how funny Lincoln was when his inspirational and thought-provoking speeches are the ones remembered in history (not that this is a bad thing in the least).
Also, Lincoln’s Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn, of the“Bourne” series) has some of the funniest lines of the movie, as do the men Seward hires to sway Democrats in the House into voting for the 13th Amendment. While the subject matter of the film is not funny in the least, Spielberg’s choice to lighten up the film was a good one because it keeps the viewer attentive throughout.
The film’s runtime, at two and a half hours, is a bit lengthy even for the most avid Lincoln fan. The lighting and the camerawork of the film were also questionable at times. Some of the scenes had buildings that looked too modern, and there were even instances where the weather changes drastically without an explanation.
The language used throughout the film was tremendously verbose, and the subject matter shared between delegates of the House of Representatives is not exactly common knowledge. These combined factors could potentially confuse the audience.
In the end, “Lincoln” is a film worth seeing for its historical significance and its honest look into the world of one of America’s most beloved presidents.

2012-12-11,AU,Republican,"by Jonathan Miller
You may have more in common with your member of Congress than you think, especially around this time of year. Students and lawmakers alike want to finish up the year and head home for the holidays. But there’s a final exam standing between Congress and the holidays, and America’s citizens are ready to give the body an “F” if it doesn’t pass.
That exam is coming in the form of the “fiscal cliff” - the combination of arbitrary, automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases coming at the end of the year that could cripple the economy. It all started last year when Congress picked 12 of its members to try to find a deal to secure America’s long-term financial future. Consumer confidence had dropped dramatically, and a credit ratings agency dropped our country’s rating.
It seemed the only thing that could make members of both parties work across the aisle was an alternative so terrible it would be untenable to both parties.
That alternative is coming closer to reality, and unfortunately, it is your generation that will have to pay the highest price.
The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that if we do not avoid the fiscal cliff, the $7 trillion combination of spending cuts and tax increases could send the economy hurtling back into recession for years to come. Unemployment, especially among young people, will rise even further. Education will suffer among the harshest spending cuts, losing about $4.8 billion in funding.
Our leaders have had more than three years to address these issues. Imagine if you had that long to prepare for a test. Yet rather than hunkering down in the library, or in their case the Capitol Building, to solve this crisis, leaders of each side avoid meeting to talk about potential solutions.
We need real solutions. These solutions begin with both parties understanding they need to work together to stave off this crisis. No Labels, a growing grassroots movement of hundreds of thousands of Republicans, Democrats and independents is working to facilitate cooperation. Since last year, we’ve been advocating for leaders in all negotiations to put everything on the table and ensure all interested parties are at the table. You can be a part of this movement and sign on at NoLabels.org
These solutions can also help fix the underlying problem: the way Washington does business. We need to find real and permanent ways for our leaders to come together to govern for the future because our nation’s financial situation is not the only problem America faces. We need our leaders to come together and find solutions in immigration, energy and infrastructure policy. As Washington’s current stalemate has shown, we can’t afford to wait for Congress to find bold, pragmatic across-the-aisle solutions.
Changing Washington won’t happen quickly. But even you would have a hard time cramming three years' worth of work into one night. What we can do now is commit ourselves, and hold our elected officials accountable, to the idea that progress is only made when our common national interest is the priority.

2013-01-01,AU,Republican,"• I loved being home until tonight, Christmas Eve. I fought with my mom over the stupidest thing and now she barely wants anything to do with me. I had a moment of weakness and cut myself for the first time in months. Happy holidays to me.
• Doctor Who is ruining my life. I can't stop watching it because it's brilliant, but I'm in the post-season two depression stage.
• @""WHY IS EVERY HARDCORE LIBERTARIAN I MEET SO PERSONALLY IMMORAL?"" - That's interesting, the few I've met here are to me more likeable than many of my fellow liberals. (Shoutout to the libertarians from Letts 3N last year)
• @A woman on Reddit 
I'm a gay lady on reddit too! I'm sensing a trend...
• i love you, dont kill yourself please 
• Speaking as a guy, I would never be unfaithful to a girl and I would never willingly help a girl cheat on her boyfriend either. If I found out that crap was going on, I'd lose all interest in you immediately. You can dump your boyfriend if you want to (sounds like he deserves it), but you should be honest with people about your relationship status.
• Person with the brother, you sound like a good person. Hope everything gets better for you two. :/ 
• Pot smoking hedonists? This makes me want to be a libertarian even more!
• Yeah... my brother relapsed a day later.  Sucks.  I had hope after the emergency room since he seemed so much happier, but I guess he just doesn't want to be sober right now.  The hardest thing about it is that I know he's suffering and every instinct I has says that I need to help him, but there's literally nothing I can do if he doesn't want to be sober.
• What does everyone think about putting a Cosi where the McDonalds used to be?
• Dear fellow ranters: I would like to just say that I love AU and am really glad that I have the opportunity to go here! To all those who are having a tough time this holiday: please hang in there! The season is tough but the pain you're going through now will make spring so much sweeter. PLEASE do not hurt yourselves–even if you think you're alone, you're not (you have your fellow ranters, at least)! Things will get better <3
• Thanks, Editor, for still putting rants up during the holidays. Props! 
• The only person to wish me Merry Christmas was the automatic text from Words With Friends.
• TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KILL THEMSELVES/OD: DON'T. Someone out there cares. I care. Please, please. Talk to someone you trust. It will get better, I swear to you, I've been in a similar place, you just need to know that it will get better, and take active steps to help yourself. Go to the counseling centre. Please. 
• I have so much anxiety that I can't get through more than a few pages of the new book I just got on conquering anxiety. Oh irony..
• I flew home for Christmas even though I didn't want to and I could have stayed with my bf instead. But I went home because my dad wanted me to. I get home for Christmas and none of my siblings even came over to see me. FML

• @”Home for the holidays (in the boondocks) and the nearest guy on grindr is 56 years old and 7 miles away…”  Although I’m not in the boonies, I’m back home to a grindr of mostly uneducated, poser @$$hole guidos, so there’s that. I feel your pain.
• I want to feel your heart beat inside of me
• “I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break. Trying to hold on but the gnawing pain in my heart won’t go away. Help?”  No one should ever feel scared in his or her own body.  You control so much of your life, you really do have the power to change things.  Please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if it gets really serious.  Or, talk to anyone-a parent, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker…it’ll surprise you how many people really truly care for you.
• Whoever you are with the detoxing brother-you're an awesome person and an even better brother.  Friends come and go--sure you could have been partying somewhere like those kids across the street--but family lasts forever.  Props to you for helping your brother through a difficult time. 
• I totally fell in love with the girl who cut my hair today.  And then I forgot to tip her.
• I think I'll start talking to girls.  What is the point of being completely awesome and hilarious and really really really ridiculously good looking if I don't talk to anyone?
• I feel bad for the basketball players...they only got four days off from this whole  entire break. I plan on going to the first home game when we come back from break. who's with me? :)

• What does it mean if i enjoyed high school way more than I enjoy college right now?
• Drunk snapchat is the best snapchat. 
• When did you become such a shallow, self-centered, groupie? It's like I don't even know you anymore. When we met I admired how you didn't care what people thought of you. Now all you seem to care about is feeling popular and ""in"" with your friend group, since you never had that in high school. Why don't you think about the choices you're making before you keep going down this road. You can stop anytime, you just have to want to live a moral life. You used to think that personal integrity and values matter. What happened to you?
• Russian women are finnneee!
• Surgeries suck :'(
• If you are suicidal, seek help from a therapist. Preferably one that does Cognitive Behavioral therapy (because that's the best kind of therapy), but any therapist will do. Whatever problems you have are fixable, you just need some support. When you're back at AU, visit the counciling center.
• Whoever posted ""And by “sex” I mean me putting my arm around you and you squirming away because you just wanna stay friends"" Dude I legitimately lol'd. 
I've come to realize that although it's not always obvious, but there are some pretty f'ing funny people at this school. Wit. I like it.  Can the funny people be more outgoing? We'd all benefit.
• Unfortunately, short guys finish last.
• that awkward moment when you realize that everyone in your new town knows what you have been doing at college and not one of them is your friend on FB...
• I'm scared to come back to AU after abroad. It just seems so terrible now.
• I don't even want to go back to school because I have to spend hours in a room with my whole sorority and some of them are awful people.
• @""I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break."" Please, please, PLEASE don't do it. Find professional help and figure out why you're feeling like this (or if you know why, figure out why it's driven you to this point).
• And this Monday/Tuesday will mark the 22nd year I haven't had a New Years Kiss. Or a kiss at all.
• Last night I had a dream that someone raped one of my friends and stalked her afterwards.  The legal system couldn't stop him, so I killed him to give her peace.  I was sentenced to prison, and inside I killed another inmate because he was plotting to harm a guard.  Once I was released I felt like there was evil in the world that I had a duty to stop, but I came to the conclusion that I was really just a serial killer justifying my murderous needs with that mentality.  So I killed myself.  How f***ed is that?
• So on Christmas Eve, I was mugged. Well, mugged might be kind of inaccurate. It wasn't violent, but a person ran up to me and grabbed my bag and ran away. My phone, camera, money and key were in there. There's nothing to be done but I can't stop dwelling on it. It's not my fault but, I can't help blaming myself. Like, I could have been more careful or something. I've never felt so powerless. It's sh*tty.

• Ughhh Fraternity rush is approaching!! I just want to go PIKE but I don't think they like me. Maybe I flirt with them to much?
• Why can't I just tell this kid that I'm not interested?! He's been in the friend zone for like 5 years now, but I don't think he knows and that makes me feel bad. But I don't know how to let him down easily, other than talking about my boyfriend to him. Which isn't even working. UGH!
• @• My peanus has never been kissed. Do you vvant to kiss my peanus with your mouth?-- You are a moron.
• @• My brother just came upstairs and asked if anyone was taking parts of the wall away, and whether any of my sisters friends have been doing work on the house. I said no to both, obviously, and then he went back to the basement again. I literally feel sick to my stomach."" Context?
• @How terrible is it for me to just pretend I’m single on okcupid?-- Your boyfriend is an ass and clearly doesn't care about you enough or he wouldn't want it to be open. It's not fair for him to be able to have other partners but he expects you not to- that's a classic double standard. You can find a much better guy, trust me. I know of some people who prefer open relationships, but they (in my opinion) tend to be selfish and really just self-interested people primarily concerned with their own gratification. 
• @• I’m feeling sick, so now I’m going to go the line for Santa Clause at the mall and spread as many germs as possible.  &@&# everyone up real bad before Christmas.-- At first I found myself thinking 'wow you're a terrible person', and then I realized I was laughing hysterically at the hilarity of it. Am I a sadist now?
• @Why can I only talk to people when I’m drunk?:
1) something happened to you which makes it hard for you to let loose around people without alcohol in you?
2) low confidence from any number of sources, including possible emotional or psychological trauma?
3) guilt over something unresolved on your end?
(most likely) you just might be a bit shy. Surround yourself with people who love you and who inspire you to be a better person.

• It's not that I don't want to talk to you anymore. Don't hate me. You just aren't moral enough for me, sorry. You've taken your values and turned them upside down just to fit in and feel like you belong. You were a better person when we first met. Look at your life choices.
• I like this guy but I think he still likes his ex a lot. She treated him terribly in the end, and I'd never treat him like that. How can I show him that I'll love him for who he is and never hurt him? He says he's afraid of trusting again.
• @single on okcupid: Um.. better make that single thing permanent. If this guy doesn't respect you enough to make it a mutual open relationship, or listen to what you want, then you should get out of it. You're worth more than that.

2013-03-07,AU,Republican,"You gotta hand it to the Republicans: they’re the best politicians in town.
They figured out how to manufacture leverage — and use it, too. They’ve found their rhythm, and they sure are grooving to the beat of their own drum.
See, the plan goes something like this:
Allow President Ronald Reagan to quadruple the national debt, largely by increasing defense spending (against the USSR, which was crumbling from within).	
Let President George H. W. Bush continue such disastrous economic policies, and then turn tail and run from him when he suggests something as heinous as raising taxes to pay for his exploits (like that undeclared war).
And then, make the debt the defining issue of the 1992 campaign and, when the other side wins, pounce on the new Democratic president by saying he’s not doing enough to reduce the deficit.
Furthermore, use the deficit as a wedge issue to take back the House in the midterm elections, and force a series of budget cuts that send the president off-message and prevent him from investing in health care, education, science and technology.
Sound familiar? That’s because it is.	
History does in fact repeat itself, and the GOP response to President Barack Obama’s budget proposals is proof of this.
The GOP said nothing — nothing! — when President George W. Bush fought two wars, signed into law a costly expansion of Medicare and cut taxes all at the same time. He doubled the national debt in eight years.
But once Obama got elected, the debt was suddenly the biggest issue we had to address. Some even took to calling it a “national security issue” (kind of like how the USSR was a national security issue in 1984).
The best line yet was Gov. Mitt Romney’s “road to Greece” gimmick.
It is pathetically ironic that the very policies that put Greece “on the road to Greece” — not paying their debts (read: “not passing the debt ceiling”) and austerity (read: “drastic budget cuts”) – are the same policies Republicans are advocating.
In 2010, America elected a gang of lawmakers who don’t understand basic economics. Americans tricked into voting for these people on the basis of a mythical “national security issue.”
And these people are working against their voters’ interests, most recently by failing to stop the sequester.
For all their talk of “job creators” and the need for more businessmen in government, Republicans don’t seem to understand that a CEO can’t provide jobs for his employees if consumers don’t have the money to buy his product or houses to put it in.
Indeed, in a recession, the government is the single most important spender and investor, because it is the only entity that can spend and invest. It did so in 1932, and has done so in every recession ever since.       	
In reality, Republicans in Congress don’t want to solve our debt “problem.” Why would they want to give up prime leverage? If history is any guide, they’ll want to use it again when the next unassuming (Democrat) schmuck strolls down Pennsylvania Avenue.        
The sequester, which Macroeconomic Advisers LLC estimates will ultimately cost 700,000 American jobs, is just the latest riff in the GOP’s tempo.        
It provided the GOP’s desired endgame: instead of talking about how to invest in our children’s future or repair our disintegrating infrastructure, we’re talking about which programs – like Social Security and Medicare – can be cut.        
So, the next time you enter the voting booth, remember that it’s not the deficit. It’s a game of political musical chairs, and it matters a helluva lot who sits in the chairs and who plays the music.

2015-01-08,AU,Republican,"Mary Cheney, right, with wife Heather Poe.
Mary Cheney, the younger of former vice president Dick Cheney’s two daughters, will be the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of 2015.
The Jan. 21 event will begin at 8:15 p.m in the School of International Service’s Abramson Family Founder’s Room.
Cheney’s career as a businesswoman and political adviser spans a wide range of occupations including independent strategic consulting, bipartisan government relations and task force management for AOL, according to a KPU press release. She also advised her father and George W. Bush as a campaign aide during the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, according to the press release.
During her speech, Cheney will address the future of the Republican party as it pertains to the LGBTQ community. While working at Coor’s in the mid-1990s, Cheney implemented a plan that ended a 20-year gay and lesbian boycott of Coor’s products. As a married lesbian herself, Cheney’s position on same-sex marriage has been controversial among her socially conservative family members.
Cheney’s appearance at AU comes 10 months after her father’s appearance at the University aroused student protests and attracted national media attention. 
KPU director Tyler Bowders said in a press release that he hopes Mary Cheney’s speech will complement and contrast with her father’s 2014 event.
“I am pleased that KPU has the opportunity to host a speaker who is able to showcase the future and diversity of the Republican Party,” Bowders said in the press release.

2015-04-08,AU,Republican,"Former First Lady Laura Bush speaks at a Bush Institute event celebrating International Women's Day.
Students have expressed mixed sentiments since The Kennedy Political Union and University Communications announced former first lady Laura Bush as the recipient of Wonk of the Year on Feb. 23.
Despite Bush’s political contributions, some students doubt her relevance to current events and to the University’s age and social demographics, Hannah Ross, a sophomore in the School of Communication, said.
 “Laura Bush may have made contributions in the past, but in the context of relevant or timely current social or political events, she has not been present,” Ross said.
KPU and AU Communications recognize Laura Bush as Wonk of the Year because of her education, health and human rights advocacy efforts according to Tyler Bowders, the director of KPU.
“Her use of the office of First Lady, humanitarianism, as well as her longevity in multiple areas of work was the driving force behind her selection as the Wonk of the Year,” Bowders said in an email. 
Jose Mejia, a junior in the School of International Service, said that Laura Bush’s work was not of the same quality as other recipients in the past but disagrees with those who believe Bush is inevitably bad because of her husband. 
“Laura Bush’s body of work is not on par with many of the other people who have been given that award like Anderson Cooper or Bill Clinton,” Mejia said. “The sentiment I do not share, that many of peers are espousing, is that Mrs. Bush’s last name automatically negates her achievements as First Lady or her unique viewpoint of being side by side with her husband.”
Tatiana Laing, a junior in the School of Public Affairs and co chair of the Ethnic and Cultural Coalition for Student Government, said she contacted KPU and AU Communications over the summer asking for a person of color to be recognized this year. 
“Both KPU and the administration were aware that I and many other students wanted a person of color for the KPU Wonk of the Year,” Laing said. 
Approximately 100 student requests for the Wonk of the Year were submitted and  recognized in the selection process, but those who made it into the final selection did not have availability in the spring of 2015, according to Bowders. 
AU Communications and KPU established the Wonk of the Year in 2012. The distinction is given to a public figure who embodies the characteristics of a wonk—someone who is a conscious, global citizen, according to AU’s description of the award.  
AU College Republican President Nicholas Hunt, a proponent of the Laura Bush Wonk of the Year decision, said he feels that republican views are often dismissed at AU. The invitation to speak at campus offers a precedent to Republican opinions, according to Hunt. 
“We are a campus based around the principle of diversity and inclusion, however when it comes to political identity, those terms seem not to apply. Republicans at American are consistently marginalized by faculty and students alike,” Hunt said. “By bringing a speaker of Mrs. Bush’s stature, I fully believe she will be able to be the voice of silenced Republicans at American University and convey the values and ideal the Republican Party stands for.”
Selection of Laura Bush concerned other student organizations who have felt ignored or disenfranchised by the university. 
Following student efforts to teach about privilege and race on campus, and the AU administration’s commitment to help, the decision to select Laura Bush as a representative of the year’s expert and impassioned person came as a setback, Laing said.
“I wanted AU to recognize that people of color can be experts, can give back to the community and are deserving of the title,” Laing said. “By not choosing a person of color, it isn't automatically a disappointment to me, but by choosing someone so irrelevant over a person of color, that's just insulting.”

2016-04-13,AU,Republican,"Syrian dissident and activist Ahed Al Hendi spoke to AU students about raising awareness for the Syrian refugee crisis and his work to help refugees during an event hosted by the Kennedy Political Union on April 11. 
In his opening remarks, Al Hendi, who founded the pro-democracy organization Syrian Youth for Justice and spoke on behalf of the Help Syria Now group, made clear the difference in the freedom of speech between Syria and the United States.  
“If we were in Syria, we would all be arrested,” Al Hendi said. “Because over there, it is illegal to listen to different ideas.”
Al Hendi was a student activist in Syria living under President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and participated in a series of protests for greater freedom of expression. He said that many liberal students were arrested and banned from the country for speaking out and that many of the protests were violently squashed. 
Al Hendi said he was arrested in 2007 for allegedly logging into certain websites that were forbidden by the Syrian state. He was held for 40 days as a political prisoner and escaped to the U.S. after he was released. Since then, Al Hendi has worked to connect with both Syrian refugees and civilians still living under the Assad regime. Some of this work involved sending cameras and providing internet access to Syrians in order to record the government crimes against civilians, according to Al Hendi. 
The Syrian Civil War that arose after the Arab Spring in 2011 has resulted in the arrest and killing of  thousands of students in colleges and universities across Syria for chanting for freedom, according to Al Hendi.
“Atrocities in Syria are the most heinous crimes of the century,” Al Hendi said. 
Al Hendi also said that the recent attacks on cities around the world by ISIS and other extremist groups have given rise to extremist right-wing groups in both Europe and the U.S., with both kinds of terrorist groups presenting dangers to Syrian refugees seeking safety. Negative portrayals of Syrians are also amplified by social media, and have resulted in a greater need to empower moderate voices in Syria to speak out, Al Hendi said.
In an interview with the Eagle, Al Hendi also spoke about the U.S. presidential race and comments made by Republican candidates on immigration and the treatment of Muslims. Al Hendi said that he remains optimistic about the policies that will result from the election.
“I think that the majority of Americans are welcoming [towards refugees],” Al Hendi said. “And I don’t think the Constitution will allow [the president to ban Muslims from entering the country or refuse to accept refugees].”
Al Hendi urged students who are interested in the Syrian crisis to go to syriastory.org to sign a petition and learn more about the issue.
“As a student, I believe in the power of students,” Al Hendi said. “I believe we can bring a lot of change.”

2016-09-13,AU,Republican,"Last Thursday, Student Government launched the AU TurboVote campaign in an effort to register every student to vote in time for the general election in November.  
SG is relaunching its partnership with TurboVote, a national platform specifically aimed at young people with the goal of increasing their civic engagement. 
After signing up online, the TurboVote application provides individualized information and updates for upcoming elections, voter registration and absentee ballots.
“The AU TurboVote campaign is one of the most ambitious voter registration plans ever in a college across the country,” said Valeria Ojeda-Avitia, Director of the Kennedy Political Union and coordinator of AU TurboVote.
The campaign has 25 campus partners, including the Undergraduate Business Association, the Interfraternity Council and the Intercultural Greek Collective, with the intention to expand, according to Ojeda-Avitia. TurboVote is also committed to non-partisanship, and the campaign is collaborating with both the AU College Democrats and AU College Republicans. 
“Voting is one of the most important facets of being an American citizen, and AUCRs is proud to do its part in encouraging civic duty by participating,” President of AU College Republicans Tom Herbert said.
The campaign will be tabling on campus throughout September, with heightened campaign efforts expected on National Voter Registration Day, scheduled on Sept. 27. 
Individuals can access TurboVote online, and can also become an AU TurboVote Ambassador and help spread the message. Ambassadors work to register voters and visit AU clubs and Greek life organizations to help groups register, according to TurboVote Ambassador Yazan Hanouneh.
""I became a TurboVote ambassador to ensure that every AU student has the opportunity to vote even while they're far from home,” Hanouneh said. “Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or something else, it is important to be civically engaged and participate in the system of democracy that keeps our nation running. In the end, this work is worth it since we'll have a more representative government that all students will feel like they helped elect.""

2016-10-12,AU,Republican,"Sitting on my couch Friday afternoon, I got the flurry of the usual alerts from CNN, Fox, etc. that arrive when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says or does something outrageous. 
I opened a new tab in my browser, went to the Washington Post, and watched the leaked video of Trump on a bus before an Access Hollywood taping with former host Billy Bush in 2005. 
Listening to it, I was absolutely horrified. A grown man running for president of the greatest superpower in the world described violating women against their will. I know he may not have actually raped or sexually assaulted a woman, but he joked about a physical attack against another human being in the same tone that he would when talk about what sandwich he may or may not have previously consumed for lunch that day.
Using his own words, Trump lost the respect of many in his party and his country. He disregarded violence as ""locker room talk"" and showed the American people that he cannot be the leader of our nation. 
With his own words, he proves to us that he cannot be a just and stable leader. He proves that he does not care about the family. He proves that he does not care about the law.
As a conservative, I believe in the strength of the American family. Thinking of my mother, sister-in-law, future daughter and myself, I would never want them to be in a country led by a man who believes that women are playthings, to be touched and grabbed at any man’s will. Thinking of my father, brother, future husband and future son, I would never allow them to speak about myself or another woman in such a manner. By dehumanizing violence, Trump threw out the family values on which the Republican Party is based.
When speaking about the Hispanic community, the Khan family, the Muslim-American community, a Mexican-American judge, and more, Trump proved to the American people that he is unfit to be our leader. Most recently, he has proved to women that he does not respect their privacy. He has proven to the Republican Party that he is not worthy of our support. 
While I will not support Secretary Hillary Clinton in this election either because I cannot and will not support her big-government policies that steal from the American worker, to the conservatives still considering a vote for Trump, I say this: think about your values, your positions, your own future, and the future of your children. The person presented to us this election cycle has shown no respect for these key values, and I don't anticipate him changing any positions. I know you are scared for the future, as I am, but I encourage you to vote with your conscience and think about what kind of future you want for America. 
I suggest protecting down ballot candidates and ensuring the Republican majorities in Congress so there can be some balance, and that you consider third party candidates. However, if you decide to vote for Trump, I do not shame you. This election is difficult, and I do not blame you for voting for change, but I do not believe the change America needs can be found in Trump.
We are a great nation full of diverse people, and we have great powers as a people through our Constitution and Bill of Rights. We must think of those when voting. 
As a conservative, libertarian, Hispanic woman with deeply held values in the free market and principles of liberty, I cannot - and will not - in good conscience vote for Donald Trump this November.

2016-10-12,AU,Republican,"When I heard about the video regarding Trump’s “locker room talk” and listened to him speak so nonchalantly about violent and life-altering acts committed against women, I sat on my bed and I cried. When I refreshed my newsfeed and was notified of yet another male Republican politician disavowing Trump, I closed my laptop and felt a deep sense of sadness wash over my heart and settle into my bones. This time, Trump’s bigotry had apparently ruffled too many feathers. Certain men and women could now relate because everyone knows a woman and no one would want to disrespect their own wife or daughter. However, this same outrage was not afforded to Muslim people or black people or immigrants or disabled people or any other person that wasn’t white or who apparently was not present in the life of a male Republican. As I sat in my bed and contemplated the end of humanity, I realized that this fight was not over. 
This election is not over and every single vote counts. The reality is that we are not only electing a president, but members of Congress who will play an integral part in shaping the progress, or the regression, of this nation. We are electing the men and women who shape policies that will try to decide the value of another person’s life. These policies will shape whether there is a planet left for our children. These laws will determine if broken systems will continue to decide whether a child is worthy of education or prison. Children, families, futures and lives depend on progress and the results of this election. We must restore the humanity in this election and therefore not voting cannot be an option. 
In 2014, only 17 percent of constituents aged 18 to 29 voted in the election; however, this demographic constitutes about 21 percent of the eligible voting population. Of course this is made harder at college as deadlines for voter registration and absentee ballot applications easily slip past, but this is just as important as any other part of your life here at AU. If you’re unsure of where to start, go here. Our votes matter and they do have an effect on the future of this country. If you say that you aren’t voting because you can’t decide, you must decide anyway. 
Think about those whose voices will not be heard in this election because they can’t cast their own ballot. When you vote, you are voting not only for yourself but for your parents, your friends, your children and families across the world who you will never meet. As you are watching the last debate, wondering how the election has become an unprecedented mess and hoping for it to be over, take hope in the fact that the ballots have yet to be cast. If you feel scared, vote. It is the most powerful way in which you can ensure that you have a say in the future of this country.

2017-01-11,AU,Republican,"This article originally appeared in The Eagle’s December 9 print edition.
Looking back on this election, it has been a rough year and a half to be a Republican woman. Facing ridicule from every side, listening to your party’s nominee criticize women and trying to choose between compromising your values and voting for necessary change at the ballot box was maddening.
However, it is over now. The next President of the United States will be Donald Trump, and it is time for the nation to face that reality and move forward with a positive agenda for change.
Although I did not vote for or support Donald Trump during his presidential run, I wish him the best in office and I truly hope he governs well. Praying for his failure at this point does not hurt his reputation, but the American people as a whole. That is why we must be cautiously optimistic: we must support him and guide him on a path toward righteousness while at the same time be willing to criticize his administration when necessary.
Further, President-elect Trump will be complemented by both a Republican House and Senate, not to mention 33 Republican governors, 26 states under the control of both GOP executive and legislative branches and six state legislatures controlled by Republicans with Democratic governors. This is the GOP’s moment, and the party must deliver if it wants to maintain and grow party support in 2018 and 2020.
To do this, I recommend the following conservative policy proposals to limit government power, control spending, cut government waste and prove that success can be achieved under a Republican government.
Step 1: Reform the criminal justice system
One of the most corrupt institutions in American government is the criminal justice system. It is designed to over-incarcerate low-level, nonviolent offenders. Upon leaving prison, these offenders cannot successfully find a job due to their criminal records and become dependent on less-than-legal means to make ends meet. Often, they are reincarcerated and enter a viscous cycle known as “recidivism.” 
This issue disproportionately impacts minority groups, and it must be stopped. Moreover, the entire system costs a tremendous amount of unnecessary tax dollars (an additional $42 million in 2017 from FY2016) and needs to be consolidated and reformed immediately. To address these issues, a bi-partisan coalition of representatives has already proposed several bills to reform them.
Another way to improve the criminal justice system would be to expand programs that assist ex-felons in finding jobs after leaving prison. Companies like Apple, Hilton Hotels and Chick-fil-A hire returning citizens to begin reintegrating former felons into society. By using public-private partnerships with these and other companies and vocational organizations, the government can prevent the cycle of incarceration from continuing to plague our system, destroy the family and consume our tax dollars. 
Step 2: Simplify the tax code and loosen ridiculous regulations
There are areas in Trump’s tax proposal where taxes among certain higher-level income groups will be higher than under Clinton’s plan, according to the Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a center-left tax policy group. This is significant because Clinton claimed she would use taxes to crack down on the upper class.
Scholar Leonard Burman notes, “Trump’s 33 percent top rate kicks in at a fairly low income level for singles: $127,500 in 2017.” The Trump tax plan could generate more levels of revenue. It would remove personal exemptions and tax breaks which would consolidate the current 74,608-page-long federal code, making it more fair. If he implements this plan, it will cut the burden of taxpayers while not letting off the wealthier economic groups from contributing a sizable amount of income in taxes. 
It would also consolidate and simplify the tax code. By simplifying the code, this would allow Americans to better understand how the federal government collects tax dollars. If Trump goes through with implementing this plan, it would save Americans a lot of time, money and headaches trying to understand all the loopholes and tax breaks in the system of which big businesses take advantage.
Step 3: Create an environment inclusive to all Americans
Often, the political left claims that the GOP is waging a “war on women.” However, 42 percent of Donald Trump’s voters were women, especially college-educated white women, 49 percent of which voted for the billionaire. This happened despite Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emphasis on Trump’s history of bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monumental question is why these women still voted for him, and unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll have an answer until we actually ask these voters. Usually, these types of allegations kill political careers, such as was the case with Anthony Weiner. And yet, it has not derailed Trump.
The GOP needs to emphasize the benefits of limited government for minorities. While protections are necessary to ensure that discrimination is prevented, all people can be most empowered by freedom, not the state. The GOP has this platform, but it does not use it. To better project this ideal, Republicans should be more open to comprehensive immigration reform that opens the door to increasing legal immigration. Further, women could greatly benefit from voluntary Personal Care Accounts that encourage financial saving for leave time. Pre-tax dollars would be saved in this PCA, and it would be used to replace or supplement income during periods of leave. This would help the problem of paid leave or medical issues. Women and minorities in the GOP also need to be louder and prouder, stand up in the name of limited government and run for office.
Although I remain cautiously optimistic, I truly hope that the Trump administration is successful in its endeavors-not just for Republicans, but for all Americans. If he fails, we will all have to live with the consequences.

2018-09-11,AU,Republican,"Fact PAC is working to give candidates the information they need to succeed.
In response to what he sees as mounting frustration to the political climate and administration of President Donald Trump, senior Noah Levy decided to take action by starting Fact PAC, a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates across the nation. 
“I would be taught throughout university that the far right is rising worldwide and it’s kind of like, what can we do?” Levy said. “Meanwhile, I’m in an environment where most of my friends, they post articles on Facebook and they get angry at the Trump administration and that’s all you can do. So I was just very inspired by kind of using my anger and putting it into action.”
Fact PAC works to provide free database and behavioral scientific consulting to Democrats nationwide who cannot afford it, Levy said. The organization, which is operated remotely online, compiles data on precincts and districts most relevant to a candidate and analyzes it for their use. Fact PAC obtains the data from that state’s Secretary of State’s website, he said. 
“We show historical voter data on the aggregates of all these precincts in their district within the past few election cycles for things like the numbers on Democratic voter turnout, Republican voter turnout, the amount of registered people in both parties,” Levy said. 
The group shows the concentration of voters geographically by creating heat maps, he added, calling it “a really important insight to provide to candidates.”
When it came to the process of starting a political action committee, Levy said he found that a good deal of thorough research and reading was required. However, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) makes it very easy to start a political action committee, he said. 
Fact PAC’s decision to work on a volunteer basis also made the process easier. The FEC’s website has forms to start a political action committee, which can be filled out and submitted electronically. They are vetted and approved every two to three business days, according to the site. 
The organization is operated by a staff of seven people, comprised of Levy, AU student Sarah Duval, four Cornell University students, and a treasurer who is not affiliated with a university. 
Fact PAC currently has nine partner campaigns, one of which is Brittany Dement, a mayoral candidate in Auburn, Alabama. 
“City politics is something I’ve always wanted to get my feet wet in,” Levy said. “I know how personal it can be for people and I know how much power someone who’s the mayor could have.”
Getting leaders such as Dement elected is the central goal for Levy’s organization. He encourages students to put themselves out there and fight to elect the right candidates. 
“I believe in better leadership by better decision-making as opposed to a strict platform of beliefs because I think the world is constantly changing,” Levy said. “If you really want to get something you just have to be willing to send that message, or send that email.”

2018-12-13,AU,Republican,"Maria Butina, a Russian gun rights activist and American University graduate, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the law governing foreign agents operating in the United States on Thursday.
Butina, 30, struck a deal with federal prosecutors that included her admission to trying to build ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign on behalf of an unnamed Russian official, widely believed to be Alexander Torshin, a Russian bank official. 
In addition, Butina attempted to build connections with influential members of the National Rifle Association and the National Prayer Breakfast alongside an unnamed American reported to be her boyfriend, Republican fundraiser Paul Erickson. Erickson has denied all allegations that he helped cultivate relationships between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.  
The charges brought against Butina were unrelated to the probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. 
As part of her plea agreement, Butina will cooperate with federal prosecutors. She will likely face up to six months in prison when she is sentenced in early 2019, and according to NPR, Butina told Judge Tanya Chutkan that she understands she will likely be deported back to Russia after serving time. 
Chutkan scheduled Butina’s next hearing for Feb. 12, when the court will assess the cooperation that Butina has given the U.S. government. Federal prosecutors have left open the possibility that they will write a letter seeking leniency for Butina depending on her cooperation with them, according to NPR. 
Butina was originally arrested in July on charges that she acted as an agent of the Russian Federation. She had graduated from the School of International Service with a master’s degree only two months earlier. 
Since her arrest, Butina has been held in jail without bond. As recently as last month, her lawyers were working to subpoena the University for class rosters that included photos of Butina’s former classmates. Several of those classmates objected to the order, though it was eventually approved by the court.

2019-03-08,AU,Republican,"John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate, has been named the 2019 Wonk of the Year, the Kennedy Political Union announced today. 
The politician will speak to students about the future of the U.S. and bipartisanship on March 21 in Bender Arena at 7 p.m.
Kasich began his career in 1978 as a state senator and later became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, notably serving 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee.
After leaving Congress in 2000, Kasich returned to politics in 2010 when he ran for governor of Ohio. He served two terms in the office before leaving the governor’s mansion in January. He is currently a senior political commentator for CNN.
In 2016, Kasich became a household name when he ran for the Republican nomination for president. Kasich “presented himself as a moderate alternative to front-running candidates,” KPU wrote in its press release. During his presidential run, he received the Republican endorsement from The New York Times but ultimately did not have the votes to beat Donald Trump, the party’s eventual nominee. 
“With a perspective unique to a public servant experienced in both the public and private sector, leadership on all levels of government, and work with major media organizations, Kasich will bring thoughtful discussion to American University on the topic of bipartisan solutions and the future of American politics,” KPU wrote in its press release. 
While many analysts place Kasich in the moderate wing of the party due to his views on immigration and other issues, critics have noted Kasich’s conservative record on abortion rights, same-sex marriage and cuts to public education, among other actions. 
Kasich once strongly opposed same-sex marriage, but following the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal in all U.S. states in 2015, he said the country needed to accept the decision and “move on.”
According to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Kasich signed 17 anti-abortion measures into law between 2011 and 2016. Those measures defunded Planned Parenthood and banned abortions from public hospitals as well as from receiving public funds. Ohio Right to Life has credited Kasich for the decline in abortions in the state.
The University has recently introduced initiatives promoting bipartisanship, including the launch of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics last fall. The institute, which is focused on creating bipartisan policy solutions, launched with a September event featuring former Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee). 
Previous Wonk of the Year recipients include Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist Malala Yousafzai, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, former First Lady Laura Bush and former President Bill Clinton.
The event, co-hosted with AU College Republicans, will require an Eventbrite ticket and valid AUID for students, faculty and staff. Doors will open at 6:20 p.m.

2019-04-13,AU,Republican,"On March 26, the Trump administration released a statement saying it would further expand the Mexico City Policy, otherwise known as the Global Gag Rule (GGR). This is a policy that cuts U.S. funding from non-governmental organizations (NGO)s to hinder their ability to use any funding towards abortion as a family planning service overseas. The GGR feeds into health inequities, prevents non-profit organizations from serving the communities they work in and places the lives of millions in danger. 
This is the second time the Trump Administration has expanded the GGR. Although the GGR was originally imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it initially only restricted NGOs from using U.S. funds for abortion services. In 2017, Trump announced that the GGR would cut U.S. funding for NGOs that used their own money and funding not provided by the U.S. for family planning services. On March 26, Mike Pompeo declared another expansion of the GGR, one that entails cutting funding from NGOs that provide non-U.S. funding to other organizations that “support or promote abortion” as a family planning service. This is all in an effort to end all “backdoor funding schemes.”
Secretary Pompeo and the Trump administration have used family planning as a political issue to retain the support of anti-abortion groups and individuals. What Pompeo and the Trump administration won’t mention is that they have also decided to cut funding for other health issues including HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Zika, tuberculosis and nutrition programs. Despite how the Trump administration wants to frame it, access to family planning services is a health issue. 
According to Advocates for Youth, the NGOs that are on the ground can’t decide whether or not to provide necessary treatments with every coming administration. The information simply doesn’t reach them in time. Thus, even when the GGR isn’t in place, the NGOs are operating like it is. The direct impact of this policy causes NGOs to stall the programs they have running, lose donations of valuable materials (including condoms and contraceptives) and lose the ability to expand their HIV prevention and treatment services to better serve the communities they work in. As Sen. Jeanne Shaheen,D-N.H., said, ""Further expanding the global gag rule puts international organizations in an impossible position: provide women the full scope of reproductive health care services or deny critical funding that saves lives. That is unconscionable.""
Women’s rights are human rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are human rights. Access to healthcare is a human right. Now more than ever, it’s imperative that we stand up to the Trump administration and use our voices as the catalysts for this movement. You may not think you can make a difference because of your age. I urge you to hold strong because, when young people set their minds to something, the results are monumental. Our voices are heard, laws are reformed and societal change happens. From the student-led sit-ins of the civil rights movement to Malala Yousafzai's international contributions to girl’s education, history has shown us that youth activism is a powerful force. So, I  urge you to call your local representatives and senators, visit them on the Hill, and push them to pass the Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights (H.E.R.) Act.
With the H.E.R. Act, we would indefinitely repeal the GGR. Through the GGR, the U.S. and the Trump Administration are constraining the ability of NGOs to use their own money for their family planning services and their ability to monetarily contribute to other organizations. At a time when progress on HIV and AIDS has halted, it is imperative that Congress work together to pass the Global H.E.R. Act. The Global H.E.R. Act is a bipartisan and bicameral initiative, garnering support from Democrats and Republicans alike. It was recently reintroduced to Congress by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Nita Lowey and has received support from Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. 
Let Congress know that we will not sit idly by as millions are denied the care they need. Infringement on the rights of the few is infringement on the rights of all. Let them know that young people’s voices matter. They say AU is one of the most politically active campuses in the country, so let’s act like it.

2019-12-12,AU,Republican,"AU professor Daniel Gade in the School of Public Affairs is running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 election.
A professor in the School of Public Affairs is running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 election.
AU professor Daniel Gade is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, former White House veterans-affairs advocate and disability rights activist. He was wounded in combat twice and lost his right leg. After earning a Ph.D. in public policy and public administration from the University of Georgia, he taught political science at the United States Military Academy for several years before coming to AU in January. 
“I am a career servant,” Gade said. “From the time I enlisted in the army at 17 years old, I’ve been a servant of the Constitution. I view service in politics, and particularly, in this case, service in the United States Senate, as an extension of my decades of service to the country.”
Since he launched his campaign in August, Gade raised funds at the same rate at his opponent Scott Taylor, who is considered the established Republican candidate.
His campaign is still in the early stages since the primary vote is not until June, but Gade said that he is now focusing on fundraising and garnering media attention. He released a campaign advertisement last month and was featured in news articles, blog posts and radio shows. 
Gade said that he has not faced any backlash for his campaign yet.
“Reception has been uniformly positive,” he said. “People are really hungry for non-politician political servants. Voters are sick of our political class.”
Gade’s governing principles and the platform of his candidacy are to promote free-market systems, maintain a strong national defense, promote limited government and protect individual liberties and civil rights, according to his website. 
“Getting government out of people’s lives allows them to thrive on their own terms,” he said. “That’s where societies thrive, because societies are an aggregation of political and economic choices.”
If he wins the Republican primary, Gade would face the Democratic two-term incumbent Mark Warner in the general election. The most recent data from the Cook Political Report said that the general election is likely to fall in favor of Warner. 
When Gade is not performing his professorial duties or orchestrating his campaign, he enjoys biking and CrossFit. He is a father of three, including a 17-year-old daughter and two younger twin boys. 
Gade says that, as a senator, he’d like to change the “divisiveness and nastiness” in today’s political climate.
“I’m willing to sit down and talk face to face, but there are some people in this political climate who are not willing to do that,” he said. “Politicians just see the R or the D, but don’t see the A for American. They need to focus on the A first.”

2020-10-09,AU,Republican,"American University students voiced a variety of concerns following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, who will replace late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if confirmed by the Senate. 
From a shortlist of conservative political figures such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Trump ultimately decided on Barrett, who is known for her conservative stances on abortion, the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ+ rights, amongst other issues. 
The Executive Board of AU College Republicans said in a statement that they support the nomination. 
“In this time of unprecedented tumult and uncertainty, it is especially imperative that the Supreme Court be at full capacity, to remain a steady defender of the Constitution,” the AUCR Executive Board wrote in a statement released Oct. 2. “We strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett and look forward to her many more years of service to the United States of America and our sacred Constitution.” 
College Republicans declined to comment further. 
Many students said they are concerned that if she is confirmed, she will threaten the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision—a landmark case that protects a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction—and the Affordable Care Act. 
Jeremy Ward, the executive director of AU College Democrats, said that Barret’s nomination “shows that the Republicans don't care about health care.”
Roseanna Yeganeh-Kazemi, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, was also concerned. She cited Barrett’s use of religion to justify and support her legal opinions, such as with cases involving LGBTQ+ rights or abortion, as especially threatening, considering that the U.S. has no established religion. 
“We pride ourselves on that concept that we have a separation of church and state, and the fact that in a lot of opinions she's written and a lot of her stances she brings in Catholicism, which I think is a major problem,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
Several students said they were frustrated that Republicans plan to confirm Barrett with only a month until the general election. In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with eight months left until the election, but his nomination was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. 
“Then fast forward four years later, Justice Ginsburg's body is probably not even cold yet, it's just hours after she passed, and McConnell is saying that we are going to have a replacement,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
While some were upset, many students said they were not shocked, given the long-term political power the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers would acquire if Barrett is confirmed. 
“I was expecting President Trump to make a decision very quickly; I was expecting the Senate to be [quick] to confirm her,” said Ali Siddiqi, a freshman in the School of International Service who has been following Barrett’s rulings since she was on the shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. “She had no scandals or allegations to which the Trump campaign would want to deviate from, especially with Brett Kavanaugh. They want a clean judicial pick.”
Barrett’s confirmation hearing is set to start Oct. 12, and it is not yet known exactly how COVID-19 might affect the proceedings.

2020-10-13,AU,Republican,"AU alum Sarah McBride speaks at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. 
Sarah McBride, an American University alumna and former Student Government president, is expected to become the country’s first openly transgender state senator after winning her Delaware Senate Democratic primary race in September.
McBride overwhelmingly won in the primary, and given the makeup of her district, she is a heavy favorite to win the seat in November. 
“The best way that I can do justice by the LGBTQ community is to do right by my district, and to work my heart out and to be the best state senator I can be for every single resident of the first senate district. That's how I honor and uphold the responsibility I have to the broader LGBTQ+ community,” said McBride, in an interview with The Eagle.  
Democrat Harris McDowell III, the longest-serving legislator in Delaware history, is retiring and endorsed McBride.  
“This moment calls for a politics that is centering our people and our communities and that is really focused on the issues that matter most to people and making progress on them,” McBride said. “I think that we have a responsibility to feed this moment with full action that makes a real difference in our family's lives.”
Her campaign has been focused on health care, paid family and medical leave and education. If elected, she said her immediate priority would be to get her state through the coronavirus crisis. 
“This campaign has reinforced for me that people are hungry for conversations in our politics that are rooted in kindness and compassion, and it's reinforced for me the desire for change and progress. The desire for progress on issues ranging from better health care to education to the environment,” McBride said. 
Despite the historic nature of her campaign, McBride emphasized that her gender is not the focus of her campaign. 
“I’m not running to be a transgender state senator, I’m not running to make headlines,” McBride said. “I’m running to make a difference in my community.” 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, McBride’s campaign did a lot of door-knocking and face-to-face interaction with voters. Despite now having to virtually interact with voters, she said her campaign has not slowed down, and she is still able to have meaningful conversations with voters.
She said, being a millennial herself, she has also made it a priority to engage with and listen to young voters throughout the course of her campaign. 
“It means making sure that when we're talking to voters, we're actually including young voters in that universe and that we're truly, meaningfully, listening to young voters as we are having those conversations with voters across the district,” McBride said. 
While Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 3-to-1 in Delaware’s first senate district, McBride said she is not taking any chances. 
“I'm not taking anything for granted. I am working my heart out over the next few weeks to talk to as many voters as possible,"" McBride said. ""Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, we're leaving no stone unturned.”

2020-12-07,AU,Republican,"Allan Lichtman is a professor in American University's College of Arts and Sciences.

After correctly predicting Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, American University professor Allan Lichtman is celebrating his 10th correct prediction of the outcomes of the presidential races since 1984. 
Although Lichtman predicted that former Vice President Al Gore would win the presidential election in 2000, he stands by his prediction. He notes that Gore won the popular vote while Bush won the electoral college in a contentious Supreme Court battle. 
Lichtman has said that he believes the results of Florida make the 2000 election stolen, as there was a large portion of the Black community whose votes were suppressed. After this election, Lichtman changed his evaluation to account for the electoral college. 
Three years before his first prediction, Lichtman met Vladimir Keilis-Borok, a Russian seismologist who would later go on to become his “Odd Couple” pairing in correctly predicting presidential elections. Each brought something to the table to create a unique predicting method.
Keilis-Borok wanted to pair his knowledge of earthquake behaviors with Lichtman’s vast understanding of the American presidency to establish what we now know as the “13 Keys to the White House.” 
“The key to our collaboration was to reconceptualize presidential elections in geophysical terms,” Lichtman said. “Not as Republicans versus Democrats…but as ‘Stability,’ when the White House party keeps the presidency and ‘Earthquake’ when the White House party loses.” 
The 13 keys are all true or false, where true favors the re-election of the party holding the White House, and false favors the opposition party. Six or more false answers result in an “Earthquake.” 
The keys include whether there is a significant third-party candidate, how the short- and long-term economy is doing, and whether the incumbent is charismatic.
As Lichtman is a lifelong Democrat, being objective has major impacts on accuracy and success, he said. 
“The secret to being a successful forecaster is putting aside your own political preferences,” Lichtman said. “If you let your prediction be tainted by your preferences, then you would be useless as a forecaster.” 
In 2016, Lichtman received backlash for his prediction that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump would win, as polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton up double digits in several battleground states. He did note that his prediction was not impacted by Trump specifically, but because the keys swayed against the incumbent Democratic party. No matter who the Republican nominee was, according to his system, they would have won. 
Lichtman said that he believes the coronavirus pandemic has had a monumental impact on Biden’s victory. 
“The COVID pandemic was pivotal in turning this election against Trump,” Lichtman said. “However, it wasn’t just the pandemic, it was the failed response to it.”
With more than 14 million cases of COVID-19, over 280,000 deaths and millions of people filing for government assistance, the pandemic has put a strain on almost every U.S. citizen. 
The professor was very critical of Trump’s reaction to this November’s election results. 
“What we are seeing from Trump and his enablers since the election represents the worst moment in the history of the U.S. presidency,” Lichtman said.
Lichtman said there is no way to tell if these keys will stay useful in the coming presidential elections, but for now, he maintains his streak.

2020-12-09,AU,Republican,"D.C. celebrated a historic milestone this past summer in the fight for statehood when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would admit certain portions of D.C. as the 51st state. 
Regardless of the outcome, this was a significant achievement for those fighting for statehood, including those in the American University community. Noah Wills, a 2018 alum of the School of Public Affairs, now president of Students for D.C. Statehood, said the bill’s passing in the House was “the pinnacle of the statehood movement.” 
“I felt the excitement from the generations of student leaders and advocates before,” Wills said. “It was a testament to their determination. I’ve only been involved in the movement for about six years, but I’m happy to have contributed something to the past generations’ work.”
Votes were mainly along party lines, with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting the bill. However, the Republican-majority Senate hasn’t taken the bill up for a vote due to unpopular support.
H.R. 51 would declare the state, which currently has a non-voting member of Congress, two senators and a voting representative. The bill would also declare that the state consists of all District territory, with the exclusion of some federal buildings and monuments. The excluded territory would be known as the “Capital.”
ANC 3D07 Commissioner-elect Christian Damiana, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and president of AU Students for D.C. Statehood, shared in the excitement of the moment. 
“When it comes to statehood, progress has been very slow, and the success is rare,” Damiana said. “When success does come, it’s very powerful. We’ve seen more of this over the past few decades with small successes like D.C. getting more budget autonomy.”
Wills said that D.C.’s lack of representation is contrary to the ideals the country upholds. He said that is what drew him to the movement.
“I was astounded when I first heard that the capital of the United States, as a beacon of democracy in the world, doesn’t give its own residents the right to Congress,” Wills said. “I used my four years at American University to study the issue and to learn about why we are where we are, what the arguments for and against it are and why it hasn’t happened yet.”
Through D.C. Students for Statehood, Wills focuses on mobilizing high school and college students through education and advocacy — work he has continued since leading AU’s chapter of the organization. 
Damiana said a goal of the organization is to spread this message of what statehood would mean. 
“A lot of AU students will not stay in D.C. for the rest of their lives,” Damiana said. “Students come to D.C. and learn how important statehood is. Then, when they go back to their home states, hopefully, they’ll tell their family, friends and their representatives and senators how D.C. desperately needs statehood.”
As for the near future, statehood’s support has been on the rise among voters. In polls conducted by Data For Progress, 43 percent of voters supported statehood in September 2020 compared to 35 percent in early 2019. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed support for D.C. statehood, but for now, much is riding on the runoff Senate races in Georgia, where two additional Democratic seats could mean sure progress for the movement. 
Wills and Damiana hope to see more substantial change in the future as they continue to work toward their shared goal.
“D.C. statehood is a pathway to economic justice, to labor rights and to saving our environment and eventually passing the Green New Deal,” Damiana said. “Many of these things will never be able to pass the U.S. Senate without statehood. Statehood would be the clearest showing of what D.C. residents can do for America if we let them.”

2021-01-03,AU,Republican,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
This year, students at American University are speculating wildly about what Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ husband Douglas Emhoff will wear on Jan. 20. 
“I think he’ll stick to the traditional black suit,” freshman Irene McCoy said. “It makes sense to play it safe. His fashion choices can’t take away from his wife's position.”
Junior Jack Castillo wants to see something different.
“It would be really cool if he wore a gray suit,” Castillo said. “I’ve always thought gray was understated enough that it didn’t pull focus, while still being elegant.” 
Some students, including sophomore Gloria Ramirez, said he should go with a dark blue suit.
“I think it would show he supports the party’s base and calm the Bernie wing of the party,” she said.
Other students expressed concerns over potential fashion mistakes the future first gentleman could make.
“Well god forbid he wears the same suit to multiple events!” junior Tanya Frazier said. “It’s not in good taste and might reflect poorly on the whole incoming administration.”
Whatever color suit Emhoff chooses, the consensus among students was that the garment had to be from a fair trade, animal cruelty-free, environmentally sustainable manufacturer. 
“Imagine how terrible it would be if Doug wore a suit that undercut Vice President-elect Harris’ position on the environment and the economy,” sophomore Lloyd Fisher said. “That would be catastrophic.” 
Suit color is not the only aspect of Emhoff’s appearance under intense scrutiny. Which designer shoes he wears is also receiving a lot of attention. 
Last semester, Professor Julius May of the College of Arts and Sciences gave his Introduction to Statistics students a project: calculating the probability that Emhoff wears various designers. 
“I wanted to give them an assignment that they might enjoy,” May said. “The students told me the frontrunners are Gucci, Hermès, Prada and Louis Vuitton.” 
After suit color and type of shoes, Emhoff’s choice of tie comes in third for most attention. In fact, musings about Emhoff’s tie grew so intense that some students began betting on it. Junior Evelyn Long, a finance major, came up with the idea and shared information about the competition on social media. Within a day, over 50 students already placed bets. 
“I have five bucks on a red tie,” senior Reg Benson said. “I think he looks best in red, and it could send a signal that the administration is willing to work across the aisle with Republicans.” 
Senior Ebony Baldwin disagreed.
“If you ask me, Doug has to wear a purple tie,” Baldwin said. “A purple tie shows deference to the GOP without setting off the far left. I put 20 dollars on him wearing a purple tie, so I’m pretty committed.” 
According to Long, winnings are doubled if the student also guesses the correct material: cotton, polyester or silk. 
Apart from suit, shoes and tie, Emhoff’s choice of socks, undershirt — and to a lesser extent — lapel pin have garnered significant attention.
Junior Casey Briggs, a theater and anthropology double major, is planning her own performance piece for the day after the inauguration. Assembling all of the costumes is pretty easy: a black robe for Chief Justice John Roberts, a traditional pantsuit for Vice President-elect Harris and an orange jumpsuit for outgoing President Donald Trump.
Emhoff’s attire, however, has her stumped. 
“There are just so many variables,” Briggs said. “Between his suit and tie and the shoes, I don’t know what to expect.” 
She has mapped out all the different combinations for Emhoff’s appearance, so she is prepared to recreate whatever he wore for her production the next day.
At press time, Briggs had just remembered something. 
“Holy crap, I forgot his haircut!” she said. “Who knows what he’ll do with his hair. A comb over, give himself bangs, maybe a buzzcut?! I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.”

2021-03-09,AU,Republican,"GOP strategist and TV political commentator Ana Navarro spoke about her experiences in politics, media and current events at a Kennedy Political Union event on Thursday. 
The School of Communication and the American University College Republicans co-hosted the conversation with Navarro, which was moderated by SOC professor Jane Hall. Central to the discussion were Navarro’s thoughts on the future of the GOP — a future, she says, that will be without party unity, at least in the short term. That’s not to say that Democrats don’t have their own internal issues, she said. 
“If we’re going to be fair, I think there’s a lot of diversity of thought within the Democratic Party as well. Their divisions, their cracks, their systems — are about ideology, they’re not about personality,” Navarro said in a student media interview before the event. “In the Republican Party, the division and the schism we are seeing right now, it’s not about principles, it’s not about convictions, it’s not about policy issues — it’s about Donald Trump.”
Navarro said she is not sure what will happen to anti-Trump Republicans as the GOP moves forward. Navarro belongs to the prominent group of Republicans, often termed “Never Trumpers,” who broke away from the party following the then-candidate’s nomination in 2016. 
“The purity test that some want to apply [within the GOP] is, ‘do you support Donald Trump or not,’ and so for me, that’s no longer a political party,” Navarro said in the student media interview. “The people who are with Trump think those of us who want should no longer be in the Republican Party and, go I guess die somewhere, knit, pickup golf? Maybe not golf.” 
Now with President Joe Biden’s administration in power, Navarro said that she and her colleagues in multiple networks realized how many topics they can discuss without Trump dominating their time. News has been very U.S.-centric since Trump took office, and Navarro is looking forward to discussing other topics on her shows. 
“We are again as a media talking about things like the Iran deal, talking about things like Syria, talking about things like the Paris Climate accord,” Navarro said in the interview. “We’ve been constantly responding to a 24/7 Twitter live president, and that was to the detriment of looking beyond our borders to what is happening in the world that also affects us.”
During the event, Navarro spoke about her moral reasoning and decision process behind voting for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential election, despite being a life-long Republican. 
“There was no choice because I’m a human, I’m an American, I’m an immigrant, I’m a Latina, I’m a woman — before being a Republican,” Navarro said. “I’m not going to vote for somebody who I think is just completely unfit, morally, and frankly, intellectually, just because of a party label.”
Navarro also said that she has dealt with a lot of hate — including daily racist and misogynist attacks on social media — and faces constant threats for being vocal about her support for the Biden-Harris administration. Even some of her good friends would turn their faces when seeing Navarro at the same restaurant, she said. 
As an outspoken female political commentator, Navarro advocated for more women to join the field. Especially with more awareness about gender inequality brought up in the #MeToo movement, she said she has noticed some changes within the primarily male-dominated media industry. 
At CNN, for example, where Navarro said most hosts have historically been male, more women are being brought on than ever before. 
In response to a question from AUCR about how to engage in civil discourse with those who hold opposing views, Navarro spoke about her experiences critiquing then-President Barack Obama on CNN with her colleague and former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile, who Navarro described as an Obama defender and advocate.
“Oftentimes after debating vigorously, we’d go have drinks, and oysters, or whatever watering hole in Washington, and people would walk in and marvel because they have just seen us fighting on TV,” Navarro said. “And I just think you make a conscious decision, ‘okay, I am going to talk to this person. … I’m going to try to listen to what they say and tell them how I feel.’ I do draw a line on conspiracy theorists and white supremacists and racists and bigots.”

2022-02-10,AU,Republican,"In an Advisory Neighborhood Commission Meeting for ANC 3D on Feb. 2, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton answered questions about her activity in Congress and advocacy for D.C. statehood.
The district’s non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives answered questions about the “Build Back Better” plan, pushing priorities forward while Democrats retain Congressional control, mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on the city and her efforts to achieve D.C. statehood.
Norton outlined her efficacy as a representative and detailed how she has helped the district in Congress recently. 
“I was rated the most effective House Democrat by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, and last Congress, I was rated the second most effective non-full committee chair among House Democrats,” Norton said. “This Congress, of the 80 bills I have introduced thus far 18 have moved, at least through committee and two have been signed into law.”
Attendees were asked to submit their questions for Norton before the meeting, most of which covered activities in Congress and their impacts on district residents. 
Unifying Democratic control under the threat of losing control of Congress is a priority for 2022, but is limited by the filibuster, Norton said. 
“The House has passed my D.C. statehood bill and my bill to give them air control over the D.C. National Guard, but they can't pass because of the filibuster,” Norton said. 
However, Norton’s provision to increase the annual D.C. tuition access grant awards from $10,000 to $15,000 in the D.C. Appropriations Bill is likely to succeed despite the filibuster. 
With regards to D.C. statehood, Norton said it feels “very close, yet very far away right now.” Fifty-four percent of the American people support D.C. statehood, and understanding this and mobilization are key to getting statehood passed, Norton said.
“The biggest hurdles to pass are the filibuster and getting Americans activated on this issue,” Norton said. “Republicans in the House and Senate have introduced more than 20 bills and amendments this Congress to overturn D.C. policies. Six members have tried to overturn D.C. vaccine policies of all things. I will defeat all these efforts just as I have defeated virtually every effort to overturn D.C. laws in more than a decade.”
Many of the questions from the public centered on the power Congressional legislation has over the district, and Norton made it clear that D.C. interests are her main priority. 
“As a matter of home rule, I don’t weigh in on council legislation,” Norton said. “My job is to defend in Congress whatever legislation Congress passes, so if I weighed in, that would be held against the district, whatever passes.”
Norton detailed the way the country’s COVID-19 policies have failed and expressed frustration with the misinformation and disinformation that have, “caused many needless deaths,” in response to a question about how these policies will continue to impact locals. 
“I’m very concerned that we are no better prepared to confront new challenges in this pandemic or future pandemics. Our healthcare workforce is exhausted and quitting in large numbers and we have an underfunded and fragmented public health system,” Norton said. “COVID will likely be around forever and we will need to be prepared to relax and scale up public health measures based on what the virus does.”
Norton closed by answering several more locally based questions from members of the ANC 3D neighborhood and providing questioners with relevant contacts in her office.

2022-03-02,AU,Republican,"As American University’s Founders Week celebration came to a close, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones discussed her work on the 1619 Project and the current efforts to ban certain materials in the teaching of history. 
Founders’ “An Evening with Nikole Hannah-Jones,” co-hosted by the Kennedy Political Union, Women’s Initiative and the Sine Institute, was the first in-person KPU event since before the pandemic.
Hannah-Jones’s main focus of the event was her work founding the 1619 Project while at The New York Times. The project, which began in 2019 as a work of long-form journalism, marked the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved peoples in the Virginia colony.
“Slavery and freedom were born at the same time here, but we only wanted to talk about one as being foundational to American identity,” she said.
Hannah-Jones argued that the ideals of the country were founded in 1619, rather than when the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. With this, the project works to highlight the effects of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans in the country’s history.
“You don't get 1776 without 1619,” Hannah-Jones said. 
The 1619 Project has come under criticism, as some think the project works to replace the events of 1776 when America declared independence. However, Hannah-Jones said it’s important  historians continue to find complex sources and interpretations of history to better understand American society as it is today. 
Along with these criticisms were attempts to defund the teaching of the 1619 Project in schools. In a bill introduced in June 2021, Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Tom Cotton said that the 1619 Project is a “distortion of American history.” 
When federal efforts to defund the teaching of the 1619 Project failed, Hannah-Jones said attention was moved to state legislatures. 
Hannah-Jones said she believed “anti-critical race theory” bills to be an attempt to deter the momentum of white support behind the Black Lives Matter movement. Hannah-Jones called these “anti-history” bills.
Critical race theory is a legal theory exploring the institutions of power from a race-based perspective. 
For Hannah-Jones, the teaching of Black American history in schools should not be labeled as critical race theory. The efforts have led to the banning of curriculum and certain books in K-12 schools. But rather than controlling what is being taught in schools, Hannah-Jones said it’s about controlling the narrative of history — critical race theory is not taught in K-12 schools, as it is an advanced legal theory. 
“History is how we think about ourselves as a society,” she said. “You have a group of people who are used to always being the heroes in the story, the victors, and now we're having to comprise a more honest and a much uglier truth, and they don’t want to.”
In addition to understanding 1619 as the foundational year of America, Hannah-Jones said America was not a true democracy until the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. Before then, she says America was an ethnocracy, a democracy for just white Americans. 
“Now we have to grapple with a multiracial democracy that we actually never had before. And it has been contested every step of the way,” Hannah-Jones said. 
Hannah-Jones also discussed how her efforts to develop a more comprehensive view of U.S. history has affected her career as a journalist. In 2021, when she was appointed to the Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism at the University of North Carolina, the board of trustees initially denied her tenure due to the controversy surrounding the 1619 Project. When the board reversed their decision, she turned down the position.
“It was one of the best moments of my life,” she said. Hannah-Jones said she didn’t want to stay at the institution which treated her, or other Black faculty, poorly.
Hannah-Jones warned students that America’s democracy is deteriorating. She encouraged students that, along with staying hopeful, they should take action and “refuse where the country is going.”
“We have the power to shape our society and we have the power to push back on these laws,” she said. “We have the power to ensure that our democracy will hold; they cannot take it from us without our permission.”

2022-03-05,AU,Republican,"American University Archives and the Founders Week Committee showcased an exhibit on the first floor of Bender Library with a comprehensive overview of American University’s history and an acknowledgment of AU founder John Fletcher Hurst’s ownership of enslaved people.
Titled Embracing Change: AU Rising to the Challenges, the exhibit showcased various historical items, including yearbooks, letters and student publications, dating back to the beginning of AU to nearly the present day. 
The exhibit was put together with the work of Founders Director Jeremy Ward, Programming Graduate Assistant for the Center of Student Involvement Madeline Portilla, Michelle Eller and Sarah Graff from the University library and Associate Archivist Leslie Nellis.
The exhibit also noted that Hurst and his family were “active participants in Maryland chattel slavery.”
Check out the new exhibit created in collaboration with the Founder's Week Committee and #AULibrary. Embracing Change: AU Rising to the Challenge. This timeline highlights AU's actions in the face of complex challenges throughout its history. https://t.co/I5jZKQ6gi4
Nellis said conversations surrounding Hurst’s ownership of enslaved people happened around Founders Week in 2018, after a column published in The Eagle discussed the relationship to slavery in AU’s founding.
“So when I talked with my colleagues working on the exhibit, I said that ‘we're going to acknowledge this, right?’ And they said, ‘Oh, yeah,’” Nellis said. “It was definitely a priority of Jeremy and Maddie …  to acknowledge that history.”
The beginning of the exhibit had a chart with a color-coordinated timeline. The color blue on the timeline highlights instances of “War, Peace, and Government” that occurred in American University’s history: green for “Climate Change and Environmental Activism,” purple for “Advancing Gender and Sexuality Equity,” orange for “Racial Equity Milestones” and red for “Global Campus.”
The exhibit contained copies of a few student publications like The AU Women’s Newsletter, News and Views from the International Student Community, The Jewish Pickle, Campus Republican and The Blackprint.
There are also yearbooks from 1931, 1963, 1971, 2004 and 2009 with student pictures, and various campus activities and clubs. The exhibit included a shovel used in the groundbreaking of the School of International Service on June 9, 1957.
The one thing Nellis wanted to include in the exhibit but didn’t make the cut was “ ... a lot of the individual student protests that took place between about 1968 and 1975.” She said there were numerous protests and students had varying demands about being anti-Vietnam War, other domestic issues and the way AU was run.
“We tried to put in some key ones or key ways that actually spurred change on campus,” Nellis said.

2022-04-11,AU,Republican,"Congressman and American University alumnus Jim McGovern (MA-2) discussed his career and the political issues facing the country at an event hosted by the Kennedy Political Union on Wednesday.
School of Public Affairs Dean Vicki Wilkins moderated the event and asked McGovern questions about his life, political work and perspective on current events. 
McGovern began by describing his experience as a student at AU, looking back on the people, places and opportunities that shaped his undergraduate years. 
“I loved every minute,” he said. “I had some great courses, I made some great friends who are lifelong friends to this day, I had incredible discussions and I had this incredible internship with George McGovern that’s still among my most cherished memories on Capitol Hill.” 
Upholding this culture of activism, McGovern mentioned how he led a protest against his graduation speaker, economist George Gilder, where he convinced several students and their parents to turn their backs to the stage during Gilder’s speech. 
“He had written some pretty controversial things, like there was no discrimination against Black women,” he said. “We all had black armbands on and we stood and turned our backs in protest when he spoke.” 
McGovern said that losing his first congressional campaign in 1994 taught him important lessons that helped him win on his second bid, despite little support from his personal and political circles. 
“When I announced [my run] both times, nobody thought it was a good idea,” he said. “I had never run for anything in my life other than class treasurer when I was a senior in high school, so there was not a lot of establishment support.” 
McGovern said his decision to run again in 1996 was fueled by a desire to run a better race the second time and a belief that he was more equipped for the job than the incumbent candidate. 
“The most important thing was that I wanted to do it,” he said. “It enabled me to get up every day in spite of the odds and campaign my heart out.” 
McGovern has won reelection in each subsequent term since his first successful bid in 1996. Some highlights of his career include starting the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, which provides school meals to nearly nine million of the world’s poorest children, and the Innovative Approaches to Literacy Program, an initiative that strives to improve literacy skills for children and students from birth through 12th grade. 
Another pivotal moment in his career took place on Jan. 6 of last year. McGovern was inside the Capitol Chamber overseeing the certification of the electoral college when the crowd of insurrectionists infiltrated the building. 
“It was really a terrorist attack, not just on the building, but on our democracy,” McGovern said. “I was in the chair, I took over for Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, and I was hearing shouts in the corridor … I was getting texts from my daughter saying ‘Where are you? What are you doing?’” 
McGovern said the emotional effects of what he witnessed that day still linger. 
“When I walk to work and I see the Capitol building, I still get emotional when I think about what it symbolized, and to see people ripping it apart,” he said. 
Speaking of the rioters, McGovern said, “Looking at their faces, if you asked me to describe what hate looks like, I would tell you it is what I saw in the eyes of these people.” He added that the rioters were there “to nullify and overturn the will of the American people.”
McGovern expressed dismay at his Republican colleagues who continue to downplay the events of that day. 
“I serve with people who say that the people who attacked us were patriots,” he said. “I can barely look at them, I can’t get into an elevator with them … 140 Capitol police officers were injured, staffers were traumatized … so to glorify any part of that day to me is sick.” 
McGovern also warned against letting history repeat itself, saying another coup “will happen again” if those involved are not held accountable. 
Asked how Congress can move forward, McGovern said that the upcoming midterm elections are a “crossroads” for protecting democracy against a future of “authoritarianism” and “fascism.” 
“If Republicans win the House or the Senate in the midterms, that is a reward to Trump, it’s a reward to those who are the ones who were cheering on those who wanted to nullify the election,” he said. “I think that strengthens their ranks, and it means the Republican party moves more and more in that direction.” 
Despite the circumstances, McGovern said he still holds hope that democracy will prevail, but added that protecting democracy is contingent on people being politically active. 
“It's not enough for us to be able to think good thoughts or to be able to argue in a classroom over policy,” he said. “If you really care about this stuff, you’ll find a way to put your energy into something of service.” 
Born into a family of small business owners, McGovern developed an interest in politics after seeing the economic challenges that his parents faced running their liquor store in Worcester, Massachusetts. Once he became a student at AU, McGovern worked his way through the ranks, interning in the office of Senator George McGovern, to whom he isn’t related, before graduating with a B.A. in history and working in the office of Democratic Congressman Joe Moakley. 
McGovern was asked to share some tips with students looking to build a career in politics. His advice: “Just run.” 
“Lightning can strike,” he said. “If you wanna do it, do it, and give it your best.”

2022-07-05,AU,Republican,"A mural commemorates the history of Tenleytown
Many incumbents emerged victorious in citywide primaries and progressives succeeded in council races in the D.C. primary election held on June 21. The election centered around issues such as housing and homelessness, policing and crime, education and transportation.
Although the June 21 election was the primary election, D.C. is historically a Democratic stronghold and Democratic primary winners almost always go on to win the general election.
Mayor Muriel Bowser won the Democratic nomination for mayor again, likely making her the second ever D.C. mayor to hold the office for three or more terms, with Marion Barry being the first. Bowser won 49 percent of the vote, beating out more progressive challengers such as Robert White, who trailed her by only 10,000 votes, with close to 41 percent of the vote.
In Ward 3, progressive Matthew Frumin secured the nomination for the seat left open by former Councilmember Mary Cheh. In the weeks leading up to the election, several other progressive candidates strategically dropped out of the race in order to avoid splitting the progressive vote and afford Frumin the votes necessary to win against more moderate Democrat Eric Goulet.
In another open race, in Ward 5, progressive Zachary Parker, secured a win against his six competitors, winning approximately 44 percent of the vote. Brian Schwalb is set to succeed Karl Racine as D.C. attorney general, who served as the city’s first elected attorney general. Until 2015, D.C.’s mayor appointed the city’s attorney generals.
Progressive Ward 1 councilmember Brianne Nadeau retained her seat, winning 48 percent of the vote, as did Charles Allen who ran unopposed for the nomination in Ward 6.
Incumbents won their races across the rest of the district Eleanor Holmes Norton won 87 percent of the vote, securing the Democratic nomination for the D.C. delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives primary. Phil Mendelson held onto his position as D.C. council chair, but defeated candidate Erin Palmer only by about 8,000 votes. Anita Bonds, councilmember-at-large, won her primary, a citywide race, with a plurality of the vote.
Turnout in the election was at a decade high, at around 32 percent, approximately 130,000 of D.C.'s around 410,000 eligible voters. Primary election turnout had not been above 30 percent since 2010, when 37 percent voted. In the 2020 primary, turnout was slightly lower than this year, at 28 percent, and in 2018, only 19 percent of eligible voters turned out to polls. 
According to the D.C. Board of Elections website, two thirds of votes were cast via mail-in or special ballot. Election board spokesman Nick Jacobs told the Washington Post that about 30,000 ballots were submitted via drop box or mail on Tuesday alone, and the board was “stunned at the magnitude.”
Few Republicans ran in the primaries, however, those who did, such as David Krucoff in Ward 3, or Giuseppe Niosi for the at-large seat, were virtually unopposed and will face their Democratic opponents in the general election this November.

2022-07-06,AU,Republican,"American University’s future educators are preparing to lead classrooms of their own amid the ongoing threat of gun violence in American schools and beyond. 
In the wake of the recent mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, current and prospective educators in the AU community reflect on their unwavering passion to teach despite the potential dangers that accompany the profession and the unsettling environment they are forced to enter into. 
School of Education professor Amaarah DeCuir began teaching in 1995, four years before the Columbine shooting claimed the lives of 12 students and one teacher — back when fire drills defined schools’ only safety plans, she said. 
A day after the tragedy in Uvalde, DeCuir sat down to write about her time spent as an educator and the evolution of safety in the classroom.
“In that moment, I went back to my very first teaching position,” DeCuir said. “I was a fifth grade teacher at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School here in D.C. The first line of what I wrote was, ‘I remember the exact day, the first day that I fell in love.’” 
Now, DeCuir instructs and supports the next generation of teachers moving through AU. DeCuir also serves as faculty adviser to Students for Educational Advancement (SEA) on campus. 
On the morning of May 24, SEA held a virtual healing circle to process the anti-Black mass shooting in Buffalo, New York and the anti-Asian salon shooting in Dallas, Texas, both of which took place earlier that month.
As the meeting wrapped up, members’ phones lit up with notifications of another shooting, this time at an elementary school. 
Junior Josiah Carolina, a history major and SEA president, wants to be a high school history teacher. He had helped to organize the virtual healing circle event. 
“We had just finished processing so much trauma, and then to find out that there was a school shooting in a room full of prospective educators, it was really tough,” Carolina said.
As the tragedies compounded, Qudsia Saeed, a junior majoring in elementary education, described a heavy moment on the call as the group entered into a moment of silence and began to process mourning additional loss of life in the very setting they’d soon be entering. 
“It's a really valuable space that we shared,” Saeed said. “I will forever treasure that moment of being together, even though we are going through these very difficult moments in history.”
Today, leading a classroom requires educators to make a difficult decision: would you put your life on the line? Carolina said his unwavering passion to teach has informed his answer to this question. 
“I would absolutely give my life for my students,” Carolina said. “That's unquestionable. I don't think anyone should be going into teaching unless that's the case.”
For senior psychology major Nadia Adams, her dream of working as a high school counselor means those closest to her might also be forced to make a sacrifice.
“My mom texted me out of the blue and asked if I was sure I wanted to work in schools,” Adams said. “It is difficult knowing that if I do work in schools, my mom will worry about me every day.”
Following the shooting in Uvalde, policymakers have reignited a battle on gun control. 
President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan gun reform bill into law on Saturday after decades of stalled efforts to enact gun control. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act limits firearm access among young buyers and domestic violence offenders, and also funds school safety and mental health programs as well as expands background checks for those under 21. The bill does not ban assault weapons such as the kind used in the Uvalde shooting. 
There is also a push from Republican members of congress such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Kevin McCarthy as well as Rep. Lauren Boebert to look to “harden” schools as a solution. 
Hardening schools can look like arming teachers or installing surveillance technology, metal detectors and fortified entries in an attempt to bolster security, according to the National Education Association. However, some of AU’s future educators say this method is neither appealing to them as employees nor conducive to a flourishing learning environment.
Carolina grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut, just a 20 minute drive from Sandy Hook Elementary School, the site of the 2012 shooting during which six adult staff members and 20 children between the ages of six and seven were killed. 
Carolina describes Bridgeport as marginalized and economically disenfranchised. Just like the city, Carolina said the schools he attended were frequently the subject of high policing. He walked through metal detectors to get into school and during the day a security force of around 10 officers would patrol halls monitoring student activity. 
“Going to school in a very militarized environment, being surveyed and police searched, you go into school thinking that you're guilty of something already,” Carolina said.
Carolina and Saeed agree, this degree of surveillance disconnects young people from the prospects of education; they've seen such ramifications in action.
Saeed mentored students at Hart Middle School in D.C. this past year. There, she witnessed the impact of such stringent security in a school setting, such as her sixth and seventh graders entering through metal detectors daily.
“They'd have to wait in lines to just get inside the school,” Saeed said. “This didn't make the students happy or safe. It didn't feel like a community. It felt more like a jail.”
With over two decades of teaching experience, DeCuir believes hardening schools misdirects time and funding from resources such as counseling, mental health and literacy initiatives. Carolina also thinks school administrations, politicians and the public need to start thinking and acting proactively.
“You want to arm teachers?” Carolina said. “Arm them with the materials, curriculum development, training and proper staffing of social workers, psychologists, therapists and guidance counselors that they need.”
DeCuir said teachers, while having to adapt to difficult standards of the job title, can also contribute to the future of American classrooms free of such threats.
“I'm an educator, I understand all of what that involves,” DeCuir said. “At the same time, I'm going to work my darndest to dismantle any of the systems or practices that we have outside and inside of schools that are creating conditions where violence and horror continues to occur.”
Though Saeed said she is not comfortable teaching in a classroom in the U.S. in part due to politicization of education and the threat of gun violence, she hopes that her peers and herself keep in mind the imagination of what schools can be. 
“It's important for us as teachers to continue to think radically and dream big about what schools can and should look like,” Saeed said. “We can pass our vision for schools on to our students and they can become the changemakers we need them to be in this world.”

2022-10-10,AU,Republican,"Protestors gather outside of the Supreme Court on Friday, June 24. 
Following the Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, national uncertainty has persisted about how abortion access may change and how states may suffer disparate impacts. As the midterm elections loom, voters will weigh abortion as a definitive issue when electing future decision-makers.
The Dobbs v. Jackson decision returned legislative power over abortion to Congress and state governments. Since then, states have imposed abortion bans and restrictions, several more are underway and further such laws may be implemented if the Republican Party gains sufficient control in state legislatures. Federal bans and restrictions are also possible, though not at all likely under the current Congress. 
Research from Pew Research Center suggests that the issue of reproductive rights will be an important issue in the midterm election. Voter registration has surged among women, which points to the fact that abortion is a mobilizing issue for voters.
In D.C., abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy, but since the district does not have statehood, the future of abortion rights in D.C. differs from states throughout the country.
Congress controls aspects of D.C., as it is a federal district. Though D.C. does have a city council, Congress has exclusive control over the district, according to the Constitution.
As the midterm elections approach in November, which party holds Congress could impact abortion rights in D.C. and nationally.
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has proposed a 15-week federal abortion ban, which would ban all abortions after 15 weeks, with limited exceptions carved out for rape, incest or threats to the bearer’s life. This ban cannot pass in the current Democratic-controlled Senate, but this could change if control shifts to the GOP in the midterm elections.
Any abortion legislation, either in its own bill or as a rider on unrelated legislation, would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president.
In 2011, former President Barack Obama signed a law that had an abortion-related rider attached to it. In signing the bill, the rider portion went into effect, banning local D.C. dollars from going to abortions for low-income people in the district. 
Additionally, abortion-related measures previously passed by D.C. City Council would be void if faced by anti-abortion legislation, D.C. local news reporter Chelsea Cirruzzo said in an interview with The Eagle. 
Potential abortion restrictions in D.C. would disproportionately impact Black residents. In 2015, more than 60 percent of abortions in the district were sought by Black residents. 
Abortion is still legal in D.C. and the broader DMV area. Despite this, there may be barriers even to legal abortion, such as potential costs.
An abortion through Planned Parenthood in D.C. can range in cost from $578 to $2,008. While financial assistance is available, this is an additional hoop abortion-seekers must jump through.
Organizations such as DC Abortion Fund also provide financial assistance to abortion-seekers. Such nonprofits rely on fundraising through events and campaigns, as well as one-off donations to provide this type of support. Other regional abortion funds include the Baltimore Abortion Fund and the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund.
Another barrier abortion-seekers must overcome is having to face anti-choice protesters in order to physically enter clinics. 
The Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force provides volunteer escorts, also known as “clinic defenders,” to reproductive health clinics in D.C., Maryland and Virginia.
“It is a scary moment, for a lot of people, that moment of walking into the clinic. Because the narratives that are out there about abortion are often so demonizing and scary,” said one local clinic defender, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons. “And so we're out there to make sure that protesters don't get out of control, don’t get too close to the patient. Or if they do have those conversations, to be able to say, ‘Hey, it's okay, we can just go inside.’”
At AU, students with reproductive health concerns may seek guidance from the Student Health Center and the Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services.
According to Dr. Ariel White, the university physician at the Student Health Center, the center provides “comprehensive reproductive health services for all students, regardless of gender identification,” as well as pregnancy counseling. The center does not provide abortions, but can refer students to the appropriate resources.
The Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services can provide counseling and supportive services, including for students who have experienced sexual assault, said its director, Dr. Jacquelin Darby. These services are all confidential.
“Our main goal is to support students and make sure that they are well, and so we will work to continue to do that,” Darby said.

2009-09-10,AU,club,"When AU's Terrace Dining Room re-opened its doors to AU students this August it was still teeming with hungry students foraging for food, but since the beginning of this year, they will have to do it without trays.
JoDe Nowland, director of Auxiliary Services, spearheaded the removal of trays from TDR. The university is always looking for a way to cut down on its carbon footprint, Nowland said, and the removal of trays from the cafeteria will reduce food waste by 37 percent.
Over the summer, Auxiliary Services experimented with the concept of a tray-less cafeteria. It yielded high results, and so the campaign to make AU a green college by reducing wastes continues this semester, according to Nowland.
Reducing food waste is not the only result of eradicating trays from TDR. The amount of water and electricity used to clean trays is also reduced.  
""People tend to fill up their trays and not eat the food,"" Nowland said. ""The food winds up in landfills and nothing positive comes of it.""
Georgetown University and George Washington University have already removed trays from their cafeteria, according to Nowland.
Eco-Sense, AU's environmental sustainability club, supported the removal of trays from TDR after a report was published by Dr. Kim, the environmental studies advisor, that showed a significant reduction in waste at the university.
Eco-Sense completely supports Bon Appetit's removal of trays from the cafeteria. 
""There is no reasonable argument for putting the trays back into TDR,"" said Drew Veysey, president of Eco-Sense. ""The reasons for being tray-less are numerous and logical.""
Students have taken the missing trays in stride, according to Nowland. 
""This is not a serious issue,"" Veysey said, ""Having a tray does not improve a student's quality of life, but a higher cost of living does decrease quality of life.""

2009-09-10,AU,club,"Butterfly Boucher stormed the District Sept. 3 with her Fender Telecaster and signature racing stripe (that she taped on herself) and opened up for the Grammy Award-winning Wallflowers at the 9:30 club. Promoting her sophomore release, ""Scary Fragile"" -- released digitally in early June and in stores Sept. 15 -- Boucher played an enjoyable set, to say the least. 
For the most part, her set was composed of newer songs from ""Scary Fragile,"" but she gave the audience a few tracks from her first album, ""Flutterby,"" including ""I Can't Make Me"" and ""Another White Dash."" These songs and others were put to the tune of just her guitar and voice, and when deemed necessary, she called in backup that took the shape of a pedal with pre-recorded bass and drums -- tracks she laid down herself. 
Her latest single, ""Gun for a Tongue,"" is a perfect example of Boucher's tendency to use a simple beat, light piano and a bass line under her live guitar. Using her pedal, Boucher prevents her songs from falling into the same pattern, keeping the audience engaged.
Her eclectic style is unique for several reasons, which she explained to the audience during the set. Her Australian upbringing was followed by her move to London and her current residence in Nashville, Tenn. In her MySpace biography, Boucher also describes the musical household in which she was raised, where she learned to play many instruments, including the bass, piano and guitar.
Alone on stage, Boucher created a full tone by tuning her guitar a bit differently than most, dropping the sixth string to a D and bringing the fourth string up two steps to an E. This can especially be heard in songs like the title track, ""Scary Fragile"" and results in the ability to play the bass line and the melody together despite only having one instrument. 
Boucher's performance of ""Scary Fragile"" was exceptional; it showed her depth as a musician who could write a ballad. With a morose tone as an opening, the melody carried the recurring lyrics of ""It's scary to be fragile in this turning world/this world, it turns me upside down."" She then quickly uplifted the crowd with ""To Feel Loved,"" showing her alt-rock side with a strong, clean strumming pattern and an added string arrangement in the middle. 
Boucher keeps her spirits high, even after the record industry has left her tumbled and bruised over the last three years. Her label claimed her first album was ""too indie for pop and too pop for the indie scene,"" according to her MySpace page. She encountered similar problems with ""Scary Fragile"" and had to re-record all 12 songs, as her British distributor insisted that she was too ""American-sounding"" for British listeners. Boucher ended up getting the full rights to her songs and is now releasing the original recordings. Today, the scars have made her tougher and gave her a sense of humor, too. One would expect her to come out of these situations bitter, but it is clear that she has bested the music industry, playing with joy and displaying her love for the music she plays. 
Now without the help of Nettwerk Records, Boucher has self-released ""Scary Fragile"" and is stronger than ever, joking about how ""well-behaved"" her band-in-a-box is. She recognizes how much work she needs to put into her career now that she is free from a label, and after the show she spent quality time with anyone who wanted a CD signed. Right in the middle of her set, she handed out mailing lists from the stage herself, passing them around the crowd hoping for people to sign and follow her along her travels. 
All in all, Boucher came to the District with only a few fans in the crowd. But as the set went along, so grew the applause and respect from the audience. She avoided overusing the pre-recorded instruments and put herself out to the crowd. She was ready for any misfires and casualties, but she came out of the show with a victory and a troop of people supporting her. 
Have no fear if you missed Boucher's show this past week; she is coming back to the District, playing at the Rock and Roll Hotel along side Erin McCarley and KS Rhoads on Oct. 20.

2009-10-12,AU,club,"Critics and fans alike have found it hard to group singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile into a single genre. She’s been described as rock, folk, alternative and even country. After watching her perform at the 9:30 club Wednesday night, it’s easy to see why Carlile cannot be contained to one set of rules.
Musician Katie Herzig opened the show with a short set of songs from her albums “Weightless” and “Apple Tree.” Herzig’s music falls under the mellow-but-still-slightly-techno category that has recently taken over the television airwaves on shows like “Smallville” and “Grey’s Anatomy” — programs in which her own music has been featured.  
With a voice part-Jewel and part-Anya Marina, Herzig’s breathy delivery was unique but enjoyable, especially on the more rock-heavy “Hologram,” a song she introduced as her angry break-up tune. The eclectic mix of sounds in her set, with instruments ranging from clarinet to accordion, proved Herzig is entertaining and talented, but one could tell the crowd was waiting for the real star of the show to begin.
The crowd went crazy with applause once Carlile took the stage. Without wasting a minute, Carlile and her band delved into an a cappella version of “Oh Dear,” from her newest album “Give Up the Ghost.” The five-part harmony was impeccable and proved from the beginning that Carlile’s voice is one to be reckoned with. This was not the only time Carlile sang sans technology in the show, as later in her set her band performed an unplugged version of “Dying Day.” 
Despite the naturally raspy tone of her voice, Carlile has the range and delivery of a seasoned professional. Satisfying her fans of varying time lengths, Carlile sang songs from all three of her studio albums, making sure to play hits like “Happy” and “What Can I Say” from her first self-titled debut, as well as her newest single, “Dreams,” and various tunes from her latest CD, released the day before the D.C. concert.
The emotion evident in Carlile’s voice is perhaps the biggest attraction for fans. Before playing the next likely single off “Give Up the Ghost,” “That Year,” Carlile explained that she wrote the song about a friend who had committed suicide when they were both 16 years old, and how she wasn’t even able to speak his name for 10 years before one day waking up and just writing the song. Carlile looked near tears as she played the acoustic solo piece, and as she ended, one could hear sniffs in the audience as people wiped away tears.
Big on audience participation, Carlile played to the crowd, often standing on the very edge of the stage and playing directly above all the fans singing along. She also kept a bevy of monogrammed guitar picks stuck to her microphone stand that she used and then tossed out into the audience after each song. During “Turpentine,” an audience favorite from her second album “The Story,” Carlile stopped the song to teach the audience a three-part harmony for the chorus that temporarily turned the sea of screaming fans into a D.C. choir of sorts.
Though Carlile’s own songs have been racing up the charts (her newest release hit was number one on the iTunes chart for a few days this week before slipping down to third position), her encore was full of covers of other artists’ songs. A rousing rendition of Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire” elicited an amazing guitar solo from Carlile’s guitarist Tim Hanseroth. Carlile then sat at the piano for an emotional version of The Beatles’ “Let It Be,” before finally launching into three of her own songs, ending the show with parent-dedicated “Pride and Joy.” 
As evidenced by the line wrapping around the block of the 9:30 club to have Carlile sign autographs after the show, one could easily tell that her music truly strikes the heart of fans and her dedication to them is evident. Staying outside for over an hour after the show signing records, picks, ticket stubs and the like, Carlile proved that much like her fans that night, she has staying power.

2009-10-12,AU,club,"Equestrianism, the skill of riding horses, has commonly been a financially demanding and specialized sport, but the AU Club Equestrian Team offers riders an affordable way to continue riding at the collegiate level. 
Co-founded in the fall of 2003, the team welcomes riders of all ability levels and backgrounds. Members do not have to compete in order to be part of the team.
Generally, the AU student body knows little about this club sport. Riders are hard to spot around campus because they travel to Lakeside Stables in Clarksburg, Md. for practice. There, Coach Jeff Becker provides team members with horses and once-weekly group lessons determined by their ability level. 
Of the 23 riders in the club, the team is only allowed to show 15 of them in competition. In order to give each rider a chance to compete, Becker rotates the lineup every competition. 
In competitions, also known as horse shows, each rider competes individually in equitation or jumping, collecting points for the overall team score and personal placement. The points a rider collects determine when they will advance to the next skill level. 
Many of the team members are involved in equitation, where riders are judged by their form and ability to control the horse.
“Equitation is a lot about showing yourself off and showing how good you look,” said senior Bailey Bearss, president and captain of the team. “A lot of horseback riding is making the connection between you and the horse look effortless, like you are a pair.”
The horses mounted in competition are, for the most part, provided by the host school. Prior to competition, riders draw a Popsicle stick with the name of the horse they will be riding and the rider is not given the opportunity to warm up on the horse.
According to junior Madeline Cohen, the hardest and most nerve-racking part of the equestrian sport is mounting a new horse. 
“It is about being very flexible as a rider and being able to ride a whole slew of different types of horses, because they are all different,” Cohen said.
To prepare his team members for the spontaneity of competition, Becker requires members to ride a different horse each practice. This helps the riders learn to quickly adjust themselves in any situation.
Despite training a young team this season — there are five returning riders — Becker is confident about the incoming talent. At the team’s first competition the weekend of Oct. 3, Becker saw a basis of a successful team being formed.
“They all support each other and help each other,” Becker said. “They really are a good team.”
Being on the team has taught AU’s riders important lessons that they have been able to apply outside of the sport. Sophomore Rachel Tranchik emphasized the patience the equestrian sport has instilled in her.
“With any horse that you have, you have to learn their different tricks. Horses have the tendency to test you,” Tranchik said. “They know who you are and know your strong points and weaknesses, and they use that to their advantage.” 
Becker expects to the team to continue to grow and overcome their nerves and fears at their next showing on Oct. 24 at Goucher College in Baltimore.

2010-04-12,AU,club,"If there is any city that can truly handle the rock prowess of the Arctic Monkeys, it’s Baltimore. The Brit rockers slammed the city with a flurry of trip-hop and fast indie rock at Maryland’s answer to the 9:30 club, Rams Head Live!
The psychedelic San Francisco natives Sleepy Sun opened the show. The band were a trip back in time to 1969, complete with harmonicas, maracas and peyote-influenced dance moves. All six members played their instruments as though there was nothing else that mattered, swaying and squeezing their eyes shut. The lead singer sang with a clear treble reminiscent of Grace Slick, hippie chick extraordinaire of ‘60s band Jefferson Airplane. The band played songs called “Sleepy Son,” “White Dove” and “Red/Black,” that were all five or six minutes long and each encapsulated a trippy, sun-drenched vibe that were both moody and uplifting. 
On the downside, each of their songs was an attempt to recapture a sound, like the trippy riff to Parliament’s “Maggot Brain,” as well as Pink Floyd’s “Shine On You Crazy Diamond.” Aside from the copycat song style, Sleepy Sun created a peaceful mood, leaving the crowd swaying and tapping their feet to the captivating rhythm.  But the crowd came for something more aggressive, which was delivered as soon as the Arctic Monkeys came onstage. 
After dropping their debut album in 2006, the scrappy and youthful “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What’s I’m Not,” Arctic Monkeys concerts have become known for transforming audiences into dancing, moshing and jumping fans. But with the turn their last album “Humbug” took, it was interesting to find out how they were going to balance their new, matured sound with their playful and witty songs of albums past. 
The band — made up of Alex Turner on lead guitar and vocals, Jaime Cook on guitar, Matt Helders on drums and Nick O’Malley on bass — opened with “Dance Little Liar,” a spooky single from their latest album. Turner crooned into the mic while Helders bashed on the drum kit. Fans swayed back and forth to the song, ready for the concert to unfold. 
As soon as that was over, the Monkeys jammed right into a frenzied rendition of “Brianstorm,” a song about a cool lad named Brian who wears ties with his t-shirts. Baltimore fans went wild, moshing and crowd-surfing to the riotous rock song. It became pandemonium and, in fitting style, the next song was another bass-heavy rock single called “This House Is A Circus.” The lights flashed like thunder on the stage and the audience matched the mood felt throughout the venue. Next was the cheery riff rock “Still Take You Home.” The haunting western-vibed song “Potion Approaching” quickly overtook the show. 
The concert continued to slow down with the equally eerie and romantic new single “Joining the Dots,” another song from “Humbug.” The song was sad and slow, but exciting for fans since the song was just released last month, and was performed with electric guitars rather than acoustic. After playing more songs from “Humbug” like “Crying Lighting” and “My Propeller,” the guys decided to speed things up again with the drum-heavy “The View From the Afternoon.”
This was followed by their very first number one song, “I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor,” an infectious pop number full of Turner’s goofy but witty lyrics. Fans sang along to the words while pushing each other, jumping up and down and spinning around on the dancefloor. Turner’s voice was strong and loud, streaked with his punkish Sheffield accent, while Helders banged away at his kit with a look of vengeance on his face. Cook and O’Malley walked around the stage, sometimes jamming face to face with Helders and Turner. 
One of the standout songs of the concert was the trip-hop power jam “Pretty Visitors.” Turner took off his guitar, grabbed the mic and launched into the rap-style lyrics of the song. The song combined fast rhythms with a slow, organ-filled chorus. It captured the violent mood of the night with Turner singing, “All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms/and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall.” 
The concert came to a close soon after that, with the echoey love ballad “505.”  But after relentless chanting from the audience, the band came back out to perform their classic and melodic “Fluorescent Adolescent,” and the thunderous riff number “The Nettles,” which they elongated for guitar solos, Turner and Helders face to face, jamming out. To end the show, Helders kicked over his drum set, pumped his fists in the air and walked off the stage — like a rock star should — topping off a smashing show with a literal bang.

2010-06-11,AU,club,"Though it becomes dangerous to depend on the home run, it certainly helps when a team’s hitters are hitting them regularly. Last night the Nationals did not mind leaning on the long ball for help as they completed the sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
The Nationals’ first baseman, Adam Dunn, has gone deep three games in a row counting last night’s absolute bomb to give Washington an early 1-0 lead. It is hard to ignore the recent tear Dunn has been on over the course of the last few games.
“We’re still continuing to get good pitching,” Dunn said regarding the team’s recent success. “We had the long ball working for this series.”
All but one of the Nats’ runs in last night’s 4-2 victory came off of home runs. In the same inning as Dunn’s, Josh Willingham hit a solo home run to the red seats in left-center field. It was his 12th of the season and gave starter Livan Hernandez some room to work. 
Manager Jim Riggleman has been seeing improved production out of the middle of the lineup where the power hitters reside.
“They’re good hitters, that’s why they’re in the middle of the lineup,” Riggleman said. “We’re fortunate to have them and lined up together like that we’ve got a chance to put some pressure on the other club.”
The last home run of the night was more of a surprise because it did not come from one of the Nationals’ big bashers, but from Michael Morse. A utility player, Morse does not get much playing time but because Roger Bernadina was filling in at centerfield for Nyjer Morgan, he got an opportunity to start-and he impressed.
“This last home-stand was pretty good with Strasburg coming,” he said. “It gave us a little jump and we’re feeling good.”
Morse reached base in every at-bat of the night. He walked once and got three hits, one of those was a ninth inning bomb to centerfield. It provided an insurance run for Tyler Clippard who performed as interim closer while Matt Capps got the night off after pitching three days straight.
“Whatever inning I pitch, I’m having fun out there,” Clippard said after notching his first save of his career. “Tonight I got the save which is great.”
Besides Clippard’s first career save, the Nats also had help from lefty, Sean Burnett. The left hander went two innings without giving up an earned run. His outing contributed to an excellent string of games from the bullpen where the Washington relievers have gone nine and a third scoreless innings in the last three games.
“It seems like every day a new guy out of our pen steps up,” Clippard said of the recent success of the bullpen. “We got a lot of options out there.”
Riggleman decided to go with Clippard and Burnett tonight in order to give his other relievers some rest before heading on the road.
“I really wanted to give Matt [Capps] at least a night off,” he said. “[Drew] Storen has been up a lot. Storen felt great tonight but I needed him for tomorrow.”
If the Nationals can keep hitting home runs like they have against the Pirates, the bullpen is going to be able to get plenty of rest.

2010-10-12,AU,club,"Friends and family celebrated the life of 2009 AU alumnus Andrew Wolf in a memorial service Oct. 12.
The 23-year-old, who received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from AU’s College of Arts and Sciences, was killed Sept. 16 during a cycling trip in Canada, where he was struck by a tractor trailer, The Eagle previously reported.
The service, sponsored by the Department of Philosophy and Religion, helped the family deal with Wolf’s sudden death.
""When there is a tremendous loss, it’s hard to get your hands around it because there is a deep silence,"" said Robert Wolf, Andrew’s father. ""The memorial fills out that emptiness because there is a shared memory that brings him alive in some way.""
Wolf, of New Jersey, was riding for the Otesha Project, a Canadian charity that promotes sustainable consumption and lifestyle choices through theater, experimental activities and storytelling, according to the project’s website.
Wolf was a member of the project’s Highlands and Islands Tour, a team that cycles across eastern Canada’s Maritime province to encourage youth environmental education, according to the project’s website.
Two other cyclists traveling with Wolf along a four-lane highway sustained minor injuries, according to the website for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Wolf went to Chile in 2008 and wrote his thesis on student social justice in Chile and graduated from AU Magna Cum Laude, NorthJersey.com reported.
Wolf was a chef and educator at Brainfood — a D.C. non-profit organization that reaches teens through food. He also worked in New York for the Children’s Aid Society as a food educator.
Students, staff and faculty joined the Wolf family in remembering Wolf’s time at AU.
Professor Jin Park taught Wolf in a course on Derrida and Buddhism and said she knew at once that he was a philosophy major.
""Andrew was a smart, smart kid, who was going to go to Mexico and work on the food issues,"" Park said. “He was just the most thoughtful person.”
Chris Watson, Wolf’s colleague, who had worked with him on his Fulbright proposal to Mexico described Andrew as someone who had a lot of respect for human dignity.
Shelly Harshe, the administrative assistant of the philosophy and religion department, said Andrew would always stop by her office to catch up.
""He was full of energy and was interested in everything,” Harshe said. “He cared about how I was doing and how my studies were going.”
AU alumna Corina Parkwell, who used to be friends with Andrew, said he ""was enthusiastic and he danced with reckless abandon. Andrew was the sweetest and loveliest guy.”
A philosophy graduate student, Phil Vaughn, Andrew's friend, said Andrew loved hanging in the library and ""everything he did had to do with love.""
""We have heard a lot about his passion, compassion and inquisitive nature,"" said AU Chaplain Rev. Mark Schaefer. “Andrew was someone that saw everything as something precious, so the best way to honor him is by taking what you've learned from Andrew and applying it in your own lives.”
The Rotary Club of Ridegewood A.M. will sponsor a scholarship in Wolf’s name, to be awarded to “community-minded students,” his father Robert Wolf said.

2010-10-12,AU,club,"Edward Norton is the poster boy for character actors everywhere. While most may recognize him as the deranged and radical Tyler Durden from “Fight Club,” Norton manages to stand out amongst Hollywood’s most talented thespians. From playing a skinhead in “American History X” to a revamped Bruce Banner in “The Incredible Hulk,” Norton prides himself on his ability to completely blend into the characters he plays. 
“I don’t really tend to approach [films] thinking about how they interact with me,” Norton said in an interview with The Eagle. “I just am not that interested in splattering myself out there.”
In one of their first big events of the year, ThinkTalk, a D.C.-based television program, and the AU Film Society hosted a Q&A with the famed actor. Students filled up Ward 2 to ask him a couple of their own burning questions, which ranged from asking how life-changing “Fight Club” was to his experience with documentary films. In addition, Norton discussed some films that have personally influenced him, such as Spike Lee’s groundbreaking “Do the Right Thing” and films from Terrence Malick and Milos Forman. 
In his most recent work, “Stone,” Norton plays the titular character, a criminal from Detroit trying to get parole after serving eight years of a fifteen-year jail sentence. Stone is the stereotypical thug, complete with cornrows and a foul mouth. Most of the film takes place inside the office room of Stone’s parole officer, Jack Mabry, played by Robert De Niro. While true Norton fans know that this is not his first film playing a criminal, Norton dispels any queries that “Stone” is an action-packed thriller with a secondary script. 
“There’s no chase scenes and no weapons,” Norton said. “The drama in this film comes from this cork-screwing tension that just evolves in conversation. So if you’re an actor, it’s like, ‘At last — I matter!’”
In order to accurately portray Stone, Norton and “Stone” director John Curran traveled to prison facilities just north of Detroit to research exactly how they should model Stone.
“A lot of the people we were interested in were coming out of the gang and drug culture in southwest Detroit ... John and I spent a lot of time mining what they said and transferring it over into the script,” Norton said. “Literally, for the sound of my voice, there was this one guy in particular we met who had a very broken, gravelly, strange sort of voice. John and I both found it very hypnotic.”
Along the course of the film, Stone discovers religion, which changes the entire theme of the movie. It is not solely about spiritual awakening, but rather about dealing with morals and convictions. It was not a personal application for Norton, so much as it was for Curran. 
“To me, the specifics of what Stone gets into are beside the point,” Norton said. “What I liked was that John was aiming at opening up the question of ‘how does one assert that there’s only one way for a person to achieve illumination?’ Or one text, or one notion of how we communicate with the divine or get a sense of the divine?”	
Norton was truly inspired by Curran’s take on directing and his opportunity to have a very hands-on role in the development of this film. As an actor for the past 12  years, Norton has amassed a wealth of knowledge about the film industry that he is keen to share with others. 
“I think that people coming up now need to push against the model in their own ways. I would tell filmmakers to take inspiration from Radiohead and what they did, self-releasing their record to people. I’m excited to see how people leave the film distribution industry behind and stop worrying about how they’re going to find a way to get embraced by the mainstream, because that model’s going to be dead someday, sure as the record industry is going to be dead.” 
This advice is something that Norton lives by, having produced and directed “Keeping the Faith” himself, as well as producing eight other films and documentaries. His accomplishments even caught the eye of  the White House, and Norton was appointed to serve in the Committee on the Arts and Humanities alongside such actors as Forrest Whittaker and Sarah Jessica Parker.
“We’re there to advise the President on policy decisions about where to allocate funds for the most effectiveness. One project recognizes and awards small after school arts programs that work with at-risk kids. So, within our budget we give these awards to about two dozen groups per year,” Norton said. 
It’s clear that the multi-talented actor has tried his hand at a number of different careers, succeeding at whatever he works on. “Stone” is out in theaters everywhere.

2010-10-12,AU,club,"With only one album to their name, London natives The xx performed like seasoned pros at the 9:30 club on the chilly night of Oct. 5. The reigning indie cool kids reflected the themes of minimalism and intimacy on their 2009 self-titled debut album in their mature, refined performance, seducing the sold-out crowd.
Vocalists Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim breathed the sensual lyrics, almost as if the audience was eavesdropping on an exchange between lovers — if those lovers were inexplicably hip, had matching haircuts and outfits, and were followed around by an MPC sampler played by Jamie Smith. The nearly pitch-black 9:30 — save for the artsy, bright backlighting, “xx” on the MPC booth, and a strobe “x” backdrop — created a chilling atmosphere that perfectly complimented Smith’s cool, crisp beats, Croft’s catchy guitar melodies and Sim’s rolling bass lines.
Starting off the set with the appropriate “Intro,” a drum ‘n’ bass-based intro of its own, xx set the tone that this show would be a slightly tweaked version of their album. With only 12 songs, the setlist was a jumbled version of the album’s tracklist, featuring covers of Womack & Womack’s “Teardrops” and Robin S.’s “Show Me Love.” The xx shined on “Show Me Love;” the lighter, dancier feel worked well against the more subdued original tracks.
Excited gasps came from the otherwise reserved audience within the opening notes of more popular songs “Crystalised,” “Basic Space,” “Vcr” and “Islands.” Minor tweaks like a slowed, a cappella end to “Basic Space” and extra dance beats in several songs were fantastic additions that helped break a too-close adhesion to their album’s sound.
A chilling, creepy side to “Fantasy” was revealed live, but the standouts were closing songs, “Night Time” and “Infinity.” Smith’s additions with the MPC sampler and drum machine brought “Night Time” to life and gave the song a driving, building feel that proved why The xx has earned so much hype in the past two years. Finale “Infinity” started off with a yearning intro of the call-response “Give it up / I can’t give it up” between the crooning Sim and cooing Croft. The same back and forth section at the end of the song was predictably prolonged, powerfully building to the end of the cool, jamming set.
Croft, Sim and Smith played a one-song encore, “Stars,” with a newly-lit background to match. Despite not being the strongest song in the set, “Stars” perfectly summed up the show: sexy, chill and a notch above the quality of the album.

2011-01-11,AU,club,"Queers and Allies dropped its opposition to an Undergraduate Senate bill passed last semester concerning AU ROTC students, now that the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy has been repealed.
The Nov. 21, 2010 bill recommended the administration look into making changes to policies that currently deny AU ROTC cadets group access to AU fitness facilities for physical training and prohibit use of AUTO vans for ROTC transportation, among other things.
Last month congress voted to repeal DADT, a 17-year-old policy that banned openly gay and lesbian service members from serving in the military. President Barack Obama later signed the repeal bill into law.
Queers and Allies originally opposed the Student Government bill because it ignored DADT altogether, stating the issue was about student equality at AU, not sexual orientation. 
“You can’t ignore the fact the SG is requesting expanded resources for an organization that discriminates against a significant number of AU students,” said Queers and Allies President Tonei Glavinic in November. 
Brett Atanasio, the chairman of the SG committee, said while the repeal of DADT is key to eliminating any student opposition to the bill’s recommendations, administrative hurdles still remain. 
The bill calls for athletic facilities to be open to ROTC cadets for physical fitness training, that ROTC be allowed to use AUTO vans and that required Military Science classes for cadets be allowed to be held on campus if classroom space is available.
“With DADT gone, [administrative procedure] will be the main obstacle in the way of things like AUTO access and club status for ROTC,” Atanasio said in an e-mail.
The administration is already clearing the way for ROTC, and cadets will be allowed to use athletic facilities this semester, according to Phyllis Peres, the vice provost and interim dean for Academic Affairs, The Eagle previously reported.
Cadets will also be able to take military science classes at AU if space is available.
After communication between Atanasio and Queers and Allies to address concerns and the repeal of DADT, Glavinic said Queers and Allies now backs the SG bill. 
“Queers and Allies will look forward to working with SG leaders to make sure that this program is able to support students participating in it an appropriate way,” Glavinic said. 
Atanasio is also meeting with George Washington University Student Association President Jason Lifton to help the GWSA to make similar changes to its ROTC policy.

2011-02-08,AU,club,"Valentine’s Day is coming fast upon us, and its coming is inexplicably linked with love songs. Musicians have been singing about the boy-meets-girl conundrum for as long as pop music has existed, and in the spirit of Valentine’s Day, here are some quality love songs of past and present:
Bright Eyes — “First Day of My Life”
Even if your soul is as black as the night, this song’s unabashed beauty will still make you cry. Conor Obsest’s fragile voice coupled with heartbreakingly gorgeous lyrics make for one of the best love songs of recent memory and one quintessential for Valentine’s Day. 
The Smiths — “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out”
If you scoff at romance and prefer your love songs served with an edge (or on the “500 Days of Summer” soundtrack), this masterpiece by the Smiths more than suffices. Besides, nothing says “Happy Valentine’s Day!” like promising your lover a tandem death.
The Flaming Lips — “Do You Realize??”
It’s a sweeping love song that serves as the perfect anthem for Valentine’s Day (and for the other 364 days of the year, too). It’s about the brevity of life, the scope of the universe and the simple joy of seeing the smile of someone you love.
Ben Gibbard — “You Remind Me Of Home”
 “I Will Follow You Into The Dark” has been inexplicably ruined by every wannabe Jason Mraz with an acoustic guitar, so if you like romance accompanied by soft strumming and earnest vocals, dig a little deeper with this song from Death Cab For Cutie lead singer Ben Gibbard. He’s married to Zooey Deschanel, so he must know some valuable secret about wooing the ladies. 
The Beach Boys — “God Only Knows”
Probably the best love song ever written, the Beach Boys say it all on “God Only Knows”. It’s a song about eternal love, plain and simple. If you listen to just one song this Valentine’s Day, make it this the one.
Anti-Valentine’s Songs
If sentimentality and feeling aren’t on your Valentine’s agenda, you’re in luck. Almost as common in music as the themes of love and affection are rejection, anger, bitterness and dismissal. A brief selection of the very best anti-Valentine’s Day songs is below.
Weezer — “Pink Triangle”
Boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy discovers that girl likes other girls. “Pink Triangle” is the best song ever written about finding out your crush isn’t interested in you — or member of your gender, for that matter.
Kanye West — “Gold Digger”
The title is self-explanatory. Kanye puts a nail in the coffin of romance, trashing the ubiquitous money-hungry female of hip-hop culture. It’s a perfect song for anyone tired of blowing all their free cash on an ungrateful significant other
Sufjan Stevens — “Casimir Pulaski Day” 
If you prefer a weepier Valentine’s Day, look no further than this tearjerker from Sufjan to tear your heart into tiny shreds. A tale of a girl stricken with bone cancer, this song is perfect for spending the holiday with your Kleenex box.
OutKast — “Ms. Jackson” 
What anti-Valentine’s Day would be complete without OutKast’s ode to the beloved mother of one of their baby mamas? Thanks, Andre 3000, for teaching us the true meaning of chivalry. 
R. Kelly — “Real Talk”
An R&B classic, R. Kelly lashes out at his lady in the most hilarious way possible — over the phone with as much drama and riffing as possible. Perfect for any jaded listener who’s killed a few relationships by creeping at the club, or goaded an ex-lover with relish to burn all his or her clothing.
Bob Dylan — “Like A Rolling Stone” 
The best diss track of all time features Dylan mocking an ex-flame fallen from grace. This Valentine’s Day, though it may be tempting to trash your previous lovers via College ACB, take Dylan’s lead and and compile an eloquent litany against your ex, mocking them for their misdeeds.
The Beatles — “Norwegian Wood” 
John Lennon knew how to treat a lady correctly: pay her a visit, sleep in her bathtub, and then light her house on fire when she leaves for work the next day. It really doesn’t get any less romantic than this. Happy V-Day, Yoko.

2011-02-08,AU,club,"Today’s incarnation of Valentine’s Day is a holiday created by greeting card companies. The plump image of Cupid, the mass-produced cards and the silly hearts on candies are so shallow and superficial that it’s nauseating. Anti-Valentine’s Day celebrations are a part of a growing movement against the hypocritical holiday of Saint Valentine’s. 
Whether you’re single or part of a couple, there are plenty of ways to enjoy yourself on Valentine’s Day without subjecting yourself to the lovey-dovey details.
Go sight-seeing
Honestly, it’s probably one of the most un-romantic things you can do in D.C. Even in the chilly winter weather, there will be no limit to the sweaty and loud tourists who accompany you to the Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial. The setting may seem picturesque, but in a place as public as the National Mall, no traces of romantic intrigue can be found. D.C. couples will most likely stick to the exclusive, local areas. If Valentine’s Day is all about “intimacy,” go in the opposite direction. Take pictures, wear fanny packs, and just obnoxiously point at our beloved national monuments.
Throw an Anti-Valentine Party
Decorate your dorm with black paper hearts. Serve bowls full of broken heart candy. Vandalize pictures of adorable celebrity couples (mustaches and pirate teeth never get old). Buy a heart-shaped piñata and smash the hell out of it. Make T-shirts. Tell date stories gone wrong over a fake campfire. 
What better way to spend the day of love than hanging out with close friends while blasting anti-love songs? There is no end to the fun that can be had in mocking of people who celebrate Valentine’s Day.
Find your inner guy
Sometimes there’s nothing better to drown out the mush and love than to kick back in your PJ’s and watch some explosions and gunfire. The Bourne Trilogy is a good pick if you’re feeling intellectual. If you’re in the mood to drown out your feelings, rent a “Transformers” movie. It doesn’t matter which one. 
If you get tired of zoning out in front of the TV screen, bust out the video games. Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros or Madden are great group games. If you feel like playing solo, grab the RPG’s or shooter games.
Have a girl’s/guy’s night out
There are plenty of clubs and restaurants having themed nights either before or on Valentine’s Day bitter singles. D.C. clubs are always a good place to loosen up and, if you want, meet other singles, especially since most doting couples are stuck in crowded, formal restaurants. Or go to a restaurant like Co Co Sala in Penn Quarter which is hosting its own “Anti V-Day” party on February 10. 
If you’re part of a couple that doesn’t feel like doing the candle-lit dinner, head over to Ben’s Chili Bowl, or even a random hot dog stand and dig into some greasy food. If you really want to make a point, make it an eating competition. There’s simply no limit to the ways in which you can celebrate your own Anti-Valentine’s Day.

2011-02-13,AU,club,"On Feb. 2, Gregg Gillis – better known by his stage name Girl Talk – held one of his famous dance parties at the 9:30 club playing his unique brand of electronic mash-up music.
Opening for Girl Talk was the New York-based, electro-pop band Penguin Prison. 
Unfortunately, while the name inspires thoughts of wonder, the music did not.
Penguin Prison, the project of front man Chris Glover, delivers a full sampling of generic ‘80s disco-pop. If this type of music happens to appeal to you, Penguin Prison will be just what the doctor ordered — otherwise it would be better to steer clear of the band. While Glover did create some dynamic rhythmic structures with his amusing Michael Jackson-esque vocals, the songs were lacking any sort of melodic hook or musical inventiveness 
However, Glover’s hyped-up, quirky stage presence partially made up for what was lacking in the music. Between songs, he would awkwardly inspire the crowd with such endearing lines as, “Washington, D.C.! Yeah! Taxation without representation! You need to get yourselves some representation!”
While Penguin Prison failed to live up to its marvelous band name, all was forgiven once Girl Talk took to the stage. From the opening Clara sample that begins Girl Talk’s first album, “Night Ripper,” the crowd was at ease, submitting to the journey on which they were soon taken.
Though Gillis has become famous for his finely produced mash-up albums, his ability to create live mixes appears to have increased with fame. Taking samples from a wide range of genres, Gillis makes all music appealing to everyone. In the words of one student who attended the concert, “Only at Girl Talk would it be okay to listen to an Annie Lennox and Lil’ Wayne duet.”
Girl Talk’s concerts are essentially giant dance parties with an audience as diverse as the samples. Using confetti, balloons, beach balls and a giant screen to project a beautifully crafted light show, Gillis creates an energetic and festive atmosphere in which one can’t help but bust a move. 
Gillis attempted to end the show with an inspiring, beat-driven version of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” but the crowd demanded more. The encore was, as Gillis put it, “experimental” and proved his talents as an expert improviser. 
Though the opening act brought the concert to a sluggish start, Gillis’ masterful mash-ups and party works lifted the audience to highs previously unknown.

2011-03-11,AU,club,"• I have a great boyfriend at AU ... there's hope ladies (and gents)!
• Just because we aren't on the quiet floor doesn't mean you have to yell.
• The guys who play hockey every Tuesday and Friday night on the Quad are so hot!
• I accidentally found something rude my roommate said about me online. For someone that everyone thinks is exceedingly nice, you sure are inconsiderate. I have lost all respect for you.
• Dear ""The Mudbox Should Sell Pens,”
Just so you know they give away free library pens at basically all of the help desks on the first floor.
Enjoy :)
• The recent waxiness of the tavern cups is unacceptable.  My Coke tastes like crayons.
• Employees of the Tavern: Smile! We're nice people. We're just hungry!
Diners at the Tavern: Treat the employees with some respect! They deserve it for putting up with our attitude every time they're overloaded with customers. 
• A housing lottery for students that inherently discriminates against those of us who have to work full-time jobs to pay for our education: if it's not in violation of some law or school code, it should be.
• I was in an GOVT class tonight and about 10 people had bottled waters in the class, including the teacher. STOP using bottled water. TAP WATER IS JUST AS GOOD. STOP WASTING PLASTIC! Am I the only one who notices this? Oh, and after you savor your beloved FIJI bottled water ... put it in the recycling! (it is only 2 feet away from the garbage)
• Dear resident who thinks that he/she owns the place,
Keep in mind that you share the floor with 50/60 other residents. We're sick of seeing your crap in the bathroom, in the kitchen (ALL over the counter drying or stacked up in the sink), and seeing the laundry room as your own closet. It's a bit much, and we're all sick of it. And your habits of you leaving your crap everywhere.
Sincerely, 
Tired of dealing with your stuff
• Dear Prohibition. I am tired of letting you get me down! Please leave. No one wants you here, and Intoxication is much more exciting friend, even if they're a bit sloppy in bed.
• ""Come on, let's get some Times New Roman, Helvetica, or even Papyrus, if the department insists on having some fun with it.""
Papyrus is even more of an abomination than Comic Sans. Helvetica all the way!
• Awkward kids need lovin' too.
• I am proud to be a Wonk, and I will never deny it. 
• The food offerings at AU are pathetic. Get rid of Bon Appetit. I feel for the people working there (I worked in service for a long time) but they seem miserable and are angry most of the time. That, on top of really shitty and unhealthy food, is enough to make me want to check out GWU or Georgetown.
• Dear Tall Undergrad Guy in the gym: STOP walking around with a scowl on your face. It makes you look weak, especially since you’re not even THAT built.
• Can we stop judging each other based on wealth, putting people down for being ""rich kids"" or ""poor kids""? We all work hard, and I'm sure all of our parents work hard. Different upbringings do bring about different attitudes, but aren't we supposed to be in college learning our true attitudes, away from the comforts of home? Lay off!
• OIT needs to get it together. I got kicked off the Internet [I'm in Starbucks right now] for something I didn't do [I called them, they told me someone downloaded ""Tropic Thunder"" on my account. Never seen it, no interest. Wasn't me]. So I went to OIT yesterday at 3:00 and I was told they wouldn't be back from their meeting until 4:30. So I came back then, and they just never showed up, since they end work at 5:00. So I went at 3:00 today, and the girl at the desk basically told me they were gone for the day and I should come back tomorrow ""around 10 or 11 because that's when they're almost always here.""
Okay then, fine OIT. Just don't post on your sign that you're around 9:00-5:00 if you're not. I don't like having to go to Starbucks to get my lecture notes off blackboard.
• Oh dubstep, where have you been all my life.  HW just got that much cooler. womp womp womp womp
EDITOR’S NOTE: Rant a few good dubstep songs please!
• @ the comic sans ranter...there is a whole website/movement dedicated to the proposed death of this font.  Google it.
Dear AU Central: I hate your e-mail ticket system. I have a request, I send it to you. I get a nameless, one-sentence reply. And your e-mail bot says my question is answered! Solved! And that my ""service request"" is now closed. Well, I asked a question about the same damn ticket after your inane reply, and what have I gotten back? Nothing. Let me talk to a REAL PERSON, AU Central.
• To the ranter who outlined 3 reasons why WONK sucks.
1-You are right
2-the whole fear the turtle thing makes so much sense! I thought that was such a dumb campaign too!
3-You are right
• Whoever said that likealittle is the new Eagle Rants was seriously disturbed.
• To the person ranting about the girl coughing in class: It's not being selfish! Some people don't have staying home when they're sick as an option! You're the selfish one!
• Founder's Ball changed my life in a very real, very fundamental way. Thank you SG and RHA!
• I don't use aderall either, and I don't understand people who do use who don't have ADD/ADHD. It feels like cheating. It's called self-control and self-discipline. Maybe instead of leaving everything to the last minute, y’all could learn how to balance a social life, work, and classes like I do. It's really not that hard. I hope real life kicks your asses.
Whenever someone tells me they're thinking of going to AU, I tell them if they're not going for SIS, then don't bother. It's not worth the price tag, administration, registrar problems, health-center fails and general disregard for students here. We're second to money. It secretly makes me very happy.
• The Dav has one dubstep song on their playlist.  It makes my day every time I hear it.
• I just got a book report assigned to me for the first time since about fifth grade.  The kicker? It's for an upper level philosophy class.
• Where did all the Tabasco Sauce in The Tavern go?
How can one attempt to enjoy a turkey cheesesteak without it?
• Dear Housing and Dining,
Thanks for putting me in a triple in the squalid shack you call Letts Hall this year and then refusing me priority housing over all the freshman for next year. I'm super excited that I get to live in the dungeons of Anderson Terrace while some frosh gets to live on 6.
Sincerely, 
Rising sophomore
P.S. TDR is overpriced, the only good things about it are Kevin, Christine, and waffle fries.
• To the people complaining about the wonk campaign-
Get over it. They spent the money and it's here whether anyone likes it or not. It's not like anyone outside of D.C. (or really anyone who doesn't pay attention to metro ads) knows anything about what a wonk is or its association to AU.
• Dear Kosher Boy,
I am sorry that I always steal your kosher box lunches, and I feel guilty when I do. But, I am obsessed with the pastrami sandwich! Nomnomnom
• omigawd people have too much time on their hands if they complain about trash cans in an academic building. Pockets, fellow students, pockets.
• There is no reason for anyone to make a movie about ""The Great Gatsby."" It'll be 90 minutes of a pink car and a green light (not in the same scene).
• AU, FIX THE RODENT PROBLEM.
• I don't want to go to classes anymore. I want to travel to London and become a famous underground dubstep dj. Upon my overexposure I will head to Rio where I will be a successful bikini model. After that, I will become disillusioned by my fame and move to New Zealand's lush country side where I will work at a cheese producing farm. I will then return to the U.S. and finish my education in Southern California. Next I will start an unprecedented franchise of quality Italian food in SoCal so they can know how pasta is done. I will return to my native New York and live in Carol Gardens and lead a happy life with my family. But right now, I need to study for my midterm tomorrow.
• It was so extremely unprofessional and offensive to put Michelle Rhee on a ""panel"" with AU undergrads who played dress up career day and pretended to be experts. That made AU look so bad.
• I'm so tired of smokers polluting my lungs with poison. AU students for a healthy campus unite! Fight for a campus wide vote to ban smoking from campus. Hundreds of college across the country have done it, from private schools to public schools to community colleges. We can do it too. Fight for your right to clean air!
• Wow Roosevelt Institute, really? You had two hours to fix the sound on the “Waiting for Superman” movie showing and you gave up after 10 minutes. Wow. Thanks for ruining the movie, as no one could hear it since you didn't bother turning up the volume.
• I came to the event to hear Michelle Rhee speak, as the advertisement said. I didn't come to hear AU freshmen pretend to be on the same level of educational knowledge as her. That was so embarrassing and awkward for everyone at the event.
• Dear Eagle Ranters,
DAVENPORT LOVES ITS CUSTOMERS. seriously. you all are wonderful. whether you're coming in for your usual double shot long or your peppermint mocha, or your skim sugar-free chai, we love you. and your loyal business. (and when you compliment our jewelry once in a while)
• To the two girls and one guy in the basement of the library: It is Thursday night and you keep complaining about how you can't finish your Georgetown cupcakes that are sitting on your table. I haven't had dinner. Get out of here.
• Why is Today@AU advertising ""spring break storage""? Are our dorm rooms and our stuff in those dorm rooms not going to be there when spring break is over? Why would everyone not just leave their stuff in their rooms? WTF
• Dear Roosevelt Institute,
Inviting a prominent speaker to campus is no excuse to hijack her talk and spam everyone at the event with wasted paper advertisements of your club. Not classy.
• I got into all the medical schools I applied to, but I don't want to go to medical school anymore.  I have no idea how I am going to tell my parents. I'm scared they won't love me anymore.
• I miss my puppy!
• I love, love, love this school. I love the classes. I love all them campus events. I love all the student clubs. I love the professors. I love the food. I love the city.
• 1 class, 20 kids, 3 boys, 1 is gay, 1 is a douche. Go AU!
• Did you really just take the shuttle from South side to North side?
• Eaglesecure still sucks. In fact, sometimes Eaglenet even works BETTER than eaglesecure. :(
• Regarding the March 1 article on a smoking ban: Until they legalize weed, leave cigarette smokers alone. You choose to be a WONK, I choose to smoke a cigarette between my 5 classes, 2 internships and job.
• I hate acting stupid in class but not realizing it until it's beyond way too late. I am eternally embarresed.
• here comes another library rant to the obnoxious loudmouths. Are the five of you really that oblivious that NONE of you notice the entire floor glaring at you?! It's louder here than the mcdowell 6 lounge at 3am. And that is saying something.
• Perhaps more people would run for SG class & school council seats if a) the stinking credits rule was eliminated, so that I could actually run for the class council that I'm a member of, and b) if we actually saw class and school councils doing anything.
• Coming soon, my new novel: How to Anonymously Ruin Student Government Elections for Fun and Profit. Based on the true events of March 2010.
• Dear Roommate,
Why is your music so loud!? Turn it down! Geez! I'm being considerate and wearing headphones, yet I can't hear anything because your music is so loud. You can listen to it without headphones, I guess, but at least TURN IT DOWN SO IT DOESN'T BLAST MY EAR DRUMS. Are you deaf!?
Sincerely,
Roommate who is afraid to confront you because you anger easily
• Conspiracy theory: Housing & Dining wants to dump all of the freshmen into Letts Hall so that they can convince all of them to move off-campus, thereby solving AU's housing crisis.
• AU Men's Basketball,
Thank you for an awesome season!  It has been a pleasure going to your games and cheering you guys on.  You make me proud to be an Eagle.
• I have no idea what I want to major in, much less what I want to do with said major, and I'm really scared that I've wasted my time, money, and my parent's money to figure this out.
• Dear Dav worker, my keychain is for my convenience, not yours. Please pour my coffee like you get paid to do and then refrain from talking to me.
• I believe I have the most difficult jobs at AU, explaining the stupid ""neighborhood parking policy"". OMG! WE ALL HATE IT! I'm tired of telling people why they were cited in their own neighborhood. I'm sick of getting cursed at, yelled at and hung up on. Why do we even have such a policy??? And to the tiny old lady who keeps tattle tailing on people parked in the neighborhood, GET A LIFE! Stop calling us to make our lives terrible ... That is all.
• TDR needs fish and chips. Actually, the AU campus needs fish and chips.

2011-07-03,AU,club,"The Nationals had an unlikely hero in their 2-1 win against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 1, as Matt Stairs, whose batting average is still in the .100s, hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth inning. The win also was the first for new Nationals’ manager Davey Johnson, who took over as manager on Monday.
The Pirates picked up their only run of the game in the top of the third inning when Pirates’ left fielder Alex Presley hit into a fielder’s choice at first base, scoring catcher Michael McKenry. 
Nats’ center fielder Roger Bernadina hit his fifth home run of the season in the bottom of the sixth to tie the ballgame at one.
Matt Stairs came off the bench in the bottom of the ninth, with men on the corners and only one out, and hit a shot off the wall in right field to end the game.
“He [Stairs] swung the bat pretty good out in L.A. and he’s still not quite 100 percent, but that looked like 100 percent right there,” Johnson said. “Twenty-five guys gotta contribute if you’re gonna win, and I have all the confidence in the world if you’re on the club I’m gonna use you.”
Nats’ starter Tom Gorzelanny pitched seven innings, allowing one unearned run and striking out eight Pirate batters. While Gorzelanny pitched well enough to win the game, the offense could not help him. Johnson gave him every opportunity to obtain the victory, but it just didn’t happen.
That is something Johnson says he will do more than former manager Jim Riggleman did, give his pitchers an opportunity to win.
“They’re gonna get a little longer leash with me. I’m expecting more out of them,” Johnson said. “I go the extra yard for them. I want them to know that. I want to give them the opportunity to win. Unfortunately we didn’t get it for him [Gorzelanny], but he won the game for us, gave us a quality start.”

2011-07-05,AU,club,"It was a crazy finish for the Nationals on Independence Day as they beat the Chicago Cubs 5-4 on a rare walk-off wild pitch that allowed right fielder Jayson Werth to score the winning run.
Unlike Sunday’s game against the Pirates, it was the Nationals who struck first, scoring a pair of runs in the bottom of the first inning off back-to-back singles by Laynce Nix and Werth.
But the Cubs got one back the next inning when, after a one-out triple by first baseman Carlos Pena, center fielder Marlon Byrd singled to make it a 2-1 game. 
They then took the lead in the top of the fourth inning with men on first and third and two outs, Cubs’ left fielder Alfonso Soriano hit a routine fly ball to right center field that somehow dropped between center fielder Roger Bernadina and Weth in right, allowing both base runners to score. Not only did it cost the Nats two runs, it cost starting pitcher Jordan Zimmerman the chance to earn the win.
“Those things can’t happen on good ball clubs and I’m sure it won’t happen again,” Nationals’ Manager Davey Johnson said. “It was really tough on Zim. Zim still battled back, pitched a heck of a ballgame, but he should have won that ballgame.”  
Chicago picked up another run in the top of the sixth when catcher Geovany Soto hit a single with the bases loaded and two outs, but the Nationals stopped the damage as Werth threw Pena out at home.
Werth continued his strong day in the bottom of the sixth, grounding out to first base to allow Nix to score following a triple in the previous at bat.
Nix had a big game as well, walking with the bases loaded in the bottom of the seventh to tie the game.
The game remained tied until the tenth inning when Werth walked to lead off the inning. Johnson then decided to pinch hit with pitcher Livan Hernandez because of his ability to sacrifice bunt, which he did successfully. Werth then stole third base and came around to score on a wild pitch a few pitches later, and the Nationals were victorious.  
While the win was encouraging, this is not the way that Johnson likes to score runs. He said he much prefers home runs to sacrifice bunts. But right now, he’s taking runs any way he can get them.
“It’s really not a good comfort zone for me quite yet,” Johnson said. “I think we’re a much better ball club than that, and I’m sure we’ll show it in the second half.”

2011-07-07,AU,club,"The Nationals took game two of a four-game series against the Chicago Cubs July 5. With the win, the worst that Washington can do now is a series split.
 The Nats scored three runs in the bottom of the first inning, as the first three batters all hit singles, but no runs. Left fielder Laynce Nix then hit a routine groundball to Cubs’ second baseman Jeff Baker, who promptly threw the ball well over the head of the shortstop Darwin Barney to allow two runs to score. Catcher Wilson Ramos hit an infield single three batters later to score third baseman Ryan Zimmerman. 
Chicago got two runs back in the top of the sixth as Aramis Ramirez, who was named player of the week earlier in the day, hit a two-run home run to left field to cut the Nats’ lead to 3-2. But that would be the final score as the Nationals’ bullpen threw three and two-thirds innings of shutout ball.
Nationals’ lefty Ross Detwiler made the spot start on Tuesday because the team played a double-header against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday, leaving the Nats’ pitching staff shorthanded. Considering that the Cubs are a team full of right-handed bats, Detwiler had a very solid outing.
“He pitched a great ballgame,” Nats’ Manager Davey Johnson said. “They’re a good offensive club and they wear out lefthanders. He made quality pitches all night.” 
Even though Washington has won the first two games of the series, Johnson is still not happy with the production on offense. And the player who best personifies the team’s struggles is right fielder Jayson Werth, who signed with the team for seven years and $126 million last offseason. After going 0-4 on Tuesday with two strikeouts, Werth is hitting .221 with 10 home runs, 30 RBIs and a .328 OBP. On top of that, Nats fans are beginning to boo him. 
“I think he’s bottomed out,” Johnson said. “I thought he was in a good frame of mind the last three or four days. I think he’s comfortable … He’s a heck of a ballplayer, and I know he’s gonna start doing things he’s capable of doing.”

And they will need him to. Werth has the potential to impact the rest of the lineup in a positive way when he is right. Unfortunately for the Nationals though, he’s been wrong for most of the year.

2011-07-08,AU,club,"The Washington Nationals beat the Chicago Cubs 5-4 July 6, their third straight win against the Cubs.
Roger Bernadina led off the game with an infield hit to short. Second Baseman Danny Espinosa hit his 16th home run of the season as the Nats’ second batter of the game, putting Washington up by two.
But the Cubs got those runs right back as first baseman Carlos Pena hit a two-run shot of his own in the top of the second, his 18th homer of the 2011 campaign.
The third two-run homer of the night was hit by Ryan Zimmerman in the bottom of the fifth to give the Nationals a 4-2 lead.
Zimmerman had a huge night offensively, going 3-4 with a walk and two RBIs.
“He’s been swing the bat good,” Nats’ Manager Davey Johnson said. “The whole ballclub looked sharper today.” 
The lead would be short-lived however, as Chicago tied things up in the top of the sixth via — get this — a two-run home run, this time off the bat of third baseman Aramis Ramirez.
The Nats finally scored a run on something other than a home run in the bottom of the seventh as catcher Wilson Ramos laid down a bunt on a suicide squeeze with Michael Morse breaking from third to give Washington a 5-4 lead. Once again, the Nationals bullpen did its job, allowing zero runs over three innings.
According to Johnson, this was the first time in his managerial career that he called for a suicide squeeze. He is far from a small ball manager. Bunting in Johnson’s mind is a wasted out. But with the way the offense has produced recently, he has had to be creative to try and score runs. The Nationals’ skipper described his recent creativity like only he can, saying, “You’ve got to open the Cracker Jack box.”
The Nationals look for the four-game sweep tomorrow, when they’ll send Livan Hernandez to the mound to face Cubs’ starter Matt Garza.

2011-08-12,AU,club,"Though public officials reached a deal on the debt ceiling Aug. 2, many student government presidents from across the country are unhappy with the deal.
Before the agreement was made, more than 120 student government presidents from 40 states, including AU Student Government President Tim McBride, signed a letter demanding Congress come up with a solution to raise the national debt ceiling and prevent the U.S. government from defaulting on its loans.
The letter, asking “Do We Have a Deal Yet,” says the student government presidents support the proposals of the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Gang of Six, a group of senators containing three Republicans and three Democrats. There are no particular provisions of those recommendations the group supports, but it does urge congressmen to accept a “bipartisan framework,” according to Andy MacCracken, executive director of the D.C. Student Alliance and former SG president.
Now that a default has been avoided, the group is disappointed the deal includes the founding of a commission to continue to debate debt reduction that is tasked with finding more cuts by November. 
“It’s very unfortunate that our leaders kicked the can down the road even farther,” MacCracken said. 
Though the group has no “grandiose” ideas that their opinions will suddenly cause bipartisan cooperation on the Hill, a few of the students, including MacCracken, were granted a conference call with President Obama and members of his staff on July 26 and a meeting with staff in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office on Aug. 1 regarding the letter.
“That speaks volumes to the impact we’ve already started to have,” MacCracken said.
Student leaders will continue to advocate to members of the new commission to reduce the deficit. 
They want politicians to focus “on what the ramifications are going to be for the next generation as opposed to what short-term benefits might be for the next election,” MacCracken said.
The student presidents’ main hope is to encourage students to get involved and take a stand on debt negotiations by calling their representatives or senators and getting their opinion heard, McBride said.
Some of those student government presidents held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. July 21, garnering media attention from CNN, NPR, ABC, FOX, and the Huffington Post.
“We’re not telling our leaders what to do,” MacCracken said. “We’re just telling them to lead.”
The difference between this lobbying group and others is that they are not asking for favors, according to McBride, who signed the letter July 12. Instead, these student leaders are still looking for a deal that will not bankrupt the country that some of these students will one day lead.
“We have a unique message that needed to be heard,” McBride said.
As Obama echoed in the conference call, students have the most to lose from any failed debt reduction negotiations. 
“Young people will shoulder the consequences of gridlock during a time that requires bold action,” the letter reads. “Your decisions will determine what kind of country we will inherit.”

2011-11-08,AU,club,"Women are attracted to washboard abs. They just are, practically all of them. 
I could include some disclaimer that I’m referring mostly to straight women and that I can’t say ‘all’ about anything (suppose I just did), but let’s be real. To claim the eye candy that is Brad Pitt’s “Fight Club” body is not something women salivate over is like denying you picked up the paper only for the Rants (and me, of course).
I shared this thought matter-of-factly a couple weeks ago at our Men of Strength Meeting. 
I didn’t anticipate a controversy, but I might as well have stated, “Murdering puppies can be fun, but only when done in moderation.” 
Immediately, I was put on defense, swatting away criticisms from my friends in the group. Feminists ain’t no monolith I tell ya. 
Many of our discussions focus on the manipulating process of socialization, through which we learn and acquire our norms and values from outside sources. 
For better or worse, we’re constantly encountering signals that betray our inner instincts. Whether we succumb to them or not, we should always be aware they’re lurking. 
Not only do I believe women fawn over six-pack abs, I don’t think they individually can control it. It’s innate, and only countered through the manipulating process of socialization.
For example, take military training. Most recruits who join the forces aren’t blood-lusting sadists. In fact, studies like the one by S.L.A. Marshall have demonstrated that, historically, many soldiers never fired their weapon directly at an enemy. 
Not until recruits are inundated with rigorous training, normalized violence and an emphasis on “shoot first-ask questions later” have troops been able to overcome their aversion to taking another’s life.  
Think about it this way, if people were so innately violent and killing others was natural, why go through the indoctrinating process of training men and women to be killers?
The only way commanders can get their troops to comport with their abhorrent expectations is by countering human nature through socialization. 
The power of socialization is grand, and I don’t contest its efficacy. In fact, my larger point was not about women liking six-packs. It was that, increasingly, women are starting to claim (startlingly) they don’t like abs, as a result of this incredible power of socialization.
Take a cursory glance at popular sit-coms and you’ll find plenty of shows with an out-of-shape husband or boyfriend. With few exceptions, the women remain svelte and sexy. Shows like “The King of Queens,” “Family Guy” “According to Jim,” stuff with Jason Segal, etc.  
Initially, I thought this was awful for men. Why do men have to be portrayed as overweight knuckleheads, constantly outdone by thinner and wittier wives?  
But the more I think about it, the more I find it exonerates rather than confines men. 
The men who write these shows are a clever bunch. They’re enabling men (probably not unlike themselves), who otherwise have no shot with a stunning female, to have the best of both worlds. They get to remain pudgy and disheveled and still hit the aesthetical jackpot. 
Their heftiness is depicted as endearing. Watch these lovable lugs long enough and they’ll wear you down and you’ll see past the rolls and lethargy. A little beer gut is cute, right ladies?
Stop nodding. Cut it out. You’re missing the point. 
Maybe I’m reading too much into this, but I think this pop culture is used as a ploy to render this inequity between the sexes trite.
A deliberate byproduct of these shows is that women accept men for their flaws, while women remain flawless. This is all cloaked in the “laudable virtue” that women are not as shallow as men, but the end result sounds like Ka-ching! for the average out-of-shape bloke.  
And somehow, it’s working! I’m astonished by how many of my (girl) friends remark that a fit body is unimportant. I know their male crushes don’t feel the same. And it’s a tad dubious they inherently do either.   
I’d call that a double standard, one that some women are gullibly embracing. Women can seek a man with a great body and mind; they’re not mutually exclusive. Women shouldn’t settle for this restrictive, complacent narrative.    
My innate nature senses it’s bull.

2011-11-08,AU,club,"Just as one might wake up with a hangover after New Year’s, the government wakes up with a hangover at the beginning of a new fiscal year, said Heritage Foundation economic expert Alison Fraser.
Comparing the fiscal year to New Year’s Day, Fraser spoke about the current state of the economy at an AU College Republicans event Nov. 1
“Our hangover for the federal government is our debt,” she said. 
Fraser spoke to an audience of around 15 students in the University Club. Her organization, the Heritage Foundation, conducts conservative public policy research.
Fraser also discussed specific economic problems facing the United States and potential solutions to these problems.
“We are seeing a dramatic increase in the size and scope of our debt,” she said.  
America’s debt will only get worse with the direction the United States is headed in now, she said.  
“Our lesson learned, if any, from the EU’s experiences is that we are just a couple of years behind having to deal with the same issues,” she said.  
After explaining the issues, Fraser talked about solutions that the Heritage Foundation has supported in the past.  
“I would do it all on the spending side without raising taxes,” she said. “Rather than taxing the rich, I would rather take away their benefits,” referring to Social Security and Medicare.
Taxes make economic growth more difficult, she said.
“We’ve got to do this in a way that makes everyone’s future brighter,” Fraser said.
Fraser encouraged the students in attendance to talk to their parents and grandparents about these issues over Thanksgiving. 
She challenged students to ask them, “What are you going to do to help me?” 
“A lot of these solutions are going to rely on us having a conversation,” she said. 	
The solutions Fraser proposed seemed to resonate with many of the students at the event.  
“I really think she made a lot of sense,” said Ella Davis, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. “She had some really good ideas for the economy in the long term.”  
Charles Merrick, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, had a different opinion. 
“I generally liked the speech,” Merrick said. “I didn’t necessarily agree with things, but they made their points well.”  
Merrick said he was invited to the event by some of his Republican friends and attended because of his interest in economics.  
“It’s important to be open to other opinions,” he said.

•Where are the straight mature men on this campus?
•A senior, had never really read The Eagle until this semester. Conor Shapiro, your pic makes me pick up the eagle every Thursday which makes me feel dumb uugh! Where do you hang?
•@More than just a body
Hell yeah. Stand your ground!
•Random fact 42: The word ""assassin"" does not come from the commonly thought ""hashashin"" from ""hashish"" but actually from the Arabic word ""Asas"" which means foundation or basis.
•The Anderson Hall President is a beautiful man
•11:11 am on 11/11/11. 'Nuff said.
•I don't get all of the straight girls complaining that all the guys on campus are gay and that they are desperate for love. If that is true, as a bisexual guy, why am I not being covered in bodies?
•Dear League of Injustice,
You got punked.

•Dear, Centennial Occupants,
You're proud to be the 1 percent? But you're not, your parents are and there's nowhere to go but down for them. Quit being pretentious, or my foot will occupy your butt.
•I miss freshmen and sophomore year when my friends and I just used to hang out for no reason at all. Why, as we grow older, do we forsake the simple enjoyment of another's company for responsibility and duty?
•@""I am everything you want”
Vertical Horizon ftw. Can we be best friends?
•FOUR DAYS UNTIL ASSASSIN'S CREED REVELATIONS COMES OUT.
•1) Where's the Rant box on newer pages?
2) Nonetheless, I am loving these daily Eagle Rants! Thanks, Eagle editor/staff! Much love!
•Dear Grad Students in my 500-level Math course,
If you can't do the homework and be ready for the quizzes on time, don't hold up the rest of the us who are trying to do well in five not three classes. Also stop coming to class late, interrupting the teacher and being combative all through class ... you are really annoying the undergrads. Thanks!
Sincerely,
A ticked off math nerd
•Someone should create a Facebook group for single AU students who don't want to be single. I'd do it, but I'm to afraid of the inevitable shame ... Anyone have the guts?
•I enjoy Eagle Rants quite a bit. But when bullying, name-calling and attacks against groups of people or individuals are allowed, it is disgusting.
•When it's Thursday, it's basically Friday. YAY
•My roommate is having her grandma and mother stay in our room for a week. I can't tell her I don't want them to stay here because I want to be able to have my boyfriend visit and stay over. Guess I'm dealing with dentures and snoring for a week.
-NO ME GUSTA.
•@all the K-Pop fans from Nov. 10:
OK, we need to all meet up. And my roommate and I are super up to watching Secret Garden with you U-KISS fan!
•IT IS NOT THE CHRISTMAS SEASON YET. It is the Holiday season, and the distinct Christmas season starts at 12:01 on Nov. 25, AFTER Thanksgiving. Jeez.
•I'm falling even more in love with you, letting go of all I've held on to, I'm standing here until you make me move, I'm hanging by a moment here with you.
•Being in Georgetown makes me feel slimy.
•Henry Cavil's jaw gives me unrealistic expectations of men.
•Frustrated First-Year from Nov 8: I need someone to talk to who speaks/is learning Russian too. I'm sick of having to constantly caption myself for my friends - ????????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????? ?????
•Show me your bruises, come on, get up, let me see your bruises.
•Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause ...
•@ that pretentious panini-ranter:
Seriously? You're gonna be THAT person? Is it really such a travesty that everyone in the USA calls panini's just that? Have you ever heard someone use the word ""panino"" and not sound like a pretentious tool? Say Panini, you jerk. USA USA USA!!!
•Dear Eagle Rants hater,
Thank you for exemplifying why Eagle Rants are a good thing. Writing that must have been very cathartic. So you got all that out with out insulting your friends who like the Eagle Rants.
-Eagle Rants Lover
P.S. The Eagle is actually one of the best school newspapers I've ever seen.
[Editor’s note: Thank you very much!]
•Am I the only one who's heard of Lambda Lambda? I heard some girls talking about it in Megabytes ... is it legit?
Sincerely, More Than Willing
•I love Rants everyday. And the return of the 'rant here' box. Just saying.
•Ya, so due to complete idiocy on the part of the people tracing the checks that my mother stole from my trust fund, my mother is now aware that I am tracing the checks and has emptied the bank account that I was trying to find. Goodbye, $40 million trust fund. Rest in peace, Grandpa. And thanks for having a conniving thief for a daughter.
•That awkward moment when you sleep through 11:11 even though you didn't and are in class.
•Tuition was $36k last year is more than $38k this year. That is an increase of nearly 6 percent. That is on track to be $43k by 2013-2014. Debt Wonks.
•Dear Freshman Biddies,
The mats in the gym are for those of us who want to workout. They are not for you to lay down and chit chat about your sex lives.
Sincerely,
Workout Wonk
•Judging by the sounds coming from my ceiling, I've finally found Redwall Abbey. That means Salamandastron is probably down the hall somewhere.
•Whoever ranted about the Roots of Racism class, I am so glad I'm not the only one who hates it. That professor doesn't teach ... she talks out of her butt. We should start a chain of Rants about it. :)
•To the Media Services - I am so relieved to hear that you don't judge me for my strange movie choices. Now that I know this, I'm totally gonna start checking out the weirdest movies to see how you react.  lol jk ... or am I?!
•Dear Creepy Jewish Grad Student,
Please stop harassing me in the Tavern. I've made it perfectly clear that I really don't want to talk to you. Are you that socially inept that you can't tell when you're making me uncomfortable and that I obviously have other things to be doing? Also, not every aspect of my life is your business. Stop being nosey when I avoid a topic.
Sincerely,
The Christian Girl Who Would Rather Not See You Again
•Leggings are not pants. That is all.
•Whoever was sexually frustrated in Centennial, what were those two dating websites you mentioned? And LAL? I share your pain, and live in Centennial.
•My current goal in life is to get an editor's note on one of my rants >.> Is that a bad thing?
[Editor’s note: Totally not a bad thing. And mission accomplished.]
•To my fellow Kpop fan who said we should all meet up, I completely agree! The Korean Student Association simply doesn't meet enough to fulfill all my Kpop needs. Plus, my roommate doesn't like the way Korean sounds. =/
•Oh my god Nick Rangos just go do something with this girl so we don't have to read anymore of her Rants.
•STRESS IS STRESSFUL.
•All these K-pop rants are making me happy. We must organize a K-pop appreciation party!
•Why are all the girls complaining about the lack of straight guys? There are plenty of them. Most of the straight girls, however, seem really unapproachable. Also, you might be assuming they’re gay, when in fact, they’re not.
•Nine rants on Nov. 9 ... how many do you think I can sneak in this time?
•I have Neverland by U-Kiss stuck in my head. This is a good day for me.
-The White girl who can believe there are K-pop fans on campus!
•If Neil Kerin were a Pokémon, what Pokémon would he be?
•To the guys on the shuttle today around 10:30 - no, forte does not mean fast, and Bach was not in the classical period. Just because you take one music class doesn't mean you're automatically Mozart.
-NOT OK.
•Gotta Catch 'em All, Pokemon!
•I'm tired of flying under the radar. I just want someone who actually sees me. But no one who looks ever sees.
•After Nov. 15, I will have three boyfriends: Desmond, Altair and Ezio. Real men need not apply.
•Well Irish redhead, I could be in love with someone like you.
•To the person who wrote: ""All I require is someone with a love of music, karate and samurai movies and Tex-Mex. My soulmate will have those things. Still looking, though ..."" If you're a straight guy, we should get together. If not, we can still be BFFs!
•To the K-pop fan from a few days ago: THERE ARE MORE OF US ON CAMPUS! YOU ARE NOT ALONE! And one of these days, someone should get around to starting a K-pop appreciation club ...
•You have the SCHWEDDY BEAR?! No! We don't want you!
•That's it. I'm getting a hedgehog.
•To the people completely baffled by the existence of Kpop-loving people in Ohio: lol Kpop is a legitimate thing. A rather globally popular legitimate thing, too. Go Youtube it. Also, you seem to be implying that ther\'s a lack of Korean cultural influences in Ohio, which is rather ignorant of you tbqh.
•This goes out to all you lonely K-poppers here on Eagle Rants:
HOW ABOUT A K-POP CLUB?! Then we can all just get together and talk about it, and eventually take over campus as everyone learns about how awesome K-pop is. Just a suggestion. ^_^
•The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock at the door.
•Quit whining about mustaches on women ... I have what I guess is called ""peach fuzz"" on my upper lip. It's blonde but still visible. If I were to try and get rid of it, there's a chance it might grow in darker/thicker, something I'm not too keen on happening. Besides, I'm not waxing/plucking/traumatizing my face for anyone. Sorry, you'll just have to deal with the face nature gave me.
•We didn’t show up on the Quad last night. Our bad.
-League of Injustice
•I don't read Rants to see a ton of random song lyrics.
•If I miss 11:11 pm I'm gonna cry. It's bad enough that I missed it this morning.
•WHY CAN'T I BE A MATCHMAKER?!

•@smokers please don't litter: the only reason I don't throw cigarettes in the trash can is because I'm always afraid that my cigarette is not fully put out and that it's gonna set fire to the trash.
•@""This is the quiet floor"". Try studying in McKinley building. Although it isn't designated as a quiet building, it is often way more quiet than the library. Same goes with Kreeger, Watkins, and Gray.
•I actually saw Neil Kerwin walking through campus the other day, and almost died of shock
•I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone is from the same state, has the same political views, and the same provincial world view. At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world. And not just a couple students, but in every single class at AU. So glad I chose AU.
•I hate that you're flirtatious by nature. It creates feelings in me I know you don't share. I'm really happy to be your friend and am proud to know you trust me with your issues. But now I have feelings for you, and that can't be good for either of us.
•The awkward look guys give you when they find out your ring is a purity ring......
•I feel like ranting should not be the place that you come out of the closet...
•Irene was a joke compared to Wednesday night.  A poorly timed, inappropriate, fart joke.
•There should be like buttons for individual rants.
•I don't want to go home... I'm happier here in DC <3
•Dear Big, I know you read eagle rants so listen up. You chose me, remember? And I chose you? We were so happy that first semester. Then you went abroad and I tried so hard to make time for you, despite my personal issues. Then you came back and acted like nothing changed. I worked so hard to try and talk to you, but you were ""too busy"". This semester I'm abroad and have emailed you, messaged you, skyped you... with no responses. What did I do to make you not like me? I just want to get an answer.
•I know I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I'm pretty sure my neighbors use their apartment for a Fight Club. That's the only rational explanation for all of those noises...
•AU is SO. SMALL.
•Why doesn't my boyfriend like cuddling more??? I DON'T UNDERSTANDDDDDDDDD
•I think my friends are telling me I'm pretty because they don't want me to give up hope on the closeted lesbian and bisexual ladies.  please come out, come out wherever you are.
•why is it so cold in the library? :( I have so much to do but I can't work like this
•@Nothing about being single could make me happier than finding out your ex boyfriend is now a misogynist frat boy douchebag.- I feel you. Brings a smile to my face to hear others talk about his attitude, and say what I'm thinking.
•Thanks for all the suggestions for essay-writing soundtracks! I now love Bastion btw. Perhaps because the music reminds me of Firefly.
•@SGShouldn'tAcceptVIPSeats: Actually, the only times people on SG get VIP seats is when their organization co-sponsors the event. KPU and SUB are very strict on who gets VIP seats, and SG members are in no way allowed to just go because of their position. If you want to get a VIP seat, ask KPU or SUB if an organization you're involved in can co-sponsor!
•I'm the only one of my friends who have not had finals yet... all of their facebook statuses are killing me.
•Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin!
•This is supposed to be an incredibly open, diverse, and accepting school right? Everyone, regardless of race/creed/sexual orientation is supposed to be accepted right? Except Republicans appear to be the exception. All the time. And it's gone farther than joking - now it is starting to really hurt.
•Why aren't my rants about sex being posted? Are we not allowed to rant about sex?
[Editor’s note: It was probably over 100 words or had profanity.]
•I kissed a girl and I liked it. hope you're ready for this babe.
•""Hmmm, assuming you’re a student, what year are you?"" WOAH! Try another question. Yes or no questions please. If not, then you could ask ""what's your name?"" and I would be forced to say...

•Considering napping in the library. No shame.
•I was sexually harassed (is that the word?) in the men's bathroom in the basement of the library. I in a position to get help, but I just hid from him in the stall until left, so it wasn't necessary. Needless to say, I'm shaken by it, but I don't fell like I can tell anyone because nothing ended up happening beyond the above...
I've learned two things: (1) those rape stickers in the bathrooms are absolutely vital, and (2) I can never imagine what rape victims must feel like, given how I feel bc of this
[Editor’s note: First, sexual harassment is against University policy and the student conduct code. Even though “nothing ended up happening,” as you said, you have every right to talk to someone, whether it be a friend, counselor or AU staffer, and to report the incident if you want to. If you want more information on sexual harassment and assault at AU, you can look through AU’s resource page: http://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/sexualassault/. If you’re just looking to talk, maybe try the Counseling Center at 202-885-3500. I’m sure other ranters have ideas as well.]
•Anyway, I guess I'll just make sure I attend the ""rape is bad"" parade again this year... Idk...
•I wish we weren't so complicated. I wish you weren't so medicated.
•I hate it when people think the glass study rooms in the library are sound proof. THEY ARE NOT. The whole entire floor can hear your conversation. You biddies have no right to disturb the students in the library who actually care about their work. Also, wtf are you wearing? Mini skirts don't constitute winter clothing, and 30 pounds of make-up won't replace a lack of personality. Why has our society let this happen, and why are there are so many people like you at AU??
•Now don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for Winter Break. But I want the chance to hang out with you actually before break to know if something is there! Why is break coming so fast now??
•AU should have a graffiti rock.
•Dear Roommate:
You do not look that great in that attire, despite your assertions to the contrary, you look dumpy and like a disheveled old physics professor, you need some decent clothes hombre.

•It makes me so happy to know that all the girls you are now hooking up with are unattractive skanks. I hope you get herpes. Sincerely, your ex.
•Someone on this quiet floor is ranting about me and my friends being too loud. Im sorry but my friend was too drunk last night not to be laughing while reiterating her actions to her
•Dear roommate: You can't be in this room forever, some time, some day, I will find your computer when you aren't at it, and I will delete all of your annoyingly repetitive music (because you always listen to the same crap) so you can broaden your horizons. And I WILL BE FREE!

-still waiting
•I wish Danny Mack was straight.
•I really hate printing dollars...
•anderson third floor is too much to handle.
•Dear people who like brag about how much work they do,
1. We all do a lot of work. Get over yourself.
2. No one cares that you went 320 words over the word limit for your paper.  In fact, word limits exist so you don't talk about unnecessary information. Oh, I guess that didn't stop you from bringing this conversation up either.
Sincerely,
Annoyed person that is far from impressed.
•""White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like ""I hate all white people, they are all racist"", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street.""
One of the key parts of racism is one group having power over another.  Sure, you could argue that we have a black president but let's be real, there still is a huge amount of discrimination against black people in many parts of our country.  Clearly, AU DOES need to change the Dean's list.
•SIS people,

•REALLY LEO 6?! REALLY?! I thought there was a banana rotting away when it was a bloddy tampon on the shelf in the shower. And I thought part of the shower floor was rippping off when it was a used condom. First a pregnancy test left on the toilet seat, now this?!!? LOOK AT YOUR LIFE, LOOK AT YOUR CHOICES. Clean up after yourself, please.
•I don't even know how many times I orgasmed last night...
•Hey boy. I like you. I think. Let's watch more movies together..
•I'm tired of these mixed signals.  I don't want to be another random hookup.  If you like me, then show it and do something about it, but if you're going to tell me you like being my friend and then hook up with me, I'm done.
•It sucks when boy X shows so much interest in you but you don't like him. And boy Y has finally made his move  to an extent but you  just wish it were boy Z that made his move already.

•Now don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for Winter Break. But I want the chance to hang out with you actually before break to know if something is there! Why is break coming so fast now??
•AU should have a graffiti rock.
•Dear Roommate:
You do not look that great in that attire, despite your assertions to the contrary, you look dumpy and like a disheveled old physics professor, you need some decent clothes hombre.

•Someone on this quiet floor is ranting about me and my friends being too loud. Im sorry but my friend was too drunk last night not to be laughing while reiterating her actions to her
•Dear roommate: You can't be in this room forever, some time, some day, I will find your computer when you aren't at it, and I will delete all of your annoyingly repetitive music (because you always listen to the same crap) so you can broaden your horizons. And I WILL BE FREE!

•Dear people who like brag about how much work they do,
1. We all do a lot of work. Get over yourself.
2. No one cares that you went 320 words over the word limit for your paper.  In fact, word limits exist so you don't talk about unnecessary information. Oh, I guess that didn't stop you from bringing this conversation up either.
Sincerely,
Annoyed person that is far from impressed.
•""White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like ""I hate all white people, they are all racist"", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street.""
One of the key parts of racism is one group having power over another.  Sure, you could argue that we have a black president but let's be real, there still is a huge amount of discrimination against black people in many parts of our country.  Clearly, AU DOES need to change the Dean's list.

•REALLY LEO 6?! REALLY?! I thought there was a banana rotting away when it was a bloddy tampon on the shelf in the shower. And I thought part of the shower floor was rippping off when it was a used condom. First a pregnancy test left on the toilet seat, now this?!!? LOOK AT YOUR LIFE, LOOK AT YOUR CHOICES. Clean up after yourself, please.
•I don't even know how many times I orgasmed last night...
•Hey boy. I like you. I think. Let's watch more movies together..
•I'm tired of these mixed signals.  I don't want to be another random hookup.  If you like me, then show it and do something about it, but if you're going to tell me you like being my friend and then hook up with me, I'm done.
•It sucks when boy X shows so much interest in you but you don't like him. And boy Y has finally made his move  to an extent but you  just wish it were boy Z that made his move already.

• @""Why does the Eagle Rant editor get to be anonymous but a sex columnist can’t be?""
KA-POW!
[Editor’s Note: It’s so unfair]
• @""How do you know if you are in love?"" love is when you can't imagine living your life without that person. They are in every waking thought you have and every sleeping dream you have. They are the center of your universe. Every decision you make takes them into account. You constantly think of ways to make him/her happy. And you would sacrifice parts of yourself for the other person. That is true love.
• @person making Disney quotes: I love you. Please don't stop.
• @""I want to have sex with a girl somewhere inside MGC"" Try the 3rd floor (4th floor if you include TDR as a floor). No one is ever up there.
• @""I""m worried that the counseling center won’t be able to help me, and I have no back up plan."" If the counseling center can't help you (or if you feel they aren't helping you in the way you would like) they can give you an outside referral to nearby therapists. I've used both nearby and on campus therapists and both have been very helpful.
• @""Nate Bronstein stole all the forks from TDR.""  ...and my heart! (swoon)
• Stop worrying who you will sit next to at commencement. Just sit a stranger. No AU student is going to bite you. We're all one big happy family. Why not make a new friend the day of graduation?
• @person helped by the counseling center. I am so happy for you. I was greatly helped by the counseling center too due to some PTSD issues from an event in my past that kept haunting my dreams. But now I am almost completely better, and have learned to deal with my baggage in more healthy ways.
[Editor’s Note: Go counseling center!]
• when will I outgrow blacking out?? because finding out about my night from pictures on my phone and texts (those that I haven't deleted) is getting old
• @""I kind of agree with the opinion that going to grad school and then immediately starting a family, while fine, seems a bit like a waste. why not take a few years, have a career, travel, do things for you.""

• I read the eagle rants and I'm a grad. student.
• Why doesn't AU open a medical school so that we can raise our school ranking? We have a healthy endowment. And there is a major shortage of doctors in this country. Or at least we could open a DO school.
• Dear Guy from the Gym and Dav.: You wear a tank top and look like you're full of yourself. You resemble Adam Levine, but lose the tank top and put on a shirt. You're a grown ass man.

• WTF AUSG job board. So angry I can only speak in A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S. SMH.
• I don't understand why so many people hate on AU. I love it here and it makes me second guess my happiness when everyone around me is complaining.
• It would be nice if the eagle prevented some of the rampant grammatical mistakes. What's the editing process like if they can't even keep from double printing parts of articles?
• I was kind of hoping you'd read my rant (which was obviously about you and you would know it was about you, it was so damn specific) and rant back, or say something in person. Guess not.

• If I find someone in my class attractive, and I want to stir up conversation and eventually hopefully soon lead to a hang out time, How would one go about doing that? I cannot just wait for it to fall and just happen, I like being proactive. (soph girl--->junior guy) ADVICE?
• I am tired of people telling me what to do. I am 19 years on 20 years old and I can make my own decisions whether or not my friends think they are trying to help me or not. If it ends up being a mistake, SO WHAT. That would be a mistake I would have had to made, and had to learn from. (this is probably totally so grammatically incorrect, but, yeah.) THOUGHTS?

• AU emailed me, wanting me to name them as a beneficiary in my estate. But... I'm a junior. I'd make a joke about how I must be more valuable to AU dead than alive, except that tuition here is so expensive, my ""estate"" is probably in negative digits.
• @fetishes. I really like toned calf muscles. And being pinned down or against a wall.

• Dear Editor,
    I write your pay checks.  While I do find the delay in posting Eagle Rants an effective strategy in keeping people waiting coming back to our web page...I personally would just like it if the rants posted automatically.  That way I can follow a conversation between two ranters in less than a week.  PS-- I still think you deserve a pay raise.

If this is directed at me, which feels pretty selfish to believe, then I’m sorry, I can’t. Worse things have happened to better people, have happened to me, but I don’t think I’m comfortable talking about this yet.
In case you’re thinking it’s because I don’t trust or depend on you, just know you’re pretty much the only one I’ve told. Like, at all. So don’t worry about that thing. I know that ‘by the time the bar closes, and I feel like falling down, you’ll carry me home’.

• Actually, high school and college degrees aren't necessary,  I mean sure, there's a social stigma against high school dropouts, and I can appreciate the whole ""college experience"" thing, but in the end, unless you are going into a field that requires higher education (law, medicine, education, etc) then it's not necessary.  Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you're taking a lot of extra steps
• I am the Eagle Rants editor!
[Editor’s Note: Impostor!]
• I also fail to see how spending what little money you have on a graduate degree will make you a better mother.  Having one baby is expensive, having six kids is really expensive.  You would rather spend $60,000+ on grad school for a degree that you won't even use in the professional world, when you could use that money for a house, diapers, groceries, a new van, or a family vacation.  Sounds pretty selfish to me.  Your kids won’t care if you have a masters degree.  They’ll just want you to be their mom.

2012-02-10,AU,club,"• Can we put the eagle rants tab on the right side the of the eagle website rather than the left. It's really annoying to have to expand the window each time when I want to click on eagle rants. Or at least make the format go ""news"", ""scene"", ""eagle rants"", ""sports"", ""opinion"", ""incubator"". Incubator isn't even really a part of the eagle. It shouldn't be before Eagle rants. I'm sure rants have 100 times the audience that incubator has.
• Why is it whenever I try to strike up a conversation with someone around campus (usually females) I basically get told to F off? Is it so hard to have a friendly chat, yes you're cute but that doesn't entitle you to have a ego the size of Jupiter.
• @How do you know you are in love--> yes everything the guy yesterday said, except for the fact that sometimes the significant other can be a lying, cheating, low-life sub-human that uses you for all your money and connections and leaves you feeling hopeless and broke. But best of luck to you!

• @ Peg fetish.  Where there is a dong there is a way
• Delt's pledge class is hot. I thought they were gay???!
• @""straight girls: how flattered/creeped out would you be"" I would be so flattered and not at all creeped out in fact I might say yes, college is about experiencing right?
• I heart the Eagle Rants editor. Your snark makes the Eagle Rants that much better. I want your job when you retire, my friend, to let the legacy live on.

• How about we just call ""the pepsi girl"" Hallie Eisenberg? She's beautiful and amazing on her own, has done more than just the pepsi commercials, and should in no way be shadowed by her brother. She deserves her name. :)<3

• ""Two sides: One is light, one is dark""
• @”If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don’t need a Master’s Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.” Actually you can’t take graduate level psychology classes at community college. Or any graduate classes for that matter.
• I know you're having a harder time than you're letting on.  I just wish I could take some of your unhappiness onto myself for a while, so that you could have a break.
• @”If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don’t need a Master’s Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.”  On that theory, a college degree isn’t necessary either. Or a high school degree. Neither is legally required. It’s not about being required.  I desire it, and it would make me more educated and better person overall. And a better mother.
• Dear Anderson 4 North,
A Just Dance Party?? Really??? Some people have class in the morning!!!
• @ MGC sex: been there, done that, several times. won't tell you where though, but it's highly recommended.
• @”I don’t think anyone is saying education is a waste of money or that mothers shouldn’t be educated.  But grad school does cost quite a bit of money” Money is not an issue. But even if it were, I would gladly spend my limited money on a graduate degree rather than a new car or a vacation, etc.
• I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.
• @why go to grad school because you can take classes on itunes for free:  I take online classes online for free too.  But I’m guessing the ranter wants the self-validation and self-esteem that comes with actually earning a graduate degree. And like she said, if she ever did need to work someday, she would already have a graduate degree to fall back on (like an insurance policy).
• @”don’t they know we’re poor”. Actually many students are not poor. I for one, would love to add AU to my estate and give annual donations.
• @itunes over college: Then why go to college at all for undergrad? You can learn it all from library books? You don’t get it.  It’s not just about the classes. It’s about the graduate school experience. Meeting fellow intelligent people who share your interests.  Having challenging homework assignments. Getting grades and feedback from experts in the field. Etc.
• @fetish rants: I wanna have a threesome while my dog watches.
• @Gender Neutral Bathrooms.  I heard that all of the bathrooms in DC were gender neutral.  Establishments can still put up signs on bathrooms suggesting that they be for men or women, but they don't mean anything legally (whether or not this applies to the dorm bathrooms where people shower, I don't know)
• I'm done with women.  Hello Catholic church, need a new priest?

• To the girl sitting next to me in the library on the 2nd floor: you're really pretty and I wish I had the courage to talk to you...
• Dear Editor,
I like that you post the rants in the evening! It gives me something to look forward to. Guys, if you wanna read in the morning, adjust your reading schedule to read the previous day's in the morning! The editor has a life and stuff to do too.

We met at orientation leader interviews a little over a year ago. You've continued to be such an asset to AU. I wish I wasnt so shy, and could ask you to just chill, even as friends. The years will continue to fly by, and I'll continue to wonder what could we have been, if anything at all? Keep being awesome.
-probably in the friend zone, and that's fine by me.
• I REALLY wish it was socially acceptable to not wear pants in class
• @hard to convince yourself: I felt the same way my entire Freshman year, and it didn't help that 2 good friends ended up transferring. Just keep stay positive, don't let the negativity bring you down, and remember: the most vocal are the ones with the strongest opinion. There are still a lot of people here who really like this school, but don't go around complaining / talking about it all the time. JUST KEEP SWIMMING :)
• What is with all the hate on girls who mix business dress with sexy dress, as being in the 1% of AU (being a straight man) I find it liberating and empowering. (Psst... Not really, but maybe a lib will eat it up... like comm major lib.)
• kinda wish the GLBTA office had another A... A for Aesexual.
• The computers in the Anderson Lab are so slow, it took me 10 minutes to get to my email. I think I actually felt myself aging because of the slow speed of those damn machines.
• Folks, stop ribbing on the Eagle Rants Editor for the time of day that the rants get posted. Keep in mind that these were only posted once a week just 3 months ago. She probably has classes and homework and a social life to keep up with too. Lay off.

• @person who wants AU to open a medical school. As someone who is pre-med, I don't recommend this. Although a DO program would be great, it doesn't fit the school and honestly we seriously do not need something else to be second (or third) at compared to the other schools in DC. Let's just stick with what we have. I will go to medical school somewhere else.

• ""...because you didnt work hard enough to get to a better school""
There's only so much you can do to compensate for a 440 math SAT score, even if you did get an 800 on the reading part and a 4.0 hs gpa. Not a matter of failing to work hard. I'm happy to be at AU because it actually is a great college, and the only time I felt disappointed was when I heard people whine about how they're not at Harvard. Disappointed in those students, not AU.
• @Editor's response to ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!"" I'm sorry you missed The Room reference and responded with N*SYNC lyrics instead. You also responded with the wrong quote to the LOTR's rant on 2/6/12. It's not your fault you aren't a nerd.

• @""Is it bad that even though I have a boyfriend, all I want to do is have sex with other guys? Im simply not satisfied and require the extra meat!"" Grow up and get some morals. And some honesty. If you want to mess around then you break up with your boyfriend and live the single life. Otherwise, don't break his heart.
• Cute smoker boy, if only I could get close to you... cough!
• I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.
• I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot your wife is dead!
• Maybe it’s time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn’t give birth to you.
• @ranter criticizing paying for a degree that a person won’t use in the “professional world”: When did AU become a vocational school? Last time I checked, I chose to go to a liberal arts college to expand my knowledge on as many topics as I cared to learn about. Sure I will probably never use my poetry class in the “professional world”, but maybe we shouldn’t live our lives catering to what corporate America tells us to be.
• @""because you didn’t work hard enough to get to a better school: Actually many people at AU got into higher ranked schools, and chose to come to AU because it is an amazing school, an amazing location, and amazing, student body, amazing professors, amazing student clubs, amazing student activities each day, etc. But as always, haters gon hate. It speaks to their own depression rather than the actual quality of the school.
• @if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Does is not sadden you at all, the Americans define a person’s worthiness of education by their career path?
• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?
• @person saying the stay at home mom shouldn't spend money on grad school because it is selfish: How dare you. And actually if this girl greatly desires a graduate education, then not going to grad school would be selfish to her kids because who wants to have a mom with low self-esteem who is brooding about how she wishes she would have gone to grad school, but instead she saved the money to use it on the kids.  I would not want to inflict that kind of guilt on a family member.

• You ""want to keep Star Wars pure,"" and yet you're going to see The Phantom Menace in 3D?  Fail.  There are only 3 Star Wars movies, and Han shot first.
• To the random girls I walked back with from AEPi last night: Thank you! Never would have been able to find Tenley otherwise.

• To the Star Wars fan ranter: you're trying to keep Star Wars ""pure"" but you're going to see Episode I in 3D? Buh?
• @YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!
WAIT HI. You have to be quoting ""The Room"", right?
• To the person responding to my gender neutral bathroom bashing, thanks for the input.
• Editor's Note: is it illegal to impersonate the Editor?
[Actual Editor’s Note: Yes. I will find you]
• @Gender neutral bathroom person.  Did you ever consider that maybe you're the one who is closed-minded for not considering that many people have conflicts with it due to their religion and beliefs.
• Fellow Lost addicts:
Someone start a club. or a meeting. or something!
Sincerely,
The Man in Black
• ""...because you didnt work hard enough to get to a better school""
There's only so much you can do to compensate for a 440 math SAT score, even if you did get an 800 on the reading part and a 4.0 hs gpa. Not a matter of failing to work hard. I'm happy to be at AU because it actually is a great college, and the only time I felt disappointed was when I heard people whine about how they're not at Harvard. Disappointed in those students, not AU.
• @Editor's response to ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!"" I'm sorry you missed The Room reference and responded with N*SYNC lyrics instead. You also responded with the wrong quote to the LOTR's rant on 2/6/12. It's not your fault you aren't a nerd.
[Editor’s Note: Is this a Back to the Future reference?]
• I STILL THINK YOU'RE CUTE.
I'LL ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE CUTE.
THAT WEDDING BAND WON'T STOP ME.
• Wow, I can't believe the other LOST ranter posted the same quote as me *high five*
• I actually love getting eagle rants at night.  After a long day of school, work, and homework, it is somewhat therapeutic to read the rants.  Thanks for putting up with all this crap, Eagle Rants editor.
[Editor’s Note: High five!]
• If it’s not real, then what are you doing here, Jack? Why did you come back? Why do you find it so hard to believe?
• Why do you find it so easy?
• It’s never been easy!
• (((((((((((((what)))))))))))))
• oh hey eagle rants editor
whatup, we should hang out
-martin
• Thinking of transfering. Why can't AU's philosophy program offer any courses on metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, or the philosophy of language? Blargh...
• All this talk about the *huge* gay population on campus. I'm straight and single. Get at me. My number is ***-***-****
• Dear Boys in Room 446?
My roommate and I enjoyed your dancing in the window today. We would like to meet you one day. Have a great day!
• To Leonard Guy who feels he can't compete: the fact that you're so dedicated and concerned with your work is great! Have confidence, know you can do it, make plans and just try your hardest. I'm a senior so I know how you feel, but you'll be fine. it's not 6 classes, it's hard work and dedication that's key
• @There’s gotta be some way to find hookups without partying, right?: when you find it, LET ME KNOW ;)
• @ The person who said people who are happy here didn't work hard- Yeah, okay. Maybe YOU didn't work hard and are bitter about it, but some of us love AU. If you hate it here so much, work harder and transfer. Let the AU lovers be happy(:
• <3 So much love to the Rants editor for quoting N*Sync lyrics on Friday. <3
[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?]
• It makes me a little sad to think there are so many people in the world who have not and will not ever experience bacon.
• Normally I'm an average to happy person but lately I feel either completely depressed or completely turned on. What's wrong with me?
• People who believe the Earth was created in literally 6 days over 6,000 years ago ARE crazy. Sorry.
• I'm drowning in responsibilities. Go away, to-do list. Go very very far away.
• Doesn't anybody like Age of Empires II anymore?  I know it is over 10 years old, but greatness doesn't go out of style.  Or am I just one lonely AOE girl stuck in the 90s?
• @“‘As the original poster, I am going to pretend you are the guy I wrote this about. I say we should both go for it."" I am the guy you wrote this about. I want you to make the first move.
• @Guy with a drug problem because of his mom. I'm here for you. I totally and definitely get the condescending mom thing and how it can get to you. You. are. not. alone.
• ""I wish my self esteem wasn’t too low to make friends."" can I be your friend?
• @""Is it bad that even though I have a boyfriend, all I want to do is have sex with other guys? Im simply not satisfied and require the extra meat!"" Grow up and get some morals. And some honesty. If you want to mess around then you break up with your boyfriend and live the single life. Otherwise, don't break his heart.
• Cute smoker boy, if only I could get close to you... cough!
• I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.
• I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot your wife is dead!
• Maybe it’s time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn’t give birth to you.
• @ranter criticizing paying for a degree that a person won’t use in the “professional world”: When did AU become a vocational school? Last time I checked, I chose to go to a liberal arts college to expand my knowledge on as many topics as I cared to learn about. Sure I will probably never use my poetry class in the “professional world”, but maybe we shouldn’t live our lives catering to what corporate America tells us to be.
• @""because you didn’t work hard enough to get to a better school: Actually many people at AU got into higher ranked schools, and chose to come to AU because it is an amazing school, an amazing location, and amazing, student body, amazing professors, amazing student clubs, amazing student activities each day, etc. But as always, haters gon hate. It speaks to their own depression rather than the actual quality of the school.
• @if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Does is not sadden you at all, the Americans define a person’s worthiness of education by their career path?
• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?
• @person saying the stay at home mom shouldn't spend money on grad school because it is selfish: How dare you. And actually if this girl greatly desires a graduate education, then not going to grad school would be selfish to her kids because who wants to have a mom with low self-esteem who is brooding about how she wishes she would have gone to grad school, but instead she saved the money to use it on the kids.  I would not want to inflict that kind of guilt on a family member.
[Editor’s Note: ]

2012-02-12,AU,club,"• The dance team is looking bangin'.
• 9 minuets until I can get my package!
• @ religious beliefs and gender neutral bathrooms. I didn't say ""replace all bathrooms ever with gender neutral ones"". I'd just like the option to exist
• UNDIE RUN UNDIE RUN UNDIE RUN. that sounds AWESOME
• @undie run. YESSSS
I know at least two people who would definitely do it.
• If you think the 2 billion Christians in the world ALL take the Bible completely literally, then you're the crazy one. And I think you missed the point. Just be respectful of other peoples' religions, no matter what they may be, and expect them to be respectful of yours/lack thereof. The only rule is to not be an asshole. Thanks and God bless.
• One does not simply survive the phonathon...
• @""@Gender neutral bathroom person.  Did you ever consider that maybe you're the one who is closed-minded for not considering that many people have conflicts with it due to their religion and beliefs."" Um religion is a choice; being transgendered is not.
• I don't read long rants.
• Tim McBride wears patriotic boxers. I would know. I've seen them.
• Sometimes a bro just wants to get laid.
• @person wanting tips for stolen laptop: Here's a tip. Don't leave your door unlocked. And don't leave you stuff unattended at the library (as hundreds of signs warn against). I don't know your situation, but if you did leave your door unlocked or your stuff unattended, I do not feel sorry for you at all. Learn some common sense.
• @""I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school."" This is true of any business school. New york times ran stories on this issue a few months back about how business students never develop their full potential of critical thought because they are always doing group projects and never get to think independently.
• @people who think eagle writers/editors/photographers get paid: lol Are you really that clueless? Can you name one college newspaper in the country that pays its writers? It's a college extracurricular, not a career.
• @future SAHM (mom lingo for stay-at-home-mom): Don't let naysayers get you down. I also want to be a stay at home mom right after college and grad school (well, for me right after two grad degrees). I want to study anthropology and creative writing in grad school. And I know fulfilling my academic goals before I am a mom will make me a more mature and confident mother.
• Please put the rants on the left side of the website rather than the far right. It's really frustrating and annoying to have to expand the webpage in order to view the rants.
• What religion is against gender-neutral bathrooms? I can't find that in my bible...
• Jobs board is back in existence, but not functioning at all. Used cars? Please explain.
• ""I will not give up hope. I was hooked from the start, when I noticed your kind and your powerful heart. So notice me... ""

• @AoE girl: ahhhh so much nostalgia. Haven't played it in so long but soo good. Might just have to reinstall it..

• Side-eyeing the ""Drooling Democrats"" editorial...

• StarCraft tournament?  Woo-Hoo!
• Eagle Secure hit a new low for me just now: I was watching a five minute video for my Health class when Eagle Secure crapped out halfway through it.
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY LOG IN TO EAGLESECURE.
• Dear girls who want to meet guys in 446,
I think you mean 445 because 446 is a room full of girls.
Sincerely,

• @ ""You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.""
This, this, this, a million times this. College has made me come to the sad realization that just because someone is reasonably intelligent and educated, does not mean that they have an understanding of basic hygiene. Or maybe they're just inconsiderate.  Either way, stop being gross!
• I sent you a letter - gatita
• ""This is a star?""
""This is a f***ing star! I run it! I'm your boss!""
""You're Mister Stevens?""
• I left AU and since moved to California... but I still read rants sometimes :) And it makes me feel better to know I wasn't the only one that felt really alone and left out while I was there. It was soo hard to make friends and no way in hell was I joining a sorority! Although going to community college now makes me wish I didn't complain about the campus so much!

• My heart skipped a beat... then I realized that there's at least one other Fiona on campus but hey, you never know, right?
• Why do I feel awkward when I whistle in public?
• How do you tell a good friend that you don't want to room with her next year because you're terrified that never having any time to yourself will drive you insane? Is there anyway to say that and not seem horrible?
• Any one else on campus in need of roommate? Im in a pickle because my friends have a odd number, help!
• is really tired of watching drunk girls being sloppy, trashy, slutty and classless. please get your lives together so you can maintain whatever dignity you might possibly have left.
• I wonder what Eagle Rants would have been like back in 1925...
""Am I alone in thinking that this Scopes Chap isn't entirely mad?""
""It is simply unthinkable that this institution would allow Undergraduates to sully it's halls with their immaturity. They must think that collegiate life is all about 'making whoopie'.""
• to all the straight girls with boy cuts, you are all 1000% more attractive and hot.
• Just because people's opinions on the Earth's origins differ from your own doesn't mean you have the right to label them crazy. I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate them calling you crazy for believing otherwise. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
• drunkn egle ranting is the new drunkj tesxting!!
• I thought I could trust you. I didn't realize how wrong I could be.
• @Star Wars purists: represent! This 3d nonsense doesn't count as star wars... The only possible motivation to see the original three is to finally see them on the big screen.... Stay true!!
• I miss the feeling of being wanted. It seems like the only attention I'm able to get from guys now is just physical attention. Meanwhile, when I was in a relationship all of last year and this past semester, people actually had a crush on me. I hate being single.
• Clubs are for GDIs.

• I don't know about anyone else, but I don't use the dorm bathroom soap because I'm allergic to it.. I use hand sanitizer after I leave. please don't judge. we're not all slobs.
• I crashed your plane, brothah.
• @future stay at home mom: It's funny how society has become more accepting of stay at home dads than stay at home moms. I bet no one would criticize a man who went to grad school and then stayed home to raise the kids while his wife works.  Don’t give up on your admirable plan. I plan on being a stay at home mom immediately after going to law school. I’m not even planning on taking the bar exam. Plan on getting prego the day after my last final exam ends. Haha
• Remember that time we only got rants once a week?
• You under counted the sassy.
• So many boogers. Sick. :(
• Grad school is a huge waste of money unless you need it for your career. You do realize that everything you learn in grad school you can  probably learn from books available for free at your local library? Don't drop 50k plus just for a self esteem booster.

• Someone in my math class asked the teacher if he could do another example.  The teacher replied: ""We've just done every example in the world.""
What are we supposed to do with that?
• The bad thing about community bathrooms is that when you're sick and phlegm is in your throat you either have to walk to the bath room each time, or develop a phlegm cup.  Which do you think I did?
• I have yet to meet a person at AU with regular bandaids.  That says a lot about a campus.  They're always rainbow, or toy story...
• We met Saturday night at a party. I cant mention names haha, but Yours starts with an E. Either way, it was great getting to know you. U seem like a kind, down-to-earth girl and id def be interested in hanging out sometime. If u know who I am, and am interested, let me know :) Sincerely, M

• I cannot deal with it anymore. I just want to experiment with the other sex. I want to know what it's like, what it feels like. I am not up to the point of sex, but anything less would be awesome. I have a couple of ideas, as in friends I would feel comfortable with doing so, (like casual makeout or w.e) but I don't think they would want to in exchange. How do I fix/deal with this dilemma ?
• @[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?],
Really I just love the occasional N*Sync throwback. Gotta love JT with the terrible frosted tips. Oh the 90's...
• @I started working out recently,
I feel ya. Try focusing on the little changes in your physique and  really hype those up to yourself. I had really flabby arms so when I started working out and finally saw the first indications of a muscular contour, I was super happy and my hard work felt vindicated. You'll get there; just keep swimming!

 Type your rant here!  
• This week is killing me. Do I have to have multiple major assignments due every day? I guess I'm just not allowed to sleep until spring break.
• @annoying greek life families.....AMEN!!!! could you pleeeeeese tell that to my ex?!?
• @“Is it weird that I think my boyfriend of about five months is probably the guy I want to marry?” just don't let him join a fraternity
• What's up with $4 Greek yogurt on campus? #WHY
[Editor’s Note: Ask the last two ranters, they seem to know a lot about greek life.]
• If you're one of those people who keeps the window open at night when it's freezing out, there are no words...
• I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS.
• We have unlimited juice?! This party is gonna be off the hook!
• Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won't give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it's just smoke!
• NOBODY ON CAMPUS LOOKS LIKE ADELE.
• I removed myself from all social media the other day to get away from all the supercritical people that judge every single thing you say. Honestly, although I feel out of the loop now, I feel liberated (and less distracted). Plus, I now know who my real friends are!
• Original ranter about the smoke-free campus plan here: I was encouraged to post a rant about this by a bunch of people who were shocked that this idea was being seriously considered. I, personally, do not smoke, and dislike having to inhale secondhand smoke. However, I have mixed feelings about the smoke-free campus plan.
• Drop. Your. Sword.
• It's called a lance...hello.
• I love my conservative friends.
a liberal
• I'm not complaining about GCH since I love them, but technically we already paid for them with our Student Activity fee.
• @""other Starkid fan, Wanna meet at the Dav at 2:30 on Thursday? I’ll wear my rocket ship shirt."" YES!! I'll be the one rolling on the floor like Lauren Lopez.  But actually, I am so bad at planning clothes so I'll just carry a sign that says ""That's Absurd!"" on it :)
• As an American fan, I'm disappointed I won't get to see the Eagles play UConn in Bridgeport now. As a UConn fan, I'm very happy to have this conflict of interest between my teams over. Confusing times
• @""fun. reference- I think I’m in love.
But I like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I’ve been cheated on"" & ""@ fun. ranter- is that you, who i think it is?"": I'm a senior and a girl, does that encourage or discourage you?
• @“""Some Nights” I love that song, I love fun. and I love Nate Ruess in general!!"" & @""To the person who posted the fun. lyrics: !!!! Are you going to see them in May? I have tickets to both shows and it is going to be insane"" I love Nate Ruess!!! I've been a HUGE fan since The Format and I've seen him live 6 times! (My profile picture is actually me with him)! I am going to the Friday show in May but I can't go on Thursday because of finals :( jealous!!
• To the girl on the fifth floor of hughes that is always naked with her curtains open:
thank you.
sincerely,
Men everywehre
• This is a campus with students who are actually conservative, think they are liberal, say they are moderates, vote democrat, and at the end of the day are disgustingly apathetic and unsure of themselves.
• Dear guy in SIS who thought his headphones were plugged in but was actually just playing music really loudly: That was hilarious and thanks for looking rightfully embarrassed when you realized your mistake!
• To straight female conservative republican. Wow I wasn't even trying to be mean with that first post. You have your whole life to be a racist, bible-quoting, million(miscalculated) mom joining, human rights offender. Why start in college? Keep pretending that your conservative boyfriend doesn't hate gay people because he's in the closet himself. Or that his huge gun makes up for his less than adequate bedroom abilities. If I could legally spit on you I would.
• My RA tells me to watch out for EI guys on my floor because they steal laptops. But just the other day we catch a mysterious man in his mid 30s walking our floor, looking around. I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
• I was so mad when I found out how much we were paying for Gym Class Heroes. WE COULD HAVE BROUGHT LIL B! Now you touring heavy and your show cost 30 G's! DAMN BASED GOD, YOU DOING EVERYTHING!
• Guys, the rants were so good today! Eff those smokers!
• @LanaDelRay Hunger Games lyrics poster: this district smells like rat piss my name is Katniss...
• @gentlemen get screwed over. Maybe she just wasn't into you. She's allowed to not be into you.
• I also find myself becoming more conservative here, but I'm not sure if it's just that a lot of the liberals here are really obnoxious.
• Reading some of these rants makes me wonder if I was ever actually like this while being an undergraduate.
• ICE TRAIN RAGE BIG!!!!
• that awesome feeling when you need emergency counseling and the person answering phones tells you the next available appointment is for thursday. What if I don't have until thursday!? #Suckstosuck
• feeling better than ever. #masturbationinthelib
• To the girls to my right on the silent floor - stop trying to have a conversation here. The whole floor can hear every single word you're saying. Neither of you are capable of whispering. Go chat in the Mudbox, some of us are ACTUALLY trying to be productive.
• @“my roommate has an std and is a slut. i do not respect her and never will.” Awesome job with the slut shaming! please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality."" Preach.
• @Team Gale. Serious? How do you read those books and come out liking Gale?
[Editor’s Note: An answer in the form of a fan-fiction short story would be preferred]
• That moment when at the end of a busy, productive phonathon shift, you start singing ""closing time"" to yourself, and your supervisor hears you and puts the song on.  :)
• To AU's spitting image of Christian Bale: God, you're a gorgeous specimen of man.
• Why did you have to leave?
• i really really miss you =/
• @""I want to hang out with you but I have to play the game…""  Don't play games, games get you nowhere
• I've been wearing more dresses just because of how many guys have been ranting about them!
• @""is the extremely attractive blonde on hughes 2 really a lesbian? help!"" No we have no blonde lesbians on our floor
-Hughes 2
• Eaglesecure is making it impossible to have a Disney sing-a-long.
• @""[Editor’s Note: Time McBride = Sitcom spinoff wherein Tim McBride discovers a time machine and explores the history of AU?]"" EDITOR YOU JUST MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD. I LOVE YOU.
• no....you're douchy.
• What qualifies someone as a ""Public Figure""?? I feel like there are so many people's full names used on here that it seems like anyone does.
• I agree about the Adele chick. She's in my class and I want to play with her boobs. :)
• Sorry editor...it's kinda why fat people are fat tho...they stay home and eat. #reality
• Why do none of my friends want to discuss politics?! I feel like I am suddenly at the wrong university
• The fact that Eagle Rants has an editor is maybe the most hilarious thing since Hope-Change
• I know I'm driving everyone crazy, but I can't stop talking about you. You are my drug
• @”facebook timeline advocate: I love the concept of the timeline, but there are a few really annoying bugs in it that I can’t figure out.  On the “map” feature, whenever I click on a city I have been to it only lets me add a single year. What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.
• @""To be honest, the whole concept of Greek life families really just annoys me..."" Couldn't agree more. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. Your right, where are their priorities?
• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.
[Editor’s Note: I just delete them when they use curse words]
• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!
• I think I am the Adele
• @hipster girls are gross: You have it all wrong. Hipsters smoke weed. Goths smoke cigarettes.
• I HATE SOCIAL GREEK LIFE. There I said it. It separates everyone into different groups and the rest dont have a group (not that they want one...). Everyone fights for equality and no cliques or bullying but thats what greek like does (a lot of the time, not generalizing).
• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.
• Was it rude to protest Brewer? Yes. You know whats ruder? Racism.
• Dear Eagle's Nest,
I would like to bring your attention to the current dearth of ice cream selections. Never have I seen a more disappointing sight than the empty shelves of the ice cream freezer. One question: Why?
Sincerely,
Jamaican Me Crazy

• @hates Greek families, we're not all awful, I'm in a non-social frat and I'm super excited about my new family! It's a way to make new friends not get rid of old ones, so if your friends can't deal that's their problem not the institution's.
• @""In this world, gentlemen get f***ed"": good job standing by your beliefs, I guess, but be careful not to take an isolated incident and extrapolate too much.

• Wondering what the hell happened today when I went to get food at MGC. Eagle's Express raided, Tavern and Salsa were completely filled up, the taco line at TDR was up to the bathroom, and to top it all off, I ended up waiting 30-40 minutes for kung pao chicken. What the hell?
• Christine at TDR is the absolute best! She always brightens up my day with her wonderful personality and her big smile. Whenever you get the chance, make sure to show her some love. :]
[Editor’s Note: I love Christine at TDR.]

• Why can't Eagle Rants be clever and contain basic English. I've read other schools rants (UNC-Chapel Hill) and they surpass us in ranting. It must say something when a student bodys' rants are from illiterates and numbskulls. Can't there be a smart rant every once in a while. Do you guys even know the meaning of a rant?
• Yes. We hate fat people at the gym. Please stay home. And eat.

• @@”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom""- And if you ACTUALLY knew what you were talking about, you'd know that unless a person's habits and actions are affecting their, or another's, day to day life, they dont have a problem. But good try.
• @Am I overreacting?,
WHY are you wearing sweatpants in public? I'd agree with your bf that you should dress a little nicer than that to go out. But if he also criticizes the clothes you wear around the dorm/ in private, that sounds controlling/problematic.

• To the ranters making Breaking Bad references, I want to sweet raw love to all of you!
• ""you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd...""
It sounds like someone is a virgin in terms of emotional maturity. Apparently, you still have some growing up to do.
• @""Sweatpants wearer."" You have to be yourself, do your thing, and stick to your own style. Keep on wearing sweatpants as much as you like.  But if it would make your bf happy, it wouldn't hurt to dress nice every once in a while.
• I'm a global scholar, and I just want to say that nothing scares me more than a room filled with global scholars.  Sh*t's intense...

• @”You’re going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries,” Actually I don’t eat those types of foods. I eat all organic, vegan, no saturated fat foods, and I exercise each day. I choose to live a healthy lifestyle and do not appreciate people who selfishly release their toxic fumes into my walking path when they could just as easily get their high from a nicotine patch and thereby avoid harming others with their decisions. I try my best not to make decisions that harm others, and I expect the same respect from others.
• @why fat people are fat. It couldn't be because of thyroid disorder or because they don't have a lot of money and fattier, carb loaded unhealthy food is cheaper so they get stuck buying that instead of expensive fruits and veggies from whole foods...quit being such a jerk.
• @sleeping around is a sign of psychological problems. 1. or it's a sign that sex is awesome and people enjoy having it. I love having sex. There's nothing wrong with me. 2. Citation needed.

• Why is everyone hating on the slut shamers!? I didn't know adultery was cool nowadays... (Yes it's not traditional adultery but it's all the same) I mean I guess I can go tell my girlfriend of 2 years that I'm allowed to sleep around because everyone else does it. That isn't right and neither is whoring yourself to every guy in EI. #stfu and #gtfo please and thank you!
• @TimMcBrideDelawareRant- I'm just glad you know it's a state. Proud to rep the state of our SG Pres, not so proud about that witch
• @ ""Dear ugly wonk who hates smokers:""  And that ladies and gentleman is what we call an ad hominem attack.  Also some possible anger management issues.
• @”I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Actually I have plenty of sex with my amazing girlfriend, thanks for asking.  But I’m glad you view your sluttiness and impulsivity as an accomplishment.  And I admire virgins for waiting for the right person instead of giving it up at a trashy frat party. But I don’t even know why I am bothering to argue with someone who clearly lacks basic human decency towards others and doesn’t care if they blow toxic fumes at innocent bystanders.
• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.
• Guys. Hot TA who's a grad student, I'm a sophomore. Anything possible there? Grad students, help me out.

• Editor, are there going to be rants over break??
[Editor’s Note: Probably not. Maybe once on Wednesday]
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.
• @To straight female conservative republican: wow. People like you are the reason conservatives are demonized on campus and the epitome of what I dislike about liberals.

• @""dating five guys means you is a SLUT."" - dating, kissing, and sexing with 5 guys at the same time may potentially qualify you as a slut...or just seeing what's out there. Who am I to judge?? Better yet, WHO ARE YOU!?
• AU students are good at making petitions and protesting ish. Where do all the smokers sign?? Even better, why don't we just congregate on the quad and have one big puff sesh?
• To everyone on the side of Kogod facing Hughes: Hope you enjoy the shows~ We'll be here all week. XD
• To the editor: You make my day with your comments, especially since you love Christine like I do too. Keep on being awesome. :]
• To the smokers: maybe a smoke-free plan wouldn't even be necessary if you actually listened to the 25 feet rule? Just saying, it's not that hard and could make everyone's life easier. Could even save you from dealing with a smoke-free campus policy. Hm, novel idea? Sounds like it to me.
• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]
• @Meet us at 6am Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the fitness center wrestling room.  We won’t judge you, we will train you.""  -... what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I'm kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.

• I'm sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished when in actuality it is the hard work of many others over several years who have worked to get a victim advocate on campus.

• Oh boy! the SG dumped more tuition dollars into a Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator!

• @""Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc..."" Um, maybe some of us are just fulfilling our natural sexual urges and comfortable with our human sexuality? I occasionally sleep around and I am perfectly happy with who I am personally and sexually. I don't need anyone's help. You have no right to try to make me ashamed of that.

• @I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
It's not RHA persey, I'd blame the RA's who don't bother looking up at the front desk when you walk in and offing public safety. This would all be so much easier if we just had freaking security cameras in the dorms like other colleges...

• The next time I see someone say that AU is a politically active campus, I'm showing them the list of candidates for this year's SG elections and laughing in their faces.
• Lol, my friend originally made the Adele rant about me, even though I don't think I look like her at all. Some people disagree, but either way, it looks like we got a few Adele look-alikes around campus! :)
• @ ""caught mysterious man in his 30s walking around""
Was this on Southside? On the top floor of Letts/Anderson. Around... 11 or 12 o'clock at night on Monday. If so, that ""30 year old man"" was me. I'm 19. I was looking for a friend of mine. Sorry to be a burden.

• To the guy that took god-like care of me when I needed it: you have no idea how much I appreciate everything, especially since you were a stranger to me.
• If anyone's taking Metro this weekend, do take note of the Red Line closure between Van Ness and Dupont Circle. You might want to save yourself some stress and take the N6 bus straight from campus to Dupont Circle instead.
• Hey guess what? Who I sleep with is none of your business unless I'm sleeping with you. Why do you even care? It has NOTHING to do with you. So why don't you focus on your own life instead of judging other people, because no one asked you.
• Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.
• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.
• does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?

i love the show, and admit to posting a few lost quotes myself. with that being said, please dont post the same ones over again. your just flat out bothering people

• AU email defaults the check-in for Alcohol Edu to the spam folder.  Even gmail knows nobody really cares about it at this point.
• Is Women's Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a ""rape culture""?
• Smile! Someone, somewhere cares about you!
• what's up with those black cars on the quad...? EAGLE do a tweet/story about this please!
• Eagle Rants Editor, you so funny
[Editor’s Note: Thanks babe]
• Why do people care about other people being sluts? Or even use that word at all? It is quite derogatory to women everywhere and completely none of your business what a woman chooses to do with her own sex life.
• I live on hughes 5, I don't close my curtains and I'm generally always naked. You're welcome.
• I would be out on the quad right now,you know if wasnt allergic to grass or anything #goingtoschoolatanationallyrankedarboretumproblems

• To the D Chi who gave a flower to a girl on a tour Thursday afternoon: While I am flattered, you managed to pick the one person in the whole tour group who was already a student here to ""welcome"" to AU with a flower.

2012-03-10,AU,club,"Rant here!
 Type your rant here!  
• @""Why is everyone hating on the slut shamers!?"" If you're happy in your 2 year relationship, congrats. If someone is happy ""whoring themselves to every guy in EI"", what do you care?? You're both happy, worthy people and who you sleep with is NOT a factor in that!
• Oh my god not everyone who has sex is screwing the first person they see. And if they are, why on earth does it matter to anyone else? Have sex with no one or have sex with everyone: that's their choice and everyone else should mind their own business because it doesn't matter!
• For the last time, Student Government has NOTHING to do with tuition money!
• @""To the ranters making Breaking Bad references, I want to sweet raw love to all of you!""
As the original poster from yesterday, this makes me so excited I just want to throw a pizza on the roof! But don't worry, I'll save the dipping sticks. ;]
• @I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer.
I have been ranting about this to my friends and everyone I know for every single day of my life...MARRY ME PLS???
• Smoking's a choice; if smokers want to smoke, let them.  This is an awfully controlling thing to try to shove down people's throats, just saying.
• ""@“Drop. Your. Sword.” Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!""
And don't forget: Never get involved in a land war in Asia!
• @ a girl- Might as well have said ""You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week. So I guess you picked today. Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays."" Quit hating! She's concerned about her boyfriend, don't judge her choice to wear sweatpants.
• @Alanis Morissette lyrics
I love you. That is all.
• You sir have also lost the Game.
• Wait you mean smoking is bad for you??? I can't believe no one told me that before!!! I am obviously going to quit right this second now that I know that!
• Woman, I ain't your man, so stop acting like I am!
• “And if you ACTUALLY knew what you were talking about, you’d know that unless a person’s habits and actions are affecting their, or another’s, day to day life, they dont have a problem. But good try.” LoL are you serious here? Are you aware sex involves two people? That means the actions are affecting BOTH the individual with the sluttiness issues AND the people they are sleeping with. That meets your criteria to the letter honey. But good try.
• ""And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with, hm? What one particular element comes to mind, hm? Hmm?""
""Aaaah, wire."" XD
• @ Hey guess what?: Hellz yeah, seems like people cant keep their mouths shut and private business to themselves
• @”I have to wonder, why is there no on campus river? I feel like my tuition should pay for such a thing.” You have no idea how often I think the exact same thing. We should least get a little steam thing going.
• Can everyone just live and let live? Just quit judging people and just BE? But I guess then there wouldn't be any Eagle Rants...
• Last semester, I had a great time at AU without out-of-class friends.  This semester, I got some and had a blast hanging out with them.  Then they randomly quit talking to me.  Now I feel super down on myself and am not having a good time at all.  Hopefully being around people who actually like me back home over break will help my confidence, because I feel really sh*tty right now...
• @”Again, can we please put the Eagle Rants tab on the website on the LEFT side of the screen, so we don’t have to expand the website each time we open the eagle website in order to access the rants.” Agreed. This is three seconds of my life WASTED each day when I have to expand the webpage. Eagle staff, GET ON THIS.
• @”I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer. That’d be cool. But God could have made pokemon real but instead was like “Nah man. Malaria.” T_T” You’re the kind of guy I wanna marry. A) Are you single? B) Where can I find you?

• Can we have a vending machine full of Clif bars? Is that even remotely possible?
• @""Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.""- Handily enough, theres a whole article about this! Right here! Online! Under the ""News"" section!
• @""what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.""
We're a loosely-military training group.  I'm a Marine officer candidate myself, and I design the workouts.  They will broadly strengthen all elements of functional fitness.  Do and don't be intimidated by us at the same time.  We welcome all fitness levels (many civilians are part of the group), but we WILL kick your ass :).  We're done until after break, but you won't regret joining us at 6am on the 20th.  All are welcome.
• ""we don’t judge or insult you for not joining."" Hmm.... I wonder how the term GDI came about??
• @""does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?""
I know it existed as of last semester, at least.  I'm pretty sure it's still going on now.  HOWEVER, I run a completely different club, and I can tell you from experience that those ""official"" email addresses usually don't get checked very often.  Your best bet is to find someone who's in it already that can give you the details.
• How about all the confident and attractive people just keep having lots of great sex with each other, and all the nervous virgins can keep calling women ""sluts"" and f***ing themselves?  Problem solved!
• I'm sick and tired of being judged for being male. I'm actually one of the men who is NOT a terrible person.
• I didn't get a Little. :'( I guess I'll just walk the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
• I've cordially invited many people to my pants party but as of yet no one has RSVP-ed. What should I do?
• No matter, how much I try, I cannot will myself to finish this paper.
• Re the leggings as pants debate, and this also applies to the girl with the boyfriend who doesn't like her frequent sweatpants-wearing: I used to be a anti-leggings gal. Now, I love them. They are mega comfortable. If you by a good quality pair (which doesn't have to be anywhere near expensive), they won't be so tight and revealing. And my boyfriend loves when I wear them, so wins all around!
• lol thyroid - cute.
• I just got rescued by the search and rescue raptor. Yay for being home!
• Dear freshmen who thinks they have more credits than me. You dont. You're just like everyone else at this school who thinks their smart. STFU or GTFO
• @people complaining about 30 year old guy walking around in a building: did you care to see if he worked for AU as facilities or maintenance? did you see if he had been claimed by someone? because I work at a front desk and I have seen strangers ask residents to claim them and the resident will. so double check among yourselves before blaming the people at the desk.
• @• ""I’m sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished..."" If you actually read the email, it wasn't talking about the creation of a victim's advocate position, it was talking about the recent development of confidentiality for that position... which just happened this year.  Also, the email opened up with ""For years.""
• I WANNA MAKE LOVE WITH YOU!
• Regarding the smoking issue:Its irrelevant whether or not smoking is addicting or dangerous. I'm sorry, but if you really are so terrified of second-hand smoke that you cant stand to be around it, then you should have gone to a non-smoking school, instead of making everyone conform to you. This is a matter of liberty. People have the right to do what they want to their body. You do not have the authority to limit people's free choices. Plain and simple.
• @""Where are the AC fans?"" I am a fan of air conditioning.
• Dear Person who quoted Pete's Dragon, I love you.
• Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
• Can we go back to weekly rants?  As much as I enjoy the daily rants, 1) The Rants were all around better when they only came out once a week and 2) I'm sick of these ""hey post the rants already"" rants.
Signed,
A Disgruntled Ranter

• I was watching Kenan and Kel tonight, and the plot was them trying to get to a double date on time. Their date was to see a movie called Teen McBride. Anytime it was brought up, I only heard Tim McBride... #AUproblems
• @""sweetie, if you want silence don’t sit outside the mud box and don’t tell me what to do cause im a freshman, i probably have more credits than you anyways.""...honey, talk to me in 4 years when you grow up and think twice before you throw lip, because you don't know who you may cross.

• LISTEN UP. AU will never be smoke free, not at least until we get our campus plan approved. Where do people go when they can't smoke on campus? The neighborhood directly around campus. This is the same neighborhood that hates AU and the students. As long as the university wants to get the campus plan approved, the campus will never go smoke free. It would be a very stupid decision. (Don't get me wrong though, I totally support a smoke-free campus!)
• @""Is Women’s Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a “rape culture”?"" ARE. YOU. JOKING. ME?? GTFO.
• To the person who responded with a hash tag about straight female conservative republican. I'm glad you people are demonized on campus. How dare you try to deny legitimate members of our society the right to marriage? Or to spend countless tax dollars on drug testing the poor to satiate your appetite for humiliation of those less fortunate than yourself? I've got a hash tag for you. #scum
• I""m just going to let you go, I like you enough to not want you to get hurt by me.

Thank you! Things are going very well. It's all about attitude and learning to help yourself rather than having someone else help you. It's rather exciting. Good luck with you too! Just remember to trust yourself, be yourself, and believe in yourself! (little words of wisdom I tell myself everyday to keep going, it sounds cheesy I know) LOVE YOUR LIFE everyone! It gets better :-)

•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.

We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...
•If you're a guy, Take Back the Night is about realizing how many people you know are survivors and how oblivious you were.

Someone puts himself last
So that you can come first

•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..
•to the ranter who started with ""If you were my girlfriend"" ILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. I'm not actually desperate and I don't really want a relationship you seem like a genuinely nice guy, sometimes hard to find here
•To the lady who just called out a room of girls being too loud: rock on.
•@@where do Au students go to party? : ""Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm ""glad"" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•""@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

•@""I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left..."" PLEASE SWIPE ME INTO TDR EVERYDAY!!!! -hungry upperclassman with no meal plan and no money
•I REALLY have to poop but don't want to pack up or leave my stuff alone in the library since there is no one around to ask to watch my stuff. SO FRUSTRATING.
•I want to tell you that your ex boyfriend didn't cheat on you with ""just some girl,"" it was me. But I also want to tell you that it wasn't consensual. But I am too scared to tell you, or anyone else. I am so sorry this happened, to both of us.
•So you always used to booty call me but now you don't answer when I booty call you, which is a bummer because I really liked having sex with you
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the dav
•goal before graduation= have sex in the library. any takers?
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" women's initiative
•@""One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today."" Story of my life. I feel so much better knowing that I'm not the only one!!
•The Eagle should learn to stop editing the work of contributing writers when it doesn't have any grammatical errors. The editor completely mangled a key sentence in my article.
[Editor's note: We edit any submissions for clarity, relativity, length and profanity, in addition to grammar and AP Style. But send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we'll look into it. Also, this editor doesn't know who you are or what you wrote, but just wants to point out that Eagle Contributing Writers are part of The Eagle staff who have written a handful of articles; content submitted by members of the AU community to the Opinion page is not written by ""contributing writers;"" it's written by people who submit content and, thus, do not have the title ""contributing writer.""]
•Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy. I know everyone wants to get a word in, but people want to read something different on their rants. :\
•Dear Editor, thanks for censoring my rant (but really), I wanted to take back what I said after I sent it in!
[Editor's note: Anytime!]
•END OF THE YEAR SEXUAL TENSION. Glad to see I'm not alone in this one.
•I'm sorry I disturbed your mom last night on the quiet floor *raises eyebrows up and down repeatedly*
•LADY MARGARET! LADY MARGARET! A kindly bridge-troll let us in... SILENCE BRIDGE TROLL!
•HI PEGGY!!!
•Why do you even come here Papaya? No body likes you.
•Cucumbers have wicked souls...
•And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?
•To everyone who responded to my postings of T.S. Eliot; thank you as your kind words really touched me (no joke). I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.
•No gorganzola on my turkey cranberry salad from the Tavern?!! Oh HELL NO!! THIS WILL NOT STAND.
•Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours.  Is this right? Just wondering?
•WHY are the einsteins employees so slow!??!!? Seriously someone needs to give them a lesson on assembly lines. I'm not hating on the dining staff, I'm simply asking for faster service.
•If I could choose to be a lesbian, I would at this point. I've had too many bad experiences with guys lately.
•What is a Pitt bomb threat? Can someone please explain this?
-confused alum
[Editor's note: This editor thinks they mean the recent string of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh.]
•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.
-a true feminist who care about true issues that are negatively affecting females
•@”@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?” Dang, being editor is complicated.  But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology. Like where you could click a rant and reply to it anonymously and then the person who originally submitted the rant could look at all the anonymous replies and reply to them. Awesomesauce
•morning rants are da bomb
•@”I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.
•It's always nice to pay for a class where the teacher doesn't teach.  Particularly an elementary mathematical modeling class where you have to find your own practice problems on the internet.
•@”What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to. Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married” This is a very logical feminist position. If only the Women’s Initiative were actually this logical.
•P.S. Please pass me elementary mathematical modeling teacher, even though you can't teach...
•Editor: About how many rants are submitted each day that break the rules and are not posted? jw
[Editor's note: Usually only a few. Depends on the day though. This editor can tell its finals season because Rants are getting angry!]
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling.  You make math tutors angry.
•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...

[Editor's note: Yes, but this editor's privacy settings are pretty strict.]
•@”Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.” That’s because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours. Please give me one single study that shows that women are being paid less than men when working the same jobs for the same amount of time. This is a non-issue and turns women away from feminist groups that ignore REAL issues facing women.
•@how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president?"" Actually, There are more women than men in both law schools and med schools. So you may want to check your facts.  Society is NOT ‘keeping women down’ and squashing their dreams. STOP PLAYING VICTIM! I’m a woman law student at AU. I have never encountered anyone telling me I couldn’t be a lawyer bc I’m a women. The fact is women CHOOSE lower paying jobs like teaching and social work more than men because many women ENJOY helping people more than making tons of money.
[Editor's note: This editor just wants to point out that there's a difference between having more women than men enrolled to study a particular subject and the rate of pay those women and men receive.]

•@You clearly didn't do any research - June O'Neil, formerly of the Congressional Budget Office, found that young women who have never had children make, after controlling for experience and education, 98 percent of what men make. She found that on the whole, there is an  unexplained gap of 8% between what ALL men and women make when controlling for these things. This is far too large of a gap, the gap in a perfect world would be zero - but it is also FAR less than ""77 percent,"" as one ranter said yesterday.

•Later on, on the drive home, I called her mom from a pay phone. I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail (the state looks down on sodomy). And that's about the time that B**** HUNG UP ON ME. Nobody likes you when you're TWENTY-THREE and I'm still more amused by pay phone calls. What the hell is call ID? My friends say I should act my age... what's my age again? What's my age again?
•The only forms of human contact I get anymore are punches to the ribcage and kicks to the stomach.  And I'm strangely okay with that.
•woke up spooning a trashcan #mylifeisrobcoy
•I've finally gotten the college experience; this entire year was one crazy whirlwind of an adventure. I'm scared that maybe it was too much of an adventure, and now no one will want to get serious with me. I promise I'm an amazing girl, I just needed my ""single"" year!
•I.  Hate.  Group.  Projects.  Nothing against my fellow group members, you're all great, I just hate feeling obligated to produce better work since we're all in this together...
•Love who you are.
Because God made you who you are for a reason and trying to be anyone else is an insult to His creation.
•Whoever ranted Springsteen by Eric Church lyrics is my hero. Can we be friends????
•@transfer who can't find friends: I transferred here 4 semesters ago, and although I have a lot of acquaintances, I wouldn't call any of them true friends. Just know you're not alone, this place can be pretty lonely, but maybe we'll bump into one another some day?
•@Desperate Housewives: I DON'T KNOW! DH has been my guilty pleasure for way too long.  I may go back and watch the first few seasons, as I don't really remember them at all.
•@Bullying Club: Tuesday the 17th, 4pm, Mudbox? (Posting this way in advance so you can respond with another time if that's not good.)
•Oh my bad I was completely wrong about how they were edited.
•I stay facebook friends with a girl from high school who I a absolutely hated (because she was mean was so mean to me) just so that I can take pride in knowing that my life is better than hers. And knowing that she peaked in high school gives me happiness. Is this wrong of me?
•Dear Eagle Rants Editor---Grow a pair you pussy
[Editor's note: This editor reads angry Rants all day and runs a business. So already got a pair, but thanks anyway, honey.]
•@”And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.” Um actually once the baby is viable (ie around 5 months) biology and the supreme court agree that it is NOT ‘just your body’. But it shouldn’t take you 5 months to realize a missed period.
•I was asked why materialism was a bad thing. I was so shocked that I couldn't come up with a coherent answer? What do other ranters think?
•The flowers are AU are so beautiful. Does anyone else take daily nature walks and stop and smell the flowers?
•@ “It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I hope someone as selfish as you never reproduces. I cannot wait to grow and nurture a life inside me. To do prenatal yoga. To read to my unborn baby. And to take care of the LIFE that is inside me. I do not judge those who choose not to have kids. That’s why we have many options for birth control. But to say that a baby living inside you is destroying your body? Wow, just wow.
•Can one be thankful without being religious or spiritual? I say yes but my friend says no because who are they thanking?
•@”Women's Initiative is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.” I agree. If our tuition money is paying for Women’s Initiative (a branch of student government), then why are Women’s Initiative leadership positions up for student government elections?
•When were hipsters invented and where did they come from? Does anyone know? I don't know any hipsters back where I come from.
•@”If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I always supported the idea that the government should never be able to force anything on people. Therefore, while I abhor the idea of abortion, I abhor even more the idea of an overly intrusive government restricting liberties. But to hear a fellow AU student talk so selfishly about a baby as if it is a cancer is almost more disgusting that the idea of an abortion.
•Editor, Sorry you had to deal with a dozen rule breaking rants on the 11th. It was probably just one really angry person ranting away. Don’t let that day ruin your faith in the eagle rants community.
[Editor's note: It's Ranters like you that keep this editor going!]
•@Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.” There was an event a few years back about choosing abstinence. Women’s Initiative protested it.
•@”This editor wouldn't want her classmates or friends to refrain from Ranting just because they know she's editing them. Make sense?” No not really. The rants are anonymous, so you wouldn’t know which ones were from your friends anyway. And if you know certain friends well enough to know their writing style, then they probably know you well enough to know that you are the editor even if you don’t publicly release that information.
•that awkward moment when your boyfriend thinks you ranted about him when it was really someone else in the same situation
•To the girl next door who keeps yelling at her boyfriend on the phone every night – please STOP. Sincerely, someone who is trying to study.
•Be converted. Follow the signs
•I have to pee -- but that means packing all my stuff up and taking it too the bathroom only to return minuets later :( On another note, my essay is due in 7 hours and I really haven't started it yet.
•I wish I could spend every night wrapped up in your arms. I shouldn't, (for now anyhow), but you make it so tempting...
•""It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes.""
Amen. I wish the best of luck to you, and I hope I receive the same in return. Just keep looking toward the future, seriously. That's what is getting me by now. Well, that and finally watching Heroes. XD
•@Desperate Housewives fan: I really don't know what I'm going to do. I know that other networks have tried to fill up the Sunday 9pm time slot, but that has been dedicated to DH for the longest time. :[ I don't know where you may want to go from here, but if you want to take a chance with a show in a whole different direction, may I recommend Breaking Bad?
•The last few weeks may be crashing down on my head, but through all the chaos of this, you pull me through it all. We have trudged through so much to get where we are, and while we may struggle with all the obstacles that face us now, I really believe we can make it. Thank you for never losing hope and making me so ridiculously happy again. I love you, rain or shine
•Note for TV characters everywhere: I know it's very dramatic and all, but angrily sliding things off of tables, desks, and other free-standing objects does not usually end well. Just saying. #avoidingworkatallcosts
•there are scary noises in the library at 5am.
•To the beautiful man wearing light blue shorts and dark khaki backpack in the Dav this morning, joking about putting out a fire with the barista... you are delicious, and seem really nice and funny. Even though I'm not brave enough to approach you, please continue to brighten my days by being incredibly sexy in the Dav. Please and thanks.
•See you at Dan Deacon on the 27th!
•I've been so stupid about guys lately that I literally should not be allowed to have a vagina.
•My boyfriend won't even hug me in public.  He claims it's because he hates PDA, but then he hugs all of his friends every time he sees them or says good bye or anything
•To all the stressed ranters, I suggest taking a walk through the neighborhood that is straight past and to the right of SIS.  It's called either rockwood or rookwood--I can never remember.  Either way, it's very peaceful and the fresh air helps.  Some light exercising at the gym with an iPod can work wonders as well.
I propose that instead of bickering back and forth about social issues on eaglerants everybody just post a tip on how to unstress.  Or you know, actually rant.
•Confession: I left AU after my freshman year, but I still read eagle rants religiously. Don't tell anyone ;)
[Editor's note: It'll be our little secret.]
•Aw dang, early morning Eagle Rants were starting to grow on me. But I'm sure the editor is doing her best to get it out and ready for us. :]
[Editor's note: Thanks for understanding, kind Ranter!]

Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




•Arrogance, Pessimism, and being Anti-social have helped me find the self confidence I've been missing for a long time. It gets lonely at times, but I truly believe it's worth it in the end when I achieve my life goals. If you feel like deep down your lacking an identity, try seeing the world as against you instead of around you. It may be the motivation you've been searching for. # Darth Vader Advice Column
•sheeeeeebz

•@""It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle"" When I first read this I initially thought it was about  typographic alignment. My bad. #DesignStudentProblems
•@Can we please cite who wrote the poetry at the end? I'm pretty sure ranting without citations is still plagiarism. And if you are writing your own poetry and want to remain anonymous, just sign it ""self"": Excuse me while I go gag.
•4/20 is right around the corner...i don't know why but that day just speaks to me
•@""I'm a GW Student. An AU friend told me about rants, and I've been reading them for awhile. I have lots of boyfriend issues too. Am I allowed to rant?""
Yay, welcome to the magical world of eagle rants =) I wish I could meet more people from the other DC schools, not that I don't love AU kids but DC could potentially be such an awesome ""college town"" if there was a lil networking between all of us!
•@""consistent sexual abuse of men"". obviously you didn't go to take back the night because you wouldn't be saying the awful things you're say. Male sexual abuse was addressed.
P.S. the whole world is a men's circlejerk. when do women get a turn?
•An LDR support group fo' reals? HUZZAH, HUZZAH! Please notify us when this is official!

•Does Editor have facebook? I can't find her there. :(
[Editor's note: Yes, but this editor's privacy settings are pretty strict.]
•@”Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.” That’s because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours. Please give me one single study that shows that women are being paid less than men when working the same jobs for the same amount of time. This is a non-issue and turns women away from feminist groups that ignore REAL issues facing women.
•@how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president?"" Actually, There are more women than men in both law schools and med schools. So you may want to check your facts.  Society is NOT ‘keeping women down’ and squashing their dreams. STOP PLAYING VICTIM! I’m a woman law student at AU. I have never encountered anyone telling me I couldn’t be a lawyer bc I’m a women. The fact is women CHOOSE lower paying jobs like teaching and social work more than men because many women ENJOY helping people more than making tons of money.
[Editor's note: This editor just wants to point out that there's a difference between having more women than men enrolled to study a particular subject and the rate of pay those women and men receive.]
•@original cold call ranter...yeah, totally wasn't talking about the same thing you were talking about...I was talking about solicitation calls, and yeah, it was in reference to a professor...sorry..
•UC World Politics hater: I completely agree with you. UC World Politics = so much unjustified ego.
•Why is this so much fun?

•You 100% did not deserve to get hired for that job and I'm sick of you taking good things away from good people just because you can. Plus, you're tacky and I hate you.
•@You clearly didn't do any research - June O'Neil, formerly of the Congressional Budget Office, found that young women who have never had children make, after controlling for experience and education, 98 percent of what men make. She found that on the whole, there is an  unexplained gap of 8% between what ALL men and women make when controlling for these things. This is far too large of a gap, the gap in a perfect world would be zero - but it is also FAR less than ""77 percent,"" as one ranter said yesterday.
•@Emotional Pain: Music.
•Honey, yo' nose sounds like a donkey blowing a horn. I understand that sometimes you just gotta sniffle, but other times you seriously just gotta BLOW. Please. Tissue yourself.
•Even though you're a million miles away/ when you hear born in the USA/ you relive those glory days/ from so long ago...
•When you don't wash your hands after using the restroom, you make me want to scrub everything. It still surprises me when you shower. (Sidenote, I thought hygiene was covered in elementary school. Why are college kids still not understanding how this soap-water-thing works???)

2012-05-01,AU,club,"•B, I miss you. Why can't things work out? It's too late for us. But you are LITERALLY PERFECT. PERFECT. Even though I recently learned something bad about you, I still think you're awesome. Am I delusional? I don't know. This is really bad... I want to see you everyday but I'm probably never going to see you again. When I see you, it's the best part of my day. The few times you've hugged me, my heart sinks. Why did you make me feel this way? It's so inconvenient. I both hate and love the fact that I at least know you.



•But you're making sure I was lying when I said I believe in clean breaks.
•I'm sorry I f*cked you over so hard. I didn't want to hurt you, but I know I really did. You got caught up in the hurricane that I'm standing in the eye of.
•Girl that new haircut is tragic, you literally look like a boy, and the track pants aren't helping.
•The Graphic Design History final isn't even that hard. You'll be way over prepared. Trust me.
•You are entitled to your own opinions about music but liking ""The Who"" doesn't make you a pseudo hippie. People are allowed to enjoy music from different time periods.
•Wait, when did consciousness become a physical entity? Physics fail.
•OIT is making me spend HALF AN HOUR with them on the phone, humiliating me by making me read and agree to documents, in order to lift a block due to ""Excessive Bandwidth."" Never mind that the documents say nothing about what counts as ""excessive bandwidth.""
OIT AND EAGLESECURE NEED TO BURN IN HELL
•@""cat facts"" yessss there is someone else out there who has pulled this prank on their friends
•Sometimes I wish my roommate would leave someday and never come back...
•I was dreading 24 hour quiet hours until I realized that I wouldn't have to hear your voice anymore. Then I smiled.
•@""It has to go somewhere because science says you can't create or destroy matter right?"" Your consciousness is not matter.
•If I was God, you'd all probably go to hell. I would also make you clean my burning book collection of Jeff Foxworthy poetry.
•Let's have a day where everyone reveals their true feelings for one another...

•""You must be hanging out with Comm people."" STOP HATING ON COMM.
•I love being an attractive, feminine girl no one would really pin as bisexual. It makes hooking up with hot girls that much more fun
•Psychics are not real. I don't care how much they seem to be real or how much they helped a police investigation. It's called cold reading and its not a magic trick. The famous skeptic James Randi challenged Allison Dubois multiple times to prove her psychic abilities on prime time TV and she denied the challenge every time. Why? Because its not real, and she knows it.
•Never go A2M!
•You just called consciousness matter??? Yes it's matter, but in reality it's a combination of different chemicals, proteins, enzymes, cells, neurons etc... in your brain that interact in a way that allows you to think, have memories, retain information. When you die those chemicals go back into the earth either through vaporization, boiling, etc... There may be a God, but your body and ""soul"" will become one with the earth and the universe... # Science is Beautiful
•@""where do we go when we die?"" if you're looking for a fairy tale ending to your life, there won't be one. Your body will be decomposed by micro organisms and the energy from it that comprised your consciousness will be fed back into the Earth, supplementing other forms of life. No matter or energy is destroyed, just converted and reused. You only get one life and one chance to live it, so cherish it.
•To the person who helped me get past chapter 5 of pottermore. I appreciate you, and glad to say I am a Hufflepuff.

SAME AS THE OLD BOSS
•Did you know that the first cat show was held in 1871 at the Crystal Palace in London? Mee-wow!
•Every additional day that I'm here makes me wish that much more that I'd sent in my transfer applications. So exhausted from the harassment and lack of friendships.
•@ “This is an example of the shallow and gossipy mentality that makes me want to transfer from AU.” Hate to break it to you hunny, but there are shallow people at any college. AU probably has the lowest percentage of shallow people you will find. Good luck trying to find a utopia void of any shallow young adults. Lol
•@”[Editor's note: Sunshine. Friends. Family. The pool. The beach. No or fewer classes. Free time. Good books. Summer films and TV shows. Summer rainstorms. Fireworks. Flip flops. Shorts. Impending Rants.]” Thanks editor. I less a little less sad now about getting rants only once a week.
[Editor's note: : )  ]
•@I'm in love with my best friend, but he's leaving in 4 days and transferring in the fall. Typical.” Welcome to the LDR club. You can do it if you put in the effort. True love is worth it. :)
•I meant colleges ""MOST"" like AU are BU, GW, NYU, not ""more like AU"". Sorry for the typo.
•Thanks for the good luck editor. I needed it. I hope the next editor is as nice as you in her editor's notes.
[Editor's note: Aww thanks. Hope all went well!]
•You're really only au cute, but I'm crushing so hard...
•@ ""I am obsessed with myself. That's why I tan in a bikini on the quad. I want all the shirtless frat guys to look at me. They are SO HAWT. Also, I love when the guys wear Vineyard Vines...it reminds me of Martha's Vineyard. I love my little!! ""
I sense a troll among us, trying to spur on debate...
•Isn't it just wonderful how when someone finally posts a complimentary message about the students of our college, so many people aim to completely tear that apart? Original poster, you give me hope as well, and don't let the haters ruin that vision.
•You always find a way to amaze me with just how rude you can be. I'm very happy to know it's not much longer before I don't have to deal with it any longer.
•Oh. My. God. I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I am so proud of you, Sarah McBride. I've only ever talked to you like twice in my life and you probably don't even know my name, but you are so inspiring. I am so happy for you and I wish you only the best. So much love and support!!!! <3
•I used to love Eagle Rants.  Now I find myself just getting depressed reading them - not that they're sad, they're just full of people criticizing each other and each others' views.  It's been nice knowing you Eagle Rants, but for my own sanity it's time to say goodbye.
•Why can't I stop watching Ancient Aliens?
•I made a rant about how my tongue hurts from eating this girl out and how blowjobs are always boring and I don't see it here, Ms. Editor.....
•My family taught me to be confident and audacious.  I know I come off as shy, but if circumstances were a little different, I would tell you that I love you in a heartbeat.
•Can people stop using their voice to talk on the silent floor at the library, please?

•B, I miss you. Why can't things work out? It's too late for us. But you are LITERALLY PERFECT. PERFECT. Even though I recently learned something bad about you, I still think you're awesome. Am I delusional? I don't know. This is really bad... I want to see you everyday but I'm probably never going to see you again. When I see you, it's the best part of my day. The few times you've hugged me, my heart sinks. Why did you make me feel this way? It's so inconvenient. I both hate and love the fact that I at least know you.
•But you're making sure I was lying when I said I believe in clean breaks.
•I'm sorry I f*cked you over so hard. I didn't want to hurt you, but I know I really did. You got caught up in the hurricane that I'm standing in the eye of.
•Girl that new haircut is tragic, you literally look like a boy, and the track pants aren't helping.
•The Graphic Design History final isn't even that hard. You'll be way over prepared. Trust me.
•You are entitled to your own opinions about music but liking ""The Who"" doesn't make you a pseudo hippie. People are allowed to enjoy music from different time periods.
•Wait, when did consciousness become a physical entity? Physics fail.
•OIT is making me spend HALF AN HOUR with them on the phone, humiliating me by making me read and agree to documents, in order to lift a block due to ""Excessive Bandwidth."" Never mind that the documents say nothing about what counts as ""excessive bandwidth.""

•Psychics are not real. I don't care how much they seem to be real or how much they helped a police investigation. It's called cold reading and its not a magic trick. The famous skeptic James Randi challenged Allison Dubois multiple times to prove her psychic abilities on prime time TV and she denied the challenge every time. Why? Because its not real, and she knows it.
•Never go A2M!
•You just called consciousness matter??? Yes it's matter, but in reality it's a combination of different chemicals, proteins, enzymes, cells, neurons etc... in your brain that interact in a way that allows you to think, have memories, retain information. When you die those chemicals go back into the earth either through vaporization, boiling, etc... There may be a God, but your body and ""soul"" will become one with the earth and the universe... # Science is Beautiful
•@""where do we go when we die?"" if you're looking for a fairy tale ending to your life, there won't be one. Your body will be decomposed by micro organisms and the energy from it that comprised your consciousness will be fed back into the Earth, supplementing other forms of life. No matter or energy is destroyed, just converted and reused. You only get one life and one chance to live it, so cherish it.

2012-06-03,AU,club,"The Washington Nationals topped the Atlanta Braves 2-0 June 2 at Nationals Park, in a game that saw two of baseball’s best young pitchers square off.
National’s Stephen Strasburg improved to 6-1 on the season after outdueling Atlanta’s Brandon Beachy, who came into Saturday’s contest with the lowest ERA in the majors. 
Strasburg threw seven razor sharp innings, striking out nine and only allowing four hits on 90 pitches.  
“After the first inning, I looked at [Mark] DeRosa and said, ‘He’s gonna be tough today to get anything going against,’ and he was,” Nationals outfielder Xavier Nady said. “When you throw 98, 99 and [are] throwing off-speed for strikes, you got your work cut out for you.” 
Strasburg is on a strict innings limit, but he felt like he could have pitched deeper into the game. 
""I felt like I was getting stronger as the game went on,” Strasburg said. “So it's tough, but it's [manager Davey Johnson’s] call."" 
Johnson’s call was to pinch hit outfielder Roger Bernadina for Strasburg in the bottom of the seventh. Bernadina, however, never received a plate appearance, as he was pinch hit for by Nady after the Braves brought lefty Jonny Venters out of the bullpen. 
Nady smoked a double off the right-field wall that scored Danny Espinosa for an insurance run that put the Nationals in front 2-0. 
Washington’s first run came on a home run from Jesús Flores in the fifth inning, the catcher’s second long ball of the season. 
Aside from the pitching showcase, another story from Saturday was the season debut of Michael Morse. After missing the season’s first 50 games with a strained lat muscle, Morse returned to the lineup Saturday and batted fifth. He finished the day 0-4, grounding out all four times to the shortstop. 
“I felt good”, Morse said. “Every at-bat, I felt more comfortable.”
Johnson was pleased with what he saw from Morse, who clubbed a team-high 31 home runs in 2011.
""He looked good,"" Johnson said. ""I said, ‘Don't get the idea that I'm gonna be defending for you,' but it worked out just perfect. He got four at-bats, and he should be fresh for the next game.""
Morse should help a lineup that has only mustered nine runs in the club’s last four games.
Tyler Clippard closed the game out for the Nats, retiring Atlanta in order in the ninth with two strikeouts. 
June 3’s matchup is also shaping up to be a great pitcher’s duel, with the Braves sending Tommy Hanson to the mound against Gio Gonzalez. Gonzalez is second in the National League in ERA, WHIP and strikeouts, while Hanson will be looking to help Atlanta earn its first win against the Nats this season.

2012-06-04,AU,club,"The Washington Nationals fell to the Atlanta Braves 3-2 at Nationals Park June 3 in the finale of the two-game weekend series between the clubs.
Atlanta’s Tommy Hanson settled down after a rocky start to improve to 6-4 on the season, while Gio Gonzalez took the loss for Washington and dropped to 7-2. 
The Nats have now lost four of their last five, as this two-game split followed a three-game sweep at the hands of the Miami Marlins. 
Washington jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first inning after back-to-back home runs from rookie outfielders. Steve Lombardozzi led off the bottom of the first with his first career homer, and fellow rookie Bryce Harper followed by hitting the first pitch he saw into the upper deck for a round-tripper. 
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, this marks the first time in modern baseball history that two rookies hit back-to-back home runs to start a game. 
“I thought the way we started the ballgame, we were gonna score some runs,” Nationals manager Davey Johnson said. “And then it seemed to die after that, but it was a tough game.”
Gonzalez had one of his shortest outings of the year, lasting just 4 2-3 innings. Gonzalez’s problem was not getting ahead of hitters.
“Especially good hitters like that, you try not to get behind on them, and when I did they made it work”, Gonzalez said. “They made me go out there and throw some pitches and make them in their counts.”
The 26 year-old lefty allowed seven hits, three earned runs and posted a season-low five strikeouts on 91 pitches. 
The Braves scored their first run in the third off a Dan Uggla double that scored Martin Prado to cut the deficit to 2-1. 
Atlanta then scored two off Gonzalez in the fifth to take a 3-2 lead that would hold up as the final score. 
Gonzalez threw two wild pitches, walked two (one intentionally), and allowed two hits in the fifth frame. The big hit came off the bat of Jayson Heyward, whose two-out single into left scored two to put the Braves up 3-2 and end Gonzalez’s day. 
With one out in the bottom of the fifth, Harper tried to stretch a shot off the right-center field wall into a triple, but was thrown out at third to end Washington’s potential threat. 
“When you’re hitting, and you got the middle of the lineup coming up behind you, you get in scoring position,” Johnson said. “He’s just a young, aggressive player and I like to see it, but that’s a situation I need [him] in scoring position.”  
When asked the same question as his manger, the young star had a similar outlook. 
“I thought he [Andrelton Simmons] had to make a perfect throw, in which he did,” Harper said. “Maybe I should’ve [stayed at second].”
Michael Morse went hitless in his second game since coming of the disabled list for the Nats, putting the slugger at 0-8 with three strikeouts.
The Nationals will next host the New York Mets for a three-game series beginning June 5. Jordan Zimmermann (3-5) will take the mound for Washington Tuesday, while righty Chris Young (4-3) will make his season debut for the Mets. First pitch is set for 7:05 p.m.

2012-07-11,AU,club,"The Washington Nationals completed a three-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants in their 1924 uniforms in a unique 6-5 walk-off victory on July 5th, Turn Back the Clock Night. The night paid homage to another one-run Washington victory, the 1924 World Series victory over the New York Giants.
With the score knotted at 5-5, Nationals first baseman Adam LaRoche hit into what should’ve been a double play to send the game to extra innings. 
Instead, San Francisco shortstop Brandon Crawford bounced a throw to first that Brandon Belt was unable to come up with, allowing Bryce Harper to score the game-winning run. Ryan Zimmerman, who was on the basepaths as the play unfolded, went through what he was thinking at the time.
""Hopefully, Adam's fast enough [to beat the throw],” Zimmerman said. “Well, actually, I know Adam's not fast enough. Hopefully, they mess up."" 
The Giants messed up, and the Nats and LaRoche are happy they did.
""Not the way we drew it up, but we will take it,"" LaRoche said. 
The Nats might not have drawn up that particular play, but the at-bats leading up to it could not have been any better. 
Nationals rookie Tyler Moore led the ninth inning off with a pinch-hit double. Fellow Nat rookie Steve Lombardozzi followed with a beautiful sacrifice bunt that allowed him to reach first after a fielding error from San Francisco closer Santiago Casilla. Harper then drove in the game-tying run with an RBI single to right.
“There’s no quit in the ball club,” Washington manager Davey Johnson said. “There’s a lot of character on this ball club.”
The manager’s statement was echoed by Nat All-Star shortstop Ian Desmond.
 “We feel capable to come back from any deficit,” Desmond said. “We obviously believe in ourselves. We’ve been there. We’ve done that this year. We’ve won so many one-run ball games that … we always think we have a chance; we don’t ever throw in the towel.” 
That character and never-say-die attitude helped spark the Washington rally in the seventh that cut a four-run deficit to one. 
Desmond smacked the first pitch he saw from Giants starter Matt Cain over the fence in right-center field for his 15th homer of the year, and Danny Espinosa promptly followed with a home run of his own. The back-to-back blasts were the fifth time the Nats have completed the feat this season. 
Harper doubled in pinch hitter Mark DeRosa later in the seventh to make it 5-4, and Washington would overcome the Giants two innings later.

2012-08-06,AU,club,"Editor’s Note: This week’s Eagle Rants brought to you from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. 
•Can I please join the class of 2015?  Hell, 2017 would be fine too.  Judging by the people I've met so far in 2016, I'm not sure I'll be able to go through my life being associated with them.
•I really hope The Eagle doesn't record IP addresses.  I would feel weird if people knew how much I already hate my own class, and I haven't actually met any of them yet.
TOR for the win from now on!
[Editor’s Note: The only information we know is what time it was sent. You’re safe ;) 
•To everyone:Shut up. Really though. Can we, as a campus,make a committment to going one year without getting our panties in a wad about every single political, SG, Greek Life or RHA event to happen? Really though. Someone gives a speech, or SG doesn't give money to your ""Oppressed Puppies in Northern Africa"" club and by all of y'alls Facebook statuses, it's like the world is ending. Everyone just relax.
•All I do is pin, pin, pin, no matter what. Pinning stuff I can't afford-d-d-d, can't give it up! #newpersonalmotto
•We're annoyed by some of the people on the Class of 2016 too. But, don't judge us based on a few active people on that page. We just want to be loved :)
Sincerely,
The Silent Majority of the Class of 2016
•Okay, everyone needs to calm down about the Class of 2016. Yeah, sometimes they don't quite know how to act, but at least they didn't try to secede from Student Government like the Class of 2015. Love, a Junior
•**** Those stupid diaper looking high waisted cut off jean shorts. Ladies, you don't look cute to any of us
•""LIKE OMG GUYZ! I DON'T KNOW HOW TO  FIND WHAT BOOKS I NEED FOR MY CLASSES"" ""GUYZ...HELP ME REGISTER FOR THIS! OMG I'M DESPERATE!!"" Class of 2016, there is something called american.edu, and it has loads of information. All of the cool kids are on it, and you should check it out too!
•I've never been one to read into signs, but this is pretty ominously coincidental.
•Got my tuition bill in the mail just a week and a half before it's due.  Not to say that I shouldn't have seen it coming, but a little more warning than that would have been nice.  And when I called AU Central, the first thing their recording says is that they aren't even pretending to stick to the August 1st deadline.  Way to drop the ball on this one, guys.  I'd expect this screw-up from a lower tier university, but not AU.
•""blah blah blah will be available to the student through their own portal"" also known as maze. really AU, can we not use those billions of tuition dollars towards organization?
•Bu, bu, but I wana be a first year! Goddamit Hogwarts, why didn't you send my owl T.T
•Some people here are so evil!
•Screw Michael Phelps!
•Getting into the class of 2016 ""party group"" was a fantastic decision. These kids are hilarious.
•Seeing the class of 2016 Facebook group has made me seriously consider transferring.
•As a 2016er I have talked to a majority of people who don't partake in the Facebook page and we want all upperclassmen to know there are normal freshmen out here. Some loser freshmen who makes a page for himself to gain popularity with his fellow freshmen is a loser and no one cares and like everyone on the page who posts all the time doesn't have a life during summer. Really hope there are normal freshmen at AU.
•Lochte! Come on!
•I miss tenders.
•lol
•@It'saTrap I'd join that PAC.  No, but really, you're a badass XD.
•Some of those male gymnasts are damn cute.
•GO USA!!
•Dan Cathy could have supported anything, ANYTHING, other than anti-gay organizations. Was St.Jude's hospital so flush with money to refuse some Chick-Fil-a bucks? Was there one less person with leukemia or cancer because of the stupid and useless donations to the Family Research Council? Come on!
•I like to support Team USA by screaming ""You suck!"" whenever athletes from other countries appear on screen. Helps to build morale.
•2016ers....just ew.
•Freshmen, stop fighting with each other on Facebook. WONK is your true enemy.
•since the incoming freshman are reading this, let me just say this: admissions knows about your page. and the videos. and the photos. and the strange sense of obsession you all have with each other
•Your nickname in my head is Blowjob Lips #3.  How much respect do you think I have for you?
•wingstop from Chicago !!!!
•wtf there are no chase banks in dc and there is no buffalo wild wings or wingstop wtf
•why do dc sport team sucks wtf
•I'm so excited for the women's gymnastics olympic finals. You have no idea.
•can we all get out of high school and stop complaining about freshmen?
•People hate my class already because of the same three posters. OMG
•@Adult language: THANK YOU SO MUCH! If more people understood this...
•DC in less than 3 weeks. Can't wait to get home!!!
•To the hot guy at work:
There's only a few weeks left until I quit my job so can we please finally just hookup in the storage closet?
•Hey guys, remember when you all were incoming freshmen and like, ""lawlz everyone on the facebook page for my class sucks,"" and then you got to AU and realized that only the lame people post all the time and you made friends and it was awesome? Give the 2016ers the benefit of the doubt. There are bound to be a few chill ones. I hope.
•So far everyone I've met who's going to AU absolutely does not get sense of humor.  To them, I'm just going to be the weird girl who celebrates Half Christmas and wears snapbacks and pinnies.
•I assure the upperclassmen that there are many members of the class of 2016 who dgaf about the Facebook group and are actually relatively normal.  The obsessive, stalkerish clique that dominates the page has already been socially f*cked over by the rest of us
•@class of 2016- thank you so much for your  Facebook page it makes coming home at night wasted that much more fun, but can you please go back posting videos it hard to read posts when you are seeing double
•The class of 2016 page on facebook has three types of people in it. The first is people who constantly post, but in their posts show how bored and lonely they really are. The second type is people who want to look like a badass by posting topics such as ""Which is worse, slavery or the Holocaust?"", but are actually pussies. The third is people that don't post at all, and just avoid the page all together. So to all of the upperclassmen who criticize us, I deeply apologize for the few that ruin the reputation majority.
•I hate how everyone is judging the Freshman/First-year students before they even get to AU. Imagine if they did that to us when we came in. I just think everyone deserves to have an equal opportunity to develop friendships like we did, rather than starting off being hated. Think about it.

•@ Stop buying from corporations:
I would, but unfortunately, the government ain't making anything that competes with big business and small businesses are almost non-existent in my area. Where else do I get the things I want or the things I need? I'd have to make it all myself. Big business is taking over. They almost built a Wal-mart right in my home town.
•@ F*** People.
You're right. People are the problem. But in regards to my response to ""Stop buying from corporations,"" we have become dependent on Corporations and Government. We make money just to spend it either on stuff we need (or in many times stuff we don't need or don't even want). And if we don't spend it, the government takes it. Things are f***ed up.
•I'm starting to look old.
•The student evaluations of professors seems to have disappeared from the AU portal.  What gives?  A friend at GW has a professor who previously taught here and I was going to check out his ratings for her.  Did they rename it?
•This is just weakness.  Other people have it a lot worse than I do.

•Does this year's incoming class suck academically? Each year we get a press release about how the incoming class is the greatest class in AU history in regard to SAT and GPA statistics.  This year we haven't heard anything.  My gut feeling reflects my concern that AU settled for second best for the incoming freshmen.  I hope we won't see a rankings drop again.

•I think that there is a fine line between debates and arguments. And my class definitely dances on that line. I don't see anything wrong with debates because it sharpens the mind and opens it up to different perspectives. I've personally learned a lot during these debates/arguments. However, I see how we can seem very immature. Can an upperclassman who will not curse me out tell me what you think about my view of this situation?
•The more I read into the 2016 group the more I get scared that I totally made the wrong choice...-Hope its the right choice

2012-11-09,AU,club,"The U.S’s most infamous con artist is coming to AU on Nov. 15.
Frank Abagnale will be speaking to students at 7:00 p.m. in MGC University Club. The Kennedy Political Union will host the event. 
Abagnale started his career as a con man in the 1960s. During that time he cashed $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and escaped from police custody twice while pretending to be an airline pilot, an attorney, a college professor and a pediatrician. 
When he was 21 he was caught by the French police but served less than five years in prison before he was released on the condition that he help the U.S. federal government fight crime.
Since then he has developed and implemented numerous fraud prevention programs for the FBI and has been selected as a member of CNN Financial News’s “Pinnacle 400”, for his success in his field.
He published an autobiography titled “Catch Me If You Can” in 1980. The book was later turned into a film directed by Steven Spielberg and a Tony-Award winning musical.

• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums.

• @Club athletes: Well, The Eagle should first focus on actually covering its lesser known Division I sports, such as cross country and track or swimming, and then worry about club sports. We have some really awesome athletes who don't even get a sentence in the school paper, and as a member on one of those lesser known teams, it is really rough not getting any recognition for competing at the varsity level. I actually met someone who didn't even know our track team existed. Seriously, work on that.

• Thank you AU Methodists for the amazing tribute you guys had for the fallen troops on the quad. I was deeply touched, and I really did not expect something like that at AU. Once again, as a veteran with too many good friends to count on those KIA lists, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. I will forever respect you all for that.

• Happy birthday to the United States Marine Corps! 237 years as the tip of America's spear. First to fight!
• @Can someone explain why someone yelled “sell your house” at Neil Kerwin in that Caus video?: So I've stayed out of responding to the CAUS rants, because most of them would just lead to giant and pointless fights. That said, for factual clarification I'll jump in. People were screaming ""sell your house"" because AU pays for his house. Our tuition dollars go towards his personal residence. By selling his house, AU would be saving millions of dollars that could go to other, more important services.
• My hope has always only ever been to do hard work in service to my country, instead of staying comfortably at home only serving myself.  I can find that on the enlisted side just as well as I can an officer.  Commissioning is not an act, it's a process, and so too is becoming a man who people can trust.  That's the real goal.
• Why are the Spanish-speaking people at this school SO EFFING LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS? It's the SILENT FLOOR of the library, this is the third time I have heard loud Spanish-speaking people loudly speaking Spanish on the SILENT floor. You are abhorrent, shut the hell up. 
• hopefully I didn't make it awkward last night. I know you have a boyfriend, but you're cute and I'm cute, so we should get together soon.
• Wow, look at all these tools actually defending CAUS. Why do CAUS members feel the need to actually legitimize themselves via Eagle rants? The whole school hates you, so just crawl back into the hole you crawled out of and stay there!

• That awkward moment when everyone thinks The CAUS is spamming Eagle Rants with pro-CAUS rants, despite the fact that no CAUS members have actually submitted Eagle Rants. But then again, I guess every piece of information that doesn't fit your narrow worldview that protesting is bad must be summarily ignored.

• @""America's spear"": Why do people think it's cool to glorify violence? America shouldn't be spearing people with wars and killing innocent civilians, thus creating more enemies for America, not to mention pain, death, and destruction for other citizens of the world. How about we try helping each other by eradicating disease and poverty.

• I keep fantasizing about my boyfriend's best friend. I wouldn't never cheat on my boyfriend. But sometimes I wish the best friend would just rape me. Am I messed up in the head for wanting that? 
• relationships are so hard. but when it's worth it, you fight hard to love the other person in the way they deserve. it's exhausting, but it's beautiful, and each season of pain eventually passes. this is why i don't understand open marriage girl. you deserve someone who WANTS to love you in the way you need. that's the person you should spend your life with.

• Someone made a queer of the quad tumblr... The ofthequad urls need to stop
• Clarification. Your tuition dollars go to his SALARY, with which he can do whatever he pleases. Honestly, CAUS is literally comprised of the stupidest people I know. 
• Because this got censored: if you want tuition to stop raising, stop expecting nice things like more green initiatives, new buildings, better salary for faculty/staff, better professors, more club support, dorm renovations. If you want the experience at AU to keep improving, tuition has to get raised. Stop being selfish and only thinking about yourselves- think about the rest of the community and the students to come. Hate to break it to you, CAUS, but money doesn't grow on trees, and your antics aren't helping our endowment...

• @""Liberals R. Tools” You are an ignorant child.  But I forgive you.  You know not what you do.""  Nice try, schmuck.  You idiots have backrupted the country and turned the USA into upper-Mexico.  Don't even try to take the moral highground here, you pretentious tool.

• JUST KIDDING. I was too curious. To Texas boy: if you meet her, I'll give you the biggest bro hug ever. that's awesome.  To cutie White House girl: OMG HE FOUND YOU!! have fun you two :P
• The 20 or so core members of the CAUS are the same people involved in the new campaign to get better pay for the TDR workers and more benefits.  Welcome to the real world kiddos.  If you don't want tuition increases you can't demand additional costs that don't matter to most students.

• @""I agree! Forget the student government and hall councils, you're right!"": Let's seriously get on this!
• “Yeah Obama authorized drone strikes which killed civilians and children. Its a tragedy."": actually it's more than simply tragic. This President who prematurely received the Nobel Peace Prize has repeatedly violated Pakistani sovereignty and international law. Also, as to Romney taking us back 50 years: if moving ""Forward"" means killing hundreds of innocent men, women and children in the name of national security, please send me back to the 50s or 60s!!

• As a student in SOC, I'd agree with the Hufflepuff label. We're good finders, and I think most of us pursue journalism because we think it's the way to do right. (Everything else, like SIS Gryffindor, SPA Slytherin, etc. is way too spot on)
• @""I, too, publicly masterbate.""  The sarcasm is strong with this one.  I'm just wondering if the generic male population has an aversion to subconsciously rearrange his stick and berries when he's watching tv, reading, etc.  And its not like I was doing any major movement underneath, my hand was just sitting there.  But sure I'll join you at the Dav, good thing I just bought a trench coat.
• I HATE THIS SCHOOL
• @'the lesser of two evils"" correction: Oh my god you are so right.  I'm not being sarcastic at all-I read that over and said to myself, ""Wtf did I write?!""  You have every right to call me out on that.  I promise I'm not actually that stupid, I wrote that rant at like 6AM after a 16 hour stint at the library, so I wasn't fully functioning.  My apologies, and you sir/madam win the “Correct such a blatant idiot mistake” award. Thank you for your service.

• This girl was going out of her way to text me and I thought it was obvious she was trying to show she was interested.  I’m interested too, so I asked her out.  She said yes, but when we tried to set up an actual time, she turned around and started talking about how busy she is, almost like it's a chore for her to make time for me.  Can any ladies out there give me some perspective on this?  I know it's finals, but I don’t feel like things are exactly starting off on the right foot.
• Trapped in a study room with frat boys. Cool it with the axe.
• The Eagle's list of best films is hilariously terrible. 2012 wasn't a super strong year for (at least, domestic) film, but in WHAT UNIVERSE was Dark Knight Rises one of the best films of the year??? I think you're just having residual good feelings from Dark Knight. I enjoyed TDKR like most people, but from a critical standpoint, it was pretty weak.

You get so explosively angry and I just can't handle it! I want to tell you how I feel but how can I when you just blow up like that? Just stop bottling everything up and talk to me.

• Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways

I recommend the books ""Why We Love"" by Helen Fischer and ""The Truth About Love"" by Patricia Love. 
• @bf checking out other girls: I check out other guys in front of my bf because I like watching him get jealous. It helps me affirm that he still loves me. Yes, I know I'm insecure. Lots of family issues growing up. I'm guessing your bf just wants to be reminded that you still love him because deep down he is insecure. Have you told him how much it hurts you? 
• True life the people who work at Capital one are the friendliest human beings on earth
• I wish okcupid would let you search by college rather than just by city. I'm too lazy to have a relationship with a GW boy, but I keep getting GW boys as my matches. Why are more AU guys not on okcupid? Or maybe they are, they are just searching for other guys and therefore aren't showing up on my matches. Ahh.
• @treated like a wife: How long have you been together? Thy is totally normal after 9 to 12 months. Even faster if you are living together.  The ""high"" of love at the beginning is nature's way of getting you to reproduce. It's a flood of dopamine to your brain. But it can't go on forever. You only have so much dopamine in your brain. And if you stayed in te once sauce stage of love, you would never get anything done in life
• Is Eagle rants ever going to create a spin off for all the ""I still love you, come back"" rants that seem to be infiltrating rants like a virus?
• How long is a normal time for a guy to be mad at his gf after a fight? (and during finals time)
[Editor’s Note: My mom always said to never go to sleep angry or you’ll have bad dreams, so I would say until the next time you sleep.]
• No one understands me but you. I don't know what I would do without you. Please don't leave.
• I've always identified as straight as I've always been sexually and emotionally attracted to guys, but in the past few years I've been really aroused by women...I'm still into guys and never have crushes on girls, since I've never been able to connect emotionally in a way that was more than friends. Am I bisexual? I'm not concerned or anything with labels. I'm just curious as to how people would identify me.
• There's a guy in my 8:55 anthro class who's super obnoxious and kind of nerdy...who I think is totally sexy. Your forearms do it in for me. I'll miss you, blonde guy with glasses.
• @ ""I’ll start the bidding at 61 pages not including works cited.  I’m sure people can top that.""
I wrote two books. Both 600 pages, due out in February called ""No Fat Chicks Allowed in TDR"" and ""Wrinkly Balls: Now With Extra Alan Arkin.""
• @""TO THE PEOPLE WHO RANT ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY MISS SOMEONE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT""
HOW CAN WE EVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF WHIRLWIND OF EMOTION THIS FINE GENTLERANTER IS TRYING TO EXPRESS WITHOUT THE PUNCTUATION?
• I'm so lonely, but I'm grateful. My friend group threw me under the bus and now I pretty much have no one here, but I'm still happy. I've always been afraid of losing everyone, and now I see the truth - loneliness isn't the worst thing that could happen to a person, and it's better than sticking with people who make you feel like the worst version of yourself. You start seeing the great things in life.
• @“Since when has ‘being white’ made somebody unable to speak up about diversity?"" So you're saying that only Caucasians are privileged, but that's a wild assumption.  'Check your privilege' applies to us all; we are all attending a private university, so don't think that my skin color gives me any advantage over anybody else here.  In fact, it inhibits me- for example, I can't form a White Student Alliance to discuss diversity issues, or a 'Men's Initiative' and get school funding.  
• @ ""Sorry, but the people who are putting on ‘shopping while black’ are really just being racists to white people"" ... you realize that racism toward white people doesn't exist, right? Racism requires a power structure that other races in the US don't have access to. Prejudice toward white people exists, but omg if I never heat the phrase ""racist toward white people"" again it will be TOO SOON.
• I'm like 87% sure that my professor is actually setting me up to fail his final. We have a final paper and he is giving me different instructions than he gave other people in our class...
• Where can you go find all the old eagle rants?
• Either the girls staring at me think I'm handsome or my penis is hanging out of my pants and some stray cats latched on to it for warmth.
• God, I always thought people had at least a glimmer of personality until I met you. At first I was so interested since we share the same interests, but you're the most boring person I've ever met. I've gone out of my way to be quirky and weird and I know you think it's all hilarious. SO WHY DON'T YOU DO ANYTHING CLEVER. Sigh. I need an interesting guy.
• I feel like you smile bigger when you see me :) which makes my heart literally skip a beat. I can't wait to get back from break so I can see you again and make sure I'm right about this.
• Whooppps that I think I like you but what am i so afraid of rant was a joke... Meant to be sung to the tune of that David Cassidy song ""I think I love you"". Reread the rant, lol, and then carry on with your day 
• The Eagle editor is hot, I don't know if you guys have seen him in action but ohmygod what a cutie
• I foud where all the attractive guys at AU have been hiding, but if I told you all I'd have to kill you soo
• @“hoo-ha is actually the worst euphemism for vagina""--""vagina"" is a euphemism itself.  It's just Latin for ""sheath (of a sword)"". And ""penis"" just means ""little tail"". And now you know; and knowing is half the battle.
• It's good to know that people will still get As by hooking up with their professors. Stay classy folks!
• Here's the thing, ""I don't want to ruin the friendship"" is a terrible reason to turn down someone who asked you out. My working up the courage to ask you out destroyed our friendship. At that instant, we're not friends anymore, and our relationship can take two possible paths: 1) you say yes and our relationship becomes deeper or 2) you say no and our relationship takes a major step backwards that can take just as long to repair as if we were dating and broke up. I already made my choice, now it's your turn. 
• Never in my wildest dreams, never in all my preconceived happy notions of it, did I ever think that college would be this lonely.
• @""Alright eaglerants lets see who has the best claim to complaining about their finals."" I may not have you beat at word count, but I have to write 24 pages AND work two 9-hour overnight shifts doing heavy manual labor. Does that count?
• I'm seriously so sick of everyone complaining about finals. We all have to study and write papers and none of us are getting any sleep. Your negativity is only making everyone else pissed so stfu!
• I had sex (very LOUD sex) while my roommate was in the room and I'm not even going to pretend that I'm sorry because in a few days I'll never see her again and the sex was amazing. thanks, chief
• @person who responded to my remarks on why I don't go clubbing, thank you, very good to know there are other introverts at this school

• All Chinese people look alike.
• Sara Bareilles--Winter Song. So beautiful!
• @ So, I’m a gay girl, but have no idea where to meet other gay girls/lesbians -- you should definitely go to qwac events next year! there are a lot of gay ladies there to meet to be friends with (and then to later possibly date)
• good lord, y'all ranters need to get your sick-ass slut-shaming under control. when you try to instill puritanical bullshit on someone else, it ultimately reflects poorly on you. you are the one who comes off like an idiot for thinking that you know better about how to conduct someone else's sex/love life, and for thinking sexual behavior is one size fits all. 
• I notice a lot of rants about ROTC guys, have you guys thought of introducing yourselves? Most of them dont bite, unless you are into that.
• I think my bf is friend zoning me..
• It's not what you think, just one more little bet,
Just another cigarette, just one more drink.
• I'm digging my own grave
• jesus the only thing cool going on in eagle rants right now is that dude hooking up with his hot professor. everything else is terrible, racist, misogynistic,  awkwardly immature and ignant. 
• “Sorry, but the people who are putting on ‘shopping while black’ are really just being racists to white people."" first, what event are you referencing? second, is this a f*cking joke? the idea of SWB draws ATTENTION TO EXISTING RACISM AGAINST BLACK AMERICANS IN THE US. so no, it's really not racist to point out societal inequities and racial profiling, it's progressive. also, the entire AU campus is the white student alliance so you good on that one. #BYE.

So call me, maybe?
• AU's gender ratio is only marginally worse than the national average for private schools.  Think about that next time you blame AU's gender ratio for being single.  In fairness the large gay male population skews it a bit further, but you have all of DC available to you.  
• The other day in the basement of the library I saw a damn fine ROTC guy bend down to pick something up. I didn't even care if my group project members saw me stare. Mami likeee

• I'm really a cool guy once you get to have your face on my testicles.
• @• Why are we both so busy? Seeing you is more or less the highlight of my week, but it happens so infrequently. If only I didn’t find you so intriguing - then I wouldn’t feel so breathless around you and I could pretend that I wasn’t enthralled by your charm. This is one of the sweetest rants I have ever heard! I hope you get to see each other more often and keep in touch over break!
• @pull yourself together: hey. F*ck you. 
• @i hooked up with my professor...Note to self: start going to office hours
• Well that settles it with gender ratios and all the lonely people, gentleman it's obvious what we have to do....become male escorts
• @ ""So I’m really into this guy, but I’m embarrassed because I have zero experience…guys of eagle rants, is this bad?"" I think it depends on the guy. I'm a guy with zero experience so I would personally prefer someone who has no experience too. But that's just me.
• God Damn it I'm tired of being the lonely male nerd, I wanna be the nerd who gets laid!
• @ ""When people ask me why I don’t go clubbing or to parties the reason is simple: I hate most people. People are annoying, rude, and can be genuinely unpleasant, include loud obnoxious music and that fact most of them are drunk and you have my reasoning for being an introvert."" This is exactly how I feel! The majority of people are hurtful, annoying, and stupid.
• Sleepy Hahas: ACTIVATE

• The nicest thing a resident can do for their RA is agree when the RA tries to enforce policy. If your RA asks people to quiet down in the lounge when you're studying, please be an amazing resident and ask the same. 
• My theory: It makes me feel better that I'm not the only one who feeling completely lonely here. Everyone honestly acts so happy and put together, but really, I think most of us are miserable and lonely. Everyone just puts on a happy face which continues the cycle because no one knows that anyone is hurting. Seriously I don't know if it's just AU or other colleges as well, but so many people I know are transferring because they are miserable here.

""Vagina"" is for anthropology feminists who take their babies to class and get mad when their entitlement is threatened. 
• @Since when has ‘being white’ made somebody unable to speak up about diversity?  Caucasians are just as diverse as Blacks and Hispanics; just because you’re Black or Hispanic doesn’t make you any more diverse then anybody else, let alone an accepting person and ‘diversity expert.’... stfu no one ever said white people were less diverse, and if they did tell them to stfu too. 
• Haha I'm feeling spiteful tonight. TAKE THAT!
• I'm beginning to hate myself but I can't stop making these choices.  People don't respect me because I don't respect myself and I don't know what to do about it. 
• @If a person cries and no one is around to hear it…that's sad.
I cried the other day right next to my gf when she was sleeping. It's not sad; it's better to cry alone, otherwise it's a cry for attention. Besides, if men cry, they cry alone, by themselves and never mention it to anyone.

I reported the incident to Facebook by clicking the designated button, but Facebook did not remove the posts (at least not yet). I want to warn the girl (she can't see it bc he blocked her from seeing the posts), but I don't want my name involved. What can I do? I tried creating a fake account to email her @facebook.com email but apparently that doesn't work. Suggestions?
• I am totally going to fail this final and I don't even care. I just want to get the heck out of that class. It's been torture all semester. GPA? Yeah, done with that. Goodbye smug students and even smugger prof. 
• I can attest that I am a certifiable bad *ss. Re-wrote my entire research paper in a little over 12 hours. And I still have time left to edit before submission at noon. Given, I probably wouldn't be here if I had actually worked on the paper over the last 2 weeks, but eh, let's save that discussion for another day. In the meantime, BAM.

• @I'm sick of only having feelings for people who can never know I have them""--- Don't think like that!! You have nothing whatsoever to lose by telling someone your feelings for them! The worst he or she will say is a surprised or polite ""oh, thank you. . . . But I'm sorry I don't feel the same way."" There's a high likelihood the person you like may like you back!

• @Ask me out already!!- little clue as to who this is, or who you like, would be really helpful!
• @""that actually would make me even more willing/(I'm not sure if this is for me though)"" (Dec. 6 wanting to date before frequent sex)-- Sorry I only just saw this! You sound really interested :)

• @I'm not a slut but my attitude toward sex is YOLO. . .--- spoken like a true slut. I've been right where you are now. Trust me. Stop screwing around, get tested, and work on truly getting to know yourself better. Then you'll start attracting men that not only will want you in bed, but who will cherish you for all you are.
• @""Damnit I miss you and I'd do anything to hear your voice right now. Except contact you."" -- Contact him. It's worth it. You'll always regret it if you don't. He may still love you.

• @""I don't know what it is, but I'm stuck on you. . .""-- talk to the person! Seriously you should reach out! You have nothing to lose!
• @""Why are we both so busy? Seeing you is more or less the highlight of my week, but it happens so infrequently."" -- you should reach out to him/ her directly and say this. I guarantee you they'll really appreciate it. They may even feel the same about you!
• @I think I like you but what am I so afraid of?""-- That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. If you like him you like him. He also might be much larger than you'd expect. You'll never know if you don't try.
• @""So I'm really into this guy, but I'm embarrassed because I have zero experience.""-- That isn't bad at all, he'll likely respect you more (if he's a good guy). Don't worry, I know a lot of girls and guys in the same situation as you.

He said that's not the case but I still feel like this....anyone else in similar situations? WHAT should I do??
• My boyfriend and I have been dating for a while. He checks out other girls openly in front of me, claiming that its normal for guys to look at other girls when they are in committed relationships. This honestly is crushing my self-esteem and making me feel sex-appeal-less and ugly. Is this normal behavior on his part...?

• Awkward Penguin over here

Stop perpetuating racism by putting on events like this.

• Speaking as a guy, I would never be unfaithful to a girl and I would never willingly help a girl cheat on her boyfriend either. If I found out that crap was going on, I'd lose all interest in you immediately. You can dump your boyfriend if you want to (sounds like he deserves it), but you should be honest with people about your relationship status.
• Person with the brother, you sound like a good person. Hope everything gets better for you two. :/ 
• Pot smoking hedonists? This makes me want to be a libertarian even more!
• Yeah... my brother relapsed a day later.  Sucks.  I had hope after the emergency room since he seemed so much happier, but I guess he just doesn't want to be sober right now.  The hardest thing about it is that I know he's suffering and every instinct I has says that I need to help him, but there's literally nothing I can do if he doesn't want to be sober.
• What does everyone think about putting a Cosi where the McDonalds used to be?
• Dear fellow ranters: I would like to just say that I love AU and am really glad that I have the opportunity to go here! To all those who are having a tough time this holiday: please hang in there! The season is tough but the pain you're going through now will make spring so much sweeter. PLEASE do not hurt yourselves–even if you think you're alone, you're not (you have your fellow ranters, at least)! Things will get better <3

You control so much of your life, you really do have the power to change things.  Please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if it gets really serious.  Or, talk to anyone-a parent, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker…it’ll surprise you how many people really truly care for you.
• Whoever you are with the detoxing brother-you're an awesome person and an even better brother.  Friends come and go--sure you could have been partying somewhere like those kids across the street--but family lasts forever.  Props to you for helping your brother through a difficult time. 
• I totally fell in love with the girl who cut my hair today.  And then I forgot to tip her.
• I think I'll start talking to girls.  What is the point of being completely awesome and hilarious and really really really ridiculously good looking if I don't talk to anyone?
• I feel bad for the basketball players...they only got four days off from this whole  entire break. I plan on going to the first home game when we come back from break. who's with me? :) 
• @I really want to ask the cute dance team girl from across the hall out to coffee on Nov. 5 you probably should ;) hahaha yes, I am that bored that I went  all the way back to November rants...
• What does it mean if i enjoyed high school way more than I enjoy college right now?
• Drunk snapchat is the best snapchat. 
• When did you become such a shallow, self-centered, groupie? It's like I don't even know you anymore. When we met I admired how you didn't care what people thought of you. Now all you seem to care about is feeling popular and ""in"" with your friend group, since you never had that in high school. Why don't you think about the choices you're making before you keep going down this road. You can stop anytime, you just have to want to live a moral life. You used to think that personal integrity and values matter. What happened to you?
• Russian women are finnneee!
• Surgeries suck :'(
• If you are suicidal, seek help from a therapist. Preferably one that does Cognitive Behavioral therapy (because that's the best kind of therapy), but any therapist will do. Whatever problems you have are fixable, you just need some support. When you're back at AU, visit the counciling center.
• Whoever posted ""And by “sex” I mean me putting my arm around you and you squirming away because you just wanna stay friends"" Dude I legitimately lol'd. 
I've come to realize that although it's not always obvious, but there are some pretty f'ing funny people at this school. Wit. I like it.  Can the funny people be more outgoing? We'd all benefit.
• Unfortunately, short guys finish last.
• that awkward moment when you realize that everyone in your new town knows what you have been doing at college and not one of them is your friend on FB...
• I'm scared to come back to AU after abroad. It just seems so terrible now.
• I don't even want to go back to school because I have to spend hours in a room with my whole sorority and some of them are awful people.
• @""I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break."" Please, please, PLEASE don't do it. Find professional help and figure out why you're feeling like this (or if you know why, figure out why it's driven you to this point).
• And this Monday/Tuesday will mark the 22nd year I haven't had a New Years Kiss. Or a kiss at all.
• Last night I had a dream that someone raped one of my friends and stalked her afterwards.  The legal system couldn't stop him, so I killed him to give her peace.  I was sentenced to prison, and inside I killed another inmate because he was plotting to harm a guard.  Once I was released I felt like there was evil in the world that I had a duty to stop, but I came to the conclusion that I was really just a serial killer justifying my murderous needs with that mentality.  So I killed myself.  How f***ed is that?
• So on Christmas Eve, I was mugged. Well, mugged might be kind of inaccurate. It wasn't violent, but a person ran up to me and grabbed my bag and ran away. My phone, camera, money and key were in there. There's nothing to be done but I can't stop dwelling on it. It's not my fault but, I can't help blaming myself. Like, I could have been more careful or something. I've never felt so powerless. It's sh*tty.

• Ughhh Fraternity rush is approaching!! I just want to go PIKE but I don't think they like me. Maybe I flirt with them to much?
• Why can't I just tell this kid that I'm not interested?! He's been in the friend zone for like 5 years now, but I don't think he knows and that makes me feel bad. But I don't know how to let him down easily, other than talking about my boyfriend to him. Which isn't even working. UGH!
• @• My peanus has never been kissed. Do you vvant to kiss my peanus with your mouth?-- You are a moron.
• @• My brother just came upstairs and asked if anyone was taking parts of the wall away, and whether any of my sisters friends have been doing work on the house. I said no to both, obviously, and then he went back to the basement again. I literally feel sick to my stomach."" Context?
• @How terrible is it for me to just pretend I’m single on okcupid?-- Your boyfriend is an ass and clearly doesn't care about you enough or he wouldn't want it to be open. It's not fair for him to be able to have other partners but he expects you not to- that's a classic double standard. You can find a much better guy, trust me. I know of some people who prefer open relationships, but they (in my opinion) tend to be selfish and really just self-interested people primarily concerned with their own gratification. 
• @• I’m feeling sick, so now I’m going to go the line for Santa Clause at the mall and spread as many germs as possible.  &@&# everyone up real bad before Christmas.-- At first I found myself thinking 'wow you're a terrible person', and then I realized I was laughing hysterically at the hilarity of it. Am I a sadist now?
• @Why can I only talk to people when I’m drunk?:
1) something happened to you which makes it hard for you to let loose around people without alcohol in you?
2) low confidence from any number of sources, including possible emotional or psychological trauma?
3) guilt over something unresolved on your end?
(most likely) you just might be a bit shy. Surround yourself with people who love you and who inspire you to be a better person.

• It's not that I don't want to talk to you anymore. Don't hate me. You just aren't moral enough for me, sorry. You've taken your values and turned them upside down just to fit in and feel like you belong. You were a better person when we first met. Look at your life choices.
• I like this guy but I think he still likes his ex a lot. She treated him terribly in the end, and I'd never treat him like that. How can I show him that I'll love him for who he is and never hurt him? He says he's afraid of trusting again.
• @single on okcupid: Um.. better make that single thing permanent. If this guy doesn't respect you enough to make it a mutual open relationship, or listen to what you want, then you should get out of it. You're worth more than that.

• My brother is making a way stronger push to get sober after Sunday's episode, but withdrawal has been brutal. Every single minute he needs help not to use. I am 100% happy to be able to be here and help, but being on duty 24/7 has just been draining. Couldn't do this without the people who have helped hold me up from afar.

• Despite staying sober, my brother has sharply spiraled downwards in terms of mental health over the past few days.  He's having severe anxiety and hallucinations, thinking he has a time machine and being afraid that the nurses are corpses.  Addiction used to be his only problem, but that's small time in comparison.  I used to think he was the strongest man in the world, and it’s terrible to see him reduced to this.  Those of you who fought with your family over vacation, please don’t waste your time with them while you still have it.  Love you bro.

Some changes to the Founders' Day Ball would benefit many
By Emma Gray
On Feb. 23, AU's Student Government hosted the 120th annual Founders' Day Ball. Set at the National Museum of American History, the affair was full of extravagance.
I cannot dispute that the chosen venue was awesome. It's an experience unique to D.C. However, the exclusivity and hype of an event that should be centered around the students who are currently becoming a part of AU history does not sit well with me.
All AU students should be able to attend the annual event. It is ridiculous that SG touts it as an ""exclusive event."" This is the only large event that AU hosts for its students, so why are most still left out? 
This year SG released 12,00 tickets, enough for about ten percent of AU's 12,000 undergraduate, graduate and law students. Students arrived three or more hours early to patiently wait for a small number of tickets. Some efforts were in vain.
Also, only AU students can attend. This restriction is more understandable, but it's still not ideal. It's usually customary that people bring their significant others to dances and balls. With more than five universities in D.C., in addition to several just outside of the District, the likelihood of one's partner being an AU student is diminished.
There are several ways that these issues could be fixed. I presume that the number of attendees is limited by the venue that is chosen. While not as glamorous, there are several spaces in D.C. that could accommodate AU's student population. For example, D.C.'s Walter E. Washington Convention Center has 703,000 square feet of space and can host events for up to 42,000 attendees.
Furthermore, if money is an issue, SG could certainly charge a small fee for the tickets rather than giving them out for free. To be fair, they could charge more for a non-AU student attending with an AU student. Paying a reasonable charge is still more ideal than taking three hours out of the day to wait in a stagnant line.
Although these changes would inevitably compromise the spectacular locations that AU students have come to expect of the Founders' Day Ball, I think it would be more successful. Students want to be with their friends at social outings, and AU wants to create a sense of community on its campus. SG's Founders' Day Ball does not currently support either of these goals. With a few adjustments, it could create a major change at AU.

Founders' Day was a huge success
By Marshall Bornemann
Undergraduate and postgraduate students at AU have a reason to be proud. On Feb. 23, University faculty gave students, professors, as well as other university affiliates an exciting event to look forward to at the National Museum of American History
Giddiness reflected the feelings and attitudes of the 1,000-plus students in attendance.  Having a DJ has become the standard for celebratory events for major universities. It makes dancing a little easier for those who may not care for it and much better for those who are generally prone to hip swaying.
The majority of AU students schedules are booked 24/7, except for the occasional coffee break shared between acquaintances. With that in mind, a close location was essential for officials' efforts in attracting so many of them.  
Many who attended feel that this event in particular is the university's most important. Held once a year, like most events, it is hailed as the largest in both size and decor. Arguably it was, and hundreds of party goers lined up to purchase tickets even after 1,200 had already been freely disposed. 
More impressive was University Center Coordinator Katie Junot's recollection of the event.  She unhesitatingly declared it ""the biggest Founders' Day in recent history,"" which holds true in the reaction evoked by another important guest.  
President Neil Kerwin flattered the entire room with compliments, from dancers to volunteers huddled in secluded corners. Of course, such an exceptional presentation by Kerwin, who has consistently spoken at past Founders' Day Ball events, will be expected to remain as powerful as this year's ball.  
Surely students, professors and other guests were surprised by the sophistication, organization and excitement of the event.  Congratulations to AU for 120 years of educational excellence!

How important is the Founders' Day Ball?
By Reza Lustig
Admittedly, I know precious little about the annual Founders' Day Ball. My accumulated knowledge of the event can be summed up in the explanation of Founder's Day provided on the AU website.
Nothing at all objectionable here; every university should be able to set aside a day to for interested students to celebrate the founding of their alma mater. The event itself has been described briefly on the page as bringing students together for the purpose of ""celebrating the great institution we all know and love,"" by gathering to ""mingle and feast on some birthday cake."" Thus, my attitude toward the event can be best described as one of indulgent indifference. I couldn't have been less interested, but if you went I hope you had fun. I myself was forced to stay in and work.
It would be nice, however, if AU's Student Government and press developed interest in matters of a somewhat more pressing nature. For instance, there's the fresh round of tuition hikes that kicked off last semester; good luck enjoying ""birthday cake"" and ""mingling and feasting"" while you're working an extra shift to cover your costs. 
Or perhaps the students who represent the rest of the student body could develop a sudden interest in the sacking of MGC workers, for the unbelievably impudent act of trying to organize in defense of their wages and rights as workers. I would, for instance, propose a conference of some sort, for mass dialogue between the student body and AU employees, including those contracted from outside companies. Not only would such an event raise the level of consciousness among students to the very real difficulties facing those who work to make their time here as comfortable as possible, but the press could also be involved. 
Similarly, the matter of sky-high tuition could also use a bit of publicity beyond CASJ and CAUS circles.  While student clubs and organizations dedicated to these issues are is a positive first step, it would be nice to know that our duly elected SG representatives are just as interested. While I enjoyed ""Casino Night"" in the MGC, I can't help but feel that the resources and time expended upon organizing and promoting it could maybe have gone to better use.
It is far from me to rain on anyone's parade here. I'm just offering some suggestions. Like my dad tells me, have your head in the clouds all you want, just keep your feet planted firmly on planet Earth.

2013-06-01,AU,club,"During a rugby game April 20, Von Gerik Allena, a 2010 graduate of the School of International Service, saw the ball fall to the ground, giving him the opportunity to run it up the field. As he ran, a fan took a picture of him which soon became a viral meme.
When Allena, a member of the Washington Renegades, a men's Division III club rugby team, began to run toward the try zone, he heard everyone from the sideline yelling, ""run, Von, you have to run.""
""I saw the try zone, which is like the touchdown zone, and I thought, ""Oh my God, I might actually get my first try today,"" Allena said. ""Then I felt someone's arms wrap around my legs and I thought, there goes the dream, it's over.""
Allena ran about 40 meters across the field before an opposing team member tackled him to the ground. During that time, however, Nick Van de Grift, who photographs all of the team's games, took a picture of Allena running with the ball.

2013-06-12,AU,club,"Though not at all groundbreaking, Shawn Levy's (""Real Steel"") ""The Internship"" is an underdog comedy more relatable than most, given the premise of a frightening job market and the cutthroat competition for college grads.
When two 40-somethings, Billy (Vince Vaughn, ""The Watch"") and Nick (Owen Wilson, ""Midnight in Paris"") lose their sales jobs at a company that has gone out of business, they find themselves jobless and relatively skilless. 
After both of their efforts to find work fail, Billy and Nick apply to, and land, internships at Google.
Upon their arrival in Silicon Valley, the two friends are predictably placed on the intern team of misfits and rejects: Team Lyle. 
And, like in any underdog comedy, Team Lyle is pitted against a team of aggressively over-achieving jerks.
The portrayal of Billy and Nick as less-than-tech-savvy adults is completely over the top, but that's what this movie is: It's an over-the-top, good-natured comedy. 
Despite some excessive scenes, such as when Billy and Nick lead the interns to a strip club and end up in a wild bar fight, the humor is good for an easy laugh. 
Another scene showcased Google employees (B.J. Novak, ""The Office"" and Karen Ceesay, ""Trouble With the Curve"") interviewing Billy and Nick for the internship position, resulting in some of the movie's funniest moments. 
However, a downside of the humor in ""The Internship"" surfaces in the same interview scene: Some of the jokes are initially quite funny, but they go on too long and losing the humor.
Both the protagonists and antagonists of ""The Internship"" are nerds. But the screenplay, which was also written by Vaughn (with Jared Stern, ""The Watch""), does not let nerds get boring. 
Sure, the characters are still all one-dimensional. But in the screenplay, Vaughn and Stern manage to deconstruct and embellish many different facets of the nerd stereotype: the Cosplay nerd, the socially awkward nerd, the nerd that never gets off his electronic device, the nerd with overly demanding parents and a few others.

2013-07-04,AU,club,"It's that time of year. You've made your deposit, bought your bumper sticker and started shopping at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Freshman year is quickly approaching, and you're feeling a little overwhelmed. Try not to fret, The Eagle's collected a few tips that'll make your transition to college life a little easier. 
What to do:
Get to know your floormates/roommates during Welcome Week.
Unless you switch rooms, these people will be your neighbors or will live with you all year. Get to know them: having friends on your floor is great and will save you from awkward elevator interactions.
Your research.
Before you even come to AU, research everything. What activities are you interested in? What professors in your intended major got great reviews from previous students? Who could be a great mentor in your program? There's no need to plan everything, but it's helpful to have an idea of what you want to do with your time here at AU.
Budget, budget, budget.
D.C. can burn a hole in your pocket if you're not careful. TDR (the nickname for the dining hall) gets old quickly and you'll soon end up at Whole Foods. Metro adds up, too. Clubbing? Forget it. Keep track of how much you're spending and maybe get a part-time job to help pay for expenses. Be smart and save where you can: the Eagle's Nest foot scrub can wait. 
What not to do:
Stay on campus.
You're going to be living in D.C., so be sure to explore the city since you won't have any classes or other obligations for that first week. Go to U Street, eat Ethiopian food, and relax at Malcolm X/Meridian Hill Park. Sit on the Watergate steps with a friend and just enjoy the nice summer weather before it rains. Jog around the Tidal Basin when the cherry blossoms come out (if you can get around all the tourists). You live here now, so go explore!
Forget to add an activity that is outside of AU.
Get a volunteer gig or a part-time job. It'll help your career, increase your time management skills and help you feel like a true ""DCist."" 
Forget to breathe.
It's no secret that college is stressful. You may find yourself writing a five-page paper and trying to complete a 100-page reading in the same night. Fights with your friends, hookups gone awry and that oh-so-needy professor can all add to your stress level. Resist feeling overwhelmed and find a quiet spot either on campus or in D.C. to relax. If that's not enough, be sure to check out AU's Counseling Center, which offers a variety of mental health resources.

2013-09-13,AU,club,"AU pride rooted in academics, not athletics
By Emily Dalgo
Party roars that are muffled only by a blaring school fight song or a Top 40 single; girls dressed in high heels, red lipstick, and pearls posing for pictures, hands on hips; a sea of crimson and blue fans, feeding off of one another’s drunken excitement and sipping from red solo cups—this is college, right?
Wrong. This is football game day, known for providing the atmosphere of an everyday college campus and what it is supposed to look like. AU, quite fortunately, does not buy into this doctrine. For many colleges, the football team is a marketing ploy, one that AU simply doesn’t need. We all came here fully aware of the non-existent football program, so the lack of an NCAA team is irrelevant for most AU students. We find our sense of pride and community in other ways: academics, rather than all-star athletes, get the fans at AU.
Victory parties, tailgating and school spirit is fun. But we didn’t come to AU to watch our friends and peers become famous for winning NCAA Player of the Year awards. We’re much more interested in the future possibility and likelihood that we will vote for the guy who sat next to us in an SPA class into the House or Senate, or watch the girl from ATV anchor a nightly newscast on CNN. 
Students can casually walk right past Bender Arena and, unbeknownst to them, a major volleyball game, basketball game, or swim meet is transpiring inside. This isn’t to say the students here don’t care at all about our sports teams. We definitely do. At AU, though, we aren’t forced to become avid sports fans or feel like lesser students if we aren’t on a team.
Schools pour funding into their football programs while academics may fall by the wayside, and a quarterback with a full-ride scholarship is put on the big screen. This is not the case at AU. Our college lifestyles are not centered around or even guided by a football team. Every shirt we wear around campus does not have to scream “Go Eagles!” to advertise our pride for going to one of the best universities in the nation. In fact, most AU shirts are not printed with the face of Clawed Z. Eagle, but rather with “American University” on them, because the school’s identity resides not in a mascot, but in its name. 
When someone asks me where I go to school, I am proud to say “American University” and have the response be, “Wow that’s a great school,” rather than, “Wow, you have a great football team.”

Lack of sports culture provides extracurricular diversity for students
By Emma Williams
AU is lucky not to have a football team. 
At most schools with established football teams, the sport will dominate students’ attention. At my high school, football was the only thing anyone paid attention to, while less popular sports, performing arts, and academic teams continually lost funding. At AU, however, students are free to find what activity interests them the most and devote their time to it, no matter how obscure.	
Allowing everyone to focus on their own niche activities is crucial to AU fostering its own sense of community. Students feel more comfortable when their interests are represented fairly, and the wide variety of clubs that students can join allows for each student to make a number of friends with similar interests.
Most importantly, not having a major sports team leads to a more academically-focused environment on campus. Without the all-consuming focus on sports, students have more time to study, intern and work in the D.C. community. At schools where football is the most well-known program at the school, such as the University of Alabama, many students feel pressured to attend every game that their schools’ teams play, often at the expense of their school work and jobs.
Without a defined community, AU has been able to make its own unique mark in D.C. and the world. Being known for only one thing is limiting, but AU students are free to choose what is important to them throughout their time in college. Each new freshman has a practically unlimited selection of sports, clubs, and jobs available to them, and can even create their own field of study by working with their advisors. 
When all focus is not placed on one extracurricular activity at a school, all students can feel like they are welcome in a diverse, accepting community.

Lack of football team is not equivalent to lack of school pride
By Marisa Fein
With another week of classes over and the weekend ahead, students fill the stadium with painted faces, decked from head to toe in collegiate gear. As the football team scores its winning touchdown, the whole crowd breaks into a roar. School pride can practically be felt in the air.
This is my idea of how a typical college football game would play out, but because I am an AU student, it is something that I will probably never experience. While AU provides endless opportunities for its students, offering everything from Model UN to a beekeeping club, it is widely known that the school is lacking when it comes to athletics. The fact that AU does not even have a football team, which seems like a complete contradiction to its name as “The American University”, shows the lack of importance that the school places on sports.
A lack of collegiate football is just another thing that makes AU unique and contributes to the culture of the campus. We are a student body who would rather become involved with the city around us than sit in a crowded stadium during our free time. While not having football games does mean that AU lacks a central event to draw the whole school together, it does not make us any less of a community.
AU students take pride in our school, even if we don’t express it on a football field. Instead, our school spirit can be seen all around D.C. At practically any march or protest in the city, you are bound to see a few AU sweatshirts. Ultimately, a lack of a football team does not equal a lack of school pride.
While it may seem strange to some to attend a school where the word “tailgate” is used less often than the words “foreign policy,” to most students it becomes a way of life. At the end of the day, I am proud to say that I am a student at AU, a school that prides itself on more than just the achievements of its athletic department.

2013-10-11,AU,club,"The Naked and Famous played not one, but two nights at D.C.’s 9:30 Club last weekend. With tickets for the initial Sunday, Oct. 6 performance selling out in the blink of an eye, one night in D.C. proved insufficient for fans of the increasingly successful alternative synth-rock group. Even after announcing a second performance on Oct. 7, tickets were sold out by the evening of the show.
The Colourist opened the night with an energetic performance rife with the sunshiny alt-pop one would expect, given their Orange County, Ca. roots. Catchy hooks and abundant on-stage energy made up for the audience’s unfamiliarity with their music, making The Colourist an entertaining opening act overall.
When The Naked and Famous took over, their three plus years of touring experience made it clear who was in charge of the evening. From start to finish, The Naked and Famous demonstrated their abilities as not only excellent musicians, but as performers. Strobe lights and vibrantly colored spotlights played across thick clouds of fog that framed the stage and hung over the front of the house. After opening the set with new songs like “A Stillness” and “Hearts Like Ours,” The Naked and Famous really got the crowd going with a debut album favorite “Girls Like You.” 
The overall blend of new and old was excellent, and the stunning lights and effects made for a nearly immaculate performance that left virtually no audience member disappointed.
Alisa Xayalith’s crystal clear vocals led a crowd-wide sing-a-long during “Rolling Waves,” making the thunderously bass heavy song a crowd favorite during the main set. Old favorites such as “All of This” and “Punching in a Dream” were also met with great enthusiasm.
The Naked and Famous finished on an undeniable high note, closing their encore with a refreshed performance of their hit “Young Blood.” New life was breathed into the song, which sounded even better than on 2010’s “Passive Me, Aggressive You” recording.
The Naked and Famous closed their show with a proud display of just how far they’ve come as musicians, as performers, and as a band. The crowd jumped, danced, and sang along beneath whirling spotlights and strobe-illuminated fog. The display of crowd enthusiasm made it clear: The Naked and Famous will always be welcome in D.C.

2013-10-13,AU,club,"Reggie Tankard is a freshman from the Bronx who plays third baseman on AU’s club baseball team. The Eagles’ club baseball team went 1-1  against York College of Pennsylvania on October 6. The team is 1-1 overall and will play Howard at  Montgomery Blair High School on Friday.
Reggie sat down with the Eagle this week to talk with about baseball, school and life. The Club Student-Athlete of the Week is determined by the leadership of the specific team
Alex Romero: Tell me about your teams performance in last week’s two games against York College of Pennsylvania.
Reggie Tankard: I think we played well for the first two games of the season. Our team chemistry will grow further on in the season, but for our first outing we fought hard. The defense played great and the offense got better throughout the day. We lost the first game 9-3 and won the second 7-6 in extra innings.
AR: How was your performance during last week’s games?
RT: In the first inning I hit a double and after that hit it just all came back to me. I felt like I was back into the baseball mode and it all felt natural from then on. Overall I scored two runs, had four RBI’s and went four for five hitting with a triple, two doubles and single.
AR: What are your personal goals for this season?
RT: Well, I heard we haven’t won many games in recent seasons. And coming from my background where my baseball team was the district champions I’m used to winning. I made a goal to get a few games under our belt. And I’m glad we started on a strong note with a win this weekend.
AR: Tell me about your coach.
RT: Our coach is Chris Grassano and he is a junior here at AU. He’s a great coach and is team captain too. He helps out the people who are less experienced, explains the game to everyone, and tries to get everyone playing time.
AR: What is the leadership presence on the team?
RT: The players who are more experienced take on a tougher role. Since I’ve been playing for a while I try to help teammates out, give them tips on how to track fly balls and get their glove down to a fielders triangle. When it comes to leadership there’s the head coach on the team then there are some peer mentors.
AR: How long have you been playing baseball?
RT: I’ve been playing since I was eight so about 10 years now, but it feels like all my life. 
AR: So what’s your motivation to play at AU on a club team considering you don’t get the publicity or scholarships of the varsity sport athletes?
RT: I don’t mind the lack of publicity, I just do what I have to do for us to win games. And as long as there’s some sort of organized baseball I enjoy doing it.
AR: What can AU do to improve club sports?
RT: Help with funding because we have to do a lot of fundraising to pay for transportation, ref’s and umpires, so that’d be a first. Then they need to provide more field space and availability for us to practice on.
AR: How has the practice field situation affected you and your team?
RT: Since there’s not much practice fields available for us to use, we sometimes go to Massachusetts Avenue field. And often times there’s little league kids there so we have to use the sides and just throw and soft toss so we don’t get much of a practice in. For when we can’t get much practice in I just remember what I was taught when I was little and just go out there and do my best.
AR: Outside of baseball what do you do for fun at AU?
RT: I try to stay very active. I play basketball and football a lot and I enjoy hanging out with my friends.
AR: What’s your favorite class at AU?
RT:  My business 1.0 class with Professor White. He’s a really great teacher and business is something that I’m passionate about. I want to be a businessman when I grow up, or perhaps a sports agent or sports manager.
AR: Why did you choose to come to American University?
RT: I love business and being in D.C gives me a great opportunity to be successful.

2013-10-13,AU,club,"The Eagle had the exclusive opportunity to sit down with Thom Powers and Alisa Xayalith of The Naked & Famous backstage at 9:30 club on Oct. 7. This gig marked the band’s second night of sold-out stops in D.C. 
Trent Burns: How has the tour in support of the new album been going?
Thom Powers: Its been good. We had to iron out a few kinks when we first started, because we were jumping straight back into the same level of “show” we had when we stopped [the previous tour]. So it’s got to be quite streamlined, it’s very slick. You know like, it goes dark, it comes back and I’ve got a new guitar, and we start a new song (snaps) just like that. It seems really simple, when you see the whole show, but there’s so much small detail that you have to iron out to get confident in doing that. When you don’t do that it’s just in shambles, you know? It’s really awkward and the night just slows down. So it was pretty difficult to jump straight back into that, but two weeks in and I think we’re almost back to where we were in touring for “Passive Me, Aggressive You.”
Alisa Xayalith: It’s been exciting. I mean you can tell, from being up on stage, how many people have bought the album. Everyone’s been really receptive so far, and that’s always good because it’s quite scary when you’re playing new songs because not everybody knows them and sometimes people take a bit of time to warm up to them. You need to win them over all over again.
TP: And we thought it was funny, as musicians in general, you can get a very narrow-vision of what you’re doing in your own little world. And we were thinking about all the new songs; they’re all performable live. So we were thinking about this whole record, and it’s just come out (laughs), so we were going “oh shit, we can’t actually put people through a whole record every single night from start to finish”. And we’ve got so many songs that people already know, so it was a bit of a wake up call for us really. We had to actually figure out how and when to put the new songs into the set. That’s been challenging but fun.
TB: So has the overall experience of concerts and touring changed over the two to three years of touring for your first album?
TP: Yeah well, when we started we were just doing these small clubs and we were just this ‘small indie band.’ And then we got to playing stuff like South by Southwest.
AX: Much like the other bands we played eight shows in four days, and in between all those shows we had press, we had all these other things that were crammed in between the shows. It was just absolutely crazy, but fun. 
TP: So we went from doing that to slowly doing bigger shows, bigger venues, bigger audiences, more radio play and more videos. So it was growing all the time, and it got to the point where we were playing proper shows like this with a decent PA [system] and decent sized crowds. As a producer I started to get a really good idea of how the band works as a five-person unit. And that had a really big impact on the approach to producing “In Rolling Waves.”
TB: Were there any big differences in producing “In Rolling Waves”? You co-produced two of the tracks?
TP: Yeah, we worked with Justin Meldal-Johnsen and he was great. We just felt stuck, like we’d hit a brick wall. We were driving to the rehearsal studio every day, getting to work, and just sitting there going “what are we doing?” There was a stale element to those two tracks; we reproduced them 10 different times and still nothing. Justin came in basically to say “this idea is really good, keep doing that” or “this idea isn’t working.” So he was just this opinion, this voice outside of the group, who hadn’t been working on the music so he could just sit back on the couch and say “I don’t think this or that is working.” So he was really wonderful to work with, and it opened me up to working with someone else as a producer. It was a really eye-opening experience for me, it made me excited about the idea of working with other people on those terms: not because we felt like we had to but because we wanted to get past that wall and make things exciting for ourselves. 
TB: Was that the biggest challenge in making the new album, doing it mostly yourself?
TP: Well we did that with the first record as well, so it just felt like we were doing what we’d always done, except that we were able to use all the experience that we had to do it again. We weren’t feeling as naïve this time, like we were punching above our weight level, or whatever that expression is. That’s how felt making the first record, just that ambition to make an album and to put it out. To be a “real band” was a huge ambition. So after doing that we felt like we could do it again, but this time we wanted to take everything that we’d learned from the first experience of making the first album and touring it and base the new record on those experiences. 
TB: You relocated to Los Angeles while working on the new album, so was that weird having moved from New Zealand?
TP: Pretty weird, but at the time we were so used to it. We were just traveling all the time, so to me it doesn’t really matter where I am; it’s a bed, it’s an indoor area. So at that point it was an almost arbitrary decision. We’d had some good times in LA, it seemed cool, so we thought “alright, let’s go there.” 
AX: At the time we were deciding to move, it was wintertime in New Zealand. LA was sunny every day, and we thought why not trace the summer? Let’s go live in LA.
TB: Do you have a favorite experience from the time you spent writing “In Rolling Waves” and living in LA?
TP: You know I don’t really have favorite anythings anymore. I just can’t fathom the idea of that singularity, you know? I love music, how can I pick a favorite? Like, “What would like to eat for the rest of your life?” That’s ridiculous, I can’t do that, I don’t think life is like that, really. I don’t anything great works like that. I have so many awesome memories of the time we spent working on the record, but that’s an accumulative thing.
TB: Are you happy with the direction this new record has taken the band in? Is it something you’d like to continue with or will we see another radical change on the next album?
TP: I wouldn’t say radical, no. But I definitely think we’re happy with what we’ve been doing: taking everything we’ve done and saying “what do I know? What have I learned? What do we want to repeat or not repeat?” And I think music, or any creative discipline really, give you experience. And you get better at playing and performing and knowing what fits and what doesn’t. Your perspective becomes more refined, and hopefully that continues to happen for us. If that stops happening, if we’re just going through the motions, I think that’s when most bands decide to call it quits. When it becomes stale, it’s probably best to stop.

2014-05-13,AU,club,"Director Liza Johnson began her feature film career with a movie about a female officer dealing with the personal turmoil of coming back home from a military tour of duty. “Return” ended up leading to her second feature “Hateship Loveship,” which is based on a short story by the Nobel Prize winning author Alice Munro. The film tells the story of the extremely introverted and empathetic character Johanna (Kristen Wiig, “Saturday Night Live”). “Hateship Loveship” finds Johanna eventually getting herself into an email correspondence with a crush, but the relationship that Johanna thinks she’s having through these emails is really one concocted by two high school girls.
Johnson took some time to chat with The Eagle’s David Kahen-Kashi about her film and female directors in Hollywood.
E: How did you arrive at this Alice Munro short story for a subject to make into a movie?
Liza Johnson: Actually, the screenwriter brought it to me. He had already written the adaptation. I think he arrived at it that way. It sounded like he and the production executive had been reading the book at the same time, and they were both really inspired by it. 
E: Do you find that it’s tougher to convey literary aspects about what’s inside a character’s head through film?
LJ: It’s just really different because in a movie the characters have to become legible through meaningful actions or dialogue. Of course, that story has a lot of meaningful actions in it, [but] it doesn’t have a ton of dialogue. I was impressed by the way Mark Poirier (“Smart People”), the screenwriter, found ways to fill in the kind of elliptical elements in the story, you know… So, I think, it was a project of making some of those ellipses in the original story come out on screen because they’re just really different art forms.
E: This is your first feature where you’re not writing and directing. Is there a difference between probably having an attachment to the script when it’s yours, or is it refreshing to have some detachment from the script?
LJ: I think it is different. I think it helped me in certain ways. I worked on it with Mark before we went out for casting and so I definitely feel invested in it and stuff. I didn’t feel remote from it. But nevertheless, I definitely had more distance than if I wrote it myself. I don’t know if it’s better or worse, but it definitely had some good attributes because a little distance can be a helpful thing.
E: The most striking element about “Hateship Loveship” is the casting of Kristen Wiig. Her performance is one that says a lot without saying too much. What was it like placing her in such a restrained role?
LJ: She’s a really smart person. She has one of the fastest, most reflexive intelligences of anyone I’ve ever met. I felt that it’s obviously the style of “Saturday Night Live” that she’s much different than in this movie. With “SNL” you have a really short time to create a character, and also it’s a comedy show, obviously. So she’s really operating at a very different register in this movie. But I felt that from her body of work that she has a lot of characters that address some of the same things that Alice Munro’s characters has. Alice Munro has comedy, but no one has ever called her a comic writer that I know of, but nevertheless, what’s underneath Kristen’s comedy is a lot of empathy or resonance with some of the things in this character, and I just thought that she would really understand the character.
E: Under any other circumstances it might seem like these characters might be unlikable, but in the film, it seems as though you’ve extended a lot of generosity toward them. How do you find a balance between finding their wrinkles and failures and giving those characters their redemption?
LJ: That’s such a nice question. I mean, I think that I feel empathy for all those characters and I think that Alice Munro does to like in her story the teenage girls come off more sympathetic than they do come off in my film. Although, I hope their sympathetic in my film as well, you know, because they’re also reacting out of embarrassment all the time. Where Sabitha is embarrassed because her dad’s embarrassing, and Edith is embarrassed because she doesn’t have as much money as everyone else. I don’t think it’s that they’re deeply mean people. It’s that they do a couple of mean gestures because they’re reacting off of their own embarrassment and their own feelings. I think that’s all how we really are. It’s not that we all behave heroically all the time or that we’re deeply evil, it’s just that as we encounter one another we get in situations where we either behave well or we don’t and to me that’s something good to try and have sympathy for.
E: There’s a motel that you shot at that looks familiarly like the one in “Dallas Buyers Club.” Is it the same one?
LJ: It actually is. In fact, they had the office next to us and shot that movie immediately after ours. So in truth, our motel is the one in their movie. It’s a great location, and I actually really liked that movie so when I saw it. We have a lot of the same producers, and I wrote to the producers [and] proposed a sequel where Johanna, and kinda some of the people who are alive at the end of “Dallas Buyer’s Club,” maybe they franchise [the movie] and shoot in South Africa.
E: Do you think there are ample opportunities for female directors in Hollywood?
LJ: Well, I can only say that I’ve been treated really well by the men and women that I work with. So I don’t have a lot personally to complain about, and I think that the people I know about working in Hollywood are interested in women and supportive of women. I think that it’s really helpful when there’s a movie like “Bridesmaids” or maybe “12 Years a Slave” is doing well, you know, because I think the trouble is people need to have more confidence that there is a marketplace for films about women.
For anybody who is themselves in a minoritarian subject position, or working in a minoritarian topics, I think it’s really helpful when there are films that kind of demonstrate there’s an audience and an economic reason for those movies to exist. I feel like that’s really the thing that we all need to keep working on. 
I’ve never had somebody…well once I’ve had somebody tell me that they didn’t wanna. Once I had a French company tell me they were already making a film with a woman this year so they were all good on women. With that exception, I think it’s more that people have to confidence in the marketplace that the marketplace does take an interest in women. It obviously does, women go to the movies all the time. So for me that’s what I hope for, not just for myself, but for others.

2014-05-13,AU,club,"AU School of Public Affairs professor Robert Johnson is a busy man.
By day, he teaches courses in the Department of Justice, Law and Criminology (JLC), mostly on the topics of the prison system and social justice. 
When he’s not teaching courses, Johnson oversees and helps to develop a student-run publishing press about these same topics.
In 2006, Johnson was incorporating creative writing into one of his courses (“Prison Stories”) when he decided to expand this kind of work outside of the classroom. He found that the best way to get students to connect with prisoners was through reading their poetry. Roberts soon began writing poetry from the perspective of prisoners himself and encouraging his students to do so as well. By combining his experience in creative writing with his passion for justice in the prison system, BleakHouse Publishing was created.
The name of the press, Johnson said, reflects the bleak reality of human suffering and the human condition. For that reason, subject matter published by BleakHouse is not necessarily limited to literal prisons, but other situations that are conducive to the feeling of being trapped.
“The point of the press is to give people who normally don’t have a voice about the margins of society an effective voice,” Johnson said. 
Though Johnson is the founding editor and publisher, BleakHouse is an otherwise student-run organization. 
“In many ways, it’s kind of a uniquely driven student operation, powered by the enthusiasm of students and the talent of students,” Johnson said. 
Nora Kirk, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, is the chief development officer of the press. She is responsible for reaching out to the community outside of AU and bringing awareness to BleakHouse. 
“It’s millions of people that are a part of our population, and they’re just this hidden component that we don’t ever think about in our day-to-day lives. So I like to think of BleakHouse as a channel, or a way to express this almost forgotten population,” Kirk said. “I think these issues are so much better expressed, it’s so much easier to connect to them on a human basis, when they’re expressed through art and creative writing and literature.”
BleakHouse publishes annual issues of Tacenda Literary Magazine, an online graphic design magazine called The BleakHouse Review and an annual poetry anthology. All works feature the combined voices of AU students and incarcerated or formerly incarcerated writers. BleakHouse also has an online art gallery where the works of prisoners are digitally on display. 
Johnson, Kirk and the rest of BleakHouse intend to expand through collaboration with Free Minds, a book club aimed at young inmates, and through hosting a larger number of readings in the prison community. 
“There’s a certain amount of spontaneity about how [BleakHouse] will evolve, but its generally getting better and better over time,” Johnson said.

2014-06-03,AU,club,"As LA-based indie rock band NO. took the stage on the first night of its U.S./Canadian tour in support of composer Yann Tiersen, the crowd was dismal at best. A few gathered at the foot of the stage, willing to wait the openers out in anticipation for Tiersen’s act. Others stood by the bar and pursued side conversations to pass the time. 
By the time lead singer Bradley Carter reached the first chorus of the band’s opening song, “Another Life”, off of the recently released debut album, “El Prado,” the background hum died down. Instead, attentive listeners headed towards the stage as Carter, whose deep, melodic voice could double for Matt Berninger of The National, lamented about lost love. 
NO.’s beachy guitars are a nod to its hometown though even their happiest song never leans towards surf-pop fluffiness. Instead, NO.’s songs opt for heavier subject matter than most beach music— desperate pleas to leaving lovers (“Stay With Me”, “Leave the Door Wide Open”) and hesitation to start new relationships (“There’s a Glow”). 
Carter carried NO. with his eyes closed, leaning and reaching into the crowd as if the subject of his songs is somewhere in the darkness. Each band member was equally absorbed in the music they were making, particularly bassist Sean Stentz, who had a third of the stage to himself. Throughout many songs, each band member echoed the chorus, creating haunting harmonies that floated on top of increasingly passionate music. 
As NO.’s set progressed at the 9:30 Club, the applause in between each song grew louder, culminating with the crowd singing along to “Hold On” as Carter recorded the moment on an old-fashioned video camera as he performed. As the band left the stage to cheers, it was soon reunited with the crowd, getting to know each new fan who approached them as they stood at the merch table between its set and Tiersen’s. 
As experimental, ambient composer and headliner Tiersen took the stage, many were confused as to why they had chosen NO. to tour with him and his band. Despite having different musical styles, Tiersen’s fans still exhibited a respectful appreciation for his openers, and NO. left the 9:30 Club having enhanced the crowd’s experience. 
“El Prado” is available for streaming on Spotify.

2014-06-12,AU,club,"CollegeAtlas.org, an online encyclopedia on national universities, announced AU as the seventh most influential college on Twitter on May 28. AU is among Harvard University, Princeton University and Yale University on the top 10 list.
“To be in the same company as Harvard, Yale and Princeton is a testament to the reach of American University’s social media influence,” AU Social Media Club faculty advisor Stef Woods said in an email.
The ranking was based on AU’s main Twitter account’s number of followers and activity, according to College Altas’ methodology report.
Teresa Flannery, AU vice president of Communication, sees the ranking as a way for the University to distinguish itself as a modern institution.
“It reflects both our savvy, connected community and the intentional integration of social media channels as part of AU’s overall strategic communication,” Flannery said in an email. 
Flannery also attributes the success of AU’s Social Media Club as contributor to the College Atlas ranking. The club hosts the Social Learning Summit, a conference that focuses on social media, each year. 
“I think AUSMC has contributed partially to this because we strive to foster a community of social media in and outside the classroom through our events, especially our annual conference the Social Learning Summit,” AUSMC President Katie Castellano said in an email. “It’s awesome to see that AU is being recognized for that.”
Faculty advisor Stef Woods recounted seeing the club’s impact on social media when she served as a panelist in 2011.
“Having served as a panelist at the first Social Learning Summit, I remember when the hashtag for the conference became the top trending topic on Twitter for the Washington, D.C. area,” Woods said.
Woods notes that AU’s early 2009 adoption of a Twitter account helped place the University on the top 10 list as well as the online involvement of different schools.
“From the School of Communication to its online class offerings to the student-run SMC and PRSSA [Public Relations Student Society of America], AU has positioned itself as an academic leader in digital media adoption and education,” Woods said.

2014-07-07,AU,club,"Neon Trees have been a steady pop-rock presence both on the radio and on tour for nearly six years now. Bassist Branden Campbell discussed “Pop Psychology” (both the album and the tour), the intersection of pop and rock and what makes a rock star with The Eagle’s Tam Sackman. 
The Eagle: Neon Trees is described as a pop-rock band. What influences from both genres contribute to your sound?
Branden Campbell: I’d say on the rock side stuff like Springsteen, The Clash… on the pop side…. I’d throw Depeche Mode onto the pop side. But also Michael Jackson, Duran Duran. 
E: You guys have been a band since 2005 and released your first songs in 2006. How have you and your sound changed since the EP “Becoming Different People?” 
BC: We’ve become more focused on songwriting and finding songs that we’d enjoy as listeners. I think we were crafting songs that we knew how to create with songs that we would listen to, with songs that pulled us in from time to time. I think tuning into that sound and kind of getting to the point. Tom Petty has a saying that we would use, “Don’t bore us, get to the chorus.” So following that advice was really helpful. 
E: Your accessibility to both the pop and rock worlds has allowed you to open for acts like Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift, but also The Offspring and 30 Seconds to Mars. Who’s your dream tour outside of the genres of pop and rock?
BC: For us, we’re constantly striving to do our own thing. So our dream tour would be us being able to play stadiums on our own. Inviting some of the other bands that we’ve appreciated along the way for a wonderful all-day event. Kind of leading our own festival would be ideal. 
E: How is “Pop Psychology” different than your previous two studio albums?
BC: I think the way that we went about doing it on the last couple of records is that we recorded everything in a room together. And this time we actually recorded everything separate[ly]. I mean we worked on the songs together and we produced them and everything. But we tracked everything separate and gave it to our producer to piece together, almost like we were making a hip-hop record. Just more stepping out of our boundaries and making something that four years ago we never would have agreed to do. We just knew it was time for us to stretch out, try something different. And it came back as something we really enjoy. 
E: What’s your favorite song to perform live? 
BC: “Living in Another World.”
E: What constitutes a ‘rock star’ in your opinion?
BC: I think when people think about a rock star, it’s someone with swagger and attitude. But I think what it really comes down to is a confidence in what you’re doing. It doesn’t mean saying the right words or playing the right line of guitar. Having confidence in what you’re doing [and] that what you’re sharing means something to someone. 
E: If you weren’t a musician, what do you think you’d be doing right now?
BC: Well, I would be fishing in southern Utah. That’s what I’ve been doing right now. 
E: A lot of the songs on “Pop Psychology” revolve around technology and modern relationships. Was this an intentional theme, and if so, why did you choose it?
BC: Yeah. I think these things impact modern society. The way we approach a modern relationship. For me, I have a wife and two kids, and being on the road and away from them, technology serves me in a way that I can keep in touch with them better than ever before. And that we can share things with each other. But at the same time, I can see people that struggle to find a way to foster relationships. It’s not the same interaction that people used to have. It’s very technologically based in the fact that it’s not real, personal interaction and that can be tough for people to really foster relationships. 
E: Despite this looking to the future and the present in your music, a lot of the band’s look and feel is pretty retro, especially in your music videos. Why did you choose this kind of persona?
BC: I think it’s something that we’ve always been attached to — the songs with the classic appeal. One time we did try to make a video based in the future and we never released it. It ended up feeling too serious. There’s something about the classic appeal. For example, in the video for “Sleeping With a Friend,” more so than ever we tapped into something that’s really 2014. But the things that are classic are that way for a reason I guess. 
E: What’s been your favorite stop on this tour so far and what stop are you most looking forward to?
BC: Well, D.C. is going to be bittersweet because it’s D.C., but it’s also the last show of the tour. But it’s going to be a great way to end it, because the show’s already sold out. It’s gonna be super cool. But last night we played in Milwaukee at Summer Fest for the fourth time in a row and it just gets bigger and bigger and last night was probably the greatest night we’ve ever had in Milwaukee. It was the most people we’ve ever had there. We’ve had a great time so far in London, Chicago, Seattle. But Milwaukee! Dude, the heartland rocks. 
Neon Trees and Smallpools play the 9:30 Club on July 13. The show is sold out. The album “Pop Psychology” is available now.

2015-01-11,AU,club,"David Terao Jr. wrestles against his Oklahoma University opponent. 

	Despite early wins from 125-pound junior David Terao Jr. and his 133-pound freshman brother David Terao, the AU wrestling team failed to secure a win against the University of Oklahoma Sooners on Jan. 8, falling 30-13 in Bender Arena.

	 “We just need a couple of guys to turn their matches around for us,” head coach Teague Moore said. “Unfortunately, we come out the loser tonight, but there’s some things that we can get better at because of this dual.”

	The Eagles entered the match after returning from a successful showing at the Aloha Invite in Honolulu, Hawaii where the team recorded five individual Top Three finishes. David Terao earned Outstanding Wrestler Honors after winning the 125-pound weight class, while junior John Boyle finished second at the 157-pound division. Freshman Josh Terao and sophomores Tom Page and Jason Grimes all took home third-place in the 133, 149 and 184-pound weight classes respectively.

	However, AU lost several key matches in the dual meet versus Oklahoma that they won against the Sooners during the holiday tournament.

	“149 [weight class], we beat them in Hawaii, and we end up getting pinned here, that’s a huge swing, and then 157 again, we beat them in Hawaii and we lose here by a point, so you know those two matches are our key matches,” Moore said. “If we can win the first four [matches], which we are completely capable of doing, that makes a different halftime, and then they’re coming in having to fight.”

	David Terao Jr. and Josh Terao created initial momentum for the Eagles, and Josh Terao scored big team points with his major 10-1 victory over Oklahoma sophomore Sean Williams.

	Oklahoma freshman Trae Blackwell ended the Eagles winning streak with 7-4 victory against AU freshman Michael Sprague in the 141-pound weight class. The Sooners then surged ahead 9-7 in team points with a pin from redshirt freshman Shayne Tucker in the 149-pound weight class.

	 “When we’re bringing in teams like Oklahoma, these are chances that you don’t get very often, and so we got to be ready for them,” Moore said.

	AU junior John Boyle brought the crowd to their feet in the last match of the first half, battling Oklahoma redshirt senior Justin DeAngelis until the final second. The two wrestlers remained scoreless after the first period, and Oklahoma managed only point in the second period. As the clocked ticked on, the pace increased, and both teams earned takedown points with only a few minutes remaining. Boyle attempted to bring DeAngelis to his knees, but time ran out, and he dropped the match 3-2, giving the Sooners a 10-7 lead heading into halftime.

	Oklahoma claimed a decision win the 165-pound weight class from redshirt sophomore Clark Glass, and they continued their hot streak with a quick pin from redshirt sophomore Matt Reed in the 174-weight class.
“Unfortunately, we come out the loser tonight, but there’s some things that we can get better at because of this dual.”— head coach Teague Moore

	AU sophomore, 184-pound Jason Grimes established renewed enthusiasm for the Eagles, however, when he earned his second collegiate pin after taking down Oklahoma freshman Brooks Climmons in less than 90 seconds.

	“I was expecting the match to go a little bit longer, but I knew if I pushed the pace, and I took it to him and didn’t let him bring the match to me, I would end up on top,” Grimes said.

	He previously defeated Climmons in the Aloha Open last weekend at the Aloha Invite in Honolulu, Hawaii, and the wrestlers have been competing against each other since elementary school in Georgia.

	“We were on the same middle school team, trained on the same club from elementary school up,” Grimes said. “We’re real good buddies actually.”

	Grimes earned Ameritel Coropration Wrestler of the Match for his performance, but the Sooners claimed the final two matches of the night with a decision win from 197-pound freshman Andrew Dixon and a pin from heavyweight Ross Larson.

	While Moore remains frustrated with the overall score of the match, he looks forward to the upcoming home meet against Harvard and Virginia Military Institute as a chance for the Eagles test their skills again and regain confidence.

	“VMI and Harvard gives us a chance to get our feet back under us,” said Moore. “We just need to continue refining and doing the things that we are capable of doing.”

2015-04-10,AU,club,"Famous for psychedelic tunes and dynamic live stage performances, Dan Deacon will bring the same colorful experience to 9:30 Club on April 11.
Deacon’s newest album, “Gliss Riffer,” explores the union of electronic music and innovative vocals, taking listeners on a vibrant musical adventure. Popular tracks “Feel the Lightning” and “Learning to Relax” reflect Deacon’s buoyant energy and infectious imagination. And ultimately, the combination of vocals and instrumentals in the songs gets listeners up and dancing. 
Don’t be fooled—Deacon’s music is far from the typical electronic music expected at a club. Instead, his tunes encapsulate an explosion of experimental techno and sonic design that sounds like a trip through a colorful world of auditory hallucinations in the best way.
“Whenever you make electronic music, you’re always listening for new sounds,” Deacon said in an interview for The Daily Progress. “A new texture you’ve never heard before is more exciting than a new rhythm.” 
Early in his career, Deacon played at makeshift venues, where he became known for performing in the middle of the dance floor to have a more interactive experience with his audience members. Although he has now moved to playing at large theaters and stages, Deacon still tries to create a responsive and two-way experience for listeners.
Audiences will be pleasantly surprised by Deacon’s ability to conduct a dance party from the stage or crowd, and should expect a night filled with richly layered electronic tracks and dance-worthy melodies. 
Dan Deacon will be playing at 9:30 Club on April 11. Tickets are $15, doors open at 10 p.m., all ages welcome.

2015-04-10,AU,club,"Every week, this column will review a D.C. gym and one or more trial classes.

	With finals week approaching, getting off campus to workout seems impossible. If you need to clear your mind but don’t have the time to take the Metro downtown, check out Sport & Health gym in Tenleytown.

	The gym has many locations, with two in Tenleytown alone. The Northwest club offers group fitness classes, nutrition and weight management programs, personal training, free weights, cardio equipment, circuit training and child care for parents who want to workout.

	Membership pricing changes based on monthly and seasonal promotions. Usually, the monthly rate is $45 with an optional addition of four hour long personal training sessions at $99. The membership includes free use of cardio equipment, weights and group classes.

	Make sure to try out the variety of group fitness classes offered including zumba, pilates, yoga, body pump, cycle, club strength and more. You can check out the class offerings and schedule on its website.

	The website has a special feature, which shows ratings of the classes it offers based on intensity level from low intensity of 200 like yoga to high intensity of 500 like bodycombat. This is a very helpful tool when determining what group classes work with your personal abilities.

How is the gym?

	Sport & Health Northwest has a large cardio area upstairs with a variety of ellipticals, rowing machines, stationary bikes, and treadmills. There are also two group fitness class studios and a studio for cycle classes.

	Downstairs, the gym offers a full circuit training area, a variety of free weights and a section for floor work. There are also locker rooms available with showers.

	More than enough equipment is available at Sport & Health, and it never seems to get overcrowded.  The staff does not walk around the floor, but they always seem to be in the offices, eager to answer any questions.

Try this Class

	The Club Strength class was one of the best group exercise classes I have ever attended. The class was set to upbeat music, and incorporated every muscle in your body, in addition to cardio.

	Club strength used major cardio, a step, weights and a mat for floor work. After a variety of squats, burpees, weight lifting and sit ups, the class left participants sore but extremely satisfied.

	Zumba combined Spanish influenced music and an hour of fun, constant dancing. The Sport & Health Zumba classes were small, with only five or six students.

	The Zumba class was very laid back, and the instructor reassured the students at the start to do their own thing and modify as needed. The instructor was extremely fun and easy to follow.

	The yoga class was more difficult than expected. The class focused on strengthening your body, and less on relaxation and breathing compared to other classes I have attended.

	The yoga instructor didn’t seem to want new students in the class at all, and though he was quick to help other students, he neglected struggling new students. I wouldn’t recommend this class unless you’re comfortable with advanced yoga techniques.

2015-04-10,AU,club,"Coming down from the high of releasing an album less than 12 hours before its D.C. show, Reptar lit up U Street Music Hall on April 2.
Fellow Atlanta natives Breathers started the night early on with a synth-heavy setlist, followed quickly by Baltimore outfit Sun Club. Sun Club proved to be an impressive surprise. A little pop-punk and a little singer-songwriter, it knew its way around a stage and easily grabbed the audience’s attention with spontaneous and fun energy. Its EP “Dad Claps at the Mom Prom” is definitely worth a listen. 
Reptar’s show was just as chaotic and quirky as promised. Starting the set with old favorites like “Rainbounce,” it quickly got the crowd singing and dancing. The band also played several new tracks from its recent album “Lurid Glow,” which was released on April 2. New favorites included “Ice Black Sand” and “Cable.” 
The heavy bass and strong electronic undertones created the perfect environment for impromptu mosh pits and a case of crowd surfing encouraged by Graham Ulicny, vocals and guitar. Ulicny got off the stage and sang with audience members twice, making the show feel all the more intimate. 
While Ulicny frequented the crowd, William Kennedy shredded the keyboard and highlighted the vocal range and capabilities of the band. The live brass and woodwinds added an entire other dimension to the already layered and complicated sets that Reptar seems to have mastered. 
Reptar gave its all on stage and their fans ate it up. Drawing a young crowd, the show remained light-hearted and fun. The set was unapologetically discombobulated and a little bit insane, but concertgoers loved it. The stage presence of this Georgia squad was electric and catching, and the audience was noticeably full of smiles. 
In the world of self-made music, Reptar’s rapid success is admirable. Built from the ground up and quickly gaining a following, the band has stayed humble and true to itself in a way that will only help it moving forward. 
The show as a whole was unconventional and feel-good, and the small venue lent an added intimacy to the otherwise energetic setting. Reptar is anything but forgettable, and its show offered a prime example of why the young band remains steadily on the rise.

2015-05-01,AU,club,"The Mary Graydon Center in 2015. 

	Weeks after a Student Government referendum passed overwhelmingly in favor of converting the third floor of Mary Graydon Center into student space, Vice President of Campus Life Gail Hanson says the University is in the pre-planning stages of creating the new space.

	Hanson announced to student leaders at a closed-door meeting on April 22 that President Neil Kerwin will soon move forward with plans to expand student life space in MGC to the third floor, Hanson and attendees including SG President Sasha Gilthorpe and former president Sophia Wirth said afterward.

	Hanson said in an interview with The Eagle that the University is beginning a process that is expected to span several years. The first step, she said, is that the University plans to hire a consultant next academic year to examine how the space might be used.

	“It’s very preliminary, but this is the first we’ve known that we’re getting ready to do the planning,” Hanson said.

	It is too early to know who will get to use the space, when the consulting process will exactly begin and where the classrooms and departments currently using office space will be moved. There are also many organizations who will likely make their case for space as Greek life and clubs face challenges in booking the little space that exists currently, the Eagle previously 
	reported.

	The space will likely not be ready until after East Campus is completed, according to Hanson, which is slated to open for fall 2016, although construction delays have put the project behind schedule, the Eagle previously 
	reported. Hanson said the renovation process will be similar to previous renovations in MGC.

	“The whole [second floor] was gutted and built out in a way that met our needs at the time…and we’ll go through a very similar process on the third floor,” Hanson said.

	 In 2001, the University renovated the second floor, which also used to house offices and classrooms.

	However, while the University is only in the early stages of converting the space, student leaders praised the announcement.

	“This has been kind of a decade in the making, if not more,” Wirth said. 
	Wirth campaigned throughout the year for more club, Greek life and student organization space.

	“I think this is a huge opportunity for students to really assess how they want their social and extracurricular space dedicated,” she said.

	In the April 
	SG elections, 97 percent of students voted in favor of expanding student space to the third floor. The SG Senate supported the referendum and made it a priority in their spring agenda. Undergraduate senator and general manager of ATV Geet Jeswani, who led the charge to collect 750 signatures to place the referendum on the ballot, is pleased the University is moving forward.

	“Seeing this thing through and seeing it actually happen is so great,” Jeswani, a senior in the School of Communication, said.

	Hanson said students will have the opportunity to give input during the consulting process, though she did not specify how. She also added converting the third floor of MGC was always one of the University’s goals.

	“In our space planning, it always was the case that the third floor of Mary Graydon, when we didn’t need it for student space, would become part of the University Center,” Hanson said. 
	University Center is the formal name of student life facilities, which includes the first and second floors of MGC.

	“And I’ve appreciated the student advocacy because that has helped to underscore just how important this is to students, but it was certainly the University’s intention to have that become University Center space as soon as possible,” she said.

MGC third floor (Cuneyt Dil/The Eagle).

	Undergraduate Senate Speaker Will Mascaro said he plans to make the third floor of MGC a priority again in the fall Senate agenda. His proposals include allowing the third floor rooms to remain unlocked during the night so that students may begin to use the space as they currently use the rooms on the second floor. He also wants to work with Public Safety to determine where security cameras would be required and how often patrols would need to happen on the third floor.

	“Our immediate priority is making that space available to students before it transitions fully over,” Mascaro said, adding that the Senate’s goal is to have unlocked rooms on the third floor by next semester. “The work right now is laying the groundwork.”

	Senior director of University Center and Student Activities Michael Elmore said he had some initial concerns with allowing unlocked doors on the third floor because of classrooms that have expensive equipment, but added “I understand what [Mascaro’s] looking for.”

	There are currently security cameras on the first and second floor, Elmore said, and the Office of Campus Life will work with Public Safety to add them to the third floor in the future.

	The Office of Campus Life will give a presentation to the University Board of Trustees Campus Life Committee later in May about student social space on campus in general, according to Elmore. MGC third floor may be brought up at that meeting.

2015-06-06,AU,club,"A lot caught my eye this week in sports -- almost too much for this quick summary. Although it didn’t make the cut, I couldn’t leave this Lionel Messi goal out of the mix. Enjoy. 




 

	Let’s take a look at what happened in the past week of sports.

		Sepp Blatter resigns four days after winning a fifth term as FIFA president
	

 In a dramatic turn of events, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced on Tuesday that he will be resigning from office after winning a fifth term. His announcement comes amid speculation that he is under investigation as part of the corruption conspiracy that put seven major FIFA officials behind bars last week. Blatter miraculously won re-election over Jordanian challenger Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, but he declared his resignation only four days after his election victory. However, Blatter will not leave office until his successor is announced in a special election that will take place between the months of December 2015 and March 2016. His resignation offers good news for soccer fans because Blatter, who is known as one of the most powerful men in sports, will no longer be in charge of one of the most corrupt organization in the world of sports. FIFA is cleaning up its act, which can only mean good things for the future of soccer.

	2. With Kyrie Irving lost to injury, it’s the Warriors series to lose.

 The Golden State Warriors took Game 1 of the NBA finals Thursday night, beating Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-100. The Warriors held James and the Cavs. to only two points in the overtime period. However, the biggest storyline that emerged from the game was Kyrie Irving’s injury. Irving sat out of most of the Eastern Conference finals with knee and foot issues. Early in the overtime period of Game 1, Irving appeared to re-injure his left knee, which led to an emotional locker room after the game. Irving is set to miss the next three or four months with a fractured kneecap. Irving’s injury is a huge loss for the Cavs. Irving is the Robin to Lebron’s Batman, and he can be even more spectacular than Lebron. Without Irving’s creativity and scoring ability, the Cavaliers will struggle to perform at the same level. It will take a herculean effort from Lebron James -- who had 44 points last night -- to beat Steph Curry and the Warriors. Game 2 is set for Sunday.

	3. The U.S. men’s national soccer team  just made history.

 Down 3-1 with 53 minutes in the books, the U.S. men’s national team (USMNT) struggled to match the more experienced Netherlands team. However, the U.S. summoned the perseverance of the founding fathers and mounted an improbable comeback, defeating the Netherlands 4-3 in Amsterdam today. When the USMNT plays a European power like the Dutch, they typically field a weaker team. That was not that case in today’s match. Dutch stars Robin Van Persie and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar played, along with midfielder maestro Wesley Sneijder. Leading the Stars and Stripes were not the usual culprits, but young players that are looking to make this summer’s Gold Cup roster. Four different players scored for the US -- LA Galaxy forward Gyasi Zardes, Hertha Berlin defender (and World Cup hero) John Brooks, Reading midfielder Danny Williams and 1860 Munich forward Bobby Wood. Three out of the four scorers are under the age of 24. This result is awesome for the USMNT, as they look to built for the Copa America in 2016 and the World Cup in 2018, where head coach Jurgen Klinsmann is shooting for a semifinal appearance. The USMNT will play one more friendly against world champions Germany on June 10th.

	4. The Blackhawks’ Andrew Shaw channeled his inner Luis Suarez.

 During the Blackhawks’ 2-1 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning, forward Andrew Shaw bit Tampa Bay’s Victor Hedman, leading to a small fight.. After the scrum broke apart, Hedman went to the bench and showed bite marks his teammates and staff.




 

	With this bite, Shaw is the newest member of the Bite Club, a collection of athletes that includes Mike Tyson and Luis Suarez. Apparently, the NHL has a history of biting incidents. Game 2 is set for tonight at 9pm ET.

	5. Broncos linebacker Von Miller got fined for what?!

 Von Miller, all-pro outside linebacker for the Denver Broncos, was fined by the team for flatulence during team meetings. Yes, you read that correctly. Flatuence. A player was fined for farting in team meetings. Let’s be honest, it must be pretty bad if the team is forced to fine a player for an action like that.

 Today, one of the world’s best athletes -- Lionel Messi -- will be on full display in the Champions’ League final as Barcelona faces off against Italian powerhouse Juventus. Kickoff is at 2:45 ET on Fox. My prediction is that the attacking triumvirate of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar will be too much for Juventus, and Barcelona will win 4-1.

2015-06-08,AU,club,"Director Andrew Bujalski’s unusual yet charming film “Results” takes on the world of personal trainers and their clients, addressing the relationship between physical and emotional strength. Trevor, played by Guy Pearce (“Memento”), owns the Power 4 Life gym in Austin, Texas, a gym that promises to help clients achieve four things: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual power. He has a tense relationship with Kat, played by Cobie Smulders (“How I Met Your Mother”), a personal trainer at his gym who is also his ex-lover. For both of them, fitness and healthy living is a way of life.
The two characters find their intense fitness culture challenged by the recently divorced Danny, played by Kevin Corrigan (“Grounded for Life”). Overweight, self-indulgent and lazy, Danny hires Kat to help him improve his physical health. The audience soon learns that Danny inherited a large amount of money when his mother died, and he spends it carelessly in an attempt to cure his boredom and depression. He constantly posts ads on Craigslist, offering $200 in exchange for services like TV repairs, an obvious excuse for companionship. 
Superficially, “Results” sheds light on the world of personal trainers and their clients, but at its core, it’s a film that centers around the feeling of loneliness. Trevor’s dedication to his dream of expanding his business has distanced him from his family and relationships. Kat’s intimidating and aloof nature makes it difficult for her to open up to those she cares about, and her aggression drives people away. Danny’s inability to move on from his wife has caused him to isolate himself from others, leaving him lonely and depressed. 
“Results” humorously gives insight into a world many people know little about, but the audience will have a hard time caring about this aspect of the film because the characters are all so unlikeable. Viewers never learn why some characters act the way they do, and this makes understanding their emotional transformations at the end of the film difficult. 
Bujalski introduces interesting secondary characters but never explores them in depth. Anthony Michael Hall (“The Breakfast Club”) plays Grigory, the Russian self-proclaimed “kettlebell master,” but he receives little screen time. Giovanni Ribisi (“Ted”) plays a sleazy and unprofessional commercial lawyer, but he also seems absent from the film. Bujalski could have developed these characters to further flesh out the film. 
Kat and Trevor tentatively work on mending their relationship, but it’s clear this won’t be easy, and Danny works to slowly move on from his divorce. Unfortunately, other than these plot developments, “Results” fails to provide any substantive results by the conclusion of the film. Kat is only slightly less aggressive than before, Trevor is still overly attached to his dream of expanding his business and Danny still seems rather pathetic. The film leaves the audience with merely a shimmer of hope that these hopeless characters will improve their lives.
Grade: C+
“Results” (R, 105 min) is now playing at the Landmark E Street theater.

2015-06-12,AU,club,"Although I say this all the time, June is the best time for sports fans. Out of the four major leagues in the US (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB) two are playing their championship series, one is in full swing and the other is about to start their training camps. On top of that, the Women’s World Cup is happening. What a time to be alive. Here’s what I saw this week in sports.


 		Barcelona is crowned champions of Europe. 		





	 	In my last post, I predicted that Barcelona would triumph over Juventus 4-1 in last Saturday’s Champions League final. I wasn’t far off. Barcelona, champions of La Liga and the Copa Del Rey, completed the treble by beating Juventus 3-1 in Berlin, Germany. Barcelona looked like the better team throughout the game, but Juventus played valiantly. Juventus hit a stroke of bad luck when Paul Pogba did not receive a penalty after Barcelona fullback Dani Alves pulled him down in the 18-yard box. That penalty would have tied the game at two goals apiece, and there’s no telling what could have happened from there. Instead, Neymar, Barcelona’s mercurial left winger, added a goal in the 90th minute to cement Barcelona’s historic season. Some pundits say that this Barcelona team could be the greatest in the club’s magnificent history, and although I am no FC Barcelona historian, this team is the best soccer team that I have seen. The attacking trio of Neymar, Suarez, and Messi might be the best attack the world has ever witnessed. The midfield is a combination of old and new: Ivan Rakitic is all over the field, filling in on the right flank whenever Messi drifts inside while still somehow maintaining a strong presence in the middle of the field. Andres Iniesta is a magician and won Man of the Match honors. Sergio Busquets is the best defensive midfielder in the world. Fullbacks Jordi Alba and Dani Alves somehow attack and defend at the same time, and Gerard Pique has rediscovered his form after a disastrous campaign last season. Luis Enrique brilliantly mixed the classic Barcelona tiki-taka style -- which is predicated on short, quick passing and dominating possession -- with a bundle of long balls over the top of the defense. He also moved the great Lionel Messi out to the right wing, which gives him more space to work his magic. Enrique deserves just as much credit as the players in my opinion. The 2014-15 campaign will go down as one of the best in Barcelona history.





 	2. Chris Heston threw the first no-hitter of the season. 	





	 	The first no-hitter of the 2015 MLB season belongs to Chris Heston, a right handed pitcher on the San Francisco Giants, the defending World Series champions. Heston struck out 11 batters and did not give up a single walk in the Giants’ 5-0 victory over the New York Mets. The only thing that held him back from a no-hitter was the three batters that he hit, the most ever in a no-hitter. This was the 288th no-hitter in MLB history and the fourth-no hitter in four years for the San Francisco Giants. However, the no-hitter wasn’t just an achievement for Heston -- Giants catcher Buster Posey earned his third no-hitter as a catcher, placing him second in the record books behind Jason Varitek. The Giants have won three of the last five World Series, and strong pitching is the main reason for their sustained success.


  	3. What in the world is wrong with Ben Bishop?  	


	Out of all of the storylines that the Stanley Cup final has produced, there is one that stands out to me: What is wrong with Tampa Bay Lightning goalie Ben Bishop? Bishop’s play in goal has been a bright spot for the Lightning throughout the playoffs, and he’s a key factor in the Lightning's success. However, Bishop ran into some problems during Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals, when he exited in the third period but then returned to the game. There is no clear answer as to why Bishop left Game 2. Bishop played the entirety of Game 3 and earned the win, making some spectacular saves along the way. However, Bishop did not suit up for Game 4, and the Blackhawks won. The series is now 2-2. The Lightning stated that Bishop did not play in Game 4 because he had an undisclosed injury, and the Lightning did not reveal any additional details. Nothing frustrates sports fans more than the term “undisclosed injury.” There has been a number of conspiracy theories that have floated around the internet, but fans can only speculate what is wrong with the Lightning goalkeeper. Let’s hope that he can get healthy for a pivotal Game 5 because he is an outstanding player, and the series would be better with him in net for Tampa Bay.


  	4. United States Soccer is on FIRE right now.   	


	Between the men’s national team and the women’s national team, there is a lot to be excited about in the world of soccer. The women’s national team won its first game of the World Cup against a good Australian team 3-1. Megan Rapinoe looked phenomenal, scoring two goals and consistently getting up and down the left side of the field with ease. Goalkeeper Hope Solo was outstanding as well, making a couple of big saves early in the game to keep Australia from taking the lead. The next game for the United States women is against Sweden on Friday at 8 p.m. EST. Sweden is lead by Pia Sundhage, who coached the U.S. team in the previous World Cup.


	The men’s national team made history again on Wednesday. For the first time in US soccer history, the U.S. men’s national team beat Germany on German soil, pulling off yet another comeback victory.  Germany looked like it would dominate the game when Mario Gotze -- scorer of the winning goal in last summer’s World Cup -- put a volley past US goalkeeper Brad Guzan. But once again the USMNT heard the call of Uncle Sam and did what the United States does best -- overcome all odds. The U.S. equalized through a Mix Diskerud goal (watch it here) and then Bobby Wood, who scored the winner against the Dutch the previous week, struck again. After a beautiful dummy from Jordan Morris, Wood turned and unleashed a sensational strike that beat the keeper and the Germans. Although Germany played with a weaker team than usual, the U.S. was without most of their World Cup players. The future of U.S. men’s national team just got a lot brighter.


  	5. The Warriors have figured out the Cavaliers, who came back down to Earth last night. 	


	The Golden State Warriors got back on track last night, dominating the Cleveland Cavaliers and winning Game 4 of the NBA finals 103-82 in Cleveland. The series is now tied 2-2, with the crucial fifth game back in Oakland. The Warriors, who lost the past two games, removed center Andrew Bogut from the starting lineup and added forward Andre Iguodala. This change made the Warriors line-up smaller and faster, neutralizing the size of Cleveland’s front line. In addition to going smaller, the Warriors also played David Lee, their highest paid player and a former all star who was moved out of the rotation due to the emergence of Draymond Green. Lebron’s play in the first three games of the series is some of the best basketball ever played, and he currently averages 41 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists a game. Last night, Golden State gave Lebron some different looks on defense, swarming the paint when he drove to the hoop and often double teamed him when he posted up. The Warriors now have all of the momentum headed back home, where they have only lost three games this season. It is a miracle that Lebron has his Cavalier team tied with the superior Warriors in this series, especially since Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving -- two all-stars -- are out with injury. Players like Matthew Dellavedova and Tristan Thompson have stepped up and played extremely well, and Dellavedova has become somewhat of a folk hero in Cleveland with his heroic play in Games 2 and 3. It seems as if the Warriors have figured out their game plan going into the most crucial games of the season. It will be interesting to see how the Cavaliers will respond.


	Looking forward, don’t miss the U.S. women’s national team take the field this Friday against Sweden at 8 p.m. EST. At the same time, the puck drops for Blackhawks vs. Lightning Game 5. The Cavaliers and Warriors take the court again on Sunday, with tipoff at 8 p.m. EST as well.

2015-08-09,AU,club,"In the Netflix show “House of Cards,” Frank and Claire Underwood seem to love their runs in the National Mall. But I’d rather lie in my comfortable bed and watch them exercise than lace up my own shoes. The American Fitness Index recently released a study that named Washington, D.C. the fittest city in America—but I’m beyond skeptical of this conclusion. 
The AFI compiled a list on the most fit and least fit cities in the U.S earlier this year. The organization concludes D.C. surpassed other “fit cities” on the list, such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon because many people in the District choose to walk to work. The number of parks in D.C. also contributed to the city’s high ranking, according a Georgia State University AFI report. 
When I heard about the District’s first place ranking, I initially questioned the standing. I don’t workout frequently, and many of my friends don’t either, so I set out to test D.C.’s fitness ranking in lieu of the AFI report. I wanted to assess the number of D.C. residents who embraced fitness and how recreational activities in the city helped boost the area’s status as the “fittest” city.  I began to rationalize the ranking by analyzing my own life: maybe I’m surrounding myself with the small percentage of D.C. residents who don’t exercise, or maybe I’m living in my own fantasy world where the gym acts as a scapegoat to avoid human interaction. 
I took my skepticism to AU’s Jacobs Fitness Center to find data to test the study’s findings. As I looked around the gym, I felt blown away by the amount of people exercising. I then met desk attendant Blake Norton, a junior in the School of International Service and a self-proclaimed physically active resident of D.C. 
When I asked Norton if he agreed with the study’s findings, he also appeared skeptical.
“That’s a hard question,” Blake said. “It’s starting to be. People are biking to work now.”
In his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Norton said people have a difficult time commuting via bikes, which makes driving a necessity. He said D.C. has bike lanes and sidewalks for people to bike to work and school, allowing them to stay active.  
Norton said he runs four to six miles a day and lifts in between his classes and work but he prefers to run at the gym rather than outside. Norton’s preference inspired me to evaluate gym accessibility and prevalence in the District, and I discovered D.C. boasts 849 gyms, according to Yelp. But does this number of gyms reflect all of D.C. or only a small portion?
After another search on Yelp, I found that Anacostia has only one small gym named “Metropolitan Fitness & Safety Academy Health Club,” a facility located at 2201 Shannon Pl SE that does not have a website or Yelp reviews. Owners and managers of the gym could not be reached for comment. 
Yelp showed 11 gyms in the Georgetown neighborhood, a number that stands in stark contrast to the lone complex in Anacostia. Georgetown claims an average annual household income of  $132,814, according to City Data, and the average annual household income in Anacostia is $30,000. City Data offers a detailed profile of each neighborhood in D.C. including average income, race, education and more. The $102,814 discrepancy between Georgetown and Anacostia correlates with the number of  available gym facilities between the two neighborhoods.
In 2004, Myfoxdc.com, a D.C. news station, named the area near Atlantic Avenue and 4th Street in Southeast D.C. the 22nd most dangerous neighborhood in the country. The news station reported that residents did not feel safe in their town, creating additional challenges for those who wished to exercise outside in the public. With a constant fear for their lives, children in this area live without the luxury of running through parks with their friends for daily exercise. 
Fitness also includes healthy eating, and to afford healthy eating, it’s important to live by grocery stores that offer fresh produce, rather than be surrounded by fast food restaurants. An article published by the The Food Trust covering the ‘grocery gap’ further proves my theory.
“In Washington, D.C., the city’s lowest-income wards (Wards 7 and 8) have one supermarket for every 70,000 people while two of the three highest-income wards (ards 2 and 3) have one for every 11,881 people,” according to The Food Trust article.
I also spoke with Lily Barsanti, a rising sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, who has spent two semesters on AU’s dance team, to understand an AU athlete’s perspective on the fitness ranking.  Barsanti said she agreed with Norton that D.C. fosters an active culture because of public transportation problems and healthy food options. 
“The metro is so hard to take, so people end up walking everywhere,” Barsanti said. “Where we live in D.C., there doesn’t seem to have a lot of fast food readily available. I definitely believe health food is becoming very trendy in D.C.”
Barsanti’s fast food comment prompted me to research the number of McDonald's restaurants in Anacostia and Georgetown. Anacostia includes three McDonald’s, but visitors won’t find the Golden Arches anywhere in Georgetown. The McDonald’s comparison and the stats included in  The Food Trust article demonstrate that healthy food options differ drastically in different areas of D.C., suggesting that D.C.’s ranking as the “fittest city” does not consider all areas of the District. My research proves that Anacostia lacks nutritious food, and we should not label all of D.C. as a part of the “fittest city.” By accepting the AFI ranking without critical questioning we  allow the District to ignore the work it must do to provide a healthier environment for underprivileged areas.
While American Fitness Index took the average measurements of fitness in D.C. to make its rankings, it failed to look at the major disparities between the neighborhoods of D.C. The next step in making D.C. a fitter overall city is taking action in providing nutritious food to every area, making gyms more readily available and working on the safety of parks.

2015-09-10,AU,club,"Pitches Be Trippin' performing at Acapalooza in 2014.
AU’s four a cappella groups will show off their unique musical styles this Saturday, Sept. 12 at the fall preview concert. The event, which will be held at the Kay Spiritual Life Center, begins at 8:30 p.m. and the doors will open at 8:15 p.m.
According to Hayat Abu-Ghazaleh, the manager of female group Pitches Be Trippin’, each of the four groups will sing two songs.
“We just want to have a strong, energetic performance to get young women interested in a cappella and Pitches Be Trippin’,” Abu-Ghazaleh said. “Our big goal for the semester is to bring variety to our performances.”
Coed group Dime a Dozen will sing “Madness” by Muse and a mashup of “Nobody Love” by Tori Kelly and “Problem” by Ariana Grande. Additionally, all-female group Treble in Paradise will perform a 60s-themed number and a song by Little Mix.
After Saturday’s show, each group will hold performances on and off campus throughout the year. The groups also collaborate with each other and with a cappella clubs from different schools.
According to sophomore member Sean Reynolds, the all-male group On a Sensual Note has taken trips to to sing in Los Angeles and Disney World, and the group is looking into a trip to New Orleans over spring break.
Treble in Paradise recently performed at AU Night at Nationals Park on Aug. 28 and will be returning to the stadium on Sept. 22 to sing the national anthem. During the holidays, members have sung carols at the Walter Reed Medical Center, a facility that treats military veterans, and the group hopes to return again this year.
Despite varied musical interests, which range from pop to classical, members of each group stressed how close they feel to their fellow singers.
“First and foremost we’re friends, and then we’re singers,” Reynolds said. “We don’t take ourselves too seriously.” 
Each a cappella group has a different dynamic, but leaders said they have each found their own way to mesh. The preview concert will allow other students to decide if they could see themselves joining a group, Hannah Johnson, the senior music director of Treble in Paradise, said.
“Dime a Dozen is the only coed group on campus, so that was pretty important to me,” Kaeli Patchen, a sophomore member of Dime a Dozen, said. “We’re a really close family, and we get to hang out with an awesome group of people.”
Members of Pitches be Trippin’ and Treble in Paradise, both of which are all-female groups, said they valued empowering women through their creative expression.
""We have always had a strong female empowerment vibe, singing songs by Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and Christina Aguilera,"" Johnson said. ""We're really open to anyone who wants to come out.""
However, Johnson also wants to encourage a greater a cappella community to grow at AU.
“In the past, a cappella was kind of individual,” Johnson said. “We want to create a community including all of the a cappella groups on campus.”
Everyone is invited to attend the free concert, and students interested in joining Dime a Dozen, Treble in Paradise, On a Sensual Note or Pitches Be Trippin’ will have the opportunity to audition for their desired group on Sunday, Sept. 13.jodonohoe@theeagleonline.com

2015-10-13,AU,club,"Concertgoers wound around the block at the 9:30 Club, waiting in line for Mew’s headlining show on Oct. 9. The Danish pop-rock band, usually found playing to massive European audiences, packed their energy and charisma into a high-octane show that kept 9:30 visitors moving throughout the performance. Eclectic indie-rock duo The Dodos played a brief but stellar opening set showcasing songs from its newest releases, 2015’s “Individ,” and 2013’s “Carrier.”
The Dodos took the stage promptly at 10:30, kicking off the late-night show with pounding drums and percussive guitar in “Goodbyes and Endings,” then launched immediately into “Competition,” a stand-out track from “Individ.” Guitarist Meric Long’s thickly layered guitar parts were supported by drummer Logan Kroeber’s primal, polyrhythmic beats. The duo blazed through their 30-minute set, balancing catchy hooks against densely interwoven rhythm-driven jams. Long’s guitar work in an extended solo on “The Current” left concertgoers - even those solely in attendance for Mew - thoroughly impressed. The short set wrapped up with “Precipitation,”  the driving first track on “Individ.”
After a brief intermission, Mew took the stage one member at a time amidst thunderous applause. The Danish prog-rock outfit, whose sound leans more pop than most profiles indicate, launched into its set with “Witness,” from latest album, “+ -.” Elaborate lighting and impeccable sound engineering emphasized that Mew operates on a level of professionalism not always found in smaller venues. Though better known in its native Europe, Mew’s DC fan base turned out in full, packing the 9:30 Club’s sizable floor to capacity. 
The band’s festival-grade energy coursed through the venue and spilled over into the crowd as Mew continued its set with new songs including “Satellites” and “Water Slides.” Its well-balanced sound perfectly highlighted the members’ individual talents, though Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen (drums) and Mads Wegner (guitar) cut through the mix particularly well. 
Mew charged through its headlining set, delivering rock-steady performances of songs from “+ -,” with a healthy infusion of old favorites. The band kept the energy flowing throughout the dreaded midway point—an often unavoidable trap for even seasoned performers—and hardly stopped to rest between electrifying performances of crowd favorites “Snow Brigade” and “She Spider.” 
The Danish rockers wound down their main set with popular tracks “Am I Wry? No” and “156,” but a deafening call for more brought the group back out. To the audience’s roaring approval, Mew ripped through newer hit “My Complications” and concluded with a soaring rendition of “Comforting Sounds.” Crashing drums and built-up guitars underscored lead singer Jonas Bjerre’s impressively controlled falsetto, ending the night on a literal high note. Mew may not have its largest demographic of listeners here in the U.S., but the dedicated fans that flooded the 9:30 club on Oct. 9 were treated to an outstanding performance that surely won the Danish pop-rockers more than a few new listeners.

2015-10-13,AU,club,"Kiersten Gillette-Pierce speaks at the Senate meeting on Oct. 11. Photo by OWAIN JAMES / THE EAGLE
At a packed meeting on Sunday, the Undergraduate Senate unanimously passed a bill requiring all Student Government office holders to undergo cultural and racial sensitivity training.
The bill, written by Kiersten Gillette-Pierce, a senator for the class of 2016, and co-sponsored by Devontae Torriente, a senator for the Class of 2018, works to combat racial insensitivity on campus.
“This is not revolutionary, this is just necessary,” Gillette-Pierce said on the Senate floor. “Every year I’ve been here, it’s gotten worse … with these trainings, at least we can’t excuse ignorance.”
The legislation is crucial, Gillette-Pierce said, because the Student Conduct Code has no specific policy for dealing with harassment based on race.
The bill outlines a plan for the trainings, which will begin next semester. The program’s success will be monitored with evaluation forms completed before and after the trainings, which SG members will submit to the Comptroller’s office. Officers who fail to comply with the mandate may face disciplinary action from their supervising executives.
Senators, for instance, would be punished by the Speaker. Current Speaker Will Mascaro said that he would either encourage the Senate to consider suspending the senator until they completed the training, or write and sign a legislative order suspending the senator until they complied.
If the program is successful, the creators hope to expand it to include members of other clubs and organizations and, ultimately, the entire campus.
The curriculum for the trainings has not yet been written. Members of the SG Diversity and Inclusion Working Group, AU’s cultural clubs and student-led racial justice movement The Darkening will design the course together, according to Gillette-Pierce.
“We’re starting it with the student leaders because they’re the ones who influence the student body the most, and by having them set the example … it makes it easier to have everyone get on board,” said Aaliyah Lambert, the coordinator of the SG Diversity and Inclusion Working Group.
Although the group has not decided on a format for the trainings, Gillette-Pierce said she envisions something similar to Empower AU, a sexual assault prevention workshop piloted during Welcome Week this year.
When the bill passed, the sizable crowd present gave Gillette-Pierce a standing ovation.Members or supporters of The Darkening made up a large portion of the audience, and the group created a Facebook event encouraging students to come, using the hashtag “#BlackOutSenate.”
The Darkening has had a strong presence at AU since the fall of 2014, when it was started by five female AU students, according to Gordon Edwards, chair of The Darkening’s Student Life Committee.
The movement’s mission is “To establish harmony on campus through fostering an environment conducive to acceptance, cultural sensitivity & love for all people,” according to its Facebook page. Since its inception, The Darkening has organized several well-attended protests and collaborated with Student Government and the Office of Campus Life to plan forums and teach-ins, The Eagle previously reported.
School-wide conversations about race relations and multiculturalism have been scarce, Edwards said. He specifically mentioned racially-offensive posts on Yik Yak, a social media app that allows users to write anonymous comments and view comments from others in the same geographic area. Commenters in the range of AU’s campus used Yik Yak to make racial jokes and post slurs at various times last school year, the Eagle previously reported.
Sunday’s Senate meeting fell just a few days after even more racist posts appeared on the app. Edwards also cited a recent incident in which the “n-word” was written on a whiteboard in freshman dorm Anderson Hall.
“Students get let off for a large majority of their offensive comments,” Edwards said.
Edwards said he sees Gillette-Pierce’s bill as “the beginning of long-term progress.” He is hopeful that the conversations it inspires will help students examine their prejudices.
“There are too many human factors to really say what its success will be, but if students keep talking about it, students keep advocating, and students keep getting involved,” Edwards said. “It will be very successful, regardless of whatever opposition is ahead of us.”

	In 1999, the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration placed a moratorium on issuing liquor licenses around Glover Park and Cathedral Heights. The measure prevented any new taverns or nightclubs from opening in the area, and put a cap on liquor licenses issued to restaurants.

	“It was devised to control what was then out-of-control peace, order and quiet issues as a result of ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control) licensed establishments,” Glover Park Advisory Neighborhood Commission Chair Jackie Blumenthal said.

	Last Thursday, the ANC proposed that the restriction be lifted on restaurant licenses — but not for taverns or nightclubs.

	The ANC has supported loosening the moratorium’s restrictions before; the last three times the city ordinance was up for renewal, the ANC endorsed weakening it. The commission’s current proposal keeps with the trend.

	“We’ll approve continuing the moratorium against taverns and nightclubs, but not against anything else in Glover Park,” Blumenthal said.

	The ANC will vote on their proposal Nov. 12. In the meantime, residents are encouraged to send feedback to commissioners by 
	email.

	If the ANC supports the alterations to the moratorium they will have to present the proposal to the alcoholic beverage regulatory agency.

	“We will appear before ABRA, probably in January, before the Alcohol Beverage Control Board to present our petition and answer their questions,” Blumenthal said.
The vote will be the first step towards a major change for potential restaurants in Glover Park and Cathedral Heights. If approved, it may be a few months before looser regulations take into effect.

2016-02-11,AU,club,"AU Recreational Sports and Fitness launched a new Weight-Loss Club this semester aimed at helping students and AU faculty and staff members who want to start living a healthier lifestyle.
The club provides its members a comprehensive guide to change unhealthy lifestyle choices, starting with two full fitness assessments measuring resting heart rate and blood pressure, a body composition analysis, cardiovascular and muscular endurance and flexibility, according to AU RecFit’s website. Members will also receive ten one-hour workout sessions with a certified personal trainer and a one-on-one consultation and nutrition class with AU’s registered dietitian, Jo-Ann Jolly.
Many of AU RecFit’s current fitness programs, such as Women on Weights, have been aimed at people who have already been exercising. According to Allie Jackson, the adjunct instructor for RecFit who started the program, the Weight-Loss Club is targeted at those who may not have stepped into the world of good health before.
Jackson said that the club is meant to create a safe space for those wanting to change their lifestyle but may not feel welcome in the gym.
“I want it to be a group of people that can rely on each other to reach their goals because weight loss is hard. A lot of people fluctuate and don’t have that social support that they need,” Jackson said.
Programs like the Weight-Loss Club are signaling a change in the style of programming for AU RecFit. More courses will be designed for small group training of niche groups rather than trying to host one huge class to fit everyone.
“What I’m trying to do is just make small groups and small programs that target specific people, and I think that’s become more successful for us here, just because AU is such a diverse population,” Jackson said. 
For a new program, Jackson said she is pleased with the response of the AU community. The first morning session, held on Jan. 25, included six participants, meeting Jackson’s desired cap. She hoped to run an afternoon meeting as well but could not receive enough commitments from interested students to host the second session. The club will run in two sessions, with the first in progress and running until March 4. The second session will run from March 14 to April 22. Meetings with the personal trainer occur on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:15-8:15 a.m. or from 12-1 p.m. Costs for a six-week session are $276 for AU RecFit members and $306 for faculty and staff non-members.
The start of the club coincides with AhealthyU’s Why Weight 8-Week Weight Loss Kick-Start, a program encouraging faculty members to pair up and support each other as they try to achieve a specific weight loss or maintenance goal. The program began on Feb. 1 and will continue until March 25.
Jackson said she has faith in the participants and hopes that this changes their lives for the better.
“I would love to see them start on a routine and have exercise become a part of who they are and not a chore that they have to do,” Jackson said. “With Jo-Ann, I would like for them to learn healthy eating and that they don’t have to starve themselves to lose weight.”

2016-02-12,AU,club,"Mental health advocate and founder of The PostSecret Project Frank Warren will speak at AU on Feb. 22, according to a Kennedy Political Union press release. 
Created by Warren in 2004, the PostSecret Project is an effort to collect anonymously mailed cards containing “the soulful secrets we never voice,” according to the release. So far, the project has received over 500,000 postcards, each containing a different confession, ranging from feelings and acts of love and kindness to fear and guilt.
The event, to be held in the MGC University Club at 8:15 p.m., will kick off the start of the project at AU, which will last from Feb. 29 through March 18,  according to the release. The project, put on by Student Government, is meant to raise awareness about mental health issues on campus. Warren will address the crowd and then answer students’ questions. 
“The Kennedy Political Union and Student Government as a whole understand that bringing speakers to campus is an essential part of the process of bringing light to the issues that matter to American University students,” KPU Communications Director Coby Eiss said. “Warren’s work in the field of mental health advocacy will provide great insight to students looking to improve American University’s resources to address this pressing matter.”

2016-02-13,AU,club,"For months, the AU club sailing team has boasted all the bells and whistles one would expect from a sports club: custom sweatshirts, stickers with their logo, and even a flag. Everything, that is, except for boats.

	 	Like a baseball team without bats, the club sailing members have tried making do without the one thing they need in order to practice. At the same time, the team has still competed in regattas (boat races) against other schools as part of the Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Schools that host regattas provide boats for all competitors.

	 	Yet for the AU team, sailboats, which can be expensive for a startup group, are crucial for even more than practice: team members say they need the equipment in order to attract recruits.

	 	“We have a lot of people who have interest and people who have sailing experience, but they’re really turned off by the fact that we don’t have boats,” club president sophomore Audrey Milite said.

	 	Danny Anderson, a sophomore and vice-president of the club, agreed.

	 	“We can’t teach sailing without boats,” Anderson said.

	 	However, the team had a solution. Club 420s, one of the two most commonly used collegiate sailing boats, can run up to $8,600. But the team got lucky, finding two used Club 420s costing roughly $600 each from a seller in Buffalo, New York.

				“We were able to get a very good deal on these two boats (which are in good condition for our purposes) and want to be able to take advantage of the opportunity,” the team wrote in an email to Dwayne Wilkerson, assistant director of club sports.

	 			Despite its good fortune in finding the cheaper boats, the AU club sailing team still hit a snag. Wilkerson replied on Nov. 10, 2015 that the procurement office, which has to give the greenlight to buy the boats, wasn’t convinced the boats were quality. The team even attached pictures of the boats to the email, but Wilkerson wrote “procurement office said the pictures weren’t sufficient and they saw what they believed to be damage in the little they could see in the pictures. … They basically said it is like buying off Craigslist.”

	 			Now, Milite and Anderson say the University is moving forward with purchasing the boats. The procurement office and the team worked out a deal where members will go to Buffalo to inspect and buy the boats, then transport them back to D.C.

	 			“[Our] hopeful scenario is that we get the boats before April,” Milite said. “March is a little cold, but April would be the month to practice.”

	 			Yet the team is rueful for the opportunities missed as the process stretched out over the better part of the year. Originally, the team hoped to have the boats in the fall semester. The team’s faculty sponsor, Jolie Roetter, knows the owner of the boats and the yacht club from which the team is buying the boats. Milite said Roetter has 40 years of sailing experience, and that the University should have trusted her judgement before questioning the quality of the boats.

	 			“Now they seem kind of on board just because we pushed so much,” Milite said of the process to win approval for the boats. “It’s just frustrating the lengths you have to go to actually get involved in this campus. They should be pushing us to do it, instead of us pushing them.”

2016-03-12,AU,club,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a crowd of AU students, staff and international media in the School of International Service Atrium on Friday morning that young people need to challenge the status quo if they hope to see change in the world.
“[Current leaders] need you to be thinking and challenging us about why we’re doing this, why we’re doing that, why we’re not doing this, how we’re doing this differently, and that doesn’t just mean speaking up,” Trudeau said. “It also means getting involved. It also means understanding that your voices are an essential part of the mix to challenge us to think about your future.”
Trudeau’s stop at AU came as part of a larger trip to Washington D.C., the first by a Canadian Prime Minister in 19 years. Earlier during his visit, Trudeau spent time with President Barack Obama at the White House, attended a State Dinner studded with appearances by politicians, celebrities and entrepreneurs and paid respects at Arlington National Cemetery.
Since his election in October 2015, Trudeau has committed his time in office to implementing his liberal ideals in Canadian policy. Trudeau became the first Prime Minister to have gender parity in his Cabinet when he chose 13 men and 13 women to fill the roles. He is also well-known for labeling himself as a feminist and supporting his stance on the issue by saying, “Because it’s 2015,” last year.
“There are lots of extraordinary women standing up for women’s rights, but I need more men to do that. It’s fighting for rights, it’s fighting for equality, it’s fighting for basic respect, and I keep having to update this, but it’s 2016 guys,” Trudeau said at today’s event.
Additionally, Trudeau discussed his commitment to take action against climate change which he also shared with Obama during their meeting yesterday.
“That idea of giving up on economic progress to protect the environment no longer makes sense because the only way we’re going to build a strong, sustainable economy is by cherishing ecosystem services and natural resources that underpin everything else,” Trudeau said.
In light of the current election cycle occurring in the United States, Trudeau said he was not concerned about an influx of Americans immigrating to Canada should people disagree with the United States’s next president and said that he would be willing to work with the person ultimately elected. He also commented on Canada’s recent decision to end its role in bombing ISIS, choosing instead to send in ground troops to help civilians build the ability to support themselves. Trudeau said that this type of diplomacy work is essential to creating long-term security and is something Canada can offer.
During his speech, Trudeau also called for a greater appreciation for diversity and creating opportunities for all kinds of people to succeed as important to developing the economy. He said that in the past, many people’s careers had a linear trajectory, but that isn’t the case today.
“Right now the career paths that we’re going to have will jump around everywhere. I mean, it’s preposterous to think that a former snowboard instructor and nightclub bouncer could end up the Prime Minister of Canada,” Trudeau said, poking fun at his own path to becoming the Prime Minister. “But the experiences we accumulate along the way of multiple career paths and multiple engagements that define us and shape us as individuals and leaders are extremely important and extremely varied and that’s one of the really exciting things for me about this generation.”
Trudeau said that he built his campaign to office based on a pure idealization of what Canadian citizens hoped their government to be, including openness and cooperation, and he plans to keep his promises and maintain Canada’s relationship with the United States.
“People need to understand that the rights and freedoms that keep us free and democratic societies aren’t always easy, aren’t always sort of knee-jerk, adapted to how we’d like the world to be, but they are essential in terms of being the countries we are,” Trudeau said.

2016-04-11,AU,club,"More often than not, self-sufficiency is the type of independence to be admired. When it comes to helping other countries gain this same type of independence, the U.S. plays the role of the suffocating parent—and the same goes for aid in Afghanistan. 
For example, a 2012 survey of women across Afghanistan by the charity ActionAid discovered that nine out of ten feared the departure of the international community because they felt their lives would significantly deteriorate. Since departure, violence against women has never been higher, with  87 percent of women reporting domestic abuse. And of the 5.8 million people without access to healthcare in Afghanistan, 4.4 million are women. Although international aid has helped shift the public eye to supporting these Afghani women in their communities, an emerging pattern says Afghan women need international aid in order to gain rights in their own country. 
The revolution of women in Afghanistan is a fight for their own rights, something a foreign man in a soldier’s uniform can’t manufacture. Women like Zainab, the first woman to ever run a marathon in her country at only 25-years-old, are inspiring women and children all over Afghanistan to be brave in what they love. When training, Zainab spoke about her experiences running outdoors where children would throw stones.
“Prostitutes, why don’t you stay at home? You are destroying Islam,” people would shout at her and her friend.
Most of the time, Zainab had to practice her 26-mile trek running circles around her own backyard. Attempts to play sports for women in Afghanistan, especially those in public, is hard. In the past, Zainab enrolled in a girls' taekwondo club, but shortly after police shut it down. When Zainab ran the marathon in Bamiyan, a more liberal and safer area of Afghanistan.  
“Bamiyan is a good place for this. In other places, they would be killed,” the region's governor, Zahir Tahir, said.
Recently, a mob beat a 27-year-old woman to death after arguing with a mullah, a man trained in religious law. Following this woman’s murder, for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, raising the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves; openly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets.
Through it all, women in Afghanistan are people seeking their right to run outdoors, have opinions and wear what they want. The only difference is they live in a country that a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll ranked in 2011 as one of the most dangerous places for women to live. But these women, through their own efforts and bravery, are seeking ways to have a voice. 
The Afghan Rug Project, an organization founded by James Opie in 2008, is a social enterprise that sells rugs weaved by women in Afghanistan in America or Europe. Its mission is to use rug weaving as an avenue to foster independence for Afghan women. The organization is built on the concept of exchange, expanding the business reach for these women without forcing them to rely on handouts from the Taliban, hard labor in the fields, or charity. 
With around 300 women already weaving, the Afghan Rug Project began not to solve complex political or military problems, but to address important needs of village-dwelling families harassed by members of the Taliban who roam the countryside. With organizations like this, women in Afghanistan can support themselves and their families self-sufficiently—a stepping stone for future independence.

2016-04-12,AU,club,"A snapshot from Truckeroo 2016.
The Scene has news for all food truck fans: the District will once again host Truckeroo, a monthly festival that features a plethora of food trucks, with the first event happening this Friday.
For those who have not yet jumped on the food truck bandwagon, Truckeroo will tempt your taste buds once a month from April through September at the Fairgrounds in southeast D.C. The idea for the food truck festival was created in 2010 by Bo Blair, owner of The Bullpen and Das Bullpen beer gardens in association with the DC Food Truck Association, Capitol Riverfront BID, Washington City Paper and Food Truck Fiesta.
The festival, which will feature 15-25 different trucks, begins at lunchtime, and continues until 11 p.m. The event will involve food, live music, corn hole and other games.
From lobster rolls, empanadas, pizza to crepes, Truckeroo offers a dish everyone can enjoy. The event displays a variety of food categories, including Spanish tapas, Vietnamese noodles, Korean barbeque and classic American soul food. Some of the food trucks featured this year are Holy Crepes, Captain Cookie & The MIlkMan, DC Slices, Kafta Mania and more. 
Holy Crepes uses fresh ingredients to create the perfect crepe. The truck offers delicious crepes for customers who love sweets. For those who prefer something a little meatier, the establishment also offers savory crepes such as chicken caprese, ham with gruyere cheese and the turkey club.
Captain Cookie & The Milkman, a Foggy Bottom favorite, is a bakery and dairy bar serving cookies, milk, and ice cream sandwiches. The restaurant has now transformed its deliciousness into a food truck and offers its popular chipwich: an ice cream sandwich made out of freshly baked cookies and local ice cream. 
DC Slices, another truck slated to appear at Truckeroo, is a pizza kitchen serving flavorful, hot slices of pizza. Fresh dough, homemade sauce and grated cheese are some of the ingredients used to create their pizza pies. They offer pizza by the slice of classic flavors, like cheese, pepperoni, hawaiian, BBQ chicken and more.
Kafta Mania, Lebanese company, serves dishes such as kafta, a Middle Eastern meal. Kafta is cooked by grinding up meat into circular shapes, adding a variety of spices and serving it all in a fresh baguette. The menu has the classic kafta served on a six-inch baguette, beef bowl and mediterranean chicken paninis.
Food trucks are found all over the District, but it is so much more fun to try all of them in one place. With the warm weather coming soon, now is the perfect time to spend with family, friends and some good food. Grab some food from the trucks, head over to the stadium to drink some beers and catch live music. There is no charge for entry, just for food and drinks from the trucks.

2016-04-12,AU,club,"Jews of AU featured three-year scholar Justin Parker after his Birthright trip last winter. 
Clarification appended. 
What does being Jewish mean to you? Since its launch at the beginning of the Spring 2016 semester, the Jews of AU photo project has asked this question to students all across campus to showcase the variety of Jewish experiences at AU.
Students at Brown University created a similar project last year that became successful, prompting Hillel International to share the idea with other campuses, according to Danny Dubin, a senior in the School of Communication and students program coordinator at AU Hillel.
When the opportunity to do “Jews of AU” came to AU’s Hillel office, Dubin decided to spearhead the project along with Dani Rosen, a sophomore in the School of Communication.
“The purpose of the page is to showcase Jewish students on campus,” Dubin said. “We don’t just want students who come to Hillel every Friday night for Shabbat dinners. We really want any Jewish student to be featured on the page and to share their stories.”
Today, the page has a five person staff of photographers and interviewers who create the features. They find many interviewees by asking around in classes and clubs, but others have even been messaging the page and going to Hillel’s office asking to be included.
Justin Parker, a three-year scholar in the School of International Service, went on a Birthright trip last winter. When he returned to campus, the Birthright coordinator connected him with Dubin who asked him to be featured on the page.
“It’s pretty informal. It was a chat, essentially,” Parker said. “It was easy, it wasn’t ‘Let’s sit down and discuss who we are.’ It was what is [being Jewish] to you and what’s it like?”
Although the page is a project started by AU Hillel, it is very much its own entity and has created a space for students to casually talk with others about their Jewish story, which can be hard to find, according to Dubin.
“We really wanted it to be something that students didn’t have to feel like they had to be part of an organization to do it - they could just be a Jewish student on campus - and no matter how they express their Judaism - whether they feel very connected or not at all,” Dubin said.
The main goal of the project is to showcase the diversity of AU’s Jewish community, according to the page, and Parker believes that diversity is inevitable in the Jewish community.
“I’d imagine that each person is going to have a different story,” Parker said. “Jews in general come from everywhere; there are so many different kinds. So no matter who you talk to it’s going to be different. Nobody is going to have the same story. You’re going to achieve diversity once you talk to more than one person.” 
Dubin says it’s just the beginning for the page because the number of people writing for the page is growing, as well as the number of people sharing it. Currently, “Jews of AU” is moving toward 500 likes and hopes to continue being relatable and diverse in order to reach a greater audience.
“I’m really excited for the page,” Dubin said. “I think it does really great things for the students that are involved with it to hone their photojournalism skills, but I think it’s really great for the school as well to bring the Jewish community together and people who aren’t Jewish to see that side as well.” 
The project can be found on Facebook at Jews of AU or facebook.com/AUJews

2016-09-13,AU,club,"One of the first things I noticed when I stepped foot on this campus were the shuttles. They are the gateway from AU to the rest of D.C., where opportunities lay abundant and ready for the picking, and that is the message that these shuttles boast. 
Plastered across these shuttles is the reminder that 90% of AU students participate in an internship and if you don’t, then why’d you even come to this school? At least that’s what I asked myself. A large part of why I came to AU was for the unparalleled access to internships and career connections that I had been told were necessary to gain even a foot in the door. 
During my first semester, I was unaware of the truth surrounding competition and what that word meant to young, ambitious, scared college students. One internship during your college career meant nothing if you didn’t already have one before college even started and had five other extracurriculars to brag about. It was never about doing what you liked, it was about doing the most that you could and, more importantly, more than the person next to you. 
I received my introduction to this stress culture when I felt shame about the amount of clubs and extracurriculars I chose to take on in my first semester at school. I committed myself to one club, one that necessarily didn’t offer any edge to my career goals but helped me to find a place on campus with people who understood my personality and my values. It was a personal choice. I knew myself and how much I could handle, but this reassurance did not quell the catastrophic thinking to which I found myself succumbing to often. While this race to the top may be the unfortunate reality of the current job market, the toxic careerism that it breeds in universities adheres to a one-size-fits-all educational system that perpetuates ableism and classism. Because while this may be the reality of the work force, many students face a very different set of circumstances. 
Many families and individuals have made sacrifices in order to receive an education at AU, drawn to it by those same messages of internships and opportunities. But unless that internship or that research opportunity is paid, why is it assumed that everyone can afford to take advantage of it? The idea that you must have an internship in order to be competitive in the job market is a tactical move in class warfare. There are very few who can afford to be at a competitive institution with recognition for internship opportunities, such as AU, without substantial financial help. However, this aid does not include living expenses, causing many students to seek out additional jobs. This often leaves students with no time or money for an unpaid internship, not only making them perhaps less qualified in the job market but also subject to the feelings of stress and shame that come with the appearance that they are behind. 
Similar to students who struggle financially, the same situation also occurs when students who struggle with different mental health concerns have to pursue their academic goals at a slower pace than the majority of the student body. Four classes and an internship may be the absolute maximum one student can handle while others seek to load their schedules much more. Contrary to popular rhetoric, neither commitment load is better or worse than the other, because there is no generic model for what an educational path is supposed to entail. We as students have bought into this idea that each decision we make will directly impact our future. We understand the large amounts of stress and pressure being placed upon us and we accept it for what it is. 
Our classrooms are not platforms to pick out our competition, so please don’t treat them as such. We become enveloped in our own stress and forget that we are not the only ones who feel alone. We are all products of a system that has waged war on our abilities as students, so in remembering that, we must take care of each other.

2016-09-13,AU,club,"Forget Spider-Man—Donald Glover is the hero Atlanta needs. After a relatively quiet few years, Glover returns to television  with the show Atlanta on FX. The show succeeds at providing a more grounded, realistic side of the African-American community, one that is more reminiscent of The Wire than a Tyler Perry show. Glover, who is known for his role in the cult show Community, as well as doubling as alt-rapper Childish Gambino, wrote the show’s first episode and stars as its protagonist, Earn, short for Earnest. 
Glover’s show portrays a grittier look at what it’s really like to be a rapper who blows up over night, something that seems all too common in the era of social media. Not only does the show illustrate the less than glamorous side of street rap, but it is one of the few shows on television to both focus on African-American characters  and portray their experiences honestly. The world of the show is fully realized and lived in, with a litany of funny and hip cultural nods. For example, the show’s comic relief character, Darius, reads a Vibe article that says “John Boyega is the new Magic Johnson,” a comparison so ridiculous that it could be pulled straight out of a hip-hop and “culture” blog’s article. 
While Donald and his brother Stephen co-wrote the believable dialogue, the first two episodes fail to stray from a traditional TV plot beat. Despite being a show that tries to convey what it’s really like living and struggling in Atlanta’s lower-income neighborhoods, the set up for these two episodes is something that could be found on Sons of Anarchy. Glover’s rapper cousin, Paper Boi, gets in an altercation and ultimately fires a gun, all in the first few minutes of the show—which may be a reality for some in Atlanta’s rap scene, but reminds the viewer that this is still television. 
Unlike another big hip-hop show, Empire, a soap-operaesque look at life as a music mogul in New York, Atlanta shows the human side of the rap game. Having family ask you for money, having to move away from your current home and taking pictures with moms are all realities that new-school rappers like Lil Uzi, Lil Yachty and Young Thug have had to deal with over the past several years. The show is coming out at a time where everyone with an iPhone is instantly aware of the next big thing in rap, but might not care to look into the musicians day-to-day realities.
The white radio DJ in the show, originally supposed to be played by Peter Rosenberg, a big time radio personality, has a moment that is entirely too believable: saying “nigga” to Glover’s character as they exchange barbs in a parking lot. We’ve all witnessed people speaking a certain way to some as opposed to others, but Glover’s subtle facial expressions and charming, dorky swagger makes it all the more funny. 
Part of me wishes that the shooting and its aftermath was replaced by another story arc, something that feels as relatable, yet uniquely Atlanta, as many of the show’s scenes. The relationships that Earn has with other characters hint at enough backstory and are convincing enough to the point that I could see any number of everyday scenarios that lead to Glover’s character becoming his cousin’s manager or being put in the doghouse by his child’s mother.
Mr. Glover’s knack for understanding the minutiae of the braggadocious nature of hip-hop culture is acute, as exemplified by Earn’s coworker at the airport when he talks about popping bottles in the club, despite making $5.15 an hour. One of the strong suits of the two episodes is that the viewer gets to see both the highs (taking a picture with the police officer who locked up infamous Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane), and lows of being an overnight sensation (having to move houses because you are now a target for a home invasion).
Donald Glover gets rap. He understands its inner workings, its trials and its tribulations. He himself evolved from an angsty mixtape-rapper into someone who was willing to take creative risks, like with his album ‘Because the Internet,” or just go flat out hard on his project ‘Royalty.’ However, the show doesn’t deal entirely with the hop-hop world. Earn’s struggles with women, his parents and having a child shows a realism that Glover was not able to showcase as the over-the-top Troy on Community. His writing prowess, the show’s immediately interesting characters and the talented cast are what will keep viewers engaged, even if the plot hits predictable (break) beats.

2016-09-13,AU,club,"From Grand Hustle Records.
Did Travis Scott return from the “Rodeo” too soon? Just a year after putting out his last full length album, “Rodeo,”  G.O.O.D. Music affiliate and Houston based rapper Travis Scott returns with his second album “Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight.” 
While the album has the glitzy, bass-heavy, trap-influenced production that we have come to expect from a Travis Scott project, the heavyweight list of producers on the album, including the legend Mike Dean, Boi-1da and Cardo, much of the album ends up feeling like darker, grimier leftovers from Scott’s last album.
The album’s title, coined by Atlanta rapper Quavo, a member of the trap-rap group Migos, references the R&B crooner Brian McKnight, a man last relevant when Travis was still in middle school. McKnight’s most obvious influence on Scott is the range of vocals that were sung on his projects, which can be seen in the heavy distortion and auto tune used to manipulate Scott’s already raspy voice. 
Like his fellow trap contemporaries Young Thug, Lil Yachty and Migos, the product quality, creative spark and lyric writing tend to take a backseat to fans’ seemingly insatiable desire for more content. Time and time again rappers fall into the cycle of releasing a project every six to 12 months, and while the singles might sell, the idea of a cohesive and interesting body of work seems to get lost in the shuffle.
With the first single from “Birds in the Trap” arriving nearly nine months in advance, limited promotion and a release date that kept getting pushed back, it’s easy to understand why this album has not gotten the attention that Scott’s last one did. For an artist who seems to be doing almost nightly shows (Scott did stadium tours with both The Weeknd and Rihanna within the past year), it’s easy to see how he and Dean might have decided to stick with the same general sound as his previous album.
Scott, known for bringing together a litany of industry and underground elite for projects, continues that trend with his latest album. The first song, “The Ends,” has an absolutely killer verse from ATLien André 3000, and later in the tracklist, rap king Kendrick Lamar drops a show stealing, earth-shattering verse. 
Although Scott is credited as a writer throughout the album, the Houston native has never been known for his lyrics. His best songs have almost exclusively been club anthems featuring ferocious energy, over-the-top lines and memorable ad-libs, more akin to Three-Six Mafia than Lauryn Hill. Sadly, the mostly mundane features and often sappy or corny lyrical outputs from Scott and his colleagues create far too many songs that can be skipped on the tracklist.
One of the main issues that the album faces comes down to the lack of memorable moments on the project. The production varies little from song to song and after a while, songs about drugs, guns and money tend to blend together. Without the intensity, creative ad-libbing and clever hooks that appear on some of Scott’s older work, the album feels like leftovers from other projects that didn’t make the cut, creatively. 
Easily the most enjoyable, fun song on the album is the second single, “Pick up the Phone.” Arguably the song of the summer, it features outlandish, clever lyrics, such as “hit 'em with three like I'm Miller, I don't talk to no man in the middle I don't talk to no man, I'm just kiddin',” aided by a great hook and an infectious island-influenced beat. Outside of this poppy club banger, there really is no equivalent, instrumentally, to some of the hits from Scott’s previous album. The murky filled haze that is this album could have benefitted from more instrumental variety and a cleaner, less repetitive sound.
The album deals with a slightly more jaded, melodramatic Scott than last time around. On “Rodeo,” Travis rapped about his rise to fame, his raging desire for success and channeling his large amount of energy into music and various illegal vices. 
Now in the upper echelon of the rap world, Travis spends more time talking about the figurative (and literal) highs and lows of being a rap superstar. That could be interesting if this was an original concept for trap/club-rap, had some more memorable moments from Travis or if there was more experimentation in the production like there was on “Rodeo”—sadly none of this is present on this album.
Scott’s albums’ wings are clipped by the sameness of the dark, heavy production that, combined with repetitive themes and delivery, makes for a mostly enjoyable experience, but not one that provides any reason to listen twice.

2016-09-13,AU,club,"Last Thursday, Student Government launched the AU TurboVote campaign in an effort to register every student to vote in time for the general election in November.  
SG is relaunching its partnership with TurboVote, a national platform specifically aimed at young people with the goal of increasing their civic engagement. 
After signing up online, the TurboVote application provides individualized information and updates for upcoming elections, voter registration and absentee ballots.
“The AU TurboVote campaign is one of the most ambitious voter registration plans ever in a college across the country,” said Valeria Ojeda-Avitia, Director of the Kennedy Political Union and coordinator of AU TurboVote.
The campaign has 25 campus partners, including the Undergraduate Business Association, the Interfraternity Council and the Intercultural Greek Collective, with the intention to expand, according to Ojeda-Avitia. TurboVote is also committed to non-partisanship, and the campaign is collaborating with both the AU College Democrats and AU College Republicans. 
“Voting is one of the most important facets of being an American citizen, and AUCRs is proud to do its part in encouraging civic duty by participating,” President of AU College Republicans Tom Herbert said.
The campaign will be tabling on campus throughout September, with heightened campaign efforts expected on National Voter Registration Day, scheduled on Sept. 27. 
Individuals can access TurboVote online, and can also become an AU TurboVote Ambassador and help spread the message. Ambassadors work to register voters and visit AU clubs and Greek life organizations to help groups register, according to TurboVote Ambassador Yazan Hanouneh.
""I became a TurboVote ambassador to ensure that every AU student has the opportunity to vote even while they're far from home,” Hanouneh said. “Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or something else, it is important to be civically engaged and participate in the system of democracy that keeps our nation running. In the end, this work is worth it since we'll have a more representative government that all students will feel like they helped elect.""

2017-03-10,AU,club,"Students protested an anticipated tuition increase ahead of the Board of Trustees meeting in March 2017. 
Education Not Debt, a student group concerned with the rise of tuition costs at AU, organized a small protest of approximately 30 people outside of the Butler Board Room on March 3 at the start of the University budget meeting. 
The Board of Trustees later voted to implement a tuition hike of 4 percent, which will be implemented in both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. 
END member Amelia Covington, a sophomore, said that tuition hikes are a main concern for the club, and that it is important for students to be aware of the budget process.
“There’s this constant fight to keep tuition high, and while I understand that this is a very tuition-based university, at the same time, the University claims to be really diverse and inclusive, but you can’t really be economically inclusive if you just keep jacking up the price more and more,” Covington said. 
Before the board passed the budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 last week, the group focused on tabling across campus and invited students to write letters to President Neil Kerwin in protest of the tuition increase. 
Covington said the group decided to write letters to Kerwin specifically because he would be one of the last people to approve the budget. The group hoped the letters would appeal to him in the final months of his presidency, Covington said. They delivered the letters on Wednesday, March 1, where they spoke in front of a staff member expressing their concerns about rising tuition.  
Kerwin has not responded to these student letters as of March 8, which Covington estimated to be around 60 total at the end of their tabling.
END member Aijah Raghnal, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, decided to get involved in the club after her friend from her hometown was forced to switch schools because of the rising costs of AU and her inability to receive more financial aid. 
“Students shouldn't have their education or experienced marred by whether or not they'll spend the next ten years in debt,” Raghnal said. She expressed concerns that the University is acting more like a “business” and said she wants to help fight back against education as a “debt sentence.” 
Covington said they organized the letter writing campaign because the University didn’t organize a community town hall to specifically discuss the tuition hike specifically. She said that overall financial transparency about the budget and the Board of Trustees is necessary for more students to be able to understand why tuition gets raised every two years. 
Prior to the passing of the budget, student government leaders hosted a community town hall with members of the budget committee in February.
Covington also noted that a survey conducted by the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2011 found that Kerwin was the highest paid university president in the Washington area, earning $1.3 million in salary, benefits, paid compensation and other pay that year.

2017-03-10,AU,club,"Patagonia arrived on AU’s campus March 1, armed with sewing machines and one mission: “If it’s broke, fix it!”
The outdoor clothing company visited AU to help students fix worn clothing as part of their Worn Wear College Tour.Patagoniais stoppingat universitiesandcolleges acrossthecountryto promote sustainable clothinguseof all brands.
The center of operations for the tour lies inside a redesigned 1993 Dodge Cummins D250. A wood plaque on the side of the truck reveals all the details of it. It has an added wooden shell made from salvaged redwood wine barrels. The plaque also says that the truck, which even has a fold-down bed, is officially known as “The Worn Wear Rig” but has been dubbed “Delia”. 
For the tour, Patagonia is working in conjunction with Post-Landfill Action Network, (PLAN) a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting zero waste practices on college campuses.
“[PLAN] was responsible for coordinating the details of the tour from creating permits for schools to booking the spaces and setting up logistics,” director and founder Alex Freid said.
PLAN partnered with AU to create the student clubs Zero Waste AU and AU Student Zero Waste Club,whichareboth responsible for the separate recycling, compost and landfill bins seen throughout campus. PLAN has helped form similar clubs at over 100 campuses, according to its website. 
Freid was on campus for the event assisting students and helping the staff fix clothes, and spoke positively about AU’s zero waste initiatives. 
“American is one of our exemplary campuses having really amazing models and well developed programs. Being chosen for the Worn Wear tour is an honor for your leadership in zero waste.” 
He emphasized the importance of teaching students how to fix and reuse clothes as an alternative to buying new clothes. In addition to fixing clothes, the tour also featured lightly used clothes for sale. Separate from those clothes for sale outside, there was a pop-up thrift sale of lightly used clothes going on in the Mary Graydon Center in conjunction with the tour run by the AU Student Zero Waste Club.
The event drew lots of curious AU students to check out what was going on, including juniors Dillan Archevesky and Greg Lomat. 
“While I’m not here explicitly to support Patagonia, events like this definitely impact things I would choose to buy in the future,” Archevesky said. “It also changes my minds on certain brands and consumerism.” Lomat also said that he tries to choose more sustainable brands when possible.
In addition to the clothing repairs, organizers screened the documentary “Before the Flood.” The film, produced by Leonardo Dicaprio in collaboration with others, features Dicaprio traveling across the world learning about the consequences of climate change and the issue of climate change denial. 
The next stop on Patagonia’s tour is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on March 10. It will make many more stops before completing the tour at UC Santa Barbara on April 26.

2017-04-12,AU,club,"The first No Lost Generation gala held to raise money and awareness for refugees. The club is hosting their second annual gala this Saturday.
No Lost Generation held its inaugural gala to raise money and awareness for refugees on April 1 in the School of International Service, which included former Ambassador to Zambia Mark C. Storella as a distinguished guest. Storella is the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.
No Lost Generation is a collaborative network of college organizations that seeks to support refugees. This student initiative has expanded to include chapters at 50 colleges and universities since its founding in 2015 at George Washington University. 
AU formed a chapter this year filled with students who have advanced No Lost Generation’s mission on campus. This includes a a rally in support of immigration rights that the group held in February. 
Shayna Vayser and Andrew Rogan are the student co-executive directors of the AU chapter of No Lost Generation. 
“There are a few things we are trying to do to engage more with the refugee community as a result of this gala,” Vayser said. “We want to promote engagement at every level, and we also want to raise money for the cause, which we are donating to the United Nations program Adopt-A-Future.” 
Adopt-A-Future works to educate a new generation of refugee children and was the recipient of all proceeds from gala ticket sales.
Rogan said the Adopt-A-Future campaign is unique because all of the money raised goes directly to two refugee camps in Kenya, in the towns of Kakuma and Dadaab. 
“The reason this gala is so important is because it promotes these provisions of actual guidance and materials which can permanently impact and improve refugee lives,” Rogan said. 
Rogan also detailed additional plans that the club has for the future.  
“A number of future initiatives are going to begin in promotion of more fundraising and more engagement with the community to advocate for refugees,” Rogan said. “In the upcoming fall semester specifically, students will have an opportunity to join a panel committee and a funding committee that will work with the No Lost Generation.”
The gala was packed with over one hundred people buzzing around networking with each other and appreciating the music, food and art. One of the most exciting parts of the event was when Associate Dean for Curriculum and Learning in the School of International Service Rose Shinko introduced Ambassador Mark Storella as the night’s keynote speaker. 
Shinko is currently the deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. He has a longstanding commitment to humanitarian affairs and human rights.
“All the folks who have been organizing this, I want to tell you that I am thoroughly excited to join you tonight,” Storella said at the beginning of his speech. “You are brought together because you care about humanitarian affairs and you are very right to.”
Storella continued by telling the story of his first engagement in refugee affairs which began during his education when he saw a sign looking for people to help Vietnamese refugees. He was inspired to commit to this cause after seeing how much help he could provide to a family which he assisted in finding jobs, getting driver's licenses and becoming accustomed to American life. 
“The refugee issue is going to be a defining challenge of your lives,” he told the crowd. “It has affected politics on a world stage and is going to get even more important.” 
Speaking on the causes of the refugee crisis, he said “Conflict is now the biggest drive of refugee migration, but with increasing environmental challenges, the crisis will be heightened because as resources become more scarce, conflict becomes even more common.”
The quality of the lives of refugees are of great concern to Storella, he noted solemnly.
“Refugees are subjected to being captured, they are subjected to being enslaved, and they are subject to being murdered,” he said.  
However, Storella still had an optimistic outlook on the future, ending his address by encouraging students to get involved in refugee rights.
“What we have to do is to get all the countries in the world to dedicate themselves to helping refugees and the permanently displaced,” he said. “What I hope you recognize, is the you are a part of a movement.”

2017-05-09,AU,club,"While AU’s sports teams may receive a good deal of praise from the University, the department that oversees them, Athletics and Sports and Fitness, has for years lacked a specific plan for how it will push its multi-million dollar program to the next level. 
Led by Athletic Director Billy Walker, the department released its first strategic plan last summer to outline its goals for advancing the program in the next five years. The plan focuses on areas to enhance the distinct experience of AU student-athletes, by pledging to improve tools for academic success and on-field performance. 
Now one year into the plan, the arrival of a new University president and stagnation in recent funding could impact the feasibility of completing those plans, in particular improving campus facilities, generating new forms of revenue and finding more money for underfunded athletic programs, such as the swim and dive team. 
“[Academics and athletics] are not mutually exclusive, we know that those are complementary and our coaches buy into that, our staff buy into that and hopefully our athletes buy into that as well,” Walker said. “That’s all a part of what we’re saying in the strategic plan, our vision and our mission and our core philosophy. We want to make sure American is branded as American and that we’re unique and valuable.”
Smaller budget, new president could limit growth
The Athletics and Sports and Fitness department’s total budget this year was $14.1 million, yet that still only made up 2.2 percent of the University’s total budget. And that number pales in comparison to other schools in the Patriot League. Boston University’s athletic department had the highest budget in the league last year at $31 million, and Lafayette University, which has the second lowest budget ahead of AU, still had a $17 million budget last year. 
This smaller budget limits the scope of the department’s strategic plans for improving campus athletic facilities and funding for student athletic programs.
No member of the AU athletic department is directly involved in the budget meetings, but instead make their requests known to the budget committee, Associate Athletic Director and Business Operations Director Josephine Harrington said.
The department’s allocation of the University budget is divided into two accounts: operating and institutional. Operating accounts, $8.8 million of the athletic department’s budget, are spent on day-to-day costs, including office supplies, team travel, team equipment and department employee salaries. 
The other portion of the budget, institutional accounts, totals $5.26 million and is spent on student-athlete scholarships. This school year that fund was distributed amongst AU’s 234 varsity athletes. While scholarship allocations are confidential, it is known for example that none of the 30 student-athletes on AU’s swimming and diving team receive athletic scholarships.
In addition to budget limitations, long term projects like the planned facility renovations and additions may have their timelines adjusted by the arrival of new university president Sylvia Burwell. Walker said the department will have talks with Burwell to see how the athletic department’s facility plans fit with her larger university vision. 
“She seems very down-to-earth, relatable, and very excited to support athletics,” Walker said of Burwell. “I’m anxious to start working with her and start moving forward, still, towards greater goals.”
Walker pushes for facilities improvements
Campus athletic facilities is an area in which AU lags behind the rest of its Patriot League counterparts. This is in part due to AU’s location in Washington, D.C. The availability of inexpensive land is more abundant in rural areas like Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where Bucknell University is located, which allows for more facility opportunities, Walker said. 
The department’s strategic plan introduces the goal of providing “state of the art facilities,” starting with replacing the turf on Jacobs Field, which has exceeded its usable 10 year life cycle.
“We know where we’re at and we’re realistic on what we can and can’t do,” Walker said of the university’s athletic facilities. “That’s why the things that we’re trying to upgrade are things we can do and that can make a huge difference.”
Additionally, the department plans to add field turf to the University-owned field on the 4500 block of Massachusetts Avenue, though there is no timeline in place for completion of the renovation. Currently, the field is used as a practice facility for the men’s and women’s soccer team and minimal club sport use. 
The department’s biggest undertaking is a plan to build an extension onto the back of Bender Arena to relocate the intercollegiate weight room and wrestling room from its current home in the Jacobs Fitness Center. The facility expansion plan would open up new space in the fitness center for the general student body, though Walker admits it may not be feasible to finish the project in the remaining four years of the plan.
“[The addition of Bender Arena] will free up those two spaces [in Jacobs], which really more than triples the area right there,” Walker said. “And that’s going to benefit the student body.”
Revenue generation 
To help finance all these endeavors, the plan also includes goals to expand revenue generating opportunities by identifying new donors and sponsors for the athletic department. Associate Athletic Director and Director of External Relations David Bierwirth said the University’s revenue generation can be divided into four sectors: sponsorship, ticketing, facility rentals and donations. 
Money from AU Athletics’ donor group, Eagles Club, makes up the majority of revenue taken in by the department, Bierwirth said. Members of Eagles Club are annual donors to the athletic department, and benefit levels for members are determined based on total annual donations. The donation levels range from $25 per year to over $2,500. 
Membership in Eagles Club has increased by 40 percent in the four years since Walker began serving as athletic director in 2013. Other factors outside the control of the department, like strong on-field performance by teams, have also helped the donation numbers and Eagles Club membership increase, Bierwirth said.
“Success helps,” Bierwirth said. “If you look at it across the board, of our teams, we’ve had incredible success, particularly volleyball and field hockey and wrestling’s been always very successful and you see the giving for that particular team growing and growing as well.”
While donations have increased over the past two years, ticket sales have fluctuated. Men’s basketball has particularly suffered; game attendance has decreased by approximately 1,000 people in the past four years. 
In 2013-2014, when the men’s basketball team won the Patriot League and reached the NCAA Tournament, average attendance at home games was 1,681 people. This season, the average attendance was 604. Meanwhile average attendance at women’s basketball games over the same four year period increased from 350 to 399. 
The department is aiming to combat the low attendance by increasing its social media presence and by partnering with student groups such as the Blue Crew and Greek Life organizations, Bierwirth said. 
“We’re not asking for 7,000 undergraduates to be here,” Walker said. “But if we have 1,000 of them [undergraduates], it would be unbelievable in there [Bender].”
Department looks to increase scholarship funding
Under the Athletic Achievement section of the strategic plan, the department stated the initiative to “continue to increase athletic scholarships to more fully fund our intercollegiate programs.” 
Full funding means that an athletic program receives the maximum number of scholarships permitted for that sport by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Basketball and volleyball programs at Division I universities receive “headcount” scholarships, in which all scholarship recipients receive full academic scholarships. 
For example, on AU’s men’s basketball team, all 15 members of the 2016-2017 roster, except freshman walk-on Justin Perez, have full scholarships. Other teams at AU receive less than the maximum number of scholarships permitted for their sport, and the money behind these scholarships is divided up across their rosters. 
At AU, the field hockey program receives the monetary equivalent of 12 full scholarships to allocate across its 21 member roster. Meanwhile \the swimming and diving program receives no scholarship money.
The athletic department would like to grow the number of scholarships for underfunded teams, either through budget requests in the University’s bi-annual budget or through privately endowed scholarships. Privately endowing an additional scholarship for a program requires around $1 million, Walker said.
“We have our ideas of where we would like to be able to continue to grow with funding,” Walker said. “Either getting [funding] through an institutional funding or working with development to raise the money for it. Realistically, more of those scholarships are going to come from the institution, but we’re going to keep attacking it from both ways.”
Opportunities for student-athlete development 
In the Athletic Achievement section of the strategic plan, the department pledges to “maximize available resources to support our teams’ opportunities to achieve their full potential.” The focus on student health and experience was part of an NCAA-wide initiative to enhance the student-athlete experience, Walker said. 
To address student welfare, the athletic department sought to increase funding to enhance the club and intramural sport experience and to offer more resources for varsity student-athletes. The department was able to follow through on its goal to receive more funding for club and intramural sports in 2018 and 2019 and were successful in hiring an additional athletic trainer.
Additionally, the athletic department introduced the service of mental performance coach Brian Levenson. Levenson currently has office hours when students can meet with him, but Walker said the department plans to expand this to include more team-based work as well. 
The department introduced a nutrition program at the beginning of 2016, the Eagle Energy program, to emphasize nutrition for student-athletes. The program provided refueling shakes for student-athletes after every weight room session.
“We’re also going to be expanding so it’s not just the Eagle Energy program, but we’re going to have more refueling stations so that [student-athletes] will be able to get fruit and other types of foods.”
To increase the effectiveness and help establish the nutrition initiative, the athletic department will seek the aid of a licensed nutritionist beginning next fall.
The department will evaluate progress made towards the goals in the strategic plan at the end of each academic term, Walker said. The plan will be evaluated based on developments in each area of the plan and the department will determine which areas need more focus in the following academic term.
“One of the steps when you’re doing the strategic plan is planning the last step, which is assessment,” Walker said. “Each of the point of contacts for each of the areas [in the strategic plan] will take their area and start doing an assessment and bring it back to me and we’ll see how we’re doing and adjust from there.”

2017-06-10,AU,club,"Royal Blood plays at the 9:30 Club on June 6. 
With the band’s second album, “How Did We Get So Dark?,” slated to come out on June 16, Royal Blood did a quick run of concerts leading up to the release, stopping at the legendary 9:30 Club on June 6. Playing a tight, 12 song setlist, the band brought a refreshing swagger and energy that captivated the crowd from the start. 
A dazzling light show and the LA-based rock band, The Shelters, helped warm up the audience. Once singer and bass guitarist Mike Kerr and drummer Ben Thatcher took the stage, however, they had everyone in the palm of their hands. It was imminently clear from the first notes of their new single “Where Are You Now?” that the band deserves all the attention that they get as next up in English rock. 
Royal Blood’s appeal is a double edged sword. They make groove heavy, riff oriented, blues influenced rock with catchy lyrics and blasting drum beats. However, despite some soaring highs (“Figure It Out,” “Out of the Black” and “Little Monster”)  on their self-titled first album, much of the music they put out has a very similar pattern and sound. It sounds great, but it all essentially kind of sounds the same.
Ultimately, on Tuesday night, that formula worked. The band had enough crowd interaction and soloing to drag out their set to the point where it didn’t all feel the same. By only playing 12 great songs, the band was able to avoid any sense of boredom that may have arose given a longer set.
Royal Blood may not be reinventing rock, but they sure are making it fun. The band thrives on stage. However, if they want to have serious longevity, they ought to look in some new, more adventurous sonic directions.

2017-07-10,AU,club,"With field hockey season rapidly approaching, the Eagles are sticking to their time-tested summer workouts with the goal of improved performance come fall. 
For the past two summers, head coach Steve Jennings and his staff have given each athlete two individual training packets, one for running and one for lifting. However, players say this year’s workouts are increased in intensity and length.
“Summer is all about getting stronger and faster,” junior defender Rachel Stefano said. 
The lifting packet is arranged differently for each individual athlete based on the weights she was recorded lifting in the spring. The 2017 packets require five workouts per week, a more demanding workload than previous offseasons, senior midfielder Samantha McCormick said. 
“The running packet is almost the same for all of us, the difference being the rest time between runs,” Stefano said.  “Incoming freshmen have a slightly tweaked packet to help them acclimate to the runs we do instead of throwing them right into it.”
In total, the athletes should be lifting, playing a pickup game twice a week, and participating in a team practice once a week. 
They’re strongly encouraged to play in summer leagues during the warm weather months to prepare their bodies for the season. Many team members go home for the summer and participate in summer leagues that practice near their homes. High Performance, a field hockey summer program geared toward college athletes, has locations all around the U.S. Eagles who utilize High Performance camps pick the site closest to their homes to train. International students join summer club teams in their home countries.
“The rigorous training schedule [both in-season and pre-season] that we have been using the past few years has worked well,” Jennings said. When they stick to the packets given to them for the summer, they are sure to see success when they come back for the season in the fall.” 
The packets given to the team by Jennings, though, are written to be used outside of set practice times with summer league teams. Stefano chooses to come to her summer league’s practices early to complete her runs, while her training days are utilized for lifting. 
“The first two weeks of the summer were the most intense for me because I haven’t been training every single day [since the regular season],” Stefano said. “I’m sure the rest of the girls could say the same.”
Jennings’s training template has been in place for the past two seasons. The hope is for each athlete to follow her packet exactly over the summer to get in the best pre-season shape possible.
“The coaches put as much as possible in the players’ hands to lead them where they want to go,” Jennings said.  
The offseason training has paid dividends for the Eagles. AU has reached the Patriot League Tournament final each of the past two seasons. In 2016, the Eagles claimed their tenth conference title under Jennings. AU finished the year ranked 19th with high expectations for 2017. 
The Eagles open their 2017 season on the road against the University of Richmond on August 25.

2017-07-13,AU,club,"LANY at the 9:30 Club in October 2016.
The first words you hear on LANY’s debut album come after a swell of soft rain and glittering synths. Singer Paul Klein quickly confesses, “Oh my god, I think I’m in love.”
And when you listen to LANY, and their self-titled release, you can’t help but feel the same way.
Three years and four EPs later, the Los Angeles band released “LANY” on June 30, a long awaited album for fans. Their chill, alternative sounds and ability to evoke a simple sense of teenage wonder have caught the attention of many, making them a hot opening act for the likes of Troye Sivan and Ellie Goulding. 
They went on two headlining tours without an album in sight. That is, until March 3, when the rose logo that had been seen so many times on tour accompanied an Instagram caption confirming a June release.
The singles leading up to the release (“Good Girls,” “It Was Love,” “The Breakup,” “13” and “Super Far”) confirmed that the band’s simple west coast vibes and sound were not only going to stay intact, but were also merely small glimpses into a bigger story played out on “LANY.” Each song on the album is its own story of love with all the confusion, beauty, work, sadness and rawness that come with being in a relationship ─ or trying to keep one together.
One of LANY’s greatest strengths is their ability to say the unsaid in their lyrics. What do you say to someone who is your everything, who won’t commit or who keeps running away? How do you process what your friends say about your love or what your mind starts thinking of at 2 a.m.? Most of these thoughts never surface in real life, but LANY has clearly pulled them out of their minds for our viewing. The album exemplifies a process of piecing together those hard to say lines and synthesizing them into songs that pack a heavy punch for the listeners.
Mixed with their brutal honesty is a sense of poetic beauty and diverse content that can’t help but put you in the song. “Overtime” puts you on defense as Klein speaks directly to his betraying lover, saying, “Tell me how you put those tears in your eyes, grand central downstairs, skippin’ work that night.” You get to slip into the shoes of a reflective rockstar on “Tampa” with the airy, late night thoughts of “I can do better than this.” A sweet voicemail from drummer Jake Goss’s mother puts you on the receiving end of the a parent’s chatter, a role that many kids know so well.
Despite the beauty and happiness that LANY thrives on, a lot of blame and reality exists on this album. Klein speaks directly to someone with his frequent use of “you,” a tactic clearly used to communicate his purest, raw thoughts. “I love you” seem to be quickly followed by the “how did we get here?” as seen in songs like “Flowers on the Floor” and “Hericane.” In fact, the songs flip so frequently between the two that you begin to question whether all the electronic synths and Tumblr-esque lyrics are simply rose-colored glasses for its listeners. Are all of these sensations of love and lust just romanticized figments of a glittering alternative album? Are we truly in love with this release or just the way it makes us feel?
But, as Klein sings on the last song: it was love. And we know that.

2017-11-13,AU,club,"When sophomore Nuha Vora first arrived at AU, she didn’t know many other Muslim students.

	She connected with a group of girls in the spring of her freshman year at a Muslim Student Association meeting. Now, they attend Friday prayers, study and spend time together, she said.

	“It’s people I didn’t have to explain my whole identity to, because a lot of the friends that I met here, they’ve said to me ‘you’re the first Muslim friend that I’ve had,’” Vora, who is now the club’s communications director, said.

	MSA’s goal is to give every Muslim -- regardless of which denomination of Islam they follow -- a home on campus, said Ammarah Rehman, co-president of the club.

	Three percent of the class of 2021 -- 34 students -- identified as Muslim in a campus-wide survey, making it the sixth most popular religion for this year’s freshman class. However, MSA  and the broader Muslim community at the University lack funding and prayer spaces. Campus restaurants also don’t serve Halal food. Combined, this makes it difficult to build a connected Muslim community at AU, Rehman said.


	Muslim Student Association lacks funding

	The Muslim community at AU does not have a national parent organization or full-time campus workers. The only religious groups with paid staff are Hillel (Jews), Chi Alpha (Christians), Catholics and Methodists, said Reverend Mark Schaefer, the University’s chaplain and leader of the Kay Spiritual Life Center.

	This is because each group is funded by parent religious organizations, not the University. Shaefer and Jennifer Baron Knowles, Kay’s assistant director who is currently on maternity leave, are the only two Kay employees paid by the University, Schaefer said.

	“The Muslim community is in kind of a special position because they’re a larger community, but without the same kind of resources that the other communities provide,” Schaefer said.

	They have no paid imam who leads their prayers, Rehman said. Two imams -- Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad and Ghiyath Nakshbendi -- lead Muslim prayers for students on a voluntary basis.

	MSA, a group outside of Kay, is technically a club, said Michael Elmore, senior director of University Center and Student Activities. However, since it is also a religious group, Schaefer advises MSA as needed. Kay will also fund some of MSA’s events, including iftar dinners during Ramadan, Schaefer said. Without a parent organization, MSA is sometimes left to advocate and raise money for itself.

	“I don’t think this is happening because we’re Muslim, but we do feel discriminated against,” Rehman said. “We know it’s not personal, but due to the lack of resources we have, we just feel as if there’s not a lot we can do.”

	Like other campus clubs that do not fall under Student Media or Student Government, the Muslim Student Association receives its funding from AU Club Council (AUCC). AUCC received about $234,000 for this academic year, said Cheyenne Oberther, coordinator of student involvement in University Center and Student Activities.

	As of Nov. 8, about 140 clubs can receive funding from that pool. MSA’s biggest expense of the year is their Eid Banquet, which costs about $2,000, Rehman said.


	MSA’s annual Eid Banquet moved last minute

	Each year, MSA organizes an Eid Banquet to mark the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. It’s one of the two major religious holidays celebrated by Muslims, Rehman said.

	Since the club couldn’t organize the event earlier in the fall semester, this year’s banquet took place on Sept. 30. Rehman booked McDowell Formal for the banquet in August 2017 and nearly 150 people attended from AU and other local universities.

	However, Hillel, the campus Jewish organization, also booked McDowell Formal to break the fast after Yom Kippur, Judaism’s holiest day of the year. They booked it during the University’s advance scheduling period, where campus groups that book large, annual events can reserve a room before the University opens reservations to the rest of the campus, Elmore said. The room has a Kosher kitchen, a requirement for Jewish dietary laws.

	The day before, Student Activities recognized the accidental double booking. Elmore learned about it during the “Enough is Enough” rally on Sept. 29, he said. Hillel couldn’t move their items after sundown because of religious restrictions and therefore needed McDowell Formal, Schaefer said.

	“Space is at such a premium around here,” Elmore said. “It isn’t a question of who is more important than anyone else, it’s a question of how did the process work.”

	Ultimately, Student Activities moved the Eid Banquet to East Campus. No one group was at fault, Rehman said. However, she said it highlighted a lack of resources and the need for an advocate for Muslim students at AU.

	Student Activities covered the cost of the East Campus room -- which requires payment for a reservation -- and reimbursed MSA for the price of the food, Elmore said.

	“We have no presence on campus and then when we mess up, it makes us look sloppy,” Rehman said. “No one knows what happened. To them [attendees], it’s ‘you’re moving this event again.’ It just makes us look sloppy.”


	Lack of Halal food forces some Muslims to avoid campus meat

	Halal food is cuisine that adheres to Islamic law, as defined in the Quran. For meat to be considered Halal, the animal must be conscious at the time of slaughter, according to an article published in “Meat Science.”

	MSA recently launched a petition calling for Halal food options on campus, which students shared on Facebook with the hashtag “#AUEatsHalal.” Rehman said she’s working with Fanta Aw, vice president of campus life, to improve availability of Halal food.

	As a freshman, Rehman said she went to Subway and just ate vegetarian sandwiches -- or tuna -- to avoid eating non-Halal meat. Most of her friends buy Halal meat separately or just give up on it and eat whatever is available, Rehman said.

	“Halal-only doesn’t exclude anyone else from eating it either,” Ahmad said. “When it’s not Halal, we are being excluded from eating it.”
Junior Awais Ahmad, a transfer student from Bellevue College, described standing in the omelette line in the Terrace Dining Room, where a cook might use vegetables, bacon and cheese to make the dish. Eating pork is strictly forbidden by Islamic law. Ahmad accidentally ate pork last semester, which was “extremely difficult,” he said.


	Absence of a designated social, prayer space for Muslim students weakens sense of community

	There are rarely religious conflicts in Kay, Schaefer said, but the small size of the building means there are often disagreements over space.

	“We were built in 1965, when religious diversity meant Protestant, Catholic and Jew,” Schaefer said. “That was as diverse as it got in 1965.”

	Most offices inside Kay have two occupants as opposed to one, Schaefer said. There is a Muslim prayer room, where students can pray for any of the five required prayers per day. The prayer room is closet-sized and can only fit about 10 people at a time. MSA holds Jum’ah -- Friday prayer -- there weekly.

	The lack of space makes it difficult to build a sense of community, Rehman said. Schaefer said he hopes to repurpose spaces in Kay to make more room for Muslims to pray and gather.
Ahmad either prays inside the prayer room or in his bedroom on his prayer mat, he said. Lately, he’s been able to get home in time to pray, so he hasn’t used the room in Kay often this semester.

	“I just wish it was larger so we could go and pray at one time together,” Ahmad said.

	Ahmad is an Ahmadi Muslim, a minority denomination at AU. He attended an Ahmadi mosque in Bellevue, Washington, before transferring to AU. The prayer services here cater to Sunni Muslims, making it difficult for him to participate in religious observations through MSA, he said.

	However, Ahmad said he appreciates the community that MSA provides.

	“We all have something in common,” Ahmad said. “We pray the same way, we believe in essentially the same things, so it isn’t difficult to make connections there.”

2018-09-04,AU,club,"Representatives from CDI talk to students at the Involvement Fair on the Quad in 2016. 
Ahead of AU’s annual student involvement fair, set for Sept. 5 from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on the quad, The Eagle spoke with several student organizations about how new and returning students can get involved with their groups. 
From identity-based clubs like AU PRIDE to social groups like the AU Ballroom Dance Club, students should be able to find an organization that speaks to them. For a full list of AU-recognized student groups, click here. 
AU Ballroom Dance Club isn’t just for professionals -- it’s for anyone looking to learn a new skill or meet someone new, said Grace Guber, the club’s public relations director. 
“We encourage people of every skill level to come out and try ballroom dancing,” Guber said. “Sometimes people feel nervous and think that if they’ve never done ballroom dance before that they can’t come to our club, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth.”
This past year, the club hosted their first dance social, which invited ballroom clubs from other universities as well as AU students to partake in a salsa class on campus. The club also expanded their curriculum to include advanced classes, Guber said. 
The organization plans to host more free dance socials and introduce more styles of dance this fall. These classes are the best way to get involved and learn more about the club, Guber said.
“When people hear about the ‘Ballroom Club’ they might think that they have to dress a certain way, or they have to perform on stage, or that they have to pay to be a part of it,” Guber said. “You can walk in wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt with no dance experience and just try it.”
Last year, AU PRIDE, previously known as AU Queers and Allies, took on a new name in hopes of being more representative of the LGBTQIA+ community and promoting unity amongst the queer and trans community, The Eagle previously reported. 
Political advocacy and community events that the organization hosted last year include National Coming Out day, a student drag show, a queer Halloween party and queer Thanksgiving, Sarah Everett, the president of the organization, said. 
The group’s final event of the spring semester was PRIDE Prom, a collaborative celebration which included college students from around Washington. In the coming year, AU PRIDE seeks to expand the work they’ve done and deepen their roots at AU. 
“We've got an ambitious programming and advocacy calendar,” Everett said. “We'll be building on our traditional semester events, PRIDE Prom and Queer Halloween, offering regular programming throughout the semester both for the larger group and for affinity spaces led by our community coordinators.” 
Students can get involved with AU PRIDE by liking the group’s Facebook page or joining the executive advisory board. 
Though Sister Sister AU was only founded two years ago, the organization has quickly made its presence known on campus, with its Facebook group containing almost 100 members. 
The mission of this organization is to “develop a community amongst women who identify as being a part of the African diáspora through professional,educational, and social events,” Aaliyah Lambert, recent AU graduate and co-founder of Sister Sister, said.
Lambert said the club was created for women of color to find a place on campus.
“It was started because during my first two years at AU, there wasn’t a place for women of color on campus to just exist and be themselves,” Lambert said. “Also, we just needed a place to meet one another, figure out what hair salons to go to or places to party.”
The organization has previously participated in healing circles for women of color at AU and held its inaugural “Strengthening the Bonds of Sisterhood Summit” in fall 2016.
AU Student Zero Waste Club is dedicated to promoting zero waste initiatives across campus and encourage students to do what they can to help AU reach its zero waste goal, co-director Grace Pugh said.
According to Pugh, club members fulfill this goal by coordinating campus-wide events and programs, such as Opt-In Grab A Bin, which provides free compost bins that students can keep in their dorm rooms to make recycling easier.
One of their first programs of the year, which the club hoped to expand this year, is Project Move In/Out. The organization collected gently used items that others donated and had a giant yard sale during Welcome Week as a fundraiser. 
“Those funds are used to send our club members to zero waste conferences, fund zero waste workshops such as green cleaning workshops, and fund trips to promote our love for the environment,” Pugh said.
 Zero Waste will host its first meeting, or “Trash Talk,” of the semester on Sept. 10. Students can learn more about the organization through Twitter or emailing them at austudentzerowasteclub@gmail.com.

2018-09-06,AU,club,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
In our new series, “Who is AU?” The Seagle will profile a new student every two weeks, in an attempt to highlight the hopes, dreams and aspirations of our diverse student body that hails from all corners of the New York tri-state area. We want to know more about the real you, and also the administration needs more propaganda to entice naive and innocent high school students. 
Freshman Rebecca Hernandez is super mean for absolutely no reason, but she wrote her admissions essay about kindness. Now, she hopes to be an inspiration to other prospective students who are actually complete jerks but want to fool admissions.
“I told my high school guidance counselor her baby was ugly, so she got mad and wouldn’t help me with my college applications,” Hernandez said. “I was totally on my own, and I was honestly in a really dark place.”
So she “gambled” that her service trip would suffice for acceptance into American.
“But then I was like, those losers in admissions would eat up a bunch of crap about how my mission trip to take selfies with orphans in Sierra Leone changed my worldview on capitalism,” Hernandez added.
She was right. Admissions did eat it right up, and she was not only accepted but offered a place in the honors program and a half-tuition scholarship. Hernandez reports that she “totally knew those half-wits” would love her essay. Following her acceptance, she posted the exact amount of scholarship money she received on Facebook so her friend who got rejected from every school except North Dakota State could see. 
Admissions counselor Deborah Heard says that she loved the complete and utter selflessness and philanthropy that Hernandez displayed in her admissions essay.
“I was really blown away,” said Heard. “It’s rare that we come across an essay in which the student speaks so genuinely and from the heart. When she launched into a lengthy description of how the malnourished orphans were fascinated by the glitter in her iPhone 10 case, there wasn’t a dry eye in the room.”
“I dropped my phone in a well and made one of the kids get it for me,” Hernandez said. “The glitter case was the only way they could spot it through the piles of toxic sewage.”
Hernandez’s former friends say that, at first, they thought she was a decent person. 
“She seemed kind of shy and quiet at first, so I started talking to her,” said freshman Gabby Shelley. “But then she told a homesick girl that her parents were better off without her, and I realized what a stone-cold person she really was.”
Hernandez’s classmates and professors also report being completely blindsided by her calculated insults and taunts. At first, she appeared to be a diligent, if not reserved and quiet student. All that changed the third day of class when she told her writing professor to “@#$% off” when he called on her. 
“I was kind of in shock,” English and literature professor Gary Kane admitted. “She seemed so nice. She really had all of us fooled on that one.”
Hernandez continues to inspire those around her through her creative use of curse words at inappropriate times, taking money from homeless people and her general cold and dismissive attitude. 
“You always hear that you have to get amazing grades, do community service and be the president of a dozen clubs if you want to get into a halfway decent college,” Hernandez said. “My mission is to show people that you can be yourself, trip blind people and still get a great education. Never let anyone tell you that being conceited, cruel, and selfish  is going to hold you back. I’m living proof of that.”

2018-09-06,AU,club,"Jorge Goyco Diaz and Juliana Delgado, the vice president and president of Underrepresented Students in STEM (USS), at the Student Involvement Fair in September. 
Juliana Delgado, a senior biology major, thinks AU does a great job of providing opportunities for STEM students. The problem, she said, is that students don’t know about them. 
That’s one of the issues Delgado hopes to solve with Underrepresented Students in STEM (USS), a new club on campus that aims to support students in educational environments and the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workforce through mentorship and guidance to its members. 
Additionally, the club will focus on providing financial support to underrepresented students who wish to continue a STEM education. Delgado co-founded USS with her academic mentor and professor Meg Bentley.
“A lot of times underrepresented students already feel limited in the STEM field, so we want to provide them with that extra push,” Delgado said.
Delgado and Bentley said it was important to understand that underrepresentation in STEM includes people of color, women, veterans and disabled people.
Within the University, Delgado and Bentley noted, any student in STEM is underrepresented academically on campus due to the high concentration of students in the School of International Service and School of Public Affairs. SIS boasted 1,867 undergraduate students in 2017-2018, while SPA had 1,521 students pursuing bachelor’s degrees, according to AU’s 2017-2018 academic data reference book. About 713 students in the College of Arts and Sciences were pursuing a degree in the STEM field in the same year.  
Bentley said AU has put a large focus on expanding representation of diverse faculty members, which is beneficial to the mission of USS as it helps empower underrepresented students. 
Faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Office are asking for a STEM audit, Bentley added. This audit would determine how many members of the STEM faculty at AU are part of underrepresented groups, Bentley said.
“We have underrepresented STEM faculty, but we can always do better,” Bentley said.
Delgado said that 99 percent of USS members are currently underrepresented in some way in the STEM field. This is in part because USS uses a broad range of factors to define the term underrepresented, including but not limited to: age, disability, sexual orientation, culture, geography, experience and thinking style.  
USS hopes to start a scholarship fund through donations in order to financially support its members. The DC NASA Space Grant Consortium, which is based here at AU, is just one organization that USS hopes they can work with to create a scholarship fund, Delgado said.
Although underrepresentation is the focus of the club, it is not a requirement to join, Delgado said.
“If we can get any student, represented or underrepresented, supporting other STEM students, I think we’ve done a job well done,” Delgado said.

2018-10-12,AU,club,"Krish Mohan discusses political and social issues within the framework of stand-up comedy to let down the audience's defenses and start conversations on controversial topics.
Krish Mohan is a self-described social vigilante.
“To me, any activist is a social vigilante,” Mohan said. “Any protester is a social vigilante.”
Mohan’s method of social vigilantism? Stand-up comedy.
“I’m breaking these very traditional social protocols because comedy is only supposed to be about the superficial stuff, the very Jerry Seinfeld-type things,” Mohan said.
In his upcoming show “Empathy on Sale,” Mohan uses comedy to tackle traditionally divisive topics such as identity politics, mental illness and the misunderstanding of progressivism. Mohan said that his goal isn’t to sermonize. Instead, he strives to kickstart a conversation among the audience.
“When you get somebody to laugh at something, you’re easing their mind,” Mohan said. “You’re adding some levity to something that’s very difficult for them to address and now you have this open forum to talk about it.”
In some cities, Mohan has found that his audience is uncomfortable with his style of comedy.
“I might be one of the very few people that broached this subject in some sort of public platform, so they get uncomfortable because it’s not something that they normally talk about,” Mohan said.
He’s faced plenty of unreceptive audiences on his journey to becoming a nationally touring comedian. When he first incorporated politics into his bits, he found himself booking fewer and fewer gigs at comedy clubs and private events.
But “controversial” comedy was always the sort of comedy Mohan wanted to perform. He found himself performing at Fringe Festivals, talent showcases that give artists free reign to create a performance that suits their vision.  
His newest show is centered around empathy and cultural bubbles. Politics are divisive, Mohan said, but they don't have to be. Comedy can release the tension between progressivism and conservatism, he said, and Mohan tries to point out hypocrisies on both sides of the political aisle.
“If both sides can kind of laugh at the hypocrisies of the group,” Mohan said. “Then you can see the other side and say, ‘oh I get where these guys are coming from too.’”
Comedy and empathy will rarely convince someone to immediately change their mind, but, as Mohan described it, it’s the “first step.”
“As Bill Hicks would say ‘you’ve planted a seed,’” Mohan said. “If you want people to think differently, to think more progressively, or just about each other… then you should be investing in each other. You should be investing in people and not constantly be at each other’s throats.”

2018-11-13,AU,club,"At the University, there are a multitude of clubs and activities for students to get involved in. Based on the AU Class of 2022 numbers, the class demographics show that 65 percent  are females and 35 percent are males. Even though women make up most of the student population, we still see several male-dominated clubs and activities at AU. Residence Hall Association (RHA) and Student Government are prime examples of this skewed gender ratio. As we see more males being elected to Student Government and RHA positions, we should be asking ourselves why this gender disparity happens.
Throughout high school, I participated in speech and debate. I took it upon myself to get involved with one of the most challenging events, extemporaneous speaking. Extemporaneous speaking, extemp for short, was an intellectually challenging event where you have 30 minutes to prepare a cohesive speech answering a question pertinent to the world today. For this event, one must be politically up to date and able to quickly formulate ideas. 
After my first couple tournaments, I noticed I was one of few girls on the circuit. There would be many times where I was in a room full of just boys. I noticed that those who qualified for finals were all men. But being the minority in such clubs didn’t stop in high school. 
We should encourage women to participate in such clubs and events. We should offer other females bouts of encouragement and support their pursuits in whatever field they wish. They should not be swayed by overwhelmingly male populations in clubs they wish to attend. This trend can grow into something more deep-rooted and serious. This trend can carry over into careers, which is where it becomes more dangerous. 
If a young female student is discouraged from running for RHA council, this will deter her from running for president in the future. The idea of women in politics is an example of a subject that is still not accepted by all members of society. While the world’s top companies are still mostly run by men, a Peterson Institute survey of almost 22,000 firms from 91 countries tells us that “women in corporate leadership positions can contribute to and advance a firm’s performance.” 
Why should we set the precedent now? I remember the joy of seeing another girl in one of my extemp rounds. Women are inspired by women. The 2015 KPMG Women’s Leadership study concluded that 86 percent of women see possibility of gaining a leadership position and feel it is more attainable when they see more women in these positions. 
What does this look like in practice for AU students? Champion girls who participate in a mostly male-dominated activity. Understand their bravery for setting precedents for women in the future. 
Based on my experience being one of the few female extempers, I understand how it feels. Women interested in running for RHA council or Student Government should undoubtedly do so. It is time we start deconstructing these skewed beliefs and support those around us who are discouraged to seize opportunities. They can forge real change in unique ways, but we will never find out how until we see these people in such clubs and places of power.

2019-03-06,AU,club,"On Jan. 31, AU Dining held a public meeting in the University Club attended by eight students. During the meeting, the University’s dining services shared their proposals to increase the minimum costs of meal plans for sophomores by about $2,000. 
Shortly after this meeting, a wave of social media outrage brought swift backlash to the proposal. On Feb 14, AU Dining announced that they were “proposing that there be no price increase to the meal plans for 2019-2020 academic year. The proposed meal plans will keep the current pricing and meal block levels.” The email additionally stated that the University’s contract with Aramark would be reviewed “to determine if a change is warranted.”
The Eagle supports student activism and organizing in reaction to the proposed changes to the meal plan program. The Residence Hall Association town hall meeting on Feb. 11, attended by dozens of students and the AU Dining director, was well-organized and provided a student space for frustrations and feedback. We commend the University for facilitating a successful process to solicit student feedback. This was the first time, in recent history, that AU Dining offered this opportunity. 
At the same time, we recognize that the University’s process for receiving feedback has left out some students, demonstrating a continued disconnect between administrators and students.

For example, students who work outside of classes to help pay for their education at AU are less likely to be able to attend the offered meetings. These are typically the students who would be most affected by the proposed changes, particularly those who identify as low-income or otherwise underrepresented.

AU Dining appears to want feedback to be given solely within an unspecified process, and students who deviate from their surveys or meetings are largely ignored and without recourse. One of the main contentions of AU Dining was that they were not receiving enough student feedback. But, it is fundamentally backward to implement meal plan changes on the basis that not enough students voiced dissent. 
In addition, students have been complaining about food quality at AU for years. If at all, who has been receiving and responding to this feedback? 
For example, the Muslim Student Association advocated to create a Halal station in TDR. It took students a year of advocating for themselves before dining services finally implemented the change. 
Issues like these reveal a cognitive dissonance -- the desire to present AU as a progressive, forward thinking institution while being reluctant to empower students to take the lead on issues that directly affect them in the ways they find most effective. 
Administrators must recognize and embrace their role as a sounding board for students. The grievances of many students are nuanced; therefore, student criticism should not be taken personally. Student opposition can range from Aramark’s history with providing poor food to prisoners to food quality at AU to individual issues of affordability in the context of rising college costs. None of these complaints are personal attacks on AU Dining administrators, but are direct expressions of frustration with how the dining system affects students.
This academic year has seen AU Dining and Auxiliary Services as a constant point of student discussion. While the University may view the student body as quick to protest, this has more to do with the overall lack of structured channels for constructive feedback and a growing sense that student concerns are not taken into account before important decisions and proposals are released by administrators.
Therefore, The Eagle encourages continued student organizing on this topic. It is important to have students, whether or not the topic affects them deeply, to be involved in the wellbeing and best interest of their peers.
However, we must note that the campus community cannot continue in a perpetual trend of demanding student-centered change, and the University eventually acquiescing. The issues facing our community are steeped in larger discourses of college affordability and food insecurity. If we hope to address these problems and change the status quo, it will require input from many people within the AU community.   
Most importantly, administrators must ensure that those students who are most vulnerable and least able to participate in meetings are provided an alternative recourse for voicing their concerns and needs. 
To accomplish this, systemic change must come from administrators recognizing that the path forward for AU Dining, and other administrative services, must look radically different from the past. For every price increase, there must be a corresponding measure to ensure that students experiencing food insecurity and other affordability issues will receive more resources and help to address their concerns.

2019-03-06,AU,club,"Students table at the off-court sustainability fair prior to a Feb. 13 men's basketball game arranged by the Office of Sustainability, various on-campus student organizations and the D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility.
Climate change is a big and looming issue, but it doesn’t have to be so intimidating. The (Com)Post is The Eagle’s new sustainability series that breaks down topics in eco-friendly living in a fresh, actionable and fun way. Check out our first installment of a staff writer making a zero waste meal.
Even before School of Public Affairs freshman Conner Shipp and School of Communication sophomore Sarah Graver became AU’s Zero Waste Club’s newest co-presidents, the climate-conscious group was already making waves on campus.
With several successful projects throughout the year, the leaders bounce ideas off of each other to generate new ways for AU students to lower the amount of waste they produce. 
“The co-presidents before us, Grace Pugh and Caroline Johnson, were really great,” Shipp said. “[They] worked closely with Tyler Orton, who’s in charge of the composting program on campus.” 
Project Move-In is one of the club’s first events of the school year that lets students buy donated furniture, hangers and other small dorm essentials in late August. At the end of the spring semester, Project Move-Out allows students to donate items by placing them in the designated bins the club places at the end of each floor in the residence halls, which they sell on the quad in the fall. 
The two projects are perfect examples of the Zero Waste Club’s mission in action, Shipp said. 
“Our club’s purpose is to help facilitate and give students the knowledge to reduce their waste in any way,” Shipp said. 
Not only are the events some of the club’s biggest fundraisers, they also help the AU community move toward a more sustainable move-in process, Shipp said. 
“It’s a lot of cumbersome stuff you wouldn’t want to pack,” Shipp said. “You’re not generating the waste from going out and purchasing those items just to throw them away at the end of the year.” 
The club works closely with the University, which gives housing extensions to volunteers who manage the program. It also uses AU’s resources and storage space to make the projects run as smoothly as possible. 
Club meetings often include an educational component to go along with activities, such as make-your-own sustainable cleaning products and a clothing swap, paired with presentations on waste and how to adopt a sustainable lifestyle.
With growing anxiety over climate change and the negative implications of waste on the environment, Shipp said that it’s up to this generation to make massive lifestyle changes. Still, club members recognize that achieving a zero waste lifestyle is easier said than done.
“I think that is a really high expectation for just your average college student,” Graver said. “My philosophy with it is as long as people are aware of the waste that they’re creating and … think about where it goes, then that will, in turn, lower what people use.” 
The club created the guides on how to recycle and compost on the side of AU’s landfill, compost and recycling bins, and regularly hands out magnets with the same cheat sheets. 
“People are looking for one big thing they can do that will change their waste output, and really it’s the little things,” Shipp said. 
Small changes such as bringing your own coffee cup, buying secondhand sustainable products and utilizing AU’s many water fountains to fill reusable water bottles are steps in the right direction, Graver said. 
Other steps toward a more sustainable life include their recent work with composting and food waste in the Terrace Dining Room, one of the club’s newest contributions to combat a larger societal problem. 
“One of the biggest things we’re doing right now is the Food Recovery Network,” Shipp said. “That’s basically collecting food that goes unserved through AU Dining Services and distributing it to people across the D.C. community.” 
The group currently meets every other Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in MGC 247. For future projects, the members currently have an on-campus thrift store in the works, which would allow students to reduce their carbon footprint via second-hand shopping.
“There’s a few spaces that we’ve been eyeing for a bit,” Shipp said. “We’ve been in communication with campus leaders as far as getting that implemented.”
According to Shipp and Graver, living sustainably is more a responsibility than a choice. The leaders encourage AU students to get educated on how to reduce their carbon footprint and live more consciously of waste. 
“If you have the ability to, why not stop it?” Shipp said. “Why not educate others?”

2019-04-10,AU,club,"Maggie Rogers performs at the 9:30 Club on March 26. 
 
Maggie Rogers tells you exactly how she’s feeling, and she’ll make you dance while she does it. The 24-year-old Maryland native brought her debut album, “Heard it in a Past Life,” to the 9:30 Club on March 25-26. 
Rogers amassed a loyal audience after a video of Pharell reacting to Rogers’ song, “Alaska” during a New York University masterclass went viral in 2016. Rogers’ album is an attempt to reconcile who she is with the person the world wants her to become, as many of the lyrics deal with personal growth and change. Her music can be described as everything from folk to indie to R&B to pop.
Rogers makes music that fans can identify with, in part because of the authenticity and vulnerability of her lyrics. This is present in “Light On,” a song about self-doubt. While it seemed like everyone knew every lyric to every song, the audience participation for the verse, “you should be so happy now” was by far the loudest. 
Rogers’ opening act, guitarist Melanie Faye, opened the show with an instrumental cover of “Say My Name” by Destiny’s Child. After warming up the crowd with this hit, Faye played her own music, proving that her vocal abilities matched her skills on the guitar. 
Rogers’ started her own set with “Give a Little,” an upbeat track that she claims is a “reintroduction of herself.” The crowd was immediately responsive and everyone began to dance to the optimistic tune. Rogers seemed to feed off that energy during her performance of “Burning.” While she fluctuates easily between acoustic songs and energized dance tracks, these two are arguably the most clean-cut pop. 
The singer then took a moment to talk about returning to D.C., a place that she said felt like home. Rogers grew up in Easton, Maryland, and said she “grew up checking the listings for [the 9:30 Club] religiously.” Rogers had many friends and family members in attendance, including her dad, who she gave several shout-outs to throughout the night.
The show was packed with anecdotes and invitations to dance from Rogers. During “The Knife,” a song that evokes the emotional changes the young singer has faced, Rogers stopped to call-out the audience members on the balcony who she felt weren’t dancing enough. It was a playful yet effective way to encourage the few who weren’t dancing to let loose. 
Before “Light On,” Rogers explained the fear that she felt grappling with so much fame so fast. Finally, she dedicated “Dog Years” to her friends who have stuck with her through this new chapter of her life. 
Rogers ended the night with “Color Song” from her 2017 EP, “Now That the Light is Fading.” The song, which describes the colors of nature, was performed a capella to a silent crowd. Rogers even stopped using her microphone halfway through, making the finale even more intimate.  
“Thank you, I’ll see you soon,” Rogers said before exiting the stage, hinting at her upcoming performances in D.C. this fall. 
Maggie Rogers will return to D.C. at the Anthem on Oct. 7-8. Tickets can be purchased here. The album, “Heard it in a Past Life” can be streamed on Spotify and iTunes.

Pop star Hayley Kiyoko will headline AMFest, an arts and music festival, at American University on Saturday, April 20, the AU Student Government Student Union Board announced Wednesday. 
Kiyoko, dubbed “Lesbian Jesus” by her fans, is a lesbian musician and a major advocate for the LGBTQ community. Her music often focuses on her emotional struggle with her identity, and highlights LGBTQ-related issues, including her music video “One Bad Night,” which raised awareness of violence against transgender women.  
She released her debut album “Expectations” in 2018 and now has over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify. Some of her popular tracks include “Girls Like Girls,” “Curious” and “What I Need” featuring R&B artist Kehlani. 
Before rising to fame, Kiyoko was a member of the all-female pop group The Stunners, with ""rhythmic pop” artist Tinashe, and was featured in the 2011 Disney Channel original movie “Lemonade Mouth.”
AMFest will take place on the quad from 2 to 11 p.m. and is co-hosted by the Kennedy Political Union, Women’s Initiative, the Alumni Association, AU Club Council and WVAU. Other members of the lineup include the Maryland-based artist Mannywellz, D.C. artist Babeo Baggins and many more musicians from the D.C.-area.
AMFest will also feature a “Women in Entertainment” panel with Girlaaa and peace and body roll duo BOOMscat at 3 p.m. in the Tavern. Students can also enjoy cotton candy, henna, a painting station and other activities.
AMFest will take place on the quad on Saturday, April 20 from 2-11 p.m. The event is free and open to the AU community and the public.

2019-05-01,AU,club,"As the University continues to make progress on the construction of the new Hall of Science, AU’s STEM community is looking forward to the benefits of a new space on campus. 
Along with the completion of the new building, AU’s plan to expand its STEM program will also include hiring more faculty, according to biology professor Meg Bentley.
While 78 percent of STEM faculty at AU are white and 59 percent are male, Bentley said the hiring process will give the University the opportunity to increase faculty diversity. 
“Students need to see someone who looks like them in the front of the classroom,” Bentley said. 
The STEM community is not waiting for the new building to begin discussions on improving their representation. At the end of March, STEM students and faculty held a summit to discuss inclusive excellence and underrepresentation in the STEM community at AU.
At the summit, Bentley, along with Kathryn Walters-Conte, who directs the professional sciences master’s program in biotechnology, presented data on the demographics of STEM students and faculty as well as students’ experiences with programs at AU. 
According to their findings, only 18.8 percent of faculty and 27.9 percent of students think there is sufficient “representation” within the STEM student body. Their survey also found that only 12.5 percent of faculty and 23 percent of students think there is sufficient representation among the STEM faculty at AU.
Some underrepresented students say that finding community is already hard enough in a STEM program that feels overshadowed by the University’s focus on political science and international relations. Jorge Goyco, a sophomore biochemistry major, said it is often difficult for young STEM students to find other people in their major.
“You can find any kid that’s an SIS major and be friends with them, and you can find any political science major to be friends with, because this is a school that is very much in that nature,” Goyco said. “STEM majors don’t have that same look.” 
To help give his classmates that sense of community, Goyco co-founded the Underrepresented Students in STEM club. As the club’s president, he is working to bring awareness to events and projects of STEM students that might otherwise go unnoticed by the student body.
Building that community, Goyco said, also required drawing greater attention to the research of STEM students and faculty. Most people on campus are not award of faculty and student research ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to the behavioral effects of cancer in mice.  
“These amazing opportunities that we have all over the University, no one knows about them,” Goyco said. “Nobody knows that we are a pretty advanced research school.”
Goyco also said that the Hall of Science could potentially be a space that brings together work from the various STEM majors.
“It will be nice to actually have a single building where we can all meet, share ideas and maybe even help each other out in our research and studies,” Goyco said.
Currently, many of the different STEM departments are scattered across campus. In some cases, they are utilizing older buildings that face problems with accessibility. Goyco pointed out that Hurst Hall, where many STEM classes meet, does not have any elevators, preventing students with limited mobility access from accessing classrooms or faculty offices.    
The Hall of Science will provide new facilities for biology, chemistry, environmental science and neuroscience departments. The building will feature state-of-the-art research laboratories, as well as a new lecture hall to take the place of the old lecture space in Kreeger. 
As life science students like Goyco await the building’s completion, physics, math, statistics and computer science students already know the benefits of finally having a designated space on campus. 
The Don Myers Technology and Innovation Building, which opened in 2017, has provided those departments with a space for research and collaboration. Mercy Griffith, a senior majoring in mathematics and secondary education, said that the building has been invaluable for her academic experience. 
“I don't think the importance of just having your own place where you can go to your classes, and talk to your professors, and see your friends, and work together can be understated,” Griffith said. “It has transformed the math department.” 
Beyond just the physical space to pursue their work, Griffith said she appreciated AU bringing greater awareness to the STEM program. 
“You feel like your work matters, you feel like you mean something to the University,” Griffith said. “The statement that I’m going to build a space for you to pursue your work, it was a really cool feeling.”
Faculty in the math department also benefited from the move to Don Myers. Michael Limarzi, a professor in the department of mathematics and statistics and sponsor of the Not Math club, said that because the math department had been so spread out, he moved through four offices in only seven years of teaching at the University. 
Those logistical problems made it difficult for students who became interested in the STEM program to learn about the different offerings and resources on campus, Limarzi said. 
“Just knowing that everyone's in the same place gives you a reason to go to the building and hang out in the building, because you know, no matter what classes you're taking, your professor’s going to be there,” Limarzi said. 
Limarzi and Griffith are optimistic that the Hall of Science will deliver similar benefits for the science department.
“The new building offers to the chemistry and life science departments what Don Myers gave to our program,” Griffith said.
But more than just new labs and grants, STEM students said they hope the new Hall of Science will give the community a chance to get to know the work of AU’s STEM programs. 
Jai Jacobs, a junior math major, said she wishes more people would learn about the research and achievements of STEM students and faculty. She hopes the university community can work to “close the gap between STEM and non-STEM students.”
“As much as this is about math, it’s not really about math,” Limarzi said. “It’s about the community of people who study math.”

2019-09-12,AU,club,"Tenleytown Main Street, a community-based non-profit organization, will produce and sponsor their fourth annual Art All Night event in Tenleytown on Saturday from 7 p.m. to midnight. 
“Art All Night is really about celebrating the District’s creative community and highlighting the diverse depth and breadth of the artistic talent in the District,” said Leigh Catherine Miles, the executive director of Tenleytown Main Street. “In Tenleytown, we fully embrace that.”
Art All Night is an annual, free overnight art festival that is presented by Mayor Muriel Bowser and D.C. Department of Small and Local Business Development. The event takes place in eight different neighborhoods, including Congress Heights, Deanwood Heights, Dupont Circle, H Street, Minnesota Avenue, North Capitol, Shaw and Tenleytown, on the same night.
“[Tenleytown is] one of about 1,200 main streets across the country, and one of more than 18 here in the District of Columbia that focuses on revitalizing our commercial areas and our specific neighborhoods,” Miles said. “Part of that revitalization is the arts.” 
This year, Tenleytown will host over 200 artists and performers in their 19 different public and private venue spaces along Wisconsin Avenue. Each of the locations will be transformed into a pop-up art gallery or performance area. For example, Guapo’s second floor will host a flamenco dancing performance and a comedy club featuring AU students and alumni, which is run by Asteria Entertainment, a group created by AU senior Rebecca Lamis.
The idea to have an event like Art All Night was not a D.C. original, however. The event was inspired by Paris’ Nuit Blanche, a similar overnight arts festival in France, which was introduced to D.C. by Shaw Main Street 11 years ago. Tenleytown entered the list of participating neighborhoods in January 2016. The event has only grown since, with 13,000 art-lovers in attendance last year in Tenleytown alone.
While Miles said that Tenleytown’s Art All Night is for “art-lovers of all ages, of all tastes and all backgrounds,” she still offers her opinions on which events may appeal the most to college students. These include the “Art in DC/DC in Art” at Citizen Heights curation, the “Art Of A Woman” exhibit at the BOLD Center and the outdoor silent disco at the Art All Night Welcome Center in the open lot next to Tenley Bar & Grill on Wisconsin Avenue. 
Tenleytown’s Art All Night even features AU’s Katzen Arts Center as one of the 19 venues, which brings the evening close to home.
“American University is a great partner of Tenleytown Main Street,” Miles said. “The Katzen Art Center [and] the AU Museum will be open for a special after-hours showing of their early fall exhibits, and they’ll have more activities going on there as well.” 
Nicole Martin, an M.A. candidate and the marketing and publications assistant for AU’s museum, said in an email that both students and community members should come to Katzen this Saturday between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. for “make-and-take art activities, light refreshments, live music, ask-me docents to guide you through our early fall exhibitions, as well as pop-up performances from [Professor] Britta Peterson’s capstone class.” 
Beyond the Katzen Arts Center, three of AU’s a cappella groups—On a Sensual Note, Pitches Be Trippin’ and Dime a Dozen—will be performing outside Janney Elementary School between 7:15 p.m. and 8:20 p.m.  
Art All Night is free, which makes all there is to do even better. 
“It’s a fully free event, which we’re really proud of and all the neighborhoods are proud of because it means that your access to enjoy and experience and explore the arts is not determined by your economics, it’s open to all,” Miles said.  
Miles said that if you haven’t been to Tenleytown’s Art All Night, you aren’t seeing the neighborhood at its fullest.
“You can’t possibly fathom the amazing array of music, dance, art, color, vibrancy [and] energy that comes to Tenleytown,” Miles said. “We want to encourage people to come to Tenleytown and experience this neighborhood in a different way.”
Correction: This story previously reported that Main Street had 12,000 programs nationwide. It has been updated with the correct number.

2019-09-13,AU,club,"Lili Reinhart, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, and Constance Wu star in ""Hustlers""

The reveal of the staggering cast of “Hustlers,” including Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B, Constance Wu, Lizzo, Keke Palmer and many others, had audiences ready for an empowering movie filled with drama, crime and a whole lot of fun. Do the personalities of these titanic stars translate from the trailers to the big screen? While the immediate answer is a resounding “yes,” some things are disappointingly left at surface level. 
“Hustlers,” directed by Lorene Scafaria, tells the true story of a stripper, Destiny (Constance Wu), as her life is dramatically altered when she meets Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), the matron of the strip club where she would like to work. The relationship between the two begins with a simple pole dancing lesson, which quickly turns into a deep familial friendship as they  become literal partners in crime. They have a family of accomplices, Annabelle (Lili Reinhart) and Mercedes (Keke Palmer), doing increasingly wilder and more dangerous things as the years go by; and yet they want these women to succeed, get all the money in the world, and not face any consequences.
Scafaria and the strong, female-dominated cast are able to portray this story in a way that many films in the past have failed to do, choosing to celebrate strippers rather than marginalize or villainize them. In “Hustlers,” they have families, they have pasts, they just want to be happy like everyone else. Scafaria spends a lot of time in the film putting the camera as close as possible to the actresses’ faces, allowing the audience to take in every expression of emotion that the characters are feeling while they scheme, celebrate, fight and fall. Montages of stripping practices, shopping excursions and suspect kitchen activities are backed with classical music, elevating these moments—traditionally seen as indulgent and seedy—as art forms that require as much brilliance as the music that underscores them. Wu and Lopez provide especially powerful performances that bring us into their world, making us empathize with their struggles, cheer for their successes and feel heartbroken over their downfalls. 
On paper, “Hustlers” does exactly what one expects it to do, humanizing a group of strippers in a fun, humorous and action-packed way. However, while the film brings important subjects to light, it only scratches the surface. We do not know the history of why Ramona is the intense matriarch that she is today, or why she is so angry at men she swindles. We do not see if anybody ever second guesses their decisions or ever feel any remorse. We do not see the quiet moments or poignant conversations between the group that make them care about one another so much and call each other family.If one thinks hard enough about the story, the motivation, history, and consistency of the characters is lost.
It is hard to fit approximately eight years of storytelling into one hour and fifty minutes of cinema, but Scafaria does a phenomenal job in garnering the right emotions and reactions through her storytelling. However, the viewer has to fill the gaps themselves. Whether you’re simply looking for a fun movie night or the opportunity to open up a conversation about the stigma around strippers, crime and how far one will go for the people they love, “Hustlers” delivers both.
“Hustlers” will be released in theaters Friday, September 13

2019-10-08,AU,club,"After two and a half years of development, the Student Involvement Fund is being put into place. This initiative from Student Government and AU Club Council will select 20 students to receive $500 each for displaying ""worthwhile dedication to their organizations,” as reported by The Eagle. 
The money for this fund comes from AU Student Government, AU Club Council and AU Student Media, of which The Eagle is a member. The total allotment is $10,000 for the fund from each of these organizations, which are funded by the student activity fee. There is an application process where members of the Budget Advisory Committee (BAC) will determine who receives the funding. In the wake of this announcement, there was controversy among the student body.
Students argue that those who devote serious time to clubs may already be in a stable enough financial position that they would not need the $500. Others feel that giving such a small amount of money shows the lack of awareness of the costs to students, as $500 is equivalent to about three weeks of work, part-time, at D.C. minimum wage. Students feel that as this fund is not targeted towards supporting low-income students, it may not help the students who would want to get more involved but cannot.
Low-income students generally do not feel supported by the University, and having a fund like targeted towards them would show that support. However, it is not necessarily true that students who already are very involved on campus are not low-income. There are plenty of students who do it all: club leadership, classes and a job. The assumption that students who are very involved on campus are coming from a place of financial privilege ignores all the hard work that students not coming from those places do on campus every semester and leaves many students out of the conversation. Even if students have higher incomes, this does not negate that those students are often working very hard to support their clubs, and it is worth supporting that. Students on campus advocate for supporting each other, and this fund aims to do so.
What is unclear is how the allocation of these funds will be decided. As The Eagle reported, students applying for this fund will need to write an essay about their involvement and receive verification from their faculty advisor. Students who are currently in stipend positions cannot apply, and once a student receives the funds, they cannot apply again. There is no clear idea of what BAC is looking for in applicants, other than that the process will be blind. It was also emphasized that quality, rather than quantity, of involvement would be considered, but that still does not give students a clear picture of who should be applying. Every scholarship has clear qualifications, rubrics and even key words; this information should have been shared before the application ever went live, and not retroactively, or never at all. There may be ideal students that this funding would make a difference for, but without a clearly defined desired applicant, some may never apply.
Another flaw is that students often must commit to club leadership or participation before knowing whether or not they will receive the funds. Without knowing this, some students who would have been great leaders and candidates for the funds will never be that involved. If these funds were more clearly targeted to different communities on campus that often feel unsupported, like students of color or low-income students, then it may be more clear that these funds would be able to help. This fund will most likely not push students to join more  clubs and over stretch themselves more than students on campus already do. However, for all its good intentions, it may leave some students out of the picture.
There is no reason not to encourage students to be involved with organizations on campus. Campus life is what brings students to universities across the United States, and the University is particularly boastful of its hundreds of registered student organizations. This fund, however, has not been implemented in an ideal way for the student body, and it remains to be seen how student criticisms may change things. This funding is a low enough amount to not make any potential changes to student financial aid, but for that same reason may not make much of a difference to individual students either. When so many club and organization leaders on campus are already pouring their time and often their own money into their organization, the $500 may just buy a club some new equipment, rights to plays or costumes for dance performances. 
Students are dedicated to the communities they’ve made on campus through these organizations. Recognizing that is well-intentioned and worthwhile, but that support would be more clear coming from the actual University administration, and not just umbrella student organizations. Until that happens, $500 is a first step of what will hopefully be continued efforts to honor students’ hard work at making AU a campus worth getting involved in.
As a member of AU Student Media, The Eagle is one of the organizations that will be funding the Student Involvement Fund through the BAC.

2019-10-10,AU,club,"Center for Student Involvement front desk
The Center for Student Involvement underwent a series of changes this summer, renaming itself from the Student Activities Office and implementing new initiatives including the Engage platform and the Corq app. 
Ayana Wison, director of CSI, explained that the changes were meant to ensure that the office was more accessible to students and campus organizations.
“We’ve been listening to the things that [students] have been saying about how we can better support them and are putting those things into action for them to really feel like this is a place that they can come to be involved,” Wilson said.
In the spring of 2019, CSI discussed the proposed changes with leaders from student organizations including Student Government, AU Club Council, Housing and Residence Life and Greek organizations. They provided feedback on how CSI could clarify the office’s purpose to students who were looking for opportunities to become involved on campus.
Colin Colchamiro, chair of AU Club Council, was one of the students who attended CSI’s spring presentation. He said that one of the primary inputs the invited students contributed was helping the office come up with a new name that better reflected the office’s mission.   
“Changing the name to Center for Student Involvement versus what we had before was put in place because we wanted to show how widespread the office works in all facets of student involvement,” Colchamiro said.
Colchamiro explained that the changes to the office discussed in the spring focused on the rebranding and outreach of CSI, but the day-to-day operations of the office did not significantly change. 
“The staff members are still doing basically the same things that I had always known them to be working on,” Colchamiro said. “Different people come into and out of those roles, but operationally, it feels pretty similar to what I know.”
Before the 2019 fall semester began, CSI began rolling out Engage, an online content management software providing club and organization leaders a central platform for administration, connecting with members and tracking engagement. 
Students might recognize Engage from its partner app, Corq, which provides a schedule of campus events and was required for attendance at events throughout All-American Welcome. The app also provides information on organizations hosting events and allows students to RSVP and access tickets all in one place.
“One thing that we've heard from students over and over again, is that we didn’t have a clearinghouse or particular place for them to go to find out about what's happening on campus, or to find out about an organization,” Wilson said. “So what we were really looking for is something that could do that.”
Colchamiro said that Engage has also improved the process by which clubs are able to get funding through AU Club Council. Previously funding request paperwork was submitted through email to AUCC and divided up internally by the staff to review. The old process, he said, made it easy to make small mistakes that resulted in delays in clubs hearing if their application was approved.
Now, clubs submit funding applications directly through Engage. Engage notifies clubs immediately when applications are approved, simplifying the process for Au Club Council staff and expediting the process for funds getting to clubs.
“With Engage, all budget requests are submitted online and it makes everything entirely centralized,” Colchamiro said. “I think club leaders are going to get a lot out of [Engage] and we are finding it a lot better for our processes, especially as every year a lot more clubs enter the scene.”
The platform has already helped CSI and AUCC better track the amount of engagement occurring on campus. During this year’s All-American Welcome Week alone, over 4,000 students used Engage and Corq to check into events across campus.

2019-11-11,AU,club,"President Sylvia Burwell announced on Sept. 17 that Board of Trustees member and University alum Jack Cassell had donated $3 million to the University in order to build a new Center for Athletic Performance, or “CAP,” as reported by The Eagle. This center was further funded by another alum donation. The center will serve both student-athletes and students in some capacity on campus. The current plan is to move the strength and conditioning rooms and wrestling room the Center for Athletic Performance, along with providing space for the University's Division 1 athletic teams and the club and intramural teams to compete. There is still a need for fundraising for the center, as this will not be paid by the University’s budget. Currently, it is unknown where the Center will be located or what different amenities will be included.
This donation for an athletic center comes at a complicated time for students. Across campus, the student body is suffering from construction fatigue, especially as the quad is increasingly difficult to navigate. It is also questionable where this facility could go; with the Hall of Science nearing its construction end date, it is unclear where this next building could fit onto an increasingly crowded campus. Even knowing that this facility will have benefits for the University, the logistics and future construction are a depressing reality for students.
Some criticisms have also been in reaction to the idea of building an athletic center at all. It is understandable why students may hear about a large donation to the University, and look at the long wait times for the Counseling Center, broken classroom buildings and lack of club funding, and feel frustrated. For some students, University athletics and their facilities are not at all a part of their AU experience. When there are so few resources to go around campus, especially when one part of the student body appears to be getting so much, questions about priorities are fair to ask. Explaining the potential campus-wide benefits to this donation may have been helpful for students who believe that priorities should lie elsewhere. However, the reality is that new athletic facilities are needed for student-athletes.
Current facilities at AU are simply not at the same level as many comparable schools. When facilities are small or aging, it is not attractive for recruiting better athletes. There is also a safety factor, as student-athletes use increasingly poor equipment, the potential for injuries also increases. To be competitive in the Patriot League, as our University sports teams work to be, there is no getting around a new center.
There is also the potential for revenue generation with better athletics programs. Most of AU’s revenue currently comes from student's tuition dollars instead of an endowment or other source of revenue, as is ideal for universities. With a better athletic program, there is real potential for higher game attendance, which could bring in another, more sustainable source of revenue. It could mean more money in the long run, and more money for other student needs. This facility will also make it easier for the students playing club and intramural sports to have access to practice and competition space that is currently highly competitive. Students are also increasingly adding HFIT classes in their schedules, to the point that several end up with waitlists. Added space means more students can incorporate physical activity into a healthier college student lifestyle.
Frustration among the student body is understandable, as it often feels like no one at the University is listening to student priorities. It would be interesting if a University donor considered holding a town hall with students to hear what they think millions of dollars should go towards. In the end, however, it is the person making the donation who signs the check and decides what they want to invest in on campus.
Instead of constant in-fighting over resources that students have no control over, students should support each other when good things happen to their peers. When the Hall of Science was announced, there were many who complained that there was “no reason” for the building as AU is not known or particularly highly ranked in the sciences, especially with so many other issues on campus. However, the sciences are the fastest growing undergraduate major at AU, and the current lab building has been literally crumbling. It was simply time for an improved space on campus. The fact is, there will always be something that one may think needs or doesn’t need funding. Supporting the University's student-athletes, who need a better facility, is worthwhile even if you’ve never stepped foot in a campus gym.

2019-12-12,AU,club,"Rachel Lee and Natalie Senft, two sophomore business administration majors specializing in marketing, were sitting in their ITEC-320 class earlier this semester, having what Senft referred to as a “casual” conversation about their passions for fashion, when their idea to create Revolution: The AU Fashion Society was born. 
“We were just talking and I was like, ‘You know, I would love to bring back the fashion club,’” Lee said. 
Senft remembered cutting Lee off and telling her that she has been wanting to bring back the club as well. After she learned that the previous fashion club on campus did not renew their license and went inactive, she began thinking about wanting to start up a new one. The pair then made plans to meet up a few days later at The Bridge to go over logistics and ideas. From there, the whole process “snowballed,” Lee described. 
According to Lee, Revolution: The AU Fashion Society, which officially became a club on Nov. 8, will focus on the intersection of business and the fashion industry, but it is a club for more than just business majors. It’s also for people interested in fashion as a hobby.
“We want to expose students to potential careers in the fashion industry,” Lee said. “We want to have speakers and panelists come, successful people who work in the industry, tell us how they got there, and tell us how we could get there, too.”
Senft believes people joining a new club like Revolution gives them the opportunity to influence the club’s creation.
“Since it’s in its beginning stages, the people who join now can really help form and mold the club to what they want it to be,” Senft said.
With their eagerness to start a new club, the two began to plan with each other and their faculty advisor, the program director for the business and entertainment program department of management, professor John Simson. 
The two friends went into first-year business courses to talk about the club and get emails of people who were interested. They also held an interest meeting for the club in early October. These efforts, combined with other forms of outreach, have garnered over 100 emails on their mailing list, and it continues to grow.
Before Senft and Lee started the process of creating this club together, they both had separate fashion journeys. 
When Senft was younger, she sewed, ran her own fashion blog and was a Nordstrom ambassador for two years. She came to campus her first year and asked how she could get more information on the old fashion club. Lee was also interested in joining the old fashion club during her first year before she learned that it was inactive.
“I just like clothing and styling outfits. I’m not as qualified as her,” Lee said as she referenced Senft’s history. Senft reassured that Lee is also very qualified.
Lee had her own “eureka” moment about Revolution this past summer. She drafted a proposal for creating the fashion club and was prepared to start the club creation process when she returned. Once she was on campus, however, she was nervous and abandoned it.
“It was daunting at first,” Lee said. “I was like, ‘Who do I talk to? How do I start? Is there even any interest?’ So, that’s why it really helps to do it with someone else.” 
According to the two, their friendship made the club creation process easy. The two joked that they are each other’s top contacts in their phones, and they text each other about the club all the time.
“If we didn’t work well together, that would be difficult,” Lee said. “In my head, I always think about how lucky we got.” 
Revolution will begin general body meetings during the spring 2020 semester. 
Revolution: The AU Fashion Society has pages on Instagram and Facebook and students can sign up for their email list here.

2019-12-13,AU,club,"As of  March 2019, the University has five open federal investigations from the Office of Civil Rights, a part of the Department of Education, into the Title IX office. This is a record number of complaints for the medium-sized university that AU is categorized as. There are some schools with four complaints, but one of those universities has a population of 40,000 students, a radically different percentage and likelihood of this number of open investigations. Each of the University’s investigations has been opened in the last four years, and notably, we do not know who filed these investigations or why they filed them. 
As members of the student body, these investigations still being open after years, in some cases, is troubling. The fact that students know that they can open these investigations would seem to be a positive, but the fact that so many have opened is concerning. 
It is likely not AU's fault that some of these cases have been open for so long. As political administrations change, so do their priorities. However, there should be better communication from the University about these cases existing and what AU may be doing to improve their Title IX process.
Anyone who spends some time on campus is aware of the political and social activism  of the student body. That may mean that this number of cases is reflective of a school doing its part to educate students on their rights when it comes to Title IX and sexual violence. 
The Empower AU program is well-implemented, educating students about the issues of sexual violence and intervention skills for the first time in an academic setting. With leaders who treat the subject matter seriously and encourage questions, first-year students at AU are getting exposed to the resources and processes they need to know about early in their college careers. AU’s Palmer Survey has shown that students know more about Title IX after the Empower AU course, as other universities use Empower AU as a model for their own schools. 
Empower AU and the inclusion of Title IX education in AUx courses is a rare case of the University acting proactively on an issue. At other universities, open discussion about these issues is more rare, which makes attitudes on those campuses entirely different. 
Education programs lead to an increase in reports filed because students are more aware of their rights. What is an issue is how that education continues past orientation. 
For older students who did not take AUx, Empower AU is now a distant memory. Different clubs require more training on Title IX issues, which can have a positive impact on the culture within that club. But that isn’t a consistent requirement for any student organizations, and arguably should be, as different organizations continue to be removed from campus for hazing or sexual violence. 
Title IX education for freshmen has also varied over the years. Many students go into AUx with a negative attitude, unwilling to engage in such an important   discussion or the instructor may not make the lesson particularly engaging for students. 
Visits from members of the Title IX office could make a difference in the interest level. The University has to do more to continue students’ education and awareness, aside from campus events that students may have difficulty attending.
Perhaps the most important thing to consider about the culture at AU surrounding Title IX is the need for it to be addressed by students. Preventing sexual violence is nearly impossible to measure, but students must continue to empower each other to make whatever decision is best for a survivor. Allyship only works if students put in the work to make sure that survivors feel supported, and students’ lack of awareness of these complaints is an issue. Without activism by the University student body, it is difficult to see any improvements being made in the Title IX process.
These five open federal investigations indicate that at least on some level, there are issues with parts of the Title IX process.  AU is doing better work than many other universities in handling a structural problem, but there are still flaws that need readdressing so that any student that needs Title IX’s help knows that they are getting the support they need.

2020-02-04,AU,club,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
A candle-lit memoriam flooded the darkened stairway, leading to the now forbidden pathway to TDR. The mood was somber, yet nostalgic. Tears of mourning splashed before the orange traffic cones just beyond the stairway and the TDR exit, plastered with a sign that said “EMERGENCY EXIT.” 
Serving as the Mary Graydon Center’s backdoor to iconic food stops, such as the Market, under the parking garage tunnel, one of the most popular fire exits leading out from TDR has now been shut down temporarily after fifty AU students have disappeared through what experts are calling a “gateway to Narnia.”
“All the money we paid for our daughter to go to this school was a waste,” Marsha Mathers said, mother of Gina Mathers, one of the missing students. While her sobbing echoed throughout the only shady corridor on campus, she crooned over her daughter’s lost opportunities. 
“I should’ve just had her to go to a trade school so that she would’ve learned something useful and beneficial to society,” Mathers said. “Instead she came here and all she learned about was ‘The Feminine Mystique.’”
“This time around, the entrance appears to be in some sad, shallow alleyway instead of some ancient oak wardrobe,” said Vinny Regus, president of AU’s Fantasy Club. “Additionally, rather than attracting the souls of four traumatized children, the gateway seems to be alluring young adults plagued with insomnia and the inevitable institutional-induced destruction of their mental state.”
Students are now recalling their lucky escapes having passed through the alley on various occasions throughout the years.
“I used to cut through that way to get to Subway more quickly,” Larissa Thompson said. “Once my boyfriend vanished after going through there, I realized that it wasn’t worth going that way just to clog my arteries with some greasy footlong more easily.”
To the University’s surprise, despite it being closed off from our side of the universe, hundreds of mythological creatures have still managed to find their way to our world.
“The kids here keep asking if we’re international exchange students,” said Rick, a 14-foot tall centaur who sought to escape the war-ravaged land of Narnia. “I guess this is payback for abducting those four British kids a century ago. I mean, why would anyone want to end up here?”
It is suspected that these students, lost to some vicarious nether, may be forced to fight in an eternal onslaught against forces even greater than college rigor.
“It’s like World War III has already started for them,” Grover Redfield said, a satyr and inter-dimensional culture consultant for the worlds of Narnia and AU. “The only way for winter to return to D.C. is not through the fight against climate change, but with victory against the armies of the White Witch.”
Aslan, the famous lion leader of the Narnians, has also reportedly been seen sneaking in and out of the gateway on numerous occasions. When confronted about his purposes behind opening the gateway, he had this to say:
“Oh, uh, it’s time to stop climate change.”

2020-02-11,AU,club,"Compared to last year’s fiasco, the 92nd Academy Awards were relatively tame, and the surprises that did materialize were mostly welcome ones. Perhaps the most memorable moment of the evening was when the South Korean favorite “Parasite” won the grand prize for Best Motion Picture—the first time a foreign language film has won the award. “Parasite” also walked away with the newly renamed Best International Film award (formerly called the Best Foreign Language Film).
In addition to this underdog upset, there were a number of memorable moments in the evening, from colorful and unexpected musical performances to heartfelt and heart-stopping speeches. Here are a few of the evening’s highlights:
Director Bong Joon Ho got plenty of exercise last night, walking to and from the stage for four separate Academy Awards, including Original Screenplay, Achievement in Directing, as well as both Best International Feature Film and Best Motion Picture.”Parasite” was the first film in the ceremony’s history to win both of the latter awards. In a deluge of firsts, “Parasite” was also the first South Korean film to be nominated for Best Picture (and consequently the first to win).
This came as a surprise given some of the other popular contenders for the night’s highest prize; many predicted Sam Mendes’ “1917” or Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” to take it. “1917” did well in the technical categories, but “The Irishman” walked away empty-handed. The result was a stunning rebuke to the Academy and the films that traditionally succeed during the ceremony.
In his host of acceptance speeches, Bong (through a translator) humbly recognized the cast and crew that made the titanic success possible, recognized the significance of representing South Korea’s first nomination for the International Film category, became emotional and graciously thanked the other nominees when accepting his Directing award, and made a couple of jokes about celebrating by drinking “until [the] next morning.”
Janelle Monáe led the ceremony off with what began as a spoof of Mr. Rogers’ “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”, a song featured throughout the film “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” starring Tom Hanks. It quickly evolved into a theatrical performance featuring dancers dressed as characters from some of this year’s snubbed movies. It was the first (and arguably the best) in a number of excellent guest performances, matched only in the theatrics of the incomparable Sir Elton John with his performance of “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again” from the biopic “Rocketman.” John won his second Oscar for the song.
Also of note was a perplexing performance of the decades-old “Lose Yourself” by Eminem, whose presence at the Oscars came as a surprise to many, and an intimate and tasteful rendition of The Beatles’ “Yesterday” by Billie Eilish—fresh off of her sweep at the Grammys—during the In Memoriam section of the evening. The performance of “Into the Unknown” from “Frozen II” was also a spectacle, featuring lines sung in various international languages, reinforcing the themes of belonging from the film as well as the ever-relevant importance of international unity.
There are always a number of memorable speeches during every Oscar ceremony. Artists from behind and in front of the camera use the spotlight to address any manner of political causes or to simply recite a laundry list of individuals the winner is grateful for. One of the first of the evening came from Matthew A. Cherry and Karen Rupert Toliver, the winners of Best Animated Short Film for “Hair Love.” Their speech called attention to the lack of representation in animation, and the often-overlooked impact of eurocentric standards of beauty on people—and particularly women—of color. Cherry closed out their speech with a brief tribute to Kobe Bryant, the basketball legend who died in an accident earlier this year.
On the issue of representation in film, composer Hildur Guðnadóttir gave an incredibly humble and inspiring speech during her acceptance of her Oscar for Original Score for “Joker.” On top of the standard fare of thanking the film’s cast and crew as well as loved ones, she closed her speech saying, “To the girls, to the women, to the mothers, to the daughters, who hear the music bubbling within, please speak up—we need to hear your voices.” Guðnadóttir won in a competitive category otherwise populated entirely by men for this year’s ceremony, joining an incredibly exclusive club of female composers with only three other women ever walking away with the award. Guðnadóttir is the first to win under the award’s “Original Score” name, which was changed in 2000. 
In another victory for the critically derided (but popularly loved) “Joker,” Joaquin Phoenix gave a lengthy and deeply emotional speech that touched on a number of subjects, focusing primarily on animal rights, our disconnection from the natural world and how these issues affect our understanding of each other. Choking up, Phoenix then closed out his speech quoting a lyric written by his late brother, River: “Run to the rescue with love, and peace will follow.”
While perhaps unlikely given last year’s Best Picture winner, “Parasite’s sweep of the Oscars is hopefully the harbinger of a new era of recognizing films and filmmakers that challenge orthodox conceptions of what we consider a “good movie,” as well as encouraging the Academy to look past the Hollywood sign when considering what to deem as exceptional cinema. While some may cynically believe the result here is just the Academy capitulating to criticism about representation at the Awards—we clearly still have a long way to go there—it is encouraging to see a departure from the sometimes insular world of prestige Hollywood filmmaking.

2020-03-09,AU,club,"Marc E. Bassy performed at U Street Music Hall on Feb. 18.
Whether you’ve heard him on your Spotify’s Discover Weekly or saw him perform live in concert, Marc E. Bassy is taking the music industry by storm. After the up-and-coming artist released his latest album, “PMD,” in September of 2019, his monthly listeners have continued to rise in numbers. 
Bassy has been in tune with his musical talents since he was young and decided to pursue a career doing what he loved, taking time to craft his writing and music.
Bassy started out a member of the L.A.-based band 2 A.M. Club before pursuing his own venture in music. He performed at U Street Music Hall on Feb. 18, exhibiting his ability to naturally entertain the crowd. He currently has 4 million Spotify listeners and has come a long way from the start of his career. 
Bassy has expanded away from the “tragically hip cool people music” that he connected with in his early 20s. He feels like he has now been able to write his lyrics with a good blend of genres. Having been gifted with writing and catching melodies at a young age, Bassy believes that his true calling is with his music.
Here’s what Bassy had to say as he plots his next decade of music.
Devika Knafo: Your music is a combination of hip hop, smooth R&B and heartfelt lyrics. Your album “PMD” is an ode to this generation's lack of connection. You mentioned that “we live in a world where everyone is more connected than ever but feels more lonely than ever.” How have you been able to explore this idea, and what have you been able to find?
Marc E. Bassy: I think that the more I explore it and think about it, it’s not just about people being more alone than ever, it’s about people not feeling comfortable being alone because they feel like they are supposed to be plugged into something at all times. I saw that when it came to having limitations on things, I could see things in life getting shorter. This behavior we have is addictive, suppressing mankind’s curiosity, and we find ourselves in this cycle of repetition that is never-ending.  
DK: Have you felt a personal disconnect with the world because of the changes happening in society with the way people act and behave around each other? What things have you learned about life and the human condition that has shaped your music and its purpose?
MEB: I used to be more idealistic, like everyone around us. I used to think of music as something revolutionary. I saw music as something that existed in a way that was subtle and not on purpose. I’ve learned that it’s more about how you say something, rather than what you say. And no one wants to hear someone barking at them or preaching at them. We want to hear someone turning into a master of their craft - that’s what is inspiring. And things that are trying to be something without naturally carrying that energy just go out of style and don’t live on, and I want my music to live on. When I first started touring, it started as something where I wanted attention and to be desirable, and there was this ego trip stuff that came with it all.
I felt like there were many people who weren’t doing things because they kept telling themselves that they can’t, and it never occurred to me that I couldn’t. I always thought I wanted to be in the NBA, but then I had a personal trauma and a near-death experience when I was 17, and I had to spend time in the hospital. The second I walked out and recovered, I told myself I can do anything, so why wouldn’t I do something I like? I loved what I was doing with music at the time, so I figured, why not take this seriously? I didn’t really know how to do what I was doing, but I wanted it so bad because it was so much fun. I loved playing with that energy that came with creating a song. I never did anything creative before music - I was just an athlete, so it was new to me. I was so behind, but so confident for how bad it was. I was all in and it's taken me 10 years to perfect my craft.
DK: What is the purpose behind your music? What emotions do you want to stir up in people who listen to your music? What do you want people to feel? Additionally, how have you expressed vulnerability?
MEB: I want people to not be afraid to be themselves. I want people to listen to my music and be like “I can be myself too, publicly with no shame.” Once I get on the record, that's my time to say what I want, to be what I want and I don't have to be afraid or pretend. If I feel like taking a chance and being someone else, I can do that. I can do anything I want. I want people to be inspired by what they do and be who they are - you are creating an identity for yourself, so find that freedom for yourself.
DK: How do you feel the Internet has impacted the music business?
MEB: I think that America is changing, people’s standards are changing [and] people's interests are changing. There are a lot more opportunities for entertainment. I feel like California is the only place where your social life is completely linked to your professional life. It doesn’t matter how hard you work at your craft, it depends on who you know and how many followers you have. I appreciate the industry and wouldn’t want to have it any other way. But this lifestyle in California has influenced many themes for my albums in the past and also “PMD.” Until I leave L.A., the theme of my music is gonna be L.A. That’s the theme. Every album has been about the things that come with L.A.: the sex, drugs, expectations, the social media craze. I’m still a mystery to myself, and that’s a mystery to me.

Ever since he began his freshman year at American University, Ryan Barto looked forward to one moment — his mom, who didn’t graduate high school, watching him walk across the stage at graduation. 
That opportunity was taken away from him when the University announced in March that there would be an online commencement ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
“I was here because of her work,” Barto said. 
For many first-generation students, commencement is much more than listening to speakers and receiving a diploma. It’s a celebration for their parents, who were not able to receive a college education, and a celebration of themselves for navigating the complexities of college life, such as applying for financial aid and working multiple jobs.
“First-gen students don’t always have the luxury of being able to call home when things get confusing or when you need help in college,” Mariah Espada, spring 2020 graduate, said.
Espada said that graduation was also a moment that she and her family had been anticipating, not just for four years, but practically her whole life. She said that she understood the reason why the University had to cancel commencement, but that it was still a hard pill to swallow.
Spring 2020 graduate, Christina Fluharty, said that after balancing three jobs, paying her own loans and filing her own taxes, she was disappointed when she couldn’t celebrate her achievements with her family, specifically her sister.
“I am paving the way for both of us and it is a little tricky navigating because neither of my parents know how the FAFSA works or anything like that,” Fluharty said. “So it was a very much self-driven journey.”
Fluharty said that she felt like the online commencement ceremony was depersonalized and that she could have gone without watching it. She said that she wishes the University would have considered that some students, who are low-income and moving far away from D.C., like herself, will be unable to come back in December for the planned in-person celebration.
Like Fluharty, both Barto and Espada were unable to celebrate with their families, but instead celebrated with their friends, who were also graduating. Espada said that she made the best out of the situation by baking a cake, while Barto described his morning as “little individual ceremonies.”
“I had little individual ceremonies and basically phone calls with people who helped me along the way,” Barto said. “It was more about saying ‘thank you’ than it was necessarily about me individually.”
Although AU, including the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, offers resources for first-generation students, Barto said he developed a club called the First Generation Student Union, which AU approved this spring, to hopefully provide more support and resources.
“Older students like myself can be able to mentor younger students as they travel through as first-gens at AU and then hopefully transition them into the real world and find careers and jobs,” Barto said.

Articles from that website have been migrated to The Eagle’s main site and backdated with the dates they were originally published in order to allow readers to access them more easily. 
As students await American University’s announcement on how it will operate this fall, many feel uncertain and are weighing their options on whether to attend classes online, in person or even take the semester off.
Online learning created unique difficulties for some students this past spring, forcing many to reconsider their return if classes take place online. Cassidy Nelson, a rising junior in the School of Communication, said that if AU stays fully online, she plans to take a semester off.
“I'm a film major,” Nelson said. “So I feel my studies online are kind of useless, as well as a lot of [other] art[s] majors. We aren't getting the in-person studies we need, whereas [with] a lot of other majors — while in person studying is important — you don't necessarily need the hands-on experience.” 
Other students said they would feel pressured to continue with online classes because of their major. Kada Jackel, a rising junior, said that being in the School of Education makes it difficult for her to take a semester off.
“I completely understand people taking a leave of absence from classes for the fall, and if I weren't a School of Education major, I would totally do that,” Jackel said. “We only have certain semesters that we’re allowed to take certain classes, so I’m not even given that option to take off if I want to.” 
Some also cited finances as part of the reason they would consider taking a semester off. AU charges $25,271 in tuition alone for full-time students taking less than 18 credits. 
“To me, online classes are not worth the tuition I pay per semester,” said rising junior Kier Lewman. “As cliché as it may sound, I only have four years of college that I’m taking out loans for, at my expense, to have a college experience and it only happens once.” 
The University said they will speak with The Eagle after they finalize fall plans.
Rising sophomore Peyton Proksch, who said she hopes the fall semester is entirely online, also fears missing out on “the college experience.”
“So many people want to go back for parties and clubs and live in the dorms and get to see their friends, but I don’t know how safe I’d feel doing all that stuff,” Proksch said. “That’s so much of the college experience, it wouldn’t even be the same. So why not just wait until it’s fully safe to go back?”
Students are also concerned about possibly exposing the greater D.C. community, which has been heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
“Being in D.C., and having a connection with such a wide population, is the biggest thing that would make me question going back,” Proksch said. ”I don’t want to not go into the city for the whole semester, but that’s the biggest chance for us to infect people outside the AU community and for us to get infected and bring it into the AU community.”
Many colleges have made tentative decisions about how and if they will return to have in-person classes. Some schools, such as the University of South Carolina, Notre Dame, Rice and Creighton, are shortening their fall semester to avoid a potential “second wave.”
Schools across the DMV have wrestled with how to bring students back to campus. ReOpen DC, the four stage approach for D.C. to reopen, is still under Phase One. Under this phase, universities in D.C. cannot resume on campus activities. As the city moves to subsequent stages, universities will be able to reopen under an approved plan by the city. 
Both Catholic University and George Washington University plan to resume in person but are still considering other possibilities. Howard University is exploring a hybrid of in person and online classes for the first part of the semester and then having students do the rest virtually after Thanksgiving break. Trinity Washington University released a plan to have 62 percent of all courses delivered online in fall and the rest of classes as a mix of hybrid and face-to-face classes. Schools such as Georgetown University have yet to release their plans. 
Some AU students said that they are less fearful because of President Sylvia Burwell’s experience as former Health and Human Services Secretary under the Obama Administration.
“If there was anyone I’d like to have making these decisions in a pandemic, it’s her, because she definitely knows what she’s doing,” Proksch said. 
The University is set to announce its fall plans in mid-June.

2020-07-06,AU,club,"Students celebrate the announcement of Sharice Davids as the winner of a Kansas congressional race at an AU Dems watch party Tuesday. 
Correction: Edu Nogues' name has been updated with the correct spelling.
All members of the executive board of American University College Democrats resigned from their positions last week, after pushback about a lack of representation of students of color in leadership positions.
The group’s president, vice president, chief of staff, treasurer, communications director, director of activism, director of diversity, equity and inclusion, and social chair stepped down. In statements posted on Facebook and Instagram, each expressed their reasons for stepping down, most of which centered around the need for more representation of people of color in their organization.
“To truly put this organization in the place I want to see it go, BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] voices must be amplified in leadership, and that must start from the top,” former president Rhett Martino said in a Facebook statement on June 29.
Martino said in a statement to The Eagle that resignations were made as a step to “meet the magnitude of the problem.”
“Personally, I believe that I was elected to enact reform on campus in this organization's capacity, and continuing to occupy the seat as head of this organization is not what I currently want to do if that means less representation for marginalized communities in AU Dems leadership,” Martino said. 
In a statement that AU Dems published on Wednesday, Jeremy Ward, previously a deputy diversity, equity and inclusion director, was appointed as the executive director for the duration of the summer, and he will be hosting town halls during this transitional period to determine the next steps for the organization.
In an interview with The Eagle on Wednesday, Ward said that the entire executive board, including the members that had already resigned, had a Zoom call to discuss the resignations and decided to appoint him as the executive director. 
“I just want to speak to as many people as possible and understand their opinions on how the club has made them feel unwelcome, unvalued and tokenized, at times,” Ward said. “Then we’ll compile that report and send a list of recommendations that we’ll make public to the student body.”
While there are long withstanding issues with diversity, Ward said, there have been people in the organization who have tried to implement change.
However, former Vice President Christopher Bastida, who was one of the three students of color on the executive board, was the first to post a statement of resignation. In an interview with The Eagle, Bastida said that the organization had not made proper changes toward more representation during his time there.
“In light of the discussions taking place over social media over the past days both regarding AU Dems and the overtly racist climate that is our campus, and what I can only describe as an unsettling, disturbing, and lackluster response from certain others on this executive board, I am left with no hope for the future of this organization as it stands,” Bastida said in his statement.
Bastida said in the interview that the group's leaders should apologize for their ""history and past actions.""
Bastida said that he coordinated his resignation with Edu Nogues, the former chief of staff. Following the resignations of other board members, Bastida said that he questions how genuine they are. He said he feels as though the resignations are in response to the controversy and “not necessarily in response to the wrongdoing of those individuals and other individuals in the organization.”
Nogues said in his statement that while he joined Bastida in his resignation, he knows that Martino recognizes the challenges that the club faces, and he is optimistic about the future of the club. In an interview with The Eagle, though, he said that there were many instances when the board members could have made changes but chose not to.
“Don’t get me wrong, the e-board tried to improve it many times,” Nogues said. “But after every statement that came out in order to make the club more diverse and address race issues, I kept getting calls, messages and complaints telling me that the statements are performative.” 
The most concerning thing, Nogues said, is that when the board was hiring the new campaign directors, it took on only white students for the role, despite multiple students of color applying for the four positions.
“It felt like we were making a lot of statements, but when we had an actual chance, we weren’t doing anything about it,” Nogues said.
In an Instagram post on Tuesday, AU’s Black Student Union announced it was canceling its Summer of Justice partnership with College Democrats following criticism of AU Dems from Black students on social media. The organization urged AU Dems to look within the club and address its problematic history, instead of hiding behind BSU's efforts. 
BSU did not respond to a request for comment. 
Thrisha Mohan, a rising sophomore at AU, was part of a group of people who were considering running for the executive board in the spring. While she ultimately decided not to run, Zuby Chowdhury, who’s Asian American, ran for president and lost by a small margin to Martino. 
Mohan said in an interview that both she and Chowdhury applied for a campaign director position. However, despite Chowdhury losing in a runoff election by 5 percentage points, and other qualified applicants being people of color, none of them received the position. 
After expressing grievances on social media, Aaditi Narayanan, the former diversity, equity and inclusion director, set up a phone call with Mohan to discuss how to improve diversity. Mohan said that the call seemed pointless, given that the organization had an opportunity to give leadership to people of color, but chose not to.
“My point to them was that I am not sure nor do I care why they made that decision, but the fact that they did is exclusionary toward a lot of qualified POC candidates, which is reflective of the organization as a whole and a problem that they knew had existed prior,” Mohan said.
Chowdhury said in an interview with The Eagle that from the moment she became a campaign fellow for the organization prior to her run for president, she was exposed to the toxicity of AU College Democrats.
“As soon as I took the position of fellow, it started going downhill for me because it was the most ridiculous grunt work position ever,” Chowdhury said. “Having really excited students who are intelligent and capable of doing a lot of things for an organization that is supposed to be progressive, just doing fundraising research was really demeaning in my eyes.”
The issues within the club became more and more apparent to her once she decided to run for president, Chowdhury said, and she heard from many people that the club is not a safe space for people of color.
Diamond Terrell, who served as AU College Democrats’ vice president from May to September 2019, said in a message to The Eagle that, as the only Black woman on the board at that time, she was constantly faced with tone policing, condescension and disrespect. She resigned from the role when she realized that the “organization was past the point of reform.” 
“Despite my calls for changing the organization from within, there was no direct action; it has all been performative,” Terrell wrote. “Historically, the organization has made little to no effort to diversify their ranks beyond white feminists, lacking intersectionality at every turn.”
Terrell added that she hoped students would recognize the flaws in the group, instead of supporting it for its past partnerships with Black student organizations. 
“I don’t want my words to get misconstrued, so let me make it clear: more than ever now, multicultural groups on campus are the organizations that need to be most supported,” Terrell wrote.
Issues with representation also extend to the national organization of College Democrats of America. In an open letter to the group published on Tuesday, state federations, called for the immediate resignation of the current president and demanded that people of color will serve and be represented on the next national board.
Bastida said that resignations within AU Dems leadership are necessary to make way for students of color to serve. He said that former board members should not run again. 
“The other resignations that have transpired [Tuesday] morning and that will likely come, I really cannot speak as to their motives,” Bastida said. “However, I am confident in mine and that I am leaving a system that is built to benefit white students.”

2020-07-08,AU,club,"Independent bookstores across the District can now reopen their brick and mortar stores as D.C. enters phase two of operating during COVID-19. However, over the past few months of quarantine, many local stores have adjusted to online-only formats with creative ways to provide books and seminars to customers worldwide.
Capitol Hill Books, situated in Eastern Market, has been selling “Grab Bags” of books. Customers can fill out a form detailing their budget and favorite genres. The store’s booksellers will then compile a collection of books to ship or pick up at the store.
According to Capitol Hill Books co-owner Kyle Burk, the “Grab Bags” saved the store. Several thousands have been ordered from California to Italy, Burk added.
Burk said that the store was “scrambling” when it first switched to operating virtually. The store’s inventory is “90 percent used books,” Burk said, so it’s been tough getting new inventory to fulfill such a large amount of orders. Burk said that Capitol Hill Books repurposed its warehouse so that it only contains new book orders to house any books that need to be shipped.
At the start of quarantine, Burk said there were two genres of books people ordered: escapist fantasy and mystery novels or historical nonfiction books about diseases. 
“You see how people deal with everything that’s been going on,” Burk said.
Other local stores have implemented similar gift package initiatives.
East City Bookshop, also located near Eastern Market, started selling “Stay at Home Surprise Packs.” Customers can fill out this form and select a pack ranging in price from $50, $75 to $100. After filling out supplemental information about the recipient’s desired gifts, the pack will be shipped full of stationery, art supplies, toys and more. 
The packages were created to sell non-book merchandise and help profits, said Emilie Sommer, a bookseller with East City Bookshop. Sommer added that these packages have been successful and have shipped across the country.
“This is a time where people need care packages and pick-me-ups,” Sommer said, referencing the gifts’ success.
The shop has also continued virtual book clubs and speakers that have been reaching more people. Before the store closed, the new fiction book club had about 20 people attending in person, and last week the meeting had 33 people join the Zoom call, Sommer said.
“Local bookstores rely on people being in the stores,” Sommer said. East City Bookshop was founded to make a physical space in the community where neighbors could meet neighbors and get personal book recommendations, Sommer said. She hopes that people will continue to buy from these stores so their neighborhoods can survive.
Though some independent bookstores are seeing the support of online and phone orders in the thousands, Brad Graham, the co-owner of Politics and Prose, located in Northwest D.C., The Wharf and Union Market, warns that these stores are still struggling. For his stores, Graham said revenues are down 50 percent and that there are no profits.
Politics and Prose saw a surge of online and phone orders at the start of quarantine, Graham said, but he wasn’t sure they’d be fulfilled. The number of sales exceeded the volume typically seen around the holidays in December, which Graham said is the busiest. Politics and Prose didn’t have the infrastructure to meet such high demands in the middle of a pandemic, so the store has been using costlier and more inefficient methods to meet demands, Graham said.
“Booksellers became bookshippers,” Graham said of his employees. “We’ve routed our store phone to connect callers to employees’ phones at home so they can help make orders.” 
Graham said that, despite the telework, some employees have been furloughed.
Because profits and revenue have dropped, Graham said there’s more desire to reopen the stores, which is scheduled for July 6 for the Chevy Chase location and July 7 for the Union Market and Wharf locations. But Graham said he still is expecting depressed sales as people continue to exercise caution regarding public shopping.
Politics and Prose has continued virtually offering their author talk series “P&P Live!” as well as classes. These events are having larger turnouts than they would have if held in person, Graham said, because they’re now accessible across the country.
Despite that, Graham said he’s not sure the sentiment for supporting local bookstores will last.
“I hope people realize the utility and importance of independent bookstores … and that means supporting them,” Burk said.
Bookstores are still seeing demand, Graham said, but it’s just a matter of becoming more efficient. Without small business loans from the federal government, Graham said Politics and Prose could not have sustained itself. 
“Right now, it’s a matter of survival,” Graham said.

Local fitness centers near American University are grappling with new challenges since D.C. entered Phase Two of reopening. Phase Two allows gyms and fitness studios to reopen with limited capacity to allow for social distancing.  
Face covering requirements are still required under Phase Two guidelines, especially in indoor locations.
Near AU, most gyms are open in some capacity, but Jacobs Fitness Center is temporarily closed, and the center’s hours are no longer listed on AU’s website. With AU’s decision to go fully online for the fall semester, the Jacobs Fitness Center is unlikely to reopen before the spring semester. 
Although CorePower Yoga’s Tenleytown location is closed, the studio has offered a free online service, since businesses had to shut down due to the pandemic. Studio memberships are frozen and will be renewed once the studios are allowed to reopen fully. On their website, CorePower Yoga lists their standards for reopening, including social distancing and regular sanitization. In addition, they list which of their studios in the country have reopened. CorePower Yoga notifies customers by email if there are any changes, as they indicate on their FAQ page. 
Barre3 in Spring Valley normally offers full-body workout classes, with low-impact movements, according to their website. Social media posts indicate that they are holding outdoor classes at alternative locations, such as Audi Field, D.C. United’s home stadium. Other classes, as indicated on social media, are online through Zoom. Their website lists an option for free trials, including  online workouts and challenges. 
Crunch Fitness in Chevy Chase is offering limited classes at its facility, and their hour-long Vinyasa Yoga class is held Sunday at 11:15 a.m. Other classes, like their Super Sculpt, Chisel and Zumba classes, are 45 minutes long on Monday. Crunch Fitness, located at 5100 Wisconsin Ave. NW, has also arranged their equipment so that everyone can social distance and have their own workout space indoors.
“Our gym is 15,000 square feet and it’s pretty open and spacious, so even with the mayor’s limit of five per 1,000 capacity, we haven’t had any problems,” said Nancy Terry, the senior vice president of marketing at US Fitness Holdings, LLC, in an email.
Increased cleaning efforts have been put in place since Crunch Fitness reopened. 
“We installed airPHX, an air filtration and sanitation system that kills germs, microbes and viruses, 24 hours a day on all surfaces and equipment in the club,” Terry said. “In addition, we’re taking the temperatures of everyone who enters the club.” 
Even with physical classes operating under the city’s guidelines, Crunch Fitness is still offering online classes for those who choose to stay at home. 
“It’s helped thousands of members stay fit and active during the closure, along with our Facebook live classes,” Terry said.

2020-09-03,AU,club,"American University’s student activity fee, which provides funding for student-run organizations, was reduced by 30 percent for the fall semester as online classes and a lack of in-person events reduce its use by students.
Instead of paying the usual $88.50 fee, students are now required to pay $62. Many organizations that depend on the fee said they aren’t worried about having enough money to provide virtual experiences to students over the next few months. 
“There definitely is enough money, and we made sure that when we made the decision to reduce the fee that it wouldn't impact clubs negatively,” said Daniel Cohen, the finance director for AU Club Council, which provides support and funding for on-campus clubs.
The fee reduction was voted on by the Budget Advisory Committee, which is made up of members from Student Government, Club Council and Student Media Board. After deciding the amount of the reduction, the committee gave a recommendation to the University so the reduction could be approved. 
While activities will be entirely virtual, organizations will still need funding to cover events like hosting speakers or other virtual experiences, which is why the fee was not eliminated entirely.
Typically, Student Government, which includes the Kennedy Political Union, Women’s Initiative and Student Union Board, receives about half of the money from the fee, while the other 50 percent is split between Club Council and Student Media Board. SG’s budget was increased by three percent this year. 
According to SG Comptroller Justin Levine, who oversees the organization’s finances, $158,000 are left in the SG budget from last year, and $118,000 of that surplus is available to be spent. 
SG was advised not to spend all of the rollover money so they can allow for “wiggle room” for future semesters, Levine said. 
Levine said the organization will still be in a good financial position to operate this year, and it’s willing to assist Club Council and Student Media if they need more funding. 
Chloe K. Li, a co-chair of the Student Media Board, said the main adjustments this semester for student media organizations are the reductions in stipends for some positions and the absence of an in-person media release party at the end of the semester. In Fall 2019, the media release party cost $700, which is an increase from previous years in part due to a higher price for food. 
According to Li, the current estimate for stipend reductions is 51 percent. 
Unlike the other groups that receive student activity fee funds, the Student Media Board is being advised to spend the leftover money from last semester since they usually have more money left over than other organizations in a typical semester. Li said she does not expect student media organizations to face any real financial struggles.
“It's just a way to make sure that we're actually spending our money and not just holding it from the student body and using it for things that we need.” Li said. 
Li anticipates that student media organizations will primarily need funding for expenses such as editing software, as students are left without access to expensive equipment they can access on campus. 
“It's less that we had a cut in budgets and more the fact that COVID-19 is happening so there's restricted access to the campus. That's going to be the issue for student media this semester,” Li said.
In the past, changes to the student activity fee have been controversial, with a referendum to raise it in Fall 2018 failing by a significant margin. However, according to Levine, this semester’s fee reduction is not likely to be permanent. 
“I think we have to let this semester run its course because obviously there has been in recent years, contentious debates on pricing and raising and lowering [the] student activity fee,” Levine said.

Since American University announced on July 30 that classes would be fully online and freshmen and sophomores would no longer be living on campus, the Class of 2024 has met friends in different ways than previous classes. 
In this era, social media has played a huge role in helping people meet each other and connect virtually.
“The very first way I made friends was Instagram; that was my main way of doing it all summer, especially the freshman Instagram page,” said Malik Gupta, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs.
There are several American University Class of 2024 social media accounts, including a Facebook page, an Instagram page and a GroupMe chat. 
On the AU Class of 2024 Instagram page, students post information about themselves in a comment, such as where they are from or what they like to do, along with some photos. Students tag their own Instagram account so they can connect with other freshmen.
“People have reached out to me through social media and have DMed me, and I’ve met up with people who live in the area [New England], since I didn’t go down to D.C. and I know a lot of freshmen have,” said Erin Glosner, a freshman in the School of International Service. 
Outside of social media, some freshmen said that Zoom breakout rooms during class have been another way to make friends. Students said they often exchange phone numbers or social media handles.
“I am gonna become reliant on the teacher really pushing these friendships or relationships,” Gupta said.
Otherwise, students have had to take it upon themselves in their classes to make friends and meet new people. 
“I just had to go out of my way and slide into other people’s private messages on Zoom,” said Ali Feder, a freshman in the School of Communication and SPA.
AU hosted an involvement fair on Aug. 27, which allowed freshmen to join new clubs, but it also became an outlet for freshmen to meet their peers with fellow interests, connect with older students and get a better sense of AU students. 
Glosner attended the involvement fair and joined CHAARG, a club that focuses on empowering women physically, mentally and emotionally. The club describes itself as a community of women who support one another and do at-home workouts together.
“I would say [CHAARG] has helped me meet new people and make friends because we do small groups, and we workout together,” Glosner said. “We just chat sometimes and then we have a bunch of group chats.”
While some freshmen have successfully met new people and made friends through these unconventional means, Gupta said that there is still some fear of not knowing what will happen when they return to campus.
“Trying to take these virtual relationships, people I have never met or anything, and turn it into something that can translate into in-person, I think that’s going to be the really hard part about this,” Gupta said.

Any athlete understands the level of discipline that it takes to get out and train, but it was made even more difficult with American University’s decision to hold the fall semester entirely online. Now, with postponed sports seasons and a lack of widespread access to on-campus gyms, it is harder than ever to find a reason to exercise. Still, AU students have found ways to keep moving.
Freshman Ally Fox was motivated by an advertisement for the Nov. 7 Delaware Canal Half Marathon. Fox said that the upcoming race is a much-needed sense of structure since she was unable to join any on-campus running clubs. 
“It’s really hard to get yourself up, that’s why I signed up for a half marathon,” Fox said. “Even though running is one of the few things that keep me mentally sane, I [felt] like [I was] training for nothing.”
Not only was the race something to work for, it also provided a sense of redemption.
“I have a long history of injury issues, and as soon as I started recovering from them, my [high school track] season got cut off last spring,” Fox said. “I have a lot of anger towards losing my last season because I was in the best shape of my life, and I was really ready to run fast.”
In accordance with coronavirus protocol, Fox will wear a face covering at both the start and finish and will run at a distance from others. 
“It’s going to be different, but it’s something, and it’s really helpful, so I’m using that as a way to keep going,” Fox said.
With two years of high school cross-country experience and six to seven days of training every week, Fox has ambitious goals to place in the first spot of her age group, running just over 8 minutes per mile.
“I just want to go accomplish something and feel good,” Fox said.
Training for her half marathon has not been a linear process. During her time in quarantine, Fox got injured again and took a two-month break from running. Fox stressed the importance of finding a balance between exercising and knowing when to back off.
“I realized my daily schedule was so messed up,” Fox said. “I would go to bed at 6 a.m. and wake up at 2 [p.m.] because I had nothing to do. As soon as I stopped running, I lost all sense of structure.”
When she was able to run again, Fox said that everything fell back into place.
For CAS freshman Caleb Farris, being a member of the AU swim team keeps him motivated to exercise regularly from his home in Austin, Texas.
Farris attends swim practices every other day after classes and works out at his local gym three times a week. His practices take place at an outdoor pool, with a maximum of two swimmers per lane and 50 percent capacity to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although AU’s fall swimming championships were canceled, Farris has not lost motivation to stay in shape.
“I’m really competitive,” Farris said. “I want to be better at what I do.”
Like Fox, Farris also has high hopes for his athletic future. He aspires to be able to run a mile in under five and a half minutes, and wants to make the 2024 Olympic trials, he said. 
Freshman Kristina Kaufman has an ambitious morning routine to stay active. She wakes up early three days a week to get to the gym in her hometown of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, by 7 a.m. There, Kaufman and her friend work on either their legs, chest or arms.
“I’m more active than I used to be,” Kaufman said. “I’m definitely happy that I’m finally able to [exercise] because I wanted to but never had time with high school.”
She said that the gym she frequents limits customers to three appointments per week, and that everyone is given an individual station complete with a set of weights and a bench. Even at low capacity with a fair amount of restrictions in place, Kaufman has noticed a change in her mental well-being.
Kaufman, a dancer up until this year, hopes to gain arm strength and muscle definition through her workouts, and she is training to be able to do a pull-up. She also goes on weekly three-mile runs with her father.
Likewise, junior health promotion major Gillian Gulley is always on the move. She said that she works out six days a week, which is no surprise since she founded AU CHAARG, a women’s health and fitness club. She has stayed active during quarantine by running, playing soccer with her friends and walking.
Always passionate about the benefits of exercising, Gulley wanted to create a club that embodied fitness and healthy lifestyles.
“[AU CHAARG] definitely helps college students get healthier,” Gulley said. “It’s really hard to keep yourself in shape during college, especially in freshman year.”
This semester, AU CHAARG is holding weekly group workouts over Zoom, including yoga and full body core strength exercises.

2020-11-11,AU,club,"Editor's Note: This article appeared in The Eagle's October 2020 virtual print edition. 
When it comes to the effect the coronavirus pandemic has had on college athletics, the primary focus has been placed on NCAA Division I programs who have had their seasons canceled or delayed. However, they are not the only athletes stuck in “wait and see” mode.
The Club Sports program at American University is home to 28 teams, offering everything from baseball to ultimate frisbee for students interested in starting up a new sport or continuing with one they’ve played before. But in March, the school cut the spring season short and sent the student body home. Seven months, no plan and no fall season later, students are still uncertain about the immediate future of club sports.
For Lucy Elliott, a senior and captain for the women’s ultimate frisbee team, the cancelation of the team’s spring season stung the team’s seniors the most. Spring is usually their most competitive season, and it was an upsetting missed opportunity to compete in sectionals, regionals and potentially nationals, if they advanced far enough. 
“AU pretty consistently makes it to regionals, but not nationals,” Elliott said. “So that was very upsetting for our seniors to not be able to compete and see how well we could have done through spring last season.”
The ultimate frisbee team was only able to compete in one of their three regular season tournaments, a home tournament that was hosted on the National Mall. 
“That was a great tournament,” Elliott said. “We got second place at it, and we were definitely looking forward to an upward trajectory.” 
AU’s club women’s rugby team was also only able to compete once before the University went fully online, playing one game against Catholic University that they won 39-5. Senior and team President Gillian Chestnut remembers when AU first made classes online for just three weeks and members still had hopes of coming back to campus and competing in April.
“First, it was a lot of planning, because that would cut out a chunk of our season and we would still have stuff when we came back,” Chestnut said. “So it was very much ‘will it be safe by then? Will we still want to have a season?’ It was very stressful, with a lot of planning and not having any details because club sports didn’t have anything to give us.”
With the spring season cut short, the waiting game to see how the fall season would play out began. It took until July 30 for AU to announce it would go fully online for the fall semester, two weeks after AU and the Patriot League decided to cancel the fall sports season. For both rugby and ultimate frisbee, planning for the fall semester without knowing what was coming took a lot of preparation.
A seasonless semester has led to innovation from each team’s leadership as they look to keep up team camaraderie and stay fit in case the sport does eventually come back. This includes Zoom practices, strategy sessions and track workouts with nearby teammates.
Kaitlyn Hepburn, a senior and one of the captains of the rugby team, has prioritized keeping rookies engaged with the team. For a lot of them, this was their first time playing this new, high-contact sport. And after learning the ins and outs of the game in the fall, the spring season would be their time to show what they’ve got.
“For a lot of the fall season, they were learning as much as they could, but the real time to shine for most rookies comes in the spring because you’ve been practicing so long and you’re ready finally,” Hepburn said. “It hurt because I remember being a rookie, and you try so hard to learn a new sport, and that’s like your time to shine. They didn’t get as much of that.”
While keeping the current team together throughout uncertainty has been a huge priority, recruiting, and gauging interest has also been important, even with no clear guarantee of when the next game or tournament will take place.
But even with attempts at keeping team chemistry up through virtual events and practices, players still feel that the old community aspect of the team is missing.
If there is a chance of restarting in the spring, it may not be the same for all sports. For a sport like ultimate frisbee that is considered low or no contact, they could have a chance to restart their season earlier than others. Adding the Oct. 26 announcement, which detailed the new spring 2021 class plan, the possibility of sports returning in the spring has heightened.
A physical sport like rugby, however, would likely be much harder to pull off than others if a restart were to happen next semester. But there is still cautious optimism and enthusiasm to get back on the field and compete with high levels of intensity. 
“USA Rugby, which is our overarching rulemaker, has put out rules and guidelines on social distancing and what practices should look like,” Hepburn said. “We are going to be excited if we go back, but we have to keep in mind what our reality is and how we have to function in that contact.” 
No matter what the immediate future holds for AU’s Club Sports programs, the impact they have had on the players who have been a part of their community is clear.
“I haven’t even thought about it as club sports,” Hepburn said. “Since the beginning of my time at AU, 90 percent of my friends are in rugby. It’s that close of a community. Those are the people that I found. No matter what situation we’ve been in, we’ve always been so supportive and interconnected. It’s honestly the coolest thing I’ve ever done.”

2020-11-12,AU,club,"Muskan Kaur left Alpha Xi Delta, a women's fraternity, in fall 2019.
Editor's Note, correction and clarification: This article appeared in The Eagle's October 2020 virtual print edition. It has been corrected with the proper spelling of Alexandra Weed’s name and clarified to state that the Panhellenic Council recruitment registration fee was waived until the end of the year. 
After allegations of racism, colorism and sexual assault in the social Greek life community at American University surfaced this summer, many students disaffiliated from sororities and fraternities on campus, with women of color speaking out about the issues they faced while involved in the majority- white organizations.
Beginning in the summer, social media posts exposing racism and sexual assault allegations on multiple Instagram pages circulated throughout the student body. Many posts said social Greek life was responsible for perpetuating rape culture and racism on campus, with students sharing their allegations anonymously.
Students on social media pressured people within social Greek life to take action, which resulted in the disaffiliation of all members of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity chapter at AU and the resignations of all executive board members of the Alpha Xi Delta AU fraternity chapter.
Social Greek life has historically been majority white at AU and at other predominantly white institutions. Some students of color find community within the organizations represented in the Intercultural Greek Collective (IGC). Cultural clubs and organizations are also available for students to find community.
The police and citizen killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and many other Black Americans led to an eruption of protests throughout the summer. They also led to a reckoning with racism for institutions across the country, including for historically white social Greek organizations.
Many women of color, who were once a part of these organizations, said being in an environment where they did not feel welcome was toxic. The following stories from women of color are not a full representation of AU community members who say they have been harmed by social Greek life, but are rather a sample of voices who have chosen to speak out. Multiple members have claimed to face homophobia, transphobia and anti-Black racism as well.
In fall 2019, now-junior Ruby Avila chose to disaffiliate from Alpha Chi Omega, a women’s fraternity, due to a lack of diversity and financial aid within social Greek life. Avila said she joined the organization her freshman year to make new friends, but soon felt there was not a place for her.“No one looked like me, no one had the financial status like me, and the people who did, I became friends with them, but they quickly dropped as well,” Avila said.
Alpha Chi Omega chapter President Alexandra Weed wrote in an email to The Eagle that the chapter has created leadership positions focused on DEI efforts.
“Our hope is that all members feel welcomed and valued as a part of their experience and we work to maintain inclusion and equity in all that we do,” Weed wrote. “These positions are responsible for promoting an inclusive environment through educational events, presentations, and workshops for both members and prospective members.""
Weed added that the chapter offers grants and scholarships, which can support members with financial need.
Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council (IFC) organizations require members to pay dues each semester. While some offer scholarships, financial aid for college expenses cannot cover dues. 
The Panhellenic Council recruitment registration fee was waived until the end of the year, according to Travis Roberts, assistant director of Fraternity and Sorority Life at AU. 
""After this, and until registration closes, they are only charging $5, which is the amount we get charged to use the software system,"" Roberts wrote in an email to The Eagle.
Affordability and representation issues also caused senior Muskan Kaur to leave Alpha Xi Delta, a women’s fraternity, in fall 2019. Kaur, who is a founding member and director of the Abolish Panhellenic + IFC group at AU, rushed during the spring of her freshman year. After rushing, Kaur later felt a growing sense of disbelonging.
“I saw a lot of colorism,” Kaur said. “My big [sorority sister] was a darker shade of brown than me and was treated so differently.”
After reflecting on what she saw and experienced in her own organization, she said that sororities did not represent Black women or women with darker skin. Realizing that she and others were complicit, she co-founded the Abolish Panhellenic + IFC chapter at AU.
The chapter’s mission to abolish social Greek life at AU began with a petition that garnered thousands of signatures overnight. Students across the country also started chapters at their own universities.
The group says that reform is not enough to rid social Greek organizations of incidents of racism, homophobia, transphobia, elitism and sexual violence.
“People have reached out to me and said that I was a woman of color empowered by her sorority but I just got lucky while others were not given that opportunity,” Kaur said. “No one should have to get lucky to feel empowered.”
Kennedy Political Union Director Amrutha Chatty, a senior who disaffiliated from Phi Sigma Sigma this past summer, said that she entered her sorority leadership ready to make reforms from the top-down; however, she had her own experiences with being misnamed.
Chatty, who is South Asian, said that with a handful of other South Asian members in the sorority, there were multiple instances when she was called the wrong name and mixed up with another South Asian member, even after being a member for multiple years and rising to the role of an executive board member.
The chapter did not respond for comment at the time of publication.
“In general, the entire system of Greek life is built to marginalize people and keep people of color out,” Chatty said.
Simrnjit Seerha, a senior, also disaffiliated from Phi Sigma Sigma over the summer after hearing multiple stories regarding the culture of social Greek life on social media coupled with her own experiences.
“My initial uncomfortability stemmed from being a first-generation American college student and also a person of color, having a different religion, a different culture, even a different first language,"" Seerha said. “I was putting so much effort into connecting with people, more so than white members.”
Seerha said that after joining the sorority, she was determined to make a change from within by joining the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion council and e-board.
“I really wanted to change the structure, but it was beyond my capacity,” Seerha said. “While a lot of people genuinely wanted to make change, it was more performative than not.”
Seerha and Chatty said their decision to leave Phi Sigma Sigma was made clear after they saw an anonymous post alleging that one of the organization’s members, former Panhellenic Council President Bella Dixon Smith, used a racist slur at a fraternity party. After apologizing on social media, but refusing to step down, she ultimately resigned the next day.
Dixon Smith said she could not be interviewed by The Eagle due to National Panhellenic Conference guidelines. The conference did not respond for comment at the time of publication.
“The fact that the Panhellenic president can do that and face no consequences goes to show what a deep rooted issue that we have,” Seerha said.
In an email to The Eagle, Acting Panhellenic President Anna Waldman said none of the seven Panhellenic organizations at AU are participating in recruitment for the fall 2020 semester. Formal spring recruitment will be held entirely online.
Senior Prachi Jhawar said she disaffiliated from sorority Sigma Kappa after one semester. She felt that Greek life was contributing to a culture of harm on campus and that leaving was the only option.
""I felt like I was constantly bringing up this conversation about racism and others would acknowledge it but not really move forward with it,” Jhawar said of her interactions with nationals.
Sigma Kappa nationals did not respond to The Eagle’s request for comments by time of publication.
Kaur said since beginning the Abolish Panhellenic + IFC chapter, the coalition has gained national attention from students, former Greek alumni and parents. She said various nonprofits have contacted the group to offer resources and assistance.
The coalition is currently running social media campaigns to raise awareness about the harms caused by Greek life. They recently held a week of action in which they encouraged students to email administrators and post to social media in support of the movement.
However, for sorority or fraternity chapters to disband their charter, official documentation that recognizes a university chapter, must be revoked by the University or nationals must decide to abolish it. If all members of a sorority or fraternity leave the chapter it can still be revived by Nationals at any moment.
Despite these barriers, some students continue to push for drastic measures to address the harm faced by women of color within social Greek life organizations.
“At a school like AU which prides itself on having spaces that are inclusive for everyone, social Greek life should not exist,” Jhawar said. “It’s not about the chapter itself or the people itself, it’s about the power and privilege and this system for upholding social and economic power for some people and suppressing it for others.""

2020-12-02,AU,club,"Comfort Foods is a Life section series highlighting AU students and the food that reminds them of home and heritage.
On any normal day of the year, it’s rather hard to tell that my father is from the South. His Southern charm is mostly obscured by the gruff habits required of someone who has been living in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado since 1996.
His cowboy hat, boots and habitually full beard are definitely more “Western ranch” than the gentlemanly habits of the country clubs he grew up around. He wears earrings with thick pearls wedged in the eight-gauge stainless steel hoops and a stud nose piercing. A thick pendant hangs around his neck — usually Thor’s hammer, Mjölnir, based on an ancient design, so think original Norse myths, not Chris Hemsworth. Generally, even I wouldn’t peg my dad as born and raised in Georgia. However, there’s one small exception: his cooking. 
The holidays in particular bring out my dad's Southern roots. Every year, an entire Smithfield ham hock makes its way from Virginia to our rural town’s post office. That’s when I know that the holidays have officially begun.
Turkey is usually the centerpiece of most families’ Thanksgiving dinners, but the salted ham has always been the center of ours. The product is hand-salted and dry-cured before it is smoked over hardwood and seasoned with black pepper. 
My dad likes to say a Smithfield ham is like a Bordeaux wine, which can only come from Bordeaux, France. To be a Smithfield Ham it must be cured in Smithfield, Virginia. The name is inseparable from the product.
A salted Smithfield ham teeters gloriously on incredibly salty. To curb the flavor, the ham slices are cut extraordinarily thin like prosciutto.
One of my first memories of the holiday season is standing in the kitchen, shoulder to shoulder with my sister, giggling as my dad protested our small, eager hands stealing the thin slices of ham as fast as he could slice them.
We’ll eat off of the 12-pound ham leg for breakfast or as a sandwich all the way to the New Year. What is left over is cut into small portions, vacuum-sealed and frozen, and will be used to make more Southern fair throughout the year like collard greens and black-eyed peas.  
My father always said that black-eyed peas cooked with salted ham should be your first meal in the New Year because it brings good luck. I wouldn’t say I’m a superstitious person, but every year we eat black-eyed peas and salted ham, hoping to bring a little bit of luck into the new year.

2021-02-11,AU,club,"Latinx and American Student Organization (LASO) is continuing to adapt to a virtual environment by hosting online events and sponsoring speakers via Zoom, according to junior Campbell Urrutia, the club’s co-president.
LASO co-sponsored several events via Zoom in the fall semester, including one with the Kennedy Political Union on Sept. 10, featuring former Sec. of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro.
The club also hosted “A Conversation on Anti-Blackness in the Latinx Community,” featuring Olga Pabón, a curriculum and instruction supervisor at Prince George’s County Public Schools, and AU professor Noemí Enchautegui-de-Jesús on Sept. 16. LASO co-sponsored the event with the American University League of United Latin American Citizens. 
Urrutia, who joined LASO his freshman year and became a member of the club’s executive board his second semester, said that LASO uses “Latinx” in the club’s name because of its inclusivity.
“We are an organization centered around creating a safe space and a home away from home for all members of the Latinx community at AU,” Urrutia said. “Our mission is to advocate for and educate about important issues in our communities — in D.C., nationwide and abroad — all while trying to create a space where we can celebrate and uplift the diverse experiences within our community.”
Despite limitations due to coronavirus, LASO was still able to hold club meetings in the fall semester via Zoom.
“Something that [the executive board] definitely noticed is that a lot of organizations are struggling to get a draw on Zoom events,” Urrutia said. “Typically, our general-body meetings would pull about 40 to 50 people, and on Zoom events, it’s … typically around 20 to 30.”
Urrutia said the involvement fair is typically one of the best ways for LASO to recruit new members. However, the number of students who joined LASO’s session at the involvement fair has gone down, due to it being conducted virtually in both the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, he said. 
In spite of the difficulties, the club has big plans for the spring semester. LASO launched the first edition of its weekly newsletter on Feb. 2, which is sent out to club members. The group will also host an upcoming event this semester featuring AU World Languages and Cultures professor Juliana Martinez on the topic of toxic masculinity in the Latinx community.
Urrutia emphasized the importance of hosting enough events for LASO members to enjoy participating in the club, but not so many that they are overwhelmed after already spending so much time online.
While Urrutia enjoys the social aspect of LASO, he said learning about the experiences of those with a different background is the best takeaway from his time in the club. 
“We try really hard to be open to people that aren’t in the mainstream Latinx identity,” Urrutia said. “Getting to learn about and experience different parts of the diaspora through LASO is really, really valuable to me.”

2021-02-12,AU,club,"THE EAGLE
Despite closing campus due to coronavirus concerns, American University’s athletic department made the decision to continue athletics in some capacity. The athletic department’s announcement of a shutdown on Feb. 5, however, indicates that the safety of athletes, staff and the surrounding community is likely threatened by the travel and the inevitable close contact in most sports. Despite this threat, communication remains scarce, and there is insufficient understanding of what safety measures are in place. The University has a responsibility to question its COVID-19 procedures for the athletic department during this shutdown brought on by an increase in cases. 
The Eagle Editorial Board wants to make clear that it does not speak for the athletes.
The most apparent issue that this shutdown brings up for discussion is transparency. Student athletes, whether they live on or off campus, have an impact on the people that live and work around them. If they live on campus, they interact with other students and staff. Those that live off campus come into contact with families, neighbors and anybody in the surrounding D.C. community. These people all have a stake in the COVID-19 safety procedures that athletes follow, arguably even moreso as athletes travel and interact with people from different schools. Still, the University’s athletic department has remained largely silent on what rules are in place for athletes beyond regular testing. 
The University has failed to outline the real benefits of endangering athletes, staff and anyone who comes in contact with them by allowing athletics to continue this semester. It’s important to note that COVID-19 spread within AU’s athletic programs impacts a broader community. AU, or even the Patriot League, does not have the infrastructure or resources of a national sports league to create a secure bubble, employ daily testing and enforce rigorous guidelines. When the professional leagues are experiencing outbreaks, how can college-level sports put various groups of people at risk by attempting to carry on with their seasons? Is this risk worth playing a handful of games that keep getting postponed?
Boston University is requiring basketball teams to wear masks while playing. The AU community needs to know if the administration and the athletic department has entertained that discussion. Still, if players have to go to the lengths of wearing a mask, or two according to CDC recommendations, should they be playing at all? The University has not offered up a valid reason to routinely expose athletes to the threat of illness. Even if sports do continue, the department must reevaluate its policies to protect the health of the community.
COVID-19 has resulted in endless lifestyle adjustments. AU students graduated college in their childhood homes, theatre majors put on capstone performances over Zoom, clubs and organizations were forced fully online these past months, and yet, the University continues to engage with in-person athletic events. Obviously, there is no way to hold basketball games online, but we have all adjusted for our own safety and for the sake of public health. Why are sports more worth it than any of these other areas? 
The 10-day shutdown imposed by AU’s athletic department is reflective of an administration that does not have enough control. The COVID-19 guidelines for athletes not only affect the athletes themselves, but also students and staff on campus and the surrounding D.C. community. AU needs to justify the continuation of athletics for the semester and provide a clear line of communication that helps people understand their risk of getting sick. If the University does not have the resources to make this work in a safe way, it must explain its next steps to AU athletes and the entire AU population.

“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar” is bright, tropical and often downright outrageous, relying on bizzare and sometimes banal humor to entertain. Starring and written by Kirsten Wiig and Annie Mumolo, it marks a mediocre comeback following the success of their first collaboration, “Bridesmaids.” 
The film follows two women, Star (Wiig) and Barb (Mumolo), as they attempt to reconnect with their inner “shimmer” through an impromptu visit to Vista Del Mar, Florida. Perhaps drawing inspiration from the “Austin Powers” franchise, the film’s antagonist, Sharon Gordon Fisherman, is also played by Wiig. Sharon’s subplot is relatively detached from the plights of Star and Barb. Rather predictably, the plots collide once Sharon’s employee Edgar (Jamie Dornan) begins a romantic relationship with Star.
Prior to becoming involved with Star, Edgar had long-held feelings for Sharon. He spends the beginning of the film repeating his desire to become an ‘official couple’ with her; his redundant use of this phrase is probably one of the most humorous aspects of the script. While it is quite a departure from his previous work, Dornan proves to be a strong comedic performer.
No matter where they go, Star and Barb feel strangely anachronistic in their space. The film uses dialogue and dynamics to set them apart from their social environment, making it clear that they don’t blend in with others when placed in groups of people. While they can converse with each other for hours on end, they tend to seem wildly disconnected from the community that exists outside of their friendship. This choice creates an atmosphere for awkwardness, and almost any interaction with others is comedic to some degree. 
Apart from Wiig and Mumolo, the film is composed of a star-studded cast of female comedians, including Vanessa Bayer, Rose Abdoo, Phyllis Smith and Wendi McLendon-Covey in minor roles. While their appearances are brief, and could have been expanded upon, they are certainly enjoyable. 
“Barb and Star” will resonate best with an audience that enjoys odd-ball, over-the-top comedy. While quirky one-liners make up most of the script, there are also a few fully-staged musical numbers. They begin spontaneously, dramatically evolving in the style of MTV music videos. Even with the music specifically written for the movie, I believe that the best musical choice was utilizing a “My Heart Will Go On” dance remix during a clubbing scene. 
Overall, the film’s greatest asset is it’s campy quality. Exaggerated scene transitions, bright color schemes and formulaic comedy make it appeal to a wide audience. And after the year we’ve had, absurd humor is something we all could use a little more of.  
“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar” is set to release on streaming platforms Feb. 12.

2021-03-10,AU,club,"Editor’s note: Abby Longo is involved with the Sierra Club and Extinction Rebellion.
One of the most dangerous contemporary delusions is that we are conquerors of our environment. This false sentiment has palpable consequences for the future of the planet and humanity. As a product of the human fixation on the development of industrial and energy sectors, scientists have begun to question the status of the Holocene, the geological era that the Earth has maintained for the past 12,000 years. The scientific community has instead proposed the entrance of a new age, the Anthropocene, which is characterized by the disruption of the natural flow of the environment as a product of extortionate human activity. Ultimately, the planet no longer functions and maintains equilibrium as it has historically. 
The label for environmental degradation has evolved over the years, initially earning the title of global warming. However, as we learn more about the complexity of the changing climate and nomenclature continues to develop, climate change has progressed into the climate crisis. After all, that’s what it is: an emergency, and the perpetrators of the climate crisis are more tangible than you may think. 
100 energy companies are responsible for over 70 percent of emissions within the past three decades. Considering the massive reign of terror that these corporations perpetuate via environmental damage and oil extraction, we as individuals need to reevaluate our role in preserving our environment. 
While there is immense value in pursuing sustainable alternatives to longstanding habits, holistically, the climate crisis is not a result of plastic straw use and failing to reuse and recycle. It is a direct consequence of oil and coal extraction, with companies like Exxon and BP pioneering the path that will turn a vibrant planet into an uninhabitable shell. 
In 2020, as individuals around the world were mandated to quarantine themselves within their homes, global emissions only dropped by 7 percent. Essentially, massive populations of people around were no longer obligated to participate in their pollutive commute to work, and still, a major percentage of greenhouse gases were being emitted into the atmosphere, and not at the hands of the individuals following government guidelines. Individual sustainability is a noble, well-intentioned pursuit, and I don’t intend to criticize these efforts. However, I urge you to mobilize on a more global level to enact change within the structures that allow a few major corporations to defile the planet. The emphasis on the Earth as a resource rather than the acknowledgment that ecosystems have inherent worth is a consequence of our habit as people and consumers to commodify. Labeling environmental features as “resources” makes it clear that this instinct to commodify is deeply entangled within us. There is a clear framing issue here. At present, through the resource-centric lens, we care only because resources are a profit opportunity to be exploited. 
If you’re truly interested in contributing to fundamental, comprehensive environmental reform, I urge you to read about organizations within the D.C. area that host panels, disseminate petitions and campaign for political reform. The DC Sierra Club Chapter is a valuable resource, as is Extinction Rebellion DC. The DC Sierra Club has numerous campaigns within the city that work to improve energy efficiency. The group is undergoing the process of phasing out popular usage of methane in buildings. Additionally, the Sierra Club has been a vital advocate for passing legislation regarding energy and water efficiency within the city, reducing environmental consequences as well as economic injury. Along with this, the club holds public committee meetings concerning clean water, zero waste, clean energy, and smart and sustainable city growth. Similarly, Extinction Rebellion DC hosts an introductory orientation to the organization every Sunday at 1:30 p.m. for those seeking to inform and involve themselves. Both organizations have extensive resources throughout the United States as well as around the world, and a significant amount of mobilization and political leverage.
Buying from sustainably sourced brands, limiting your animal product consumption and composting are fantastic ways to reduce your carbon footprint. However, your footprint pales in comparison to that of notorious oil corporations. Coupling independent efforts with participation in larger organizations that have legislative influence and mass-mobilization capabilities are the most effective ways to approach the atrocity that is climate change.

Carrera-Goglas, una estudiante de posgrado en KOGOD, dijo que los estudiantes de todas las escuelas de AU son bienvenidos.
""Puede ser alguien que está en otra escuela y está realmente interesado en establecer contactos, escuchar sobre la comunidad latinx, y también conocer a líderes de la industria con diversos orígenes,” dijo Carrera-Goglas.
Como muchos de los miembros de KOLLAB son estudiantes internacionales, la organización también ofrece a sus miembros estadounidenses oportunidades para aprender más sobre las diversas culturas empresariales en los países latinoamericanos. Los estudiantes internacionales de origen latino también podrán aprender más acerca de la perspectiva americana respecto a los negocios, dijo Ruiz. 
Ana Quiñonez, tesorera del club y estudiante de posgrado internacional nicaragüense, se unió a KOLLAB para aprender más sobre la cultura empresarial estadounidense y al mismo tiempo compartir con sus compañeros sus experiencias comerciales en Nicaragua. 
“Para mí es una oportunidad para aprender y enseñar a las personas que no han tenido la experiencia de hacer negocios en Latinoamérica cuáles son los puntos que son similares y los puntos que son diferentes al hacer negocios [en los diferentes países],” dijo Quiñonez.
Carrera-Goglas y Ruiz fundaron el club después de expresar interés en un centro latinx en la escuela KOGOD que facilitaría oportunidades para conectar con otros estudiantes y líderes empresariales latinx. Como ambos miembros ya habían trabajado por varios años, sabían lo importante que es una comunidad de contactos profesionales sólida para los latinxs que buscan trabajo.
“No sabía lo importante que sería [tener conexiones latinx profesionales] hasta que entré a la fuerza laboral y vi [que] si quieres conseguir un trabajo en algún lugar, es mucho más fácil conseguirlo si tienes buenas conexiones profesionales,” dijo Carrera-Goglas. “Ser mujer, ser mujer de color, ser latina, puede haber incluso más barreras frente a ti, así que, cuando se me presentó esta oportunidad −le dije a Marco– sí, me quiero unir”.
Actualmente, todos los miembros de KOLLAB son estudiantes de posgrado en programas de dos años. Según Ruiz, el objetivo del primer año de la organización es construir una base sólida para que la organización pueda continuar incluso después de que la mayoría de sus miembros actuales se hayan ido.
Ambos copresidentes se han conectado con varias de las organizaciones de estudiantes más antiguas de AU para absorber todos los consejos y estrategias que éstas han utilizado para promocionar su organización y aumentar la participación de los miembros. 
Mientras que la mayoría de sus reuniones de primavera se concentraran en el reclutamiento de nuevos miembros y establecer relaciones más fuertes entre los miembros del club, KOLLAB tiene varios eventos previstos para el semestre de otoño, incluyendo estrenar una serie de discursos con líderes de negocio latinx, traer attencion al movimiento de realizar el “Día de Apoyar a Negocios Latinos” en una fiesta nacional y colaborar con pequeñas empresas latinas en el distrito. 
KOLLAB ofrece a la gran comunidad hispana y latinx de AU un espacio seguro para interactuar con otros de su comunidad y también expandir sus redes profesionales.
“Quería usar este tiempo para construir algo que [hiciera] que el campus se sintiera más como casa, y me vino a la mente que si creamos [esta organización], tal vez podría hacer que [estar en línea] sea un poco más gratificante para nosotros. [Podríamos] acercarnos como una comunidad,” dijo Ruiz.

2021-04-09,AU,club,"Editor’s note and update: Max Rubin and Maanasi Natarajan, staff columnists for The Eagle, were not involved in the reporting, writing or editing of this article. This article has been updated to state that polls have been extended, and, due to technical difficulties, ""virtual paper ballots"" have been sent out for students who were unable to complete their ballot.
With election week underway, here are the candidates for Student Government’s 2021-2022 executive board. Polls open Friday, April 9 at noon and close Sunday, April 11 at 12:45. More information from the Student Government Elections Commission about the candidates and elections can be found here. 
Due to technical difficulties with the online polls, AUSG later sent a “virtual paper ballot” to students who were unable to finish casting their ballot.
The Eagle asked candidates about their policies, goals and their plan for the expected fall return to campus after over a full year online. 
President 
The President is the chief spokesperson for SG, meeting with administration and other entities on behalf of the student body. They are also in charge of several advocacy groups, including the Community Service Coalition and Center for Advocacy and Student Equity. 
Chyna Brodie 
Brodie is a sophomore studying political science in the School of Public Affairs. Brodie’s campaign is centered around three main tenets: advocacy, community and transparency. 
According to her platform, she said she will prioritize uplifting and advocating for the voices of BIPOC students on campus, through creating a coalition of student leaders from different perspectives and communities. She also plans on improving the accessibility of mental health services for students, while also pushing for more BIPOC counselors to be hired. 
Brodie hopes to build more community at American University through an on-campus pilot program that would pair two residential floors together to create more community engagement. She also plans to hold more programming events with on-campus clubs on the quad, listing movie screenings, dances and night markets as potential events. 
She stressed that there has been a lack of transparency on behalf of the administration in making impactful decisions. If elected, Brodie says she will “fight to include students in high-level conversations affecting us,” listing grading decisions, camera policies and tuition changes as important topics to have students’ perspectives on. 
If elected, Brodie said that she will host monthly town halls with the student body, where they can voice any concerns they have. She said that students should not have to be the ones starting petitions to make changes. 
“I will fight for you, tooth-and-nail, to elevate your voices and raise these concerns to the University,” Brodie said when outlining her future plans. 
Brodie was unavailable for an interview, so her policies and plans have been sourced from her campaign’s social media pages and public announcements.
Ishita Jamar 
Jamar is a sophomore studying public relations and strategic communication in the School of Communication. Jamar’s campaign is focused on creating a safer and more accessible campus, improving diversity and inclusion and advocating for a greener AU. 
One of Jamar’s main goals is to enhance safety services for the campus community. This would include posting instructions for handling situations such as alcohol overconsumption and drug abuse in bathrooms, making self-defense classes public and more available for all undergraduate students and offering NARCAN training for medical professionals at AU. 
Jamar also wants to work with the administration on revising the Student Conduct Code to eliminate loopholes that she says allow for racist and discriminatory behaviors. 
AU’s student conduct code outlines a sanctioning process for students found responsible for bias incidents.
As part of Jamar’s plan to enhance safety services, Jamar advocates for the recommendations made in the final report from the SG Commission on Preventing and Handling Sexual Assault Cases. One involves centralizing key resources such as those for sexual assault, AU policy legal procedures and academic integrity codes to make them more accessible for students. She stressed that these resources, although they can be found through the student portal, are not in plain view. 
As part of the Changemakers plan for AU, Jamar wants to move forward with the idea of an “Eagle Wellness Nest” in Hurst Hall, making it a central location for student wellness and Title IX services. 
Jamar plans to continue working with the new Office of Equity and Title IX to address power-based violence. Jamar told The Eagle that, in an unofficial capacity, she has voiced her concerns to the new office and the Center for Student Involvement and has talked about training for student leaders. She hopes to continue having conversations with these offices about requiring relevant training for student leaders and having regular discussions about biases and sexual assault. 
As part of her platform to improve diversity and inclusion, Jamar is advocating for a number of policies. 
Jamar wants D.C. history to be a part of the American University Experience (AUx) core curriculum. 
“I think having these conversations can help AU students find how to respect and have personal and productive conversations on these topics inside and outside of the AU community,” Jamar said.  
Addressing improvements for SG, Jamar wants to make the organization more accessible for students, improve transparency regarding their work and create an inclusive environment. As part of her goal to improve diversity and inclusion, Jamar hopes to create a Student Diversity Committee within SG. 
Jamar said she does not yet have a plan for the return to campus as she is waiting to hear more about the University’s fall plan. She said, if elected, she hopes to be included in the conversation with the administration about the plan. Jamar said she will work to ensure a safe reopening of campus. 
Vice President 
The Vice President’s main duties involve any SG programming, with Kennedy Political Union, Women’s Initiative, Founders and Student Union Board under their purview. 
Javon Darrien 
Darrien is a sophomore studying communication, economics, legal institutions and government (CLEG) in the SPA. Darrien’s campaign focuses on reimagining Founders Week and providing more funding for school and class councils and other organizations.  
For Founders Week, a controversial event that has come under fire in recent years for the University’s historical ties to slavery and for its ballooning cost, Darrien said that, while he has ideas about the reform, he wants to include the campus community in the discussions.  
“It’s a harmful history and it is not meant to be celebrated, but rather acknowledged, and we should learn from it. I think we can use Founders as a time to celebrate our current students, athletes, the people who don’t get the same sort of shine or bandwidth on campus and also our current alumni,” Darrien said. “I think it can be a space to bring the entire community together in an equitable and inclusive way.”  
One of Darrien’s goals involves making organizations like the Women’s Initiative more directly involved in SG. He said that this year, the school and class councils have played a huge role in holding events to engage the campus community, despite being limited to virtual events. Darrien hopes through more funding, the school and class councils will continue to have a large role in creating a sense of community among students. He also wants international students to have space to program events. 
Transparency and accountability are other big aspects of his campaign. He said he wants to meet with students about their ideas and policies, and working with other representatives and stakeholders, try to implement those policies. 
For the return to campus, Darrien hopes to work with the Undergraduate Senate on reestablishing the fall transition group, a collaboration between the executive board and the senate created last spring to ensure an equitable transition for the return to campus in the fall.  
“I want to make sure the transition is fair and equitable,” Darrien said. 
Zuby Chowdhury 
Chowdhury is a sophomore studying international relations in the School of International Service. Chowdhury stressed that her campaign is focused on promoting healing, DEI and rebuilding AU’s community after more than a year apart. She hopes that, if elected, she will be able to spearhead programming that makes students feel proud to be at AU. 
One of Chowdhury’s top goals is addressing the controversial history of Founders with what she calls “Reimagining, Renaming and Rebuilding” the event. She plans to create a student-led commission focused on overhauling Founders.  
“I want to move away from celebrating our founders, and move towards celebrating the progress we have made as a student body and the changes we still have yet to make,” Chowdhury said. She believes it is important to work with Black affinity groups and clubs on campus, as well as the Antiracist Research and Policy Center while reimagining Founders. 
Chowdhury also explained the importance of bringing in a diverse group of speakers and focusing on uplifting those voices. 
“Given the rise of hatred in the past four years, we need to do some healing and growing,” she said. “I believe these speakers are important for that.”
When asked about returning to campus, Chowdhury told The Eagle that safety is her number one priority, and her campaign has formulated plans for both a return to pre-pandemic levels of operation and a continuation of online classes. 
Secretary 
The Secretary is the chief of communications for SG, and their responsibilities include maintaining the SG website, any social media platforms and the directory. They also handle external communications and branding.
Maanasi Natarajan
Natarajan is a sophomore studying CLEG in the SPA. Natarajan said that the main aspects of her campaign are increasing social media accessibility, as well as creating a more inclusive campus both in SG and at AU. 
She hopes to develop stronger forms of communication and dialogue between SG and the student body through introducing online forms that ask for feedback on how to improve accessibility. She has also talked to other executive board candidates about hosting monthly town halls with the student body. 
As the deputy director of online engagement under the current secretary’s administration, Natarajan hopes to continue the work they have done, including working toward establishing a SG resource page. She hopes this page will help certain communities at AU find more representation and resources. 
Natarajan also hopes to expand on it, creating an AAPI resource page that would provide history and ways to contribute to the cause. In addition, she plans to add a portion to the website that discusses the history of marginalized communities on AU’s campus. 
Natarajan plans to create paid on-campus opportunities specifically geared toward low-income students, which will also provide experience in relevant fields. 
“It can be really difficult to get a job if you don’t have experience, but it can be really difficult to get experience if you can’t take unpaid experience,” she said.
Comptroller 
The Comptroller is in control of the majority of SG’s budgets, excluding the programming budgets. They oversee spending and accountability on matters related to finance.
Max Rubin
Rubin is a sophomore studying CLEG in the SPA. Rubin said that he wants to run with much of the progress previous comptrollers have made. However, he hopes to add an advocacy component to the position, which he believes has been missing.  
Rubin stressed that SG should have more of a role in AU’s planning by providing alternative reports published by the body. He hopes to open up more lines of communication with other D.C. universities which he said would benefit all parties involved. 
“We’re in this together, whether it is COVID[-19], general wellbeing or helping the community in D.C., I think we could all benefit from this collaboration,” Rubin said.  
Rubin also explained the importance of an expansion of the Eagle Endowment Grants so that they include more resources for potential projects.

2021-05-09,AU,club,"THE EAGLE
Editor’s Correction: This article has been corrected with the proper spelling of Fariha Rahman’s name. 
As we begin the summer and prepare to transition into a new wave of staff members at The Eagle, it is important to congratulate those who have made this newspaper what it is today. The Class of 2021 has been instrumental in advocating for student media, The Eagle and student journalism throughout their time at American University. 
On the last day of her tenure as editor-in-chief, Sophie Austin wrote a goodbye letter to our readers and staff. After graduation, Austin will report local news as an intern for the Dallas Morning News. During her time at The Eagle, Austin was an integral part of the News staff and introduced several new diversity initiatives as EIC, including El Águila, The Eagle’s Spanish coverage section.
“We, the student journalists of The Eagle, have set ambitious goals amid heartbreaking circumstances,” Austin wrote in her letter. “We’ve accomplished so much and set ourselves up to continue to serve the community in the best way we can in the future.” 
Taking a page from The GW Hatchet’s “30 final column inches,” we congratulate our entire class of graduating seniors and invite you to read their reflections and tributes below.  
Abbie Veitch, Administrative Local News Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies and Environmental Studies
During my freshman year, when I nervously walked up to The Eagle office for a “meet the staff event,” I almost left before talking to anyone and then Haley Samsel introduced herself to me and told me to apply. Despite being worried I would not get a spot on staff, I sent the application and when I got an email saying I got a position as a news staff writer, I posted a screenshot of my acceptance email from Haley on my private Instagram. The caption said, “I really didn’t think this was going to happen and now I have responsibilities uh ah but also AH!!” At the time when I said ‘responsibilities’, I was thinking about personal responsibilities like meeting deadlines and showing up to meetings. After being on the Eagle for four years, the meaning of responsibilities shifted for me. 
Being a student journalist — working and writing about a community that we are so deeply invested in — has been a responsibility that myself and my fellow seniors and staff members carry every day. This experience has taught me so much about what it means to be a storyteller and why this work is important. It has also shown me the very real and tangible consequences of mistakes in journalism and that we cannot take our responsibilities to uphold ethics and consider harm in our reporting lightly. I’m especially grateful to Sophie [Austin], who has consistently reminded us of how to improve and diversify our work in her role as EIC. I have no doubt that the next generations of Eagles will continue to carry this responsibility and do even more incredible journalism in the years to come. On a more personal note, I cannot imagine what my college experience would have looked like without the people I’ve met on The Eagle. The Eagle has been my rock throughout college; I consistently had a place to go and people to be with when things were challenging in the larger AU community and in my personal life. Whether it was help with homework, advice on a story or someone to vent to or laugh with, I could always find that in The Eagle office. Out of everything I’ve missed during this virtual year, I’ve missed being in the office the most. 
But despite being apart we’ve continued our weekly staff meetings, where we editorialize on the big news of the week. During every ed-board, I’m struck by the thoughtfulness of my peers, and I’m thankful to be exposed to so many other perspectives. I can’t tell you how much these perspectives have pushed me to grow not only as a writer and a storyteller but as a person and as a friend. Here are just a few of the people I’ve met through The Eagle who have challenged, supported and helped me to grow: Courtney, Haley, Kimberly, Nick, Sasha, Dilpreet, Brandon, Maria, Cordilia, Brianna, Lydia, Grace, Clare, Sophie, Kelsey, Spencer, Fariha and Nina. That list could go on and on and take up this entire letter. I’m so lucky to have had these people to lean on and learn from and I’m hopeful that the next Eagles will have similar friendships that foster the kind of strong newsroom and community that I was so fortunate to be a part of. 
Alec Branch, Assistant Sports Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism
My time with The Eagle began in the spring of 2020 as a staff writer for the sports section. I went in with pretty low expectations as to what I would be doing, expecting to just cover some basketball games and not much else. But when I picked up a feature story on a highly ranked wrestler who was chasing a national championship at the time, that was when I really decided to go all in and be fully a part of the newspaper and sports section. At a school like AU where the athletic programs seem to be pretty far down on the list of things that people at the school engage with, it is easy to forget or look past just how many incredible stories so many athletes and coaches have. There could be a basketball player who's chasing the school’s all-time scoring record. There could be a wrestler that's ranked sixth nationally in his weight class. Athletes at the school could be forming coalitions to empower themselves and push the school to be anti-racist. Even in a pandemic, when there are no games actually being played, the sports section will always have fun and interesting stories, and sports at AU is no different.
First, I want to thank Spencer Nusbaum, who has been and will continue to be an incredible managing editor for the sports section. It can’t be easy to lead a sports section in a year where no games took place for 10 months, but he was always a great source for finding new stories, and I also learned a lot from his own writing and reporting. He also edited every piece I wrote, and I can definitely say I became a better writer because of that. I also want to thank Jon Kolodny for helping me out early on and being a great example to learn from when it comes to figuring out how to cover live games and conduct postgame interviews, things I had never done before I joined The Eagle. Lee Clarke and Zeke Cohen started in the sports section during the same semester as I did and being able to work with them on stories, as well as follow the work they have done, has been a great experience. Lastly, I would like to shout out Sophie Austin and Lydia Calitri for being incredible EICs during my time at The Eagle. Being a part of The Eagle has really been a worthwhile experience.
Asher Weinstein
Asher Weinstein worked as a student government beat reporter and features editor in the news section for most of his time as an AU student. He covered SG elections, guest speaker events and wrote a story featuring an AU alumni who attended BLM protests this past summer.
“He was someone I could rely on for breaking news and in-depth investigative pieces, always knowing he would dedicate his time and energy to making sure the story was factual, accurate and expansive of all angles,” News Managing Editor Kelsey Carolan wrote. 
Bobbie Armstrong, Satire Editor
Bobbie Armstrong is a staple in The Eagle’s satire column, The Seagle. As a satire editor, she has written over a dozen pieces.
“Bobbie always finds a way to make pitch meetings funny, lighthearted and that really shows through in the work that she produces, specifically for the satire section,” Opinion Managing Editor Riya Kohli said. “She’s just a very funny person, and I know that she’s definitely made me smile in the past couple semesters where it’s been kind of rough for everybody.”
Cameron Fisher, Sports Staff Writer, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism
Being a part of The Eagle was never a thing I really reflected on, but now that my time on staff is over, I can’t help but think about how important this organization was to me. It was the kind of thing that fell in my lap and became the driving force for improving my writing, becoming more connected to campus and meeting some of the most talented and devoted people. In a time when nothing felt normal or constant, The Eagle was there for me and it quickly became one of the highlights of my college career.
Throughout my life I have always viewed sports as a unifying and powerful tool to bring people together, so covering AU’s teams and athletic department during this past year of distance is something I’ll always remember. I am so proud of the work we accomplished and how we were able to adapt to the challenges at hand and make covering games online work. And of course I can’t talk about the sports staff without thanking our incredible Managing Editor Spencer Nusbaum. His editing and own reporting have made me a better writer and I am so grateful to have had him leading the way this past year. Thanks for fielding my many questions and always keeping things interesting.
Probably the most valuable thing I’ll take away from my time at The Eagle is the resiliency of student journalism. Kind of cliché to say, but the odds were really stacked against us this year, and I was consistently in awe of the work that all of the staffers produced and just how dedicated they were to covering such important topics. The future of The Eagle is bright and thank you to everyone for letting me be a part of it even for just a short time. Best of luck in the future!
Cecilia Markley, Style Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism, Minors in Political Science and Spanish
My time on The Eagle was unique in many ways. I only joined one year ago, so my entire time spent with The Eagle was online. I never met many of my fellow staffers in person, and I never even stepped foot in our office. I wasn’t even in D.C. during the summer and fall of 2020. In the beginning, I felt like an imposter, and I felt guilty speaking up and sharing my opinion. But as time went on, I realized how wonderful The Eagle family is. Fellow staffers encouraged me and cheered me on throughout my time here, making me feel each passing day more and more like a part of the Eagle family. Kelly McDonnell, as managing editor of Life in summer and fall of 2020, was supportive of my initiative to cover underrepresented clubs on campus and was always willing to answer my many questions and listen to me when I was self-conscious about an article. Sophie Austin, our amazing editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year, talked to me during news shifts in the fall about class, The Eagle and just life in general. And then, I was shocked and unbelievably honored when Clare Mulroy, the managing editor of Life in spring of 2021 and our brilliant new editor-in-chief, offered me the position of Style editor.
As Style editor this semester, I often felt out of place. At pitch meetings, I always compared myself to arts and entertainment editor Stephanie Mirah and music editor Thomas Recchio, both of whom never failed to come with a myriad of well-researched pitches. Food and fitness editor Emily Walsh always had creative pitches. Silver screen editor Grace George almost every week had found a new screener for the staffers. I felt like I couldn’t live up to them and was always flailing when presenting my pitches. Several times throughout the semester, however, I reached out to Clare and Steph, and they reassured me that I was doing a good job. I also want to shoutout Grace, who wrote such an amazing Style article for the spring print edition. And a big thank you to Clare for answering my constant texts. I’m so excited to follow her work as editor-in-chief. I want to thank Kelly and Clare, the Life section editors and more broadly the entire Life section, for being some of the kindest, most talented and most genuine people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.
Thank you to everyone who worked at The Eagle this past year. You all helped me in so many ways. Thank you to everyone who has ever worked at The Eagle for making it what it is today and for everyone who will continue to build it to be even better. Looking back at this past year, I am proud of my work for The Eagle. I started the AU Club Feature series, which I hope to watch grow even more after I leave. I met some of the most incredible people who I never would have known were it not for joining this institution. I grew as a writer more in this past year than in all my years before. I am so happy that I got to contribute to such a remarkable organization. My only regret is that I didn’t join The Eagle sooner.
Daniella Ignacio, News Staff Writer, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Musical Theatre
I’ve done a lot of reflecting on The Eagle over the past year, thanks to The Eagle Explains. For this final bit of writing I have, I want to take the time to reflect on what it has meant to me to be a student journalist and pursue my dual degree. If you know anything about me, you know that I’m doing a double major in musical theatre and journalism at AU. It has defined my work and how I perceive myself over the past four years. I know that I wouldn’t have continued to pursue journalism if it hadn’t been for The Eagle. There are so many aspects of theatre that have made me a better journalist, and so many aspects of journalism that have made me a better theatre artist. 
I now consider myself a multi-hyphenate, an interdisciplinary storyteller: words I didn’t fully understand when I first came to AU. There were times at The Eagle when I thought I had to hide how nerdy I am about theatre, there were times in the DPA when I worried that it was weird to write about the department… when I thought that my journalism and theatre lives had to be separate. But being an artist who prioritizes empathy has helped me to be a good reporter, editor and collaborator in general. I understand the impact of covering communities and being the person who is covered. All of these experiences have taught me the sheer importance of reporting on a community and telling stories that matter. So many of the journalistic skills I have are skills I learned on staff. More importantly, the people I’ve met through staff and through reporting on the AU and D.C. community have made it all the better.  
Thank you to all the EICs I’ve worked with since freshman year: Courtney Rozen, Haley Samsel, Lydia Calitri and Sophie Austin. Shoutout to Lydia for being there for me through my first print process on the layout and publishing end and for being supportive when I was both Copy and Online Managing Editor at the same time. Extra special thank you to Sophie for advocating for a more diverse newsroom and trusting me with so much intense work and editorial decisions as Online ME throughout everything that 2020 brought us. Thank you to Izzy Wolff for being my right-hand woman through the online work we’ve done over the past year, and for being a wonderful friend even as I’ve taken a step back and spent this last semester focused on writing again. Thank you to everyone who’s ever worked on Life for bringing me into The Eagle and showing me that I can be an arts journalist. Thank you to all the copy editors I worked with in the early semesters of the section, and especially Georgina DiNardo for keeping it going so well. Thank you to anyone who’s ever had to hear me say “I can’t come to [insert meeting here], I have rehearsal” and been understanding, and to everyone who made me feel so passionate about The Eagle that I’ve dropped everything and worked all day and night to get things done, whether it was an article, print edition, breaking news to post on socials or a multimedia project. I’m so hopeful for what the future Eagle staff will bring to this organization and I cannot wait to see you all shine. 
Danielle Mistretta, Assistant Copy Editor, Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and Sociology
While I recently joined the staff in the past year, I have really enjoyed my time working at The Eagle and meeting fellow staffers. I started working for The Eagle at the start of the pandemic and it gave me a sense of community during a time of isolation. While I wish it could have been in-person, I want to thank the staff for being so welcoming and for introducing me to the world of journalism. It was inspiring to work with staffers who are so dedicated and passionate about the work they do. I first joined The Eagle to gain more insight into the field of journalism and to gain more experience writing and editing. I have learned so much through this experience and have taken away many skills I will use in the future. Specifically, I want to thank Sophie Austin for her leadership and dedication and for indirectly encouraging me to apply, Georgina DiNardo for creating such a welcoming environment and for teaching us everything we needed to know and my fellow copy-editing team for all of your hard work. Best of luck to everyone!
Emily Walsh, Food and Fitness Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Transcultural Studies
I think I joined The Eagle late in the game, but I’m so happy I decided to do it. I’ve stayed within the Life Section throughout my entire Eagle career and I could not ask for a more fun, welcoming group of people. The Eagle has given me so much freedom as a student and as a journalist to write and cover issues important to me and AU’s campus. Some of the people I’ve met in my time here have been some of the most passionate people about this school and journalistic writing. I’m constantly so impressed by the stories written by my peers here at The Eagle, and I know we will go on to do incredible things.
If I were to list the people that I met through The Eagle that made an impact on my time writing here, that list would be too long. This newspaper has become such a positive space for growth and learning in my academic career that I will be forever grateful. To the editors I’ve had, the friends that I’ve met and our incredible EICs — past, present and future: thank you for making The Eagle what it is today and thank you for making my time being here so positive. When I look back on my years at college, the memories I have from The Eagle will stand out. I’ll be wearing my cord at graduation with pride because I cannot wait to see what’s in store for everyone. I cannot thank everyone enough for such an incredible time.
Emmanuel Boardman, Assistant Copy Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Communication, Legal Institutions, Economics, and Government
Throughout the past year at The Eagle, Boardman copy edited dozens of stories in the news, sports and life sections. He said that during his time at The Eagle he has enjoyed looking at others’ stories. According to Copy Managing Editor Georgina DiNardo, Boardman was an “amazing addition” to the team, and a dependable copy editor that DiNardo said she can count on to edit quickly, thoroughly and correctly. DiNardo said that, despite not getting to meet him in person because of the pandemic, Boardman was still extremely helpful and she is very happy to have had the chance to work alongside him.
Gabriela Menendez Alurralde
As an Instagram and social media editor under the Online section, Gaby Menedez Alurralde was an essential part of getting published stories out to our social media pages every day. The online team often operates under stress and quick notices to post stories to social media. As an Instagram editor, outgoing Online Managing Editor Grace Newton said Alurralde was consistently “on top of” posting to The Eagle’s instagram. As a senior, Alurralde was also a natural leader on the online staff, Newton said. 
“It was always nice to have upperclassmen like Gaby on staff to lead everyone else,” Newton said. 
Grace George, Silver Screen Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Religion
College forces you to make hasty decisions about your life from the first day. Making those decisions is easier when you’re surrounded by people who remind you who you are and who you want to be. As a freshman, I came into AU as a journalism major, unsure if my courses would point me towards a different field of study. I joined The Eagle and, like many, I was intimidated and unsure of where I could fit into this unfamiliar space. The wonderful people I have met and had the privilege to work alongside at this publication pulled me in like a gravitational force, and I found myself reapplying each semester and continuing to enthusiastically pursue journalism. Everyone whose time at The Eagle has overlapped with mine has helped me grow over the past four years as a writer, revealing to me the everpresent good in this work. I hope to preserve that optimism for my future as a journalist.
I have so many people to thank who have impacted me while passing through The Eagle’s office. Thank you, Courtney Rozen, Haley Samsel, Lydia Calitri and Sophie Austin. Your work ethic, leadership and warmth as individuals inspire me each day and make me proud to have been a part of The Eagle family. Thank you Brianna Crummy, Brandon Ermer, Cordilia James, Dilpreet Raju, Sasha Jones and Kimberly Cataudella for sitting next to me in the office when I was new and awkward. Your friendships and support have made me a better person. Thank you Olivia Kozlevcar, Spencer Nusbaum and Abbie Veitch for making me smile at meetings and in Google Docs. Your presence will always be a comfort to me. Thank you, Kelly McDonnell, Steph Mirah, Clare Mulroy and Isabella Goodman for being an amazing network of support for story ideas and innovation in the Life section. I value my relationship with each of your creative selves. And thank you to the wonderful freshmen I’ve worked with closely this year: Tristan Au, Zoe Bell, Sara Winick, Annmarie Melsheimer and Mary Kett. I will be eagerly watching your creativity shape and mold the future of The Eagle. 
You have each made The Eagle office — or virtual Zoom rooms — feel like home. I am so grateful to have grown alongside each of you over the past few years. To those who still have time left with The Eagle: welcome new staffers warmly, appreciate the moments in the office that you share in person, pick up stories that challenge you, write and report with ethics at the front of your mind and take care of Zac for me. 
Kelly McDonnell, Life Staff Writer, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism
My freshman year of college, The Eagle intimidated me. The application proved high standards of expectations, and my fear of being rejected bested me. When I finally did join the summer after freshman year with a bit more pep in my step, I regretted not having joined sooner. The most important thing I felt with The Eagle was proud. I was proud of myself and always more proud watching my fellow staffers publishing amazing stories.
My first big moment with The Eagle was my infamous “Wonk Rat” piece. I covered the fateful video that exposed Megabytes’ sorry infestations, then the breaking news piece when locks had been placed on the cafe’s front doors. As much as the story became a kitschy joke on campus and during ed-board, I loved feeling included, I loved contributing to the laughter and the lore that still pervades AU culture. Besides Megabytes stories and dining investigations that bolstered my journalism voice, The Eagle helped me realize my true passion for culture writing and film writing. I loved writing film reviews for Silver screen and pieces about local arts happenings for the Life section. I discovered from opportunities from The Eagle that my creative voice lies in film and entertainment and all the personal and cultural storytelling that comes with it. My favorite project was interviewing the directors of “Ralph Breaks the Internet,” an amazing opportunity my sophomore year that excited me about future opportunities to interview filmmakers and other creatives. I also loved writing my retrospective pieces this past year, about “Paris Is Burning” and “Moonlight.” Being able to creatively and journalistically review those films while commenting on contemporary culture is exactly what I want to continue doing post-grad, and I am so grateful for The Eagle’s gift of space, patience, encouragement, trust and dutiful editing.
I’m thankful for the people who surrounded me and led me through college, who made me laugh and feel excited to go to every Eagle meeting or event. Grace George, you are such a great friend, and I am obsessed with your laugh. Dan Papscun, your passion and encouragement helped me in so many ways. Sophie Austin, thank you for your trust, for teaching me, for forgiving me, for supporting our whole staff. Stephanie Mirah, Clare Mulroy, Thomas Recchio, Grace George, Lizzy Tarallo, thank you for being wonderful section editors last semester and working so hard with me to publish amazing stories all throughout summer and fall that transformed the Life section, your work is unmatched. I am very lucky and grateful to have had so many pals help me. I’ll see ya real soon.
Sophie Lampl, Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration with specializations in Marketing and Spanish
It’s been a great four years for me working with the Eagle. I remember walking into the Eagle office my first semester with my resident assistant at the time who was already on multimedia and it was great meeting upperclassmen who were so kind showing us the ropes and being very welcoming. It’s been a wonderful experience working with everyone on The Eagle, and a special shout-out to the multimedia team, it was great working with you all!
Stephanie Mirah, Arts and Entertainment Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Creative Writing
As a freshman, I joined The Eagle as an opinion columnist, knowing next to nothing about the inner workings of a newsroom. At the time, opinion columnists were not expected to attend ed-board meetings since we already spent all of our time sharing our opinions. On my first day as a new writer, I arrived early for a “new hire” meeting and found myself unexpectedly at an editorial meeting. Our then editor-in-chief, Courtney Rozen, always started each meeting with personal check-ins. When my turn came, I remember my face turned red, and I said in a shaky voice, “Um, I am actually not supposed to be here yet.” 
It’s funny looking back four years later. Today, The Eagle is going to struggle to get rid of me. Four semesters as an opinion columnist. Another four as a life staff writer. Two as the arts and entertainment editor. This organization and its people have been nothing but good to me. It has been challenging at times but rewarding. Some people who made this experience especially rewarding are Samantha McAllister, whom without, I think I would have played my newspaper experience safe. Her willingness to think big encouraged me to do the same (not to mention the importance her friendship played in my personal growth.) Dan Papscun, whose commitment to journalism is something I strive for. Ayelet Sheffey who is not only my roommate but the kind of beat reporter I dream of being. Clare Mulroy for her endless support and grace. Sophie Austin for showing me what it means to lead a newsroom effectively and efficiently — online, I may add. To all my fellow seniors who are so well-equipped to mold the future of journalism, I consider it a privilege to have had this opportunity to call them my colleagues before they become too famous. Mostly, thank you to everyone in the arts and entertainment community at AU and around D.C. who have trusted me to tell their stories. You help make our paper succeed. 
I haven’t cried yet — shocking, I know — but I am not sure I ever will. That’s how confident I am that this newsroom will thrive even as us seniors take our leave and how secure I am in that my time meant something when I was here. I don’t need to mourn it, I guess. To our current staff, know you have a strong network of people who want to support you. To The Eagle staff of the future, the same goes for you. After all, once an Eagle? 
Thomas Recchio, Music Editor, Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, Minor in Justice
I started working at the Eagle in spring 2020 as a life staff writer with absolutely no experience in journalism whatsoever. My thinking at the time was that this was going to be a complete fluke and a last resort in case I did not get an internship. Well, it turned out that I got both an internship in journalism and worked at The Eagle that semester all the way until now. This amazing experience taught me a lot about myself and has brought out the best in me. I am a bit of a socially awkward guy who had never really had to put myself out there before. Journalism helped me overcome some of that. At my first ever pitch meeting, I was not sure what to expect and I came in with a completely open mind. From that day forward, I got to know people who became friends and mentors from the very beginning. I especially want to thank Clare Mulroy, who has been a friend and colleague from the very beginning of my experience at The Eagle. She has really helped me grow as a journalist and always knew how to get the best out of me. Her continued friendship and mentorship mean a lot and I definitely will apply what she has taught me going forward in my future endeavors.
I discovered as time went on that journalism really does a good job in allowing for creative freedom and in providing a platform for many different subject matters. As my time at The Eagle continued, I enjoyed a very productive summer in 2020, where I started to write more about music, which has been an integral part of my life since childhood. I took piano lessons from Kindergarten until the end of high school. I still play occasionally to this day. Writing about music was extremely rewarding for me and it allowed me to feel more comfortable expressing a part of myself that I had largely kept quiet about. I continued as a staff writer in the fall of 2020 where I built on my productive work in the summer. I deepened my connection with music and the arts, writing articles almost exclusively on those subjects. When I became the music editor this semester, I learned about the many additional responsibilities that come with being an editor while continuing to share my passion for music with others. I learned about what kind of content I can focus on and how I can get creative with it during a pandemic. This job helped me grow not only as a writer but as a person and a leader. I look forward to what lies ahead in the future after graduation.
To the D.C. music community, thank you for everything you do. You continued with great events and programming even during the COVID-19 pandemic and I enjoyed being able to cover some of those events. Covering Bruce Hornsby’s concert at the Strathmore last year made me cherish in-person concerts more and I look forward to when in-person concerts can return safely. To my colleagues at The Eagle, thank you for everything this last year and a half. I wish I could have gotten more of the in-person experience but getting to know you all has been amazing. If there is one word to describe everyone, that word would be resilient. The pandemic brought out the resilience in us and we accomplished a lot of great things together. I am confident that you will do great things now and in the future and I am excited to see where The Eagle goes moving forward.  
Zeke Cohen
Having written and created over a dozen pieces for the Sports section, Zeke Cohen is instrumental in the production of “Angle on the Eagles,” The Eagle’s newest podcast for the Sports section. According to Sports Managing Editor Spencer Nusbaum, Cohen has taken a lot of initiative in hosting and running the podcast.
“He’s really a sponge in a sense, he really wants to soak up a lot and I think it’s going to benefit him in the future and it definitely benefited our section,” Nusbaum said.

2021-05-11,AU,club,"Ricky Staub’s directorial debut, “Concrete Cowboy,” tells the age-old story of familial reconciliation in a not-so-common setting.
The film follows the relationship between Cole (Caleb McLaughlin), a 15-year-old inner-city trouble maker, and his estranged father, Harp (Idris Elba). 
Upon Cole’s expulsion from school in Detroit, his mother, Amahle (Liz Priestley), drops him off at Harp’s house in an urban part of Philadelphia for the summer. Cole is dismayed to find his new home in terrible condition, containing nothing but beaten-up furniture, a fridge filled solely with soda and old beer and Boo, one of the many horses that Harp takes care of with his team at the Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club. A fed-up Cole leaves Harp’s place to go hang out with his cousin, Smush (Jharrel Jerome), who we quickly learn deals drugs. 
Throughout the rest of the film, we watch Cole’s journey as he decides whether to follow in Harp’s footsteps or run with Smush. Eventually, he will choose the former option.
“Concrete Cowboy” ends with a reunion between Cole and his parents as they all embrace each other for the first time in years.
All in all, the film is predictable. Smush fulfills the tried and true narrative of the inner-city kid who couldn’t quite make it out of his environment in time, (think “Boyz n the Hood,” “Menace II Society,” etc.) and “Concrete Cowboy” has no problem embracing it.
Equally as predictable is the family reconciliation at the end of the film. From the get-go, we can tell that Cole and Harp will eventually bond with each other. And while this may be intentioned as heart-warming or redemptive, it largely comes off as trite.
While the reunion is easy to spot, it’s also forced. There’s no logical progression from estrangement to reunion; the script simply insists that they must learn to like each other.
The film does have its merits, though. Elba’s grizzled, “I’ve-seen-some-stuff-in-my-day” delivery is aptly paired with his cowboy persona. His do-it-yourself attitude and the cigarette that never seems to leave his mouth hearkens back to the classic outlaws of old Westerns.
Staub’s direction also shows flashes of brilliance. He uses the camera masterfully to elicit visceral feelings in the audience.
During the moment before Smush’s demise, we watch through Cole’s eyes as his cousin walks up to the front of the gas station where the deal is to go down. There’s a quiet calm-before-the-storm buildup to the shooting, as we are forced to look on in silence, as helpless as Cole is to stop the inevitable. The camera suddenly fades to black. Gunshots blare out at high volume, and we’re jolted right back into the scene with a force via a shaky POV shot that follows Cole running towards the crime scene. 
We feel the full emotional impact of the situation no matter how certain the outcome was. No amount of foresight can prepare us for sudden loss, and the frantic camera movements combine perfectly with distorted street sounds to capture that feeling.
“Concrete Cowboy” is far from a perfect film. Its results are expected and its story is nothing new. Yet we can’t help but feel emotionally drawn to the characters’ performances and the story’s oddly enticing Western mystique in the midst of Northern Philadelphia. 
Deep down, we all want to ride off into the sunset just as Cole and Harp do, together.

2021-10-08,AU,club,"Content warning: This story contains mention of assault. This article has been updated with a recent announcement from the University that Trebat is no longer affiliated with AU.
The Superior Court of the District of Columbia recently granted a modified curfew for a former American University graduate student who is charged with multiple counts of “bias-related” assault so he can attend classes on campus.
Patrick Trebat, a former graduate student in the Kogod School of Business, was arrested on Aug. 7 off of Wisconsin Avenue after he “unlawfully assaulted and threatened” Sean Lai and his parents, fracturing Lai’s finger and leaving his father with a broken wrist and mother with arm pain, according to court documents. Charging documents state that Trebat shouted homophobic slurs and anti-Asian remarks at Lai and his family during the incident. The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia filed a complaint in the form of criminal charges against Trebat before the Superior Court on one count of assault and two counts of assault with significant bodily injury.
Trebat was released under a High Intensity Supervision Program, which transitioned to a curfew at the end of August. At the beginning of September, Trebat filed a motion to extend his curfew from 10 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. to accommodate an evening class at AU. The court granted this motion. Trebat did not respond to request for comment.
Chief Communications Officer Matthew Bennett confirmed that the University did not play a role in Trebat’s motion to extend the curfew. 
On Saturday morning, Bennett told The Eagle in an email that Patrick Trebat ""is no longer affiliated with American University and is not allowed on campus.” Bennett declined to provide specifics, but said that ""the matter was concluded"" last week. 
Patrick Trebant is no longer affiliated with American University and is not allowed on campus.
Trebat’s counsel, Brandi Harden, is an adjunct professor at the Washington College of Law. Harden declined a request for comment. 
Bennett declined to comment on Harden, but said she “is acting in her non-university capacity in a legal matter that [the] University is not party to.”
According to Bennett, the University closely follows the student code of conduct when faced with off-campus arrests like this one. 
“When we are made aware of a situation like this, it gets referred to the appropriate offices,” Bennett said. “If the case involves a legal proceeding or a police matter, then obviously AUPD is informed as well.”
Section XVIII of the student conduct code states that the dean of students or their designee will administratively adjudicate the case when a student has been accused of a non-academic offense “where the student has been arrested, charged, convicted of, or sentenced for a felony crime” for certain misconduct. 
“Our commitment is to the safety and well-being of our community — that is always first and foremost,” Bennett said. “So we take that into account no matter what is going on with the circumstances of any case, and take the appropriate steps.”
Anti-Asian violence is not new in the United States; anti-Asian hate crimes rose by nearly 150 percent in 2020, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Daniel Chapman, co-chair of the Asian Pacific Islander Queers United for Action DC (AQUA DC), said that the coronavirus has only exacerbated these issues. 
“Since COVID-19 last year, there has been much more anxiety amongst our communities here due to growing anti-Asian sentiment and violence,” he said in an email statement. “As a result, I have definitely felt a stronger sense of solidarity within our diverse community.” 
Chapman also said that community members have set up support networks for affected victims, and AQUA has specifically built networks between queer API folks in addition to donating to causes such as a #StopAsianHate rally in northern Virginia. 
AU Asian American Student Union released a statement on social media Friday evening denouncing the curfew extension and the University’s silence on the matter. AASU is hosting a virtual healing space for the AU Asian American community on Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. and Oct. 11 at 7 p.m., according to the post. Georgetown University's Asian American Student Association, AU's South Asian Student Association, Project Penyou, the Philippine-American Coalition, AU Hawai'i Club and the Korean Student Association cosigned the statement. 
Erin Enriques, a co-president of the AASU, said she wants to see the University respond in a way that holds itself accountable. Enriques, although unsurprised by AU not making the community aware of Trebat’s presence on campus, said she fears for the safety of fellow Asian students.
“I was disappointed, but I wasn’t really surprised … I also was pretty worried for my own friends, we’re all at AASU,” Enriques said. “And because people take classes in the evening, and if [Trebat] is being allowed to take classes in person at night, it still puts people and the community at risk, for both students and faculty.”
Enriques said she doesn’t want the University to respond by increasing police presence on campus, but she’d like to see more transparency.
“In the future, I do want to see AU be more upfront about things, [especially] people who are associated with AU, and especially if they’ve committed hate crimes,” she said. 
Moving forward, Enriques said that AASU plans to work with other AAPI organizations on campus to create spaces and resources for students to feel safe. 
“AU has not done right for their POC students and faculty,” she said. “[The University has] not protected them.”
Matthew Ong, a close friend of Lai for over five years, saw the ways in which the attack deeply impacted Lai and his parents.
“Sean and his elderly parents are severely traumatized by the attack,” he said. “What happened to them is despicable — they don’t deserve to have anti-gay slurs yelled at them or be told ‘you don’t belong here.’ They don’t deserve to get beaten to the ground just for existing.”
Ong, like Lai, is an immigrant of Chinese descent and said that seeing a close friend get hurt because of his identity was “painful and worrying.” Lai, who got his PhD and accepted his identity as a gay man in D.C., feels unsafe in his own neighborhood, Ong said.
However, Ong has hope: “Sean and his family are resilient. They, along with Sean’s diverse community of friends, want justice and accountability,” he said. “Racist beliefs and predatory behavior have no place in our lives.”
In terms of University action, Ong shares the same sentiment as Enriques. 
“Administrators at American University must prioritize the physical and mental well-being of their minority students, faculty and staff,” Ong said. “No one, including Asian and LGBTQ+ people, should have to fear for their lives just for walking down the street.”

2021-11-09,AU,club,"Let’s set the mood for the evening: dim lighting with a pink undertone, brick walls that smelled of a good time and one center stage with a luminescent spotlight. 
On Oct. 14, this spotlight presented Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson live at the DC Improv Comedy Club. They are famously known for their comedy duo “Sorry About Last Night” and are also the creators of the “Guys we have f****d” podcast. 
Fisher and Hutchinson put on quite the raunchy display, but regardless of how vulgar and down to earth their content was, it’s up to par with the funnier stand-up comedy routines to come about in recent years. 
The show started off with a simple opening act — another performer, Naomi Karavani, set the tone for a good show with a few witty one-liners. 
Karavani said that women and men who play football are similar: once they hit 30 years old, they start looking at younger athletes — college athletes or even high school athletes. And, to rub salt in the wound of all 30-year-old football players, she took a direct hit at Tom Brady, and said that however much gender is a construct, so are Tom Brady’s knees. The room responded positively to the newbie on stage — she set a laid back and humorous environment for the upcoming comedy duo.
Shifting attention, Fisher was first up to bat and automatically hit a home run with her jokes. The room was in uproar, with every punch line delivered to a tee.
Fisher started with commentary on how everyone always looks for love in tall men but are completely “overlooking” short guys. You can never trust a tall man since they are always so far away, she said, they might just be cheating on you all the way up there. 
This quickly turns into the point of the show — “Sorry About Last Night” — and Fisher joked about her overconfidence and slight self-obsession proving a lack of competence in the bedroom. Discovering this about herself, she said it came as a shock to her ego, but made for a good laugh. Fisher gave ease and insight into the world of dating and hookups. It bordered right on the line of pathetic but did not cross over humility. 
Hutchinson was up to the plate next, yet another homerun. Every joke was delivered with such character: with a range of facial expressions, voice impressions and overall realness, she was fearless. Laying into every joke with an experience made the content all the better — knowing that this was fact, not fiction added an extra laugh because it was relatable.
Her comedy was a spectrum of topics from her past trauma to family dysfunction and the chaos that was having a brand-new puppy at the start of quarantine — as Hutchinson put it, “I wasn’t going to go through it alone”.
That statement is what rounded out the entire show: their content spoke to every person in the room, and created a comfortable environment where you could learn to laugh at life’s mishaps. Everyone has ‘dumb b****h’ moments as the two said, and that’s okay — Fisher and Hutchinson showed that with a little laughter and a few drinks, you can overcome the toughest obstacles. 
Conclusively, Fisher and Hutchinson’s stand-up routine is nothing short of a knee slapper. While their live show may no longer be in DC, the two have a podcast with relatively all the same content, just a tad more up to date with their life happenings.

2021-11-11,AU,club,"Indie-rocker Lucy Dacus concluded the first leg of her tour for her newest album “Home Video” at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 29 on the heels of two sold-out shows at the venue the previous week.
The show felt distinctly unique due to Dacus’ relationship with D.C. As a native of Richmond, Virginia, she shared stories of coming to shows in the area from a young age and meeting boygenius groupmate Julien Baker at a D.C. show.
“It feels really special to be here,” Dacus said to the crowd. “It’s a special city to me.”
Before Dacus came on, folk singer Tomberlin started things off with a minimalistic set, aided only by her acoustic guitar and casual, joking demeanor. Although an artist with a more upbeat style might have provided more energy to open the show, Tomberlin’s voice was undeniably beautiful, making for some especially powerful vocal moments. 
While Tomberlin gave off delightfully awkward, just-getting-back-to-in-person-shows charm, Dacus and her backing band were ripe with stage presence as they arrived onstage for the main show. Dressed in coordinating light-colored outfits, the musicians interacted beautifully throughout the show, from the times when all five were mixing their instruments in loud, euphoric symphony, to when Dacus’ guitarist accompanied her on a quiet, acoustic version of her song “Partner in Crime.” 
Adding another layer of excitement to the night, Dacus revealed that her dad was in the audience, even pointing toward him during her song “Going Going Gone,” as she sang, “I always had to be home by eight / My dad would kill me if I was late,” prompting laughter from the audience. 
Both that song and one unreleased song by Tomberlin saw the artists explicitly asking the audience to sing along. These moments of direct interaction between artist and audience were simply joys to behold and partake in. Especially after the hiatus from live music during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, even small moments like those served as reminders of what was lost in the time without live music, and what musicians and concertgoers have finally been able to experience once again. 
The intimate feel of the show was clear throughout the night, from a fan passing a homemade embroidery hoop to Dacus onstage to Dacus ending the show with an unreleased song that she asked fans not to record. As Dacus played, trusting the audience to restrain themselves and just enjoy the moment, it was a wonderful way to end the night. Although the pre-encore ending song — the cinematic and explosive “Night Shift” — would have been a beyond satisfying finale in and of itself, the encore was just the cherry on top.
Dacus and her band gave a truly impressive performance through their musicianship and stage presence. The rapturous applause proved the show a success, transforming a rainy end of the week into an excitement-filled start to the weekend. Right then, it was clear that the D.C. music scene would welcome back Dacus and her band with open arms whenever they decided to return for a night of insatiable live music once again.

2021-12-09,AU,club,"From the Newsstands: This story appeared in our December 2021 print edition. You can find the digital version here.
The entertainment world was struck in a way that was both soul-stirring and inconceivable in March 2020. Theaters, museums and concert halls across the world went dark, leaving creators to look inward and consider more confined ways of making art. For creators at American University, this meant making content from their childhood bedrooms. 
Many found that this time caused unparalleled stress; a waiting game fixated on nothing but the return to in-person work. For others, this time presented a chance to explore the boundaries of art in the most versatile space possible: the internet. And while the coronavirus raged across the country, the social media app TikTok began to emerge as an emotional and creative outlet for young people. 
For individuals who considered themselves performers in the pre-pandemic world, the platform gave them a way to channel their artistic tendencies while engaging with an audience. Such is the case for Grace Bressner (@gracebressner), a dancer and freshman in the Department of Performing Arts at AU. 
“I started blowing up more during the pandemic: there was this one video I posted, and it got me my first million views,” Bressner said. She now has just over one million followers on TikTok. “People were on the app, everyone was starting to join [it], because that’s all there was to do.”
And although Bressner finds that the type of dancing she continues to do on TikTok is very different from her in-studio dance styles, she does feel that it was a great place for her to fill out some of her desire to entertain during lockdown. 
“In the sense of performance and of entertainment qualities, TikTok for sure fulfilled that,” Bressner said. 
She currently creates her own dances and revises the dances of other creators in her own style. One of her dances was even performed by TikTok superstar Charli D’Amelio.
“[The dance] was known for Charli doing it three times,” Bressner said. “But there was also so much hate associated with it. When you create your own TikTok dance, the most common comment and recurring thing that people will say is that it’s just recycled movements.” 
As a result of this reaction, Bressner now spends more of her time recreating the dances of others. She also finds breaks from her virtual presence with in-person dance lessons and through preparation for AU Dances, an event between dance courses where students showcase their learned skills. For her, it’s a welcome return. 
For other entertainment forms, remaining fully virtual seems likely. Content creator Upneet Kaur (@createbyua), who is a senior in the School of International Service, began developing her video crafting skills on the platform. On TikTok, she creates content centered around fashion, art and lifestyle. Her videos amass thousands of views; she currently has a following of upwards of 60 thousand. 
“In terms of short films, I’d never done them before I joined TikTok. I have in the past just filmed videos or taken pictures,” Kaur said. “But compiling it into those videos and giving them a theme was never something I’d done before. It’s something I had always admired that other people did, but not something I thought I would be able to do.”
In learning to create this type of content, Kaur has also developed a unique style that highlights her ability to build aesthetics and redefine the boundaries of modern creative demonstration.
“[It] has given me one more way to express myself,” Kaur said. 
The same is true for Sebastian Aguilar (@sebbylyfe), a junior with 10 thousand followers who considers himself a genreless content creator on TikTok. Self-expression is the primary driving force behind his content, which remains fluid based on his own interests.
“I don’t put myself in a single section of entertainment, I do it more for myself,” Aguilar said. “A lot of my personality comes through the videos that I make, and so I just like expressing myself with other people on the internet. I think a big part of that came because of the pandemic: I didn’t get to share my personality with people in person anymore, and being the extrovert that I am, I found that TikTok could be that platform to give me that opportunity.”
Aguilar also said he feels that TikTok has provided young people with a newfound sense of community, one that remains unparalleled by most platforms. 
“One of the big benefits to TikTok is that you can have an interest that you think nobody else is interested in, but you do find somebody who shares that similar passion,” Aguilar said. “One of the larger projects that I’m working on is to do a collaboration cross-country.”
And for others, like SIS and Kogod School of Business senior Paul Sutton (@paulblartgoestoschool), TikTok creation opened them up to being entertainers. Sutton began using the app as a way to share videos from his work as a park ranger during the pandemic.
“I was never really an entertainer before this,” Sutton said. “I was a park ranger, and that was my job during the summer when I was at home during the pandemic. So if the pandemic didn’t happen, I wouldn’t have had that job, and I wouldn’t have made the TikTok.”
At AU, Sutton is the president of the club soccer team and a member of a professional business fraternity. Following the end of his stint as a park ranger, Sutton now remains relatively popular among the nature fan community. 
“After I ran out of park material, I just started posting more stuff about me,” Sutton said. “Which was kind of nice because I learned to be able to show myself through the app instead of just showing my park life.”
For now, all genres of live performance are slowly beginning to trickle back to the foreground. But TikTok creators — as well as the viewers that fuel the ongoing popularity of the app — seem set on solidifying the app’s spot as a vivacious and valid form of modern entertainment.

2021-12-13,AU,club,"From the Newsstands: This story appeared in our December 2021 print edition. You can find the digital version here.
American University Football: Still Undefeated.
You can buy the shirt with that slogan on the back at the AU bookstore for $24. The gag is obvious — AU doesn’t actually have a football team, but the inside joke belies a lack of school spirit to many.
“There’s not a lot of school spirit,” School of Public Affairs junior Dylan Judge said. “It’s the culture of the school.”
Other students who spoke to The Eagle echoed a similar collective apathy toward AU athletics.
“I’m extremely indifferent,” School of Communication sophomore Olivia Tudor said. “I feel like a lot of people didn’t come here because of the school spirit.”
In fact, many students either think the Eagles never flew across the gridiron or only played a few games long ago. The story is much more complex: multiple teams wore the pads for AU, and unlike the slogan, they lost — a lot.
Losing streaks, car crashes and cheerleaders in disguise: The American University Football Team 1925-1941
AU played its first two football games in 1925 against George Washington University and Emerson Institute — according to AU records — and lost both games. 
The Eagles wore blue and orange, and they played in a ravine adjacent to the University President’s house that is now the site of the Wesley Theological Seminary in the 1930s, according to 2003 reporting from The Eagle.
Losses were a theme for the Eagles during their 1925-1941 existence. AU went 24-67-6, according to AU’s official record. Their best season was in 1926 when they went 4-3-1, and they never had another winning season. An analysis of the former AU yearbook — the AUCOLA (1927-1955) — reveals that the Eagles had three zero-win seasons, and were usually thoroughly outclassed by their opponents.
AU played 34 teams in its history and had a winning record against eight. Regular rivals were St. John’s University, Hampden Sydney College and Randolph-Macon College. The Eagles played the three schools 27 times and beat St. John’s once.
AU’s Achilles’ heel was their inability to score — the Eagles were shut out 32 times. The Eagles were outscored by their opponents by at least 30 points 24 times, proving their defensive ineptitude and offensive incompetence.
In the span of four weeks in 1928, AU lost to Gettysburg College 81-0, Catholic University 69-0, St. John’s University 63-0 and Gallaudet University 37-7. The Eagle commended AU for its “spectacular tackles” in the recap of the humiliations.
Despite the losing, AU’s actual record is disputed. The Eagle’s records prove inconsistent over the years, and AU has no official record book for the football team. The only source that kept regular records was the yearbook. 
What is undisputed are the interesting people who played and coached for the Eagles. Fullback Tom Sawyer played for AU during the 1926-1927 season. He was a two-sport star, as captain of the basketball team in 1926, and captain of the football team in 1927. However, Sawyer’s successful career crashed and burned soon after.
After just two games, Tom Sawyer and three other players were suspended from the team for “training violations,” according to a 1927 Washington Post article. While no official reason was given, the Post reported the four players had been involved in a car crash after driving home from a party. The suspensions forced AU to cancel its game against William & Mary and AU finished the season 1-5. Sawyer withdrew from AU soon after, according to The Eagle.
There was also Gus Welch who coached AU from 1937-38 and compiled a 2-10-1 record. Welch had a strong resume as a player, suiting up for coaching legend Pop Warner and playing alongside football great Jim Thorpe. Welch was hired to turn AU’s fortunes around, but he went down in AU lore for the many stunts he allegedly attempted as head coach.
In 1938, The Washington Post reported that Welch tried to start a woman as a placekicker for the Eagles, but AU’s dean of women denied the idea. Welch was also known for his “30-second football” lectures to new players before throwing them into games for the first time. 
In the same article, the Post also alleged that Welch, fretting how small his teams were, dressed cheerleaders and students as players to fool opponents into thinking he had more players than he actually had. In an interview with The Eagle in 1959, Stafford “Pop” Cassell — whose name adorns Cassell Hall and who played and coached for the football team — quoted Welch allegedly saying, “The only way for us to get a crowd is to play at the half of a Redskin game.”
The team didn’t improve during Welch’s tenure and he resigned after the 1938 season. With the onset of World War II, the University eliminated the football team because there weren’t enough men on campus to field a team, The Eagle reported. 
The University considered reviving football, but AU deemed it “impossible” in 1959, and an official team has never suited up for AU since. 
Despite this, AU students were not done with the gridiron.
Beer drinkers, debt and X-rated films: The 1970s
Upon arriving as a student at AU, Terry McLarney wanted to keep playing football. He played at Wheaton High School in Maryland, and then went to Jacksonville State University to begin his college football career. After a year, he transferred to Montgomery College to continue playing football. However, academic pursuits led him to AU in 1973, McLarney said in an interview with The Eagle.
Now a Lieutenant in the Baltimore Police Department, McLarney said that he didn’t know that AU had a club football team when he got to campus. But after a chance encounter at the cafeteria on registration day, McLarney joined the team and played center and guard from 1973-74. McLarney said that the team was a tight-knit group with a sense of camaraderie.
The team played at Reeves Field and went 5-2-1— according to the AU yearbook— and McLarney said the team was invited to play a bowl game in Oswego, New York, which they lost. Despite the success, McLarney wasn’t blind to the apathy the student body had for the team.
“No one really cared that there was a football team,” McLarney said. “However, when we would play a home game and walk over there in full gear … People would come out and watch. Once we were walking over and I heard someone saying ‘we have a football team?’”
1977 alumnus Lowell Lease laughed when he heard the story. 
“I don’t know if anybody had realized that there was a football team,” Lease said.
Lease played football with McLarney in high school and said McLarney had told him about the club football team. When he came to AU in 1974, he signed up to play as a defensive end.
Lease played one year for the Eagles — a hand and head injury cut his career short — but he said he liked the team atmosphere.
“It was a real cross-section of guys,” Lease said. “The chemistry was good, we all got along and did really well. We had good cohesiveness in defense and offense and it was a lot of fun.”
McLarney and Lease’s teams only got to suit up after years of grassroots efforts to bring football back to AU.
In 1965, a group of students created the AU Football Club to promote tackle football’s return to campus, and after four years of advocacy, the AU student government, known as the “Student Confederation” at the time, pledged to fund the team, according to The Eagle’s reporting in 1969. The club team played from 1970-1976, but its tenure was fraught with controversy.
Relations between the team and the SC were tense from the beginning. According to The Eagle in 1970, the two sides disagreed about cost. The comptroller in 1970 suggested the club football team was not forthcoming with the actual cost of the team and called the pro football faction “a little tribe of beerdrinkers.” 
The two sides continued to disagree on the club’s expenses, and The Eagle frequently reported the student government repeatedly charged the team with overspending. Neither Lease nor McLarney remembered the debate, but the money dispute ultimately doomed the team.
In 1973, an Eagle investigation found that the club was nearly four thousand dollars in debt. In 1974, SC said the club owed a travel agency $1,800 and $1,000 to a motel in Oswego for the game, according to The Eagle’s reporting in 1974. McLarney said he didn’t remember the team being in debt or having any problems with the Oswego trip.
The team held fundraisers to try and keep the club afloat, including a Las Vegas night and an “X-rated movie night” that turned a profit, according to a 1974 Eagle article.
The fundraisers didn’t raise enough funds and SC refused to fund them in 1975, according to a 1975 Eagle report, spelling the end of the club football team.
The 1976 season was football’s last gasp at AU, and the team was disbanded. Football had finally faded from AU for good. 
Despite this, both Lease and McLarney said that their time at AU has stuck with them in their respective careers and that a football team could give the school some much-needed spirit.
“You go through life and there’s so many parallels,” McLarney said. “You reap what you sow, if you don’t work out, you don’t go practice, you’re not going to be decent and gut it out during tough times. The teamwork and caring, and all that kind of stuff — for me, it was football.”

2022-01-05,AU,club,"Students expressed concerns about American University’s coronavirus response at a virtual question and answer session hosted by Student Government President Chyna Brodie Monday.
At Monday’s event, Brodie answered student questions about the University’s planned operations for the three upcoming weeks of remote learning.
“Going off of conversations that I had with D.C. Health, we’re going to be experiencing a surge [of Omicron cases] within the next two and a half, three weeks,” Brodie said. 
In the last days of 2021, D.C.’s COVID-19 case count increased dramatically, with approximately 2,000 new infections being confirmed daily. Brodie said that her conversations with the D.C. Department of Health indicated that students can expect in-person operations to resume once this projected spike in cases dwindles. 
Brodie said that students can expect to receive an email from administrators around Jan. 20 with updates about class modality for the rest of the semester, but said that she expects “a very low likelihood” of fully remote classes continuing past Jan. 30. 
Concerns about testing procedures
Many students in attendance at the event raised questions about the administration’s response to a petition started by AU’s Disabled Student Union, which is asking the University to implement mandatory testing for all students at least twice a month.
Brodie said that, because the University facilitates its testing through the external party ShieldT3, biweekly testing of every student on campus could “overwhelm the system.”
“We will have some form of routine testing when everyone gets back this January, but I do not want to promise that in a school of over 8,000 kids, everyone will be getting tested every two weeks,” Brodie said. 
DSU’s petition referenced a number of other universities that currently do require their students to undergo more frequent testing, including George Washington University. Brodie said that these universities have a higher testing capacity because most received federal or state funding to develop their own testing centers and labs.
“Each and every one of these universities leads back to extensive in-house testing or an extensive in-house lab,” Brodie said.
Nearby Gallaudet University also administers its testing through a partnership with ShieldT3 and mandates weekly testing for its roughly 1,000-person student body.
Some students at the event pushed back on Brodie’s response to the petition, questioning the University’s commitment to addressing the disabled community’s concerns, as well as Brodie’s commitment to advocating for what students are asking for to the administration.
“Disabled students deserve better,” DSU President Katherine Greenstein wrote in the chatbox.
According to a comment in the chatbox from junior Stacia Tomlinson, one of Brodie’s cabinet members who helped to facilitate the event, SG is “working with the Faculty Senate and administration to provide as many accommodations for students that do not feel comfortable on campus.”
Some students also raised concerns about the availability of the testing center, such as having longer hours and keeping the center open on weekends. 
Brodie recommended that any student with concerns about the University’s testing policy contact Fanta Aw, the vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence. 
Students question cost and benefit
Brodie said that, based on conversations she has had with University administrators, students should not count on having any portion of their tuition refunded for the spring semester.
“Last time we received a discount was when we went online for a full year, and that discount was only 10 percent,” Brodie said, referring to the University’s tuition reduction for the fully remote fall 2020 semester.
In-person living and learning in January
While students who need to access laboratory spaces for capstone projects or research work will be able to, Brodie said the majority of learning until Jan. 30 will be conducted virtually to mitigate infection rates.
“Exposure in in-person lectures definitely played a significant role in contact tracing as you all saw throughout the [fall] semester,” Brodie said.
Brodie said that she is working with administrators to assist students who are not located in the Eastern Standard Time zone, including international students.
Residence halls will reopen on Jan. 6, as scheduled before the announcement of remote classes. Students are still allowed to return to their dorms on this date. However, in its Dec. 28 announcement, the University encouraged students to stay home because “it may be more convenient for isolating … or for participating in online classes.”
Some attendees raised concerns about whether students will follow social distancing guidelines and other public health recommendations once back in their residence halls.
“We can’t control the decisions of individuals who choose to ignore public health guidelines,” Brodie said. “Dorms are opening because … students have the right to access their dorms.”
For any students who left essential belongings in their dorms before leaving for winter break but do not plan to return to campus before Jan. 30, Brodie said they can contact their residence hall staff to inquire about having items shipped to their homes.
For dining, Brodie said that “a majority” of campus facilities will be accessible for grab-and-go service. Dining locations will offer to-go boxes for students to take their food home.
For students who do not plan on returning to campus before Jan. 30, Brodie said that she is discussing the possibility of introducing another meal swipe donation program with administrators.
Brodie told students to expect an email providing more specific details about dining modifications from the administration within the coming days.
Brodie said that University buildings will open before Jan. 30. The library will operate on modified hours, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. The University’s shuttle buses will also continue to run during this period. 
Both the Cassell and Jacobs Fitness Centers will also be open to students. Brodie said that this measure was taken because, for some students, a lack of access to exercise facilities “represents a deterioration of their mental health.”
Brodie encouraged members of club sports to contact AU RecFit for information about whether their teams will be permitted to practice before Jan. 30. 
Brodie advised Federal Work-Study recipients to contact their supervisors for information about remote job modalities. She confirmed that desk receptionists will still be required to work in person.
Brodie said that the University will be offering free KN95 masks to students before in-person classes resume.
As the University prepares for another semester amid the pandemic, Brodie encouraged students to contact her via email at president@ausg.org with any concerns that they have.
“I don’t want anyone in our community to feel anxious, unheard or unseen,” Brodie said.

2022-01-05,AU,club,"Deeply rooted in the American mythos, Wim Wenders’ 1984 film “Paris, Texas” is a gripping drama about a man seemingly pulled out of thin air. The only thing he can remember from the past four years is a mysterious plot of land and a name: Paris, Texas.
Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is picked out of the desert in a fugue state by his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), who takes him back to Los Angeles where Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Clément) have taken custody of Travis’ son, Hunter (Hunter Carson). In order to reignite Travis’ memory, the family watches an old home video of a day at the beach. Here, the mystery of Travis starts to unravel. He was happily married to a woman named Jane (Nastassja Kinski), but after watching this video, we can’t help but wonder what happened. They were clearly in love; they had a child together and even bought a property together in Paris, Texas. What could have caused Travis to walk out on that?
From the very first shot of the Southwestern landscape, Wenders demonstrates the supernatural nature of the West, a landscape that is a vast and open space, full of wonder and opportunity. The camera lingers on the mundane and ordinary, giving even the plainest objects the reverence they deserve. Now obsolete phone booths, a staple of 1980’s America, become a lifeline of communication in the unknown. Roadside motels and diners are deified by the camera, providing the basis needed for a continuing journey. This creates a strong sense of nostalgia for a rapidly disappearing time in American history, a time before cell phones and constant connectivity.
Together Hunter and Travis embark on a beautifully shot odyssey through the Southwest to reunite with Jane, who is later found working at a gentlemen's club. The club is hallmarked by private booths with a one-way mirror separating the client from the performer. These rooms are reminiscent of confessional booths common in old churches. The one-way mirror only allows one person to view the other, but when Travis enters the booth, he turns his chair to face away from Jane, so neither of the two can see each other. The two communicate through telephone handsets, reminding us of the wall that divides the booth in two.
In this pseudo-confessional booth, Travis tells a story to Jane, a story of a man madly in love with a young woman, a love that slowly devolved into jealousy, distrust and manipulation. The rose-tinted glasses we had previously viewed their relationship with are yanked off as Travis monologs why he walked out on her. The camera barely moves from its position, and the infrequent cuts center the attention on Travis and Jane. Reflections from the mirror blend two faces into one, visually overcoming the separation between them. While the scene might seem dully shot compared to the rest of the film, the simplicity is actually its biggest strength.
The first two-thirds of the film fully embrace the mythical status of the West. Each shot reinforces the notion of the West as a land of opportunity; a place where time stands still and life is a dream. The entire premise of the story rests on a man magically reappearing in the middle of nowhere and embarking on a mythological odyssey to reunite with his wife. Even the title “Paris, Texas” evokes ideas of a spectacular city on the same level as the French capital sitting in the middle of Texas.
But reality isn’t that magical — the man who reappeared in the desert has to reckon with his past failures and reconnect with the life he once lived. The West provides a land full of opportunity that can be squandered in one fell swoop. Paris, Texas isn’t some grand city, it’s a relatively small town complete with its very own scaled-down replica of the Eiffel Tower. The simplistic and almost boring climactic scene grounds the film firmly in reality against the idealistic nature of its beginning. It forces us to focus not on the surroundings, but on the characters and their flaws.
When watching “Paris, Texas,” it’s easy to feel nostalgic — not only for childhood, when life was easy and everything was an adventure, but for a simpler time without the stresses of modern life, a time the majority of us will never get to live in. 
The days of getting in a car and just driving out into the unknown, with no clear destination in mind, are harder to come by. Completely disregarding work, school or life in general to go on an adventure can be appealing, and yet out of reach for many of us. But in those few moments where the advent of walking away looks appealing, think back to Travis and Jane, and remember that what we leave behind is never really gone.
“Paris, Texas” is available to stream on HBO Max now.

2022-01-06,AU,club,"About Sex Work AU is a new campus organization bringing awareness to students about the sex worker community in the D.C. area. 
The organization began as a group project in Adjunct Instructor Aimee Richardson’s HLTH-323 Issues in Women’s Health class. 
“We look at health and we take health for granted,” Richardson said. “Being in the AU community, we live in this bubble. Our expectation is that health is eating right and exercising and for some people, it's really just getting general care.”
In the class, students create community-based learning projects centered around women’s health. Students indicate their topic of interest, and Richardson assigned them groups from there. 
“It’s not just about learning, it’s about giving back and working with communities that need assistance,” Richadson said. 
These projects, which have been a part of the class for several years, are more than just learning about women’s health, they’re about reaching into the community, Richardson said.
“I think it’s something that's really important and something that the AU community should be interested in,” Richardson said. “Especially living in the District of Columbia where sex work is a big part of the city.”
Matilde Eckford, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences, was interested in studying the health of sex workers. But soon, the class project turned into a club. 
The About Sex Work AU club is active on its Instagram page, where they post educational infographics, including the history of the sex work industry. Additionally, the club has been tabling inside the Mary Graydon Center to reach students. 
“It’s really just showing people that [sex work] is very normal. This is a real profession,” Eckford said. 
The main goal of the organization is to destigmatize sex work through education. On their Instagram, they’ve done this by posting information on where they post educational infographics, including the history of the sex work industry.
The organization used Instagram to properly define terms within the sex work industry. For example, the club defines sex workers as individuals who accept payment in return for sexual services as well as other commonly used terms like commercial sex, clients and third parties. 
“When you learn about specific terminology, and the ways in which those terms impact sex workers, and what terms are preferred, it helps break down stigmas,” Eckford said. “Then also you can use language that is not nearly as offensive and is better for education.”
According to About Sex Work AU, stigmas are the biggest barriers to the decriminalization of sex work. For example, sex workers living with HIV are faced with negative stereotypes. On its Instagram, the club also shares statistics about sexual violence and sex workers — sex workers have an increased chance of experiencing sexual violence while working and sex workers of color, migrant sex workers and transgender sex workers are at an even higher risk. Looking into the future, the group plans to break down these stigmas with students on campus. 
“It’s one of those things where I know a lot of people have a relatively liberal attitude towards sex work, but I think not too many people know more than OnlyFans or the real issues that a lot of sex workers face,” Eckford said. 
The group plans to become an official club this semester, with hopes to reach into the D.C. community by partnering with other organizations.

According to the club’s president and current senior in the College of Arts and Sciences, D.J. Daniels, AU Beekeeping offers a way for students to play an active role in fighting for a brighter, greener future.
“We’re definitely a cornerstone of sustainability,” Daniels said. “[It’s] also just a good place for environmentally inclined [students], or just students who are involved in the environment in sustainability on campus.” 
AU Beekeeping is a way to engage students in why bees are so important to the environment and gives them hands-on experience when taking care of the hives, said College of Arts and Sciences senior and Vice President Kira Fontana.
“We’re an environmental club, but through our love of bees and beekeeping,” Fontana said. “Our purpose is outreach and education.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture states that bees are a key part of agricultural production and healthy ecosystem function. Bees and the pollination they provide are directly tied to the nursery industry; seed plot’s performance and regrowing plant communities in rehabilitated areas are both influenced by the crucial pollination bees provide. And despite urbanization and intensification of farming, native bees are still able to provide bountiful crop visitation in various landscapes, contributing to not only financial gain, but also a diverse, healthy and balanced ecosystem. 
A 2019 study from the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that urbanization can lessen and decay the habitat of bees and other pollinators. Increasing urban development harms pollinators by a series of direct and indirect effects, many of which include urban warming, frequent and increased exposure to environmental contaminants and loss and modification of habitat.
AU Beekeeping offers an off-campus program where members can become certified beekeepers and an event called “Jeopard-BEE,” a trivia competition that puts participants’ bee knowledge to the test.
AU Beekeeping’s certified beekeeper program is offered through the DC Beekeepers Alliance, a non-profit association of beekeepers in Washington, D.C. Daniels said AU Beekeeping hopes to have a more active role in this program and continue collaboration in the future. 
Just like its members, AU Beekeeping recently took a more active role in helping to foster a culture of sustainability. The AU Beekeeping Society was involved in a fund where it helped renovate a beehive-reliant green roof in Mary Graydon Center. 
The coronavirus pandemic briefly hindered the group’s plans. Fontana said that the club didn’t host activities during the coronavirus because it was challenging to engage with people. 
“It was definitely difficult,” Daniels said. “We decided to take the 2020-2021 year off completely because it was too difficult to post things online and get things in order. Then coming back this year was definitely a struggle.”
However, Daniels admits this brief lapse of time came with its own benefits: 
“It gave us an opportunity to start fresh, gave us some time to reset,” she said, “And now we’ve got a brand new e-board coming in. It was great, and we’re able to hold more events than we have in the past as well.” 
For Fontana, AU Beekeeping is more than just a sustainability club: it offers space for like-minded students to work together on something they care about. 
“I definitely love the friendship and community aspect, it’s just really exciting to be with other students who also think bees are cool or want to help the planet in some way,” Fontana said. “It’s really fun to share that passion for these little creatures that are so important ecologically and do so much as pollinators. They’re so critical and it’s really important, especially as we urbanize more.”

2022-03-02,AU,club,"THE EAGLE
Founders Day Ball, Student Government’s most renowned event, was removed from the Founders Week programming this year. The Ball has been historically criticized by the student population due to its expensive nature and celebration of John Fletcher, AU’s founder who was a slave owner. Getting rid of Founders Ball is a positive step in reworking Founders Week. 
Jeremy Ward, American University’s first Black Founders director, told The Eagle that both the event’s meaning and COVID-19 policies are the reasoning behind the Ball’s absence. Ward hopes that the student body will reflect on the true meaning behind Founders, especially through the inclusion of affinity groups in the celebration. This Founders Day focused on the current AU community with open mic night, acapella, food events, a keynote speaker and more open attendance — the Ball typically has limited tickets — for the entire AU student body.
These events, which proved a commitment to better engage the AU community in Founders Week, deserved a bigger platform. In past years, the hype over Founders Ball was enough to garner student awareness. With the absence of the Ball, many students were unaware of Founders events leading up to the week. This may suggest a lack of communication between SG, the student body and the University. SG could have utilized physical flyers, decorations around the main center of campus or used social media more effectively. 
While the decision to remove the Ball is one The Eagle’s editorial board commends, SG has the opportunity to come up with another keynote event that draws in students toward the celebration that is less costly and engages more of the student body. Perhaps a casual outdoor gathering on the quad similar to Welcome Week events where students can celebrate together could be a model for future Founders weeks. 
Founders Week has come under fire in the past for climbing budgets. In 2019, SG spent a record high at approximately $140,000. This year, the budget for Founders Week was approximately $106,000. The budget for Founders Week have traditionally been explained by high costs for the Ball. Still, without a Ball, the student body deserves clarity on where and how this money is being spent. A breakdown of how this money was spent would help alleviate student concerns regarding this matter. So far, SG has not released how much money was actually spent on Founders Day. 
Ward’s commitment to recenter Founders traditions on clubs is promising. Many argue that the famed Founders Day Ball’s purpose was to form community, but that ignores the AU community that already exists on campus every day. This Founders provided student organizations with funds for events, meaning that clubs did not have to dip into their own budgets to participate. This should continue as a guide for SG to support the existing organizations on campus when looking to strengthen the community at AU past Founders Week. 
The absence of Founders Day Ball may have changed a decades long tradition of Founders Week, but it opened up the doors for better, more inclusive events at AU. Events like Embracing Change, which discussed the history of AU, are welcome modifications to Founders Week. Moving away from the “founder” part of Founders Week is a positive change that changes the spotlight to present-day AU, not the past.

2022-03-03,AU,club,"The Eagle hosted a roundtable discussion with multiple student-led affinity and cultural organizations Feb. 17 with the goal of identifying areas that we have overlooked or underreported in the past so we can better serve the community.
Editors present at the meeting asked questions about how each organization wanted to see themselves reflected in The Eagle’s coverage, what types of coverage would lend itself best to each organization, harmful stereotypes frequently seen in the media that should be avoided in reporting and what The Eagle and other mainstream media tend to get wrong.
The Eagle is using this input to help generate story ideas, such as increasing coverage of queer students of color, transgender and nonbinary students, students on the aromantic spectrum, the presence of ableism on campus, racial and ethnic identity and more.
Editors also asked questions about how communication and transparency could be made more effective. As a result of this feedback, The Eagle published a guide to our reporting and interviewing methods in order to make interviewees more well-informed of our reporting processes and the journalistic terminology a reporter may use with them if they are ever approached for an interview. 
Based on feedback about our reporting processes from the student groups at the roundtable, editors also discussed trauma-informed interviewing practices with reporters in the event of reaching out to an affinity or cultural group for comment about a tragedy or other negative event that has affected them.
The Eagle and select student groups also discussed expanding the pool of students being contacted for interviews on particular issues as a way to diversify the voices being featured in our coverage.
If your student organization or club would like to be involved in the next roundtable discussion, please contact editor@theeagleonline.com.

2022-03-04,AU,club,"World Series champion Ryan Zimmerman announced his retirement on Feb. 15 after 16 years with the Nationals. As a result of spending his entire career in D.C., Zimmerman is one of the faces of D.C. sports. 
During the 2019 World Series, Zimmerman hit .208, including 5 home runs. Zimmerman played a critical role in the Nationals’ World Series win. Zimmerman hit the first World Series home run in Nationals’ history. The home run was hit off of four-time all-star Gerrit Cole’s 97mph fastball, making Zimmerman’s run a monumental moment in the National’s franchise. 
The Nationals drafted Zimmerman as their first pick during the 2005 draft. As a two-time all-star, two-time silver slugger, a golden glove recipient and a career batting average of .277, Zimmerman had 16 monumental years with the Nationals.
Zimmerman made an official statement via Twitter announcing his retirement. 
Today, Ryan Zimmerman announces his retirement from the game of baseball. Thank you Ryan for all that you have done both on and off the field!⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣A message from Employee No. 11 ...⁣⁣ pic.twitter.com/BOwfsjS4Yo
“Ryan's numbers and accomplishments speak for themselves, but the way he led by example and was respected not only in our clubhouse but around the game,” Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said in a statement. “That is what I will remember most about his career.” 
Off the field, Zimmerman founded the ziMS Foundation, which is dedicated to the treatment and ultimate cure of Multiple Sclerosis, a disease that affects the central nervous system. Zimmerman’s mother was diagnosed with MS in 1995.
“My family has given me the support to fulfill my dreams. The Washington Nationals have given me the opportunity to play the game that I love at the highest level in our nation’s capital,” Zimmerman said on his website. “I am thrilled to have launched a foundation that I hope can make a real impact in the life of my family as well as many others afflicted by MS.” 
Since its founding, the ziMS Foundation has raised more than $3,500,000. 
After 16 years in D.C., Zimmerman’s legacy will live on through the ziMS Foundation and, of course, the 2019 World Series.

2022-03-05,AU,club,"American University’s Disabled Student Union hosted a vigil for Disability Day of Mourning in front of Kay Spiritual Center on March 1, which focused on detailing the lives lost because of ableism and the betrayal disabled people face in society.
The vigil was held following months of activism from AU students and the DSU raising concerns about numerous new COVID-19 policies instituted by the University, with students vocalizing concerns about the lack of mandatory testing, issues with masks and classroom requirements. 
The event started with a short speech given by Katherine Greenstein, the president of DSU, explaining the importance of hosting the vigil. Disability Day of Mourning falls directly after Rare Disease Day on February 28th.
“[Disability Day of Mourning] is something we take with incredible honor every single year on March 1,” Greenstein said at the vigil. 
After the short speech, students took five minutes of silence to mourn lives lost to abuse, filicide and other forms of ableism. 
Helena Milburn, DSU secretary, said she hopes the vigil was able to create a safe space for disabled students on campus. 
“I’m glad we were able to remind people that there are resources available for them – that the e-board is there for them if they need anything,” Milburn said.
While being glad and hopeful to be giving to the AU community, DSU members also acknowledged the weight and meaning this day holds for many.
“I would be happy if we don’t have to hold this vigil next year,” Laura Polomis, treasurer of the DSU said. “But that won’t happen, so we will continue to mourn and amplify the voices of our peers.” 
Kaniya Harris, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and director of Women’s Initiative, was among the students in attendance at the vigil. Harris said she was glad that the vigil was able to shed light on a serious topic.
“My family has always been involved in volunteering and helping the disability community, and I grew up at home surrounded by that,” Harris said. “It’s nice to see students show up for something I feel strongly about.”
Harris also mentioned concerns for the local D.C. community, specifically citing the district’s unhoused population. 
“What AU students don’t understand is that they go out clubbing, maskless, and walk through the streets, potentially spreading COVID to vulnerable populations in our communities,” Harris said. 
In 2019, 36.3 percent of people experiencing homelessness in D.C. were found to be chronically unhoused —– meaning they are people with disabilities who have been experiencing homelessness for over a year. This is one of the highest rates of chronic homelessness in the country. 
The vigil also addressed a lack of action from the University in listening to demands made by students at AU on COVID-19 policies. 
“They have the resources,” said Jackson Beauregard, an attendee at the vigil and a junior in the School of Public Affairs. “We saw AU require mandatory testing twice a week during the minimester, we know it’s not that they don’t have the resources. AU is putting the emotions of AU students before those that require these accommodations.” 
Greenstein also expressed their fear and frustration over the way AU has been handling its COVID-19 policies in an interview with The Eagle after the vigil. They showed frustration in the way AU has handled COVID-19 policies, specifically mandatory testing.
“It’s awful, just awful,” Greenstein said. “The University hears us, but they aren’t listening to us.”
In a statement to The Eagle, AU spokesperson Elizabeth Deal said the University continues to support the AU community and address concerns. 
“The health and safety of our community remains our priority and our protocols, including vaccine and booster requirements and surveillance testing, help support the well-being of all community members,” Deal said. 
Deal said the University encourages students with specific accommodations or health issues to contact the Academic Support and Access Center to access resources for disability-related accommodations.
“AU doesn’t protect us, we protect ourselves,” Polomis said.

2022-03-05,AU,club,"American University Archives and the Founders Week Committee showcased an exhibit on the first floor of Bender Library with a comprehensive overview of American University’s history and an acknowledgment of AU founder John Fletcher Hurst’s ownership of enslaved people.
Titled Embracing Change: AU Rising to the Challenges, the exhibit showcased various historical items, including yearbooks, letters and student publications, dating back to the beginning of AU to nearly the present day. 
The exhibit was put together with the work of Founders Director Jeremy Ward, Programming Graduate Assistant for the Center of Student Involvement Madeline Portilla, Michelle Eller and Sarah Graff from the University library and Associate Archivist Leslie Nellis.
The exhibit also noted that Hurst and his family were “active participants in Maryland chattel slavery.”
Check out the new exhibit created in collaboration with the Founder's Week Committee and #AULibrary. Embracing Change: AU Rising to the Challenge. This timeline highlights AU's actions in the face of complex challenges throughout its history. https://t.co/I5jZKQ6gi4
Nellis said conversations surrounding Hurst’s ownership of enslaved people happened around Founders Week in 2018, after a column published in The Eagle discussed the relationship to slavery in AU’s founding.
“So when I talked with my colleagues working on the exhibit, I said that ‘we're going to acknowledge this, right?’ And they said, ‘Oh, yeah,’” Nellis said. “It was definitely a priority of Jeremy and Maddie …  to acknowledge that history.”
The beginning of the exhibit had a chart with a color-coordinated timeline. The color blue on the timeline highlights instances of “War, Peace, and Government” that occurred in American University’s history: green for “Climate Change and Environmental Activism,” purple for “Advancing Gender and Sexuality Equity,” orange for “Racial Equity Milestones” and red for “Global Campus.”
The exhibit contained copies of a few student publications like The AU Women’s Newsletter, News and Views from the International Student Community, The Jewish Pickle, Campus Republican and The Blackprint.
There are also yearbooks from 1931, 1963, 1971, 2004 and 2009 with student pictures, and various campus activities and clubs. The exhibit included a shovel used in the groundbreaking of the School of International Service on June 9, 1957.
The one thing Nellis wanted to include in the exhibit but didn’t make the cut was “ ... a lot of the individual student protests that took place between about 1968 and 1975.” She said there were numerous protests and students had varying demands about being anti-Vietnam War, other domestic issues and the way AU was run.
“We tried to put in some key ones or key ways that actually spurred change on campus,” Nellis said.

2022-06-13,AU,club,"AU's food pantry opened its doors in September 2017 to students experiencing food insecurity on campus. 
In fall  2020 in the United States, 30 percent of four-year-university students said they experienced food insecurity in the past 30 days, according to Health Affairs, and it disproportionately affected students of color. 
The Market, AU’s 24/7 food pantry, is located in MGC 308 to change the largely felt reality of food insecurity for students. The Market has both short and long-term goals to help students and change the conversation around food insecurity as a whole, in addition to providing access to students who may not have Eagle Bucks or remaining meal swipes.
Understanding the needs of students on campus and ensuring that there are healthy produce and food options, as well as setting up different partnerships with organizations at AU is necessary, said food pantry advisory board member Emily Stinneford, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences and the head of marketing and outreach for the pantry.
“[The Market’s] missions are community partnerships with organizations in the greater DC area and providing fresh produce with larger goals of ending food insecurity and decreasing inequality with the understanding that The Market is not the end of the discussion,” Stinneford said. 
Collaborations between The Market and other organizations are in the works right now too, such as AU’s Community Garden and 4P Foods, a local and farm-fresh food delivery service, to support their mission of improving the quality of what the pantry offers.
“We have the funds and the means to choose where we are getting produce,” said Stinneford. “We not only provide for students who need the pantry and deserve access to fresh and healthy foods but at the same time [we are] giving back to the community and supporting ethical farming practices.”
However, many students are unaware of the pantry’s existence in part because of the under-discussed topic of food insecurity. 
“I think there is a stigma associated with food insecurity, especially at a predominately wealthy, private university like American University. It’s not something a lot of people talk about on a regular basis,” said Stinneford.
Some critiqued the university for contributing to this dilemma.
“The pantry does not benefit a key demographic of American University’s money-making constituency,” said Lily Billotti, a sophomore in CAS who uses the pantry. 
Billotti also claims that The Market is not a priority because lower-income students such as herself are not paying full tuition and not monetarily supporting AU meaning the University doesn’t want to support The Market.
“There is no budget approval process, and I am the staff operations manager for The Market Food Pantry,”  said Associate Director of Student Engagement Calvin Haney. “As a donation funded operation, The Market Food Pantry is regularly working to balance between the two competing forces of the needs of our student users and ensuring fiscal responsibility with the funds we are provided to ensure we have enough food to cover a given need in the academic semester.”
In the future, Billotti said she hopes to see fliers around campus like there are for other programs (such as student clubs and performances), increased social media presence and for the University and the pantry to listen to students more. 
“I don't fault this on anyone working on the program, but I wish they would listen to the feedback form. The pantry, except for a couple of items, isn’t healthy in my experience,” Billotti said. “What we ask for is largely ignored because [the items] are too expensive. So, I think more students would be open to the pantry if the food was healthy.”
One AU student discussed her knowledge and experience of food insecurity including but also beyond The Market. 
Zahra Udaipurwala, a sophomore in CAS, said that there is a great spectrum of socioeconomic statuses at AU from students and their level of need for the pantry. Udaipurwala said that the pantry is only briefly mentioned on AU’s website and that she only knows about it because of her friend who uses it.
“Personally, I’ve seen food insecurity with my friends at AU. The fact that it exists and is accessible to students is great but I do know students of color who use it, actually,” said Udaipurwala. “It is not as stocked as you think it would be. It’s very variable depending on the days of the week and time of year it seems. There is little consistency in the type of food you’ll find if you’ll find food there or not.”
A major issue has been the expense of food around the country and at the pantry, but centering on equality and food justice is a priority for The Market which seems to have more means. The Food Justice Symposium is being put on by AU Professor Garrett Graddy-Lovelace and students working in the Unity Coalition and the Center for Environment, Community and Equity. 
“[The symposium] is meant to connect people on campus and in the community who are researching or working in food and food justice. There will be a panel and our Market Pantry coordinator and leader Calvin Haney will be on the panel,” said Stinneford.
Food insecurity continues to go beyond campus as well, creating an ongoing struggle for all college students and often many other young adults. This subject is often not discussed because of taboo as well as lack of general resources for this underserved population. 
“We will never have the capability to meet the range of wishes that are identified by student users, but over the academic year, we have sought to offer a greater diversity of food items and toiletry resources than in the past,” Haney said. “Our commitment is to continually innovate and meet the needs of our AU students who experience food insecurity.  We continue to welcome your feedback and giving.”
“We understand we are a necessary resource right now, but it's really important that we have funding and are able to provide it,” Stinneford said. “We are definitely looking for greater institutional changes in the university and the broader community outside of just having a place for students to have food.”

2022-07-08,AU,club,"American University is known for its environmental consciousness, priding itself on being the first university to reach carbon neutrality. AU was recently selected as a 2022 U.S. Department of Education “Green Ribbon Schools'' Post-secondary Sustainability Awardee. Admittedly, AU has taken progressive steps in building sustainability plans to achieve groundbreaking goals and milestones. Yet, the impression of a green campus is a narrow, performative illusion that has overshadowed student efforts in maintaining this image. Students demand and deserve more communication, transparency and support from the administration to breed an environmentally sustainable culture involving all contributors, not just the students alone.
On April 14, the AU Community Garden announced that the garden will be demolished to build the new Center of Athletic Performance (CAP) in fall 2023 instead of the initial two to five-year plan to relocate the garden. The news shocked everyone as the garden has served the community by providing a safe and green space, carefully nurtured by its members and volunteers. On top of their regular duties and routines to take care of the garden and plan for next semester, the garden leaders have been working tirelessly to chase down responsible representatives that have not communicated clearly about the plan for the garden. During an April 11 meeting, Leonardo Casas, AU Senior Project Manager, told the gardeners that AU was destroying the garden in the summer without plans to restore it. This devastating update was debunked when the garden leaders met with Anthony Cortes, Director of Capital Management and everyone involved in the CAP project on April 18. A new timeline was introduced at the meeting and they guaranteed that the plan would include administrative support throughout the process of relocating and rebuilding the garden to build a bigger and better one. 
Thankfully, there is a more definite and optimistic plan for the garden now, but this would not have happened if it were not for the garden’s fearless leaders’ determination and resiliency in uncovering the ideas and decisions made behind closed doors without their input. 
The lack of communication and transparency is a consistent behavior of AU when it concerns environmental projects initiated by students. The administration’s inaccessibility for students to reach out to representatives and access resources hinders the garden’s progress and our goal of becoming more environmentally friendly. Even the Summary Narrative of AU’s application to Green Ribbon Schools heavily emphasized the role of the garden and the University’s financial support towards clubs dedicated to improving sustainable outcomes around campus. Yet, the so-called “sustainability fund” has never been consistent or enough for clubs like the AU Community Garden to utilize. The lack of funding restricts the garden to more conservative projects. Therefore, bigger and bolder proposals like building a greenhouse or a pond were pushed back or rejected. AU seems to only care about environmental sustainability for superficial purposes, such as the aesthetics of the Arboretum and the benefits of tourism and recruitment, greenwashing and fostering a culture of “look, but don’t touch.”
Unlike the “culture of sustainability” AU claims to have, there is a lack of unity within our community. Stemming from the lack of collaboration with administration, students feel as though no one is in the loop of knowing what is going on, including professors in the environmental science department and many other related departments. Garden members and other AU community members were distraught prior to the updated information the leaders unearthed by relentlessly hassling administrative people for answers. It was also disheartening to witness AU leaving sustainability behind again by leaving the garden out of the 2021 Campus Plan. Disjointed words about the garden were tossed around without consulting with the members who take care of the garden. Students are then forced to clarify the situation and make room for themselves when the administration should have guaranteed their space in the plan in the first place. 
Although progress is slow, students and faculty members remain persistent. For instance, Valentina Aquila, a professor within the Department of Environmental Science, created an email chain that links all environmental science and studies majors for better communication and exposure to opportunities circulating within the community. Despite the positives, many setbacks and unfinished projects were left behind due to the lack of commitment from AU. Students have presented projects that were approved by the Learning by Leading program. However, when it came down to funding and facilitation of implementing projects, students did not receive financial or actionable staff support. The program encouraged leadership in expanding student-run environmentally focused projects with scarce and unconstructive mentorship. Therefore, projects were rarely followed through due to financial concerns and a lack of resources. In the end, many promising projects are swept under the rug, neglected and left behind. 
The AU Community Garden and environmental advocates need more than verbal support. Although student activism is essential in building an inclusive green campus, the student effort has been one-sided and AU has been taking credit for their work without providing the support they need. Suppose AU will brand and brag about its commitment to building an environmentally sustainable space in the Bender tunnel and during campus tours. In that case, AU’s decision-making process should prioritize the garden and the needs of the students. A sustainability leader requires AU to approach with more top-down actions and united teamwork among administration, faculty members, clubs and organizations and the student body.

2022-07-08,AU,club,"Whether it’s their first Pride month or their 53rd, AU's LGBTQ+ students and faculty all carry a different Pride story. Each experience is unique and filled with feelings of joy, grief, frustration and peace. 
""For the longest time I didn't think queerness was something to celebrate,"" said Fabby Rincon, a rising sophomore at AU studying Journalism and Political Science. This year is Rincon's first Pride month being out to her friends and family, and she says AU played a large part in helping her discover and celebrate her sexuality. ""I've never been at a more openly queer place than this school. Being in a place where I was not only surrounded by allies but queer people is a whole other world."" 
Living on campus last year exposed Rincon to a community where LGBTQ+ individuals not only existed, but openly celebrated their identity and advocated for themselves. 
""The ability to be in a space that accepted me so openly made me more comfortable in my identity,"" Rincon said. 
For Rincon, Pride month is also about freeing herself from the temptations of ""compulsive heteronormativity"" and letting go of her stigma against celebrating queerness. This year she is celebrating sexuality for the first time by attending the NYC Pride Parade. 
Marnie Twigg, a professor of Literature and Women’s and Gender studies, attended their first D.C. Capital Pride Parade at 18 years old with their girlfriend. They described it as a beautiful accumulation of people and their “first real exposure to gay pop culture."" They added, ""There's a sense of togetherness that isn't something you often get on the D.C. club and bar scene, especially in the early 2000s."" 
In D.C., there are few LGBTQ+ bars and nightclubs, but the most iconic bar before 2016 was Phase One — the oldest lesbian bar in the United States. 
""Phase One was crazy during Pride; Jello wrestling, people dancing on the bars, and drag king shows,"" Twigg said. However, the queer community has lost many of those celebratory spaces. ""There are a lot of places we lost during the pandemic, but the best part about AU is where we are, and you have to be willing to go digging to find your queer community,"" Twigg said. 
Now, as Twigg has taken a backseat to the D.C. club and party scene, celebrating Pride month to them means passing on their knowledge and experience, ""As I got older, pride for me became something deeper and more internal. I want to pass on the stories of the little things, the crazy things, the fun things about D.C."" 
Katie Greenstein, a rising junior from St. Louis, Missouri, described past Pride parades as a space of pure ""queer joy"". However, this year was different, due to the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade. 
""Justice Clarence Thomas wrote explicitly that he was coming for contraception and same-sex relationships. We have to take that threat seriously. It's not just a threat. It's a promise,” Greenstein said, speaking of the decision. 
The threat of losing the right to marriage equality is a scary reality for Greenstein and the LGBTQ+ community, especially those living in states like Missouri. The weight of this possibility dampened their sense of celebration during the annual Pride parade.
""I wish that I could say that I was celebrating, but for the folks in our community, I think we tried, we tried to feel happy and excited, but we know better, and we know what's coming for us."" 
While at home, Greenstein said they felt a sense of loss. They know that at AU and in D.C., they have the privilege of feeling safe within their queer identity, ""I'm so unashamedly queer at AU, and it doesn't matter."" However, they are continuing to grieve for every home that doesn't have protection against LGBTQ+ hate, and they hope AU and the D.C. community will be ""a queer haven for the country.""
Kyle Johnson, the co-leader of AU’s LGBTQ+ Faculty and Staff Affinity Group, is working to create the haven that Greenstein longs for. His professional and personal life follows in the footsteps of LGBTQ+ advocates that take Pride beyond the month of June. He is working to create liberating spaces for queer people year-round, such as his work leading the LGBTQ+ affinity group. 
Throughout the year, Johnson facilitates an affinity group sponsored virtual coffee chat; LGBTQ+ AU students, faculty and staff gather to create relationships and community. These conversations are used to strengthen queer individuals' ability to feel represented, seen, and heard.
""If people need someone to talk to, they can reach out and use the connections they made during these chats,” Johnson said. ""A college is a place where students discover who they are, and a lot of times first-year students learn how to be their true authentic selves, and become comfortable enough to tell their friends and families back home, but unfortunately as we know that can backlash against them, especially financially."" Johnson alongside the rest of the affinity staff have created a LGBTQ+ resource fund to help students experiencing financial difficulties. 
On June 17, the affinity group raised the progress pride flag, featuring colors that represent people of color, trans people, and those living with HIV/AIDs, on AU's quad, ""It demonstrates our dedication to the movement and AU's LGBTQ+ community."" Johnson happily added that this would become a yearly tradition. 
Pride month is more than accepting others and their identities; it is a celebration. Every student, staff, and faculty member has their own unique way of honoring their queerness. For many, they attend their local Pride parade to commemorate a community that was once forced to be hidden. Rincon’s parade experience was nothing short of liberating
​​“This is my first pride where I’m so confident in my identity, I’m confident that this is me, and it’s one of the most freeing experiences ever,” Rincon said

2022-09-02,AU,club,"The American University Student Government will use $45,000 to provide stipends for the 2022-2023 academic year, an increase of $1,000 from the previous year. The payments are for members of the executive board and their cabinets. Members of the Undergraduate Senate do not receive stipends, with the exception of the speaker. 
Executive board members, which includes the president, vice president, secretary and comptroller, will receive the largest stipends, each being allocated $6,000 for the upcoming school year. All members of the executive board will see an increase in stipends from the previous year. The president’s stipend increased by 17.6 percent, the vice president’s stipend increased by 29 percent, the comptroller’s stipend increased by 36.36 percent and the secretary’s stipend increased by 31.86 percent. 
Logan Galimi, SG comptroller and sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, oversees financial advocacy for the AU students as well as manages the SG budget.
“The finance committee looked at our governing documents and they were like we think you should all be paid equal,” Galimi said.
Alex Drakeford, a senator in the Finance Committee and a junior in SPA, said, “The logic was essentially that we did not want there to be a hierarchy between the executives in terms of payment, so we wanted to make it equal.”
Although stipends for executive board positions increased, some positions, like the speaker of the Undergraduate Senate and deputy comptroller, saw a decrease in the amount of money they will receive. Two new positions this year which are covered by the stipend bill are the executive chief of staff and executive chief of operations. Galimi said that these positions were created in an effort to streamline the process so that one person could accomplish the work that multiple positions used to separately complete.
“It's like, ‘Hey, you guys don't all need your individual chief of staff's. You can work together and we'll pay that one extra and then they can act as kind of a glue,’” Galimi said.
This summer SG adjusted and passed the 2022-2023 Academic Year Budget as well as a Stipend Allocation Bill. Both the budget and stipend bills were ratified by the Undergraduate Senate on June 3.
On May 27, SG Undergraduate Senate Finance Committee conducted a public forum with the AU community regarding questions on the proposed budget and stipend bill. These questions largely focused on the areas of the budget where there were the largest increases in funding. This allowed AU students to field questions regarding the upcoming changes before both bills were presented before the Undergraduate Senate for final deliberations.
Some of the most pressing pieces of the budget bill discussed were the increased funds for the Vice President’s programming fund to $14,500 from $6,000 the previous academic year. This funding is meant in part to increase awareness of SG activities and projects. In the 2021-2022 school year, these funds were used for giveaways and events.
Furthermore, Galimi said it was important to note that the programming boards are no longer allocated a stipend under SG so it was not covered in the recently passed bill. Those are people such as the Kennedy Political Union director and the Founders Week director that now receive their funds from the Center for Student Involvement directly. 
According to Galimi, CSI determined that the student-led Budget Advisory Committee made up of students from SG, the AU Club Council and student media was not operating successfully, so they separated where the programming boards’ money would be allocated from. 
Kydira Garfield, a sophomore in the School of Communication and the current director of KPU, said that the programming board’s funding not being tied to SG allows for more opportunities that would not have been available otherwise.
“It's a little bit more encompassing and gives a little bit more room to kind of do certain things that we didn't have the capabilities to do in previous years,” Garfield said.

2022-09-08,AU,club,"Parts of the City Ridge development on Wisconsin Avenue are beginning to open, eight years after the property was purchased by the developer Roadside. The space is designed to create a community that caters to people’s daily needs through residential, retail and office spaces. 
Spanning four buildings, 690 apartments ranging from studios to three bedrooms will house the residents of City Ridge. The studio apartments start at around $2,600 a month, with the 3-bedroom penthouses starting at around $10,000 a month. 
Rob Wolcheski, the lead developer for Roadside, said housing options are available for students, as City Ridge is a mile away from American University’s campus. 
The residential buildings, named The Branches, Botanica, Crescendo and The Coterie, include amenities such as rooftops, creator studios, greenhouses, fitness studios and more. Additionally, residents will be able to join The Ridge Club, the member-only pool and social club. 
The development includes 154,000 square feet of retail space, including the 82,000 square foot Wegmans Food Markets which opened in early July. Additionally, the development will include a 30,000-square-foot Equinox gym.
City Ridge will also house restaurants ranging from Tatte Bakery & Cafe to Taco Bamba with 22,000 square feet of restaurant space. Wolcheski says retailers will be looking to hire AU students.
“We view the AU community as part of the broader neighborhood,” Wolcheski said. 
Companies such as the headquarters for CAVA and Industrious will occupy 160,000 square feet of office space. 
Development of City Ridge
Roadside LLC, the developer of City Ridge, purchased the property from the Fannie Mae company in 2016. In the following eight years, the property went under a $715 million redevelopment.
When the process began, Roadside began meeting with members of the community to hear feedback. Such feedback was used in the leasing process and the design of open spaces, according to Wolcheski.
Additionally, Roadside worked with the McLean Gardens development to create the Neighborhood Advisory Committee as a way for residents to share their questions and concerns about the development.
“I think that they are welcoming the surrounding community, which includes McLean Gardens, with open arms. I think they've integrated themselves nicely into their community,” Adam Hoyt, advisory neighborhood commissioner for District 3C06, told The Eagle. 
Hoyt said he recognizes there may continue to be concerns about the construction and timeline of the development. However, Hoyt and Wolcheski both said lines of communication will remain open as City Ridge becomes more operational. 
“It’s been a labor of love here to make sure that there are minimal disruptions to our daily lives, but also understanding that there is a massive project being completed just next door,” Hoyt said. 
Throughout the development of City Ridge, Roadside worked to make the development process environmentally friendly. City Ridge is the first project in D.C., and the second nationwide, that received the LEED v4 ND for Gold Certification. The certification is awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council to neighborhoods that are created to be more sustainable.
Wolcheski says the certification came in part because of the stormwater management used at City Ridge. Storm water would typically run into the surrounding parks, impacting the trails and streams. The City Ridge development can retain up to 1.2 inches of rainwater on-site, with containers holding 260,000 gallons of water. 
Affordable Housing
In the early stages of development, ANC3 encouraged Roadside to include 20 percent affordable housing in the residential buildings. Roadside included eight to ten percent of affordable housing that is required under the inclusionary zoning for the property.
“We worked with the confines of the existing zoning at the site,” Wolcheski said. 
Seventy-five percent of apartments in Washington, D.C. are over $2,101 per month. In the McLean Gardens neighborhood, the average price for a studio apartment is around $1,850 per month. The average price for a studio in this area increased 36 percent in the last year, according to Rent.com. 
Hoyt acknowledged that enough has not been done to provide affordable housing in Ward 3. 
“It comes down to holding developers accountable when they want to build mixed-use spaces, making sure on the residential side of that that we’re doing all that we can to provide affordable housing as it’s been provided throughout the city,” he said.

2022-09-13,AU,club,"The Student Involvement Fair hosted by the Center for Student Involvement on the quad during the first week of class saw the University’s more than 200 clubs table and recruit new students. This was the first time in two years that the Involvement Fair was hosted in-person, after being held online in 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
From sports to politics to culture, students had a chance to learn more about the different clubs on campus and join ones that caught their interest. 
The turn-out for this year’s fair was better than expected according to Emily Minster, the director of political affairs for Leading Women of Tomorrow AU. This student-run club is dedicated to encouraging female-identifying students seeking jobs in public service and bridging gender gaps. Spread across the world, Leading Women of Tomorrow offers training and resource programs for students to build confidence in considering roles in government positions.  
“We’ve had a lot of engagement,” Minster said. “We’re getting a lot more people who seem really interested in getting involved which is exciting.”
AU’s club sports teams were also at the Involvement Fair, including the Women’s Club Lacrosse which had been inactive for a while and had become more and more active in the last two years. 
“We’ve definitely had some new players show up,” Celine Lawrence, co-president of the team said. “It’s pretty decent traffic, more than I think we expected.”
Ben Solomon, vice president of AU Gamers, a club dedicated to creating a sense of community through games, was glad that their community was able to reach a larger audience.
“I’m happy that freshmen are coming cause when I came here I was a transfer student and I saw this exact set up and was like, ‘Woah! They do this here?’” Solomon said. 
The large freshman class has also made an impact on the membership of clubs. Rude Mechanicals, a classical theater troupe at AU, has had a lot of freshmen and sophomores interested in joining the club this year according to Zoe Tompkins, Rude Mechanicals’ technical director.
“It’s nice to see everybody outside and getting involved,” Sania Parker, the social media liaison for Les Coeurs D’Afrique, AU’s African dance team, said. Parker said she thought the student turn out was good this year compared to last year’s Involvement Fair.
Students that attended were also surprised with the number of clubs that they found tabled this year.
Among those students was Scout Zischke, a freshman in the School of International Service.
“It’s been pretty good learning about the clubs I’m interested in,” Zischke said. “I had heard about the fair, so once my classes ended I decided to come and look around.”
Returning students equally showed their excitement for their first fair in-person. 
Maggie Loughran, a sophomore in SIS, said she was not familiar with many of the clubs that were there. 
“Most of the clubs that I’ve heard about were here so I feel like it’s a good event,” Carson Ley, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, said. “Last year when the fair was online it was hard to be able to see everything.”
Both Ley and Loughran said they were excited the Student Involvement Fair was in person as they both did not attend last year’s virtual fair. 
All of the clubs that were present at the fair can be found and joined through Engage. 
“There were a lot of students outside so that was really good. I'm glad to see all, if not most, of the clubs out on the quad because it wasn’t like this last year,” Parker said.

2022-10-07,AU,club,"Editor’s note: As a student media organization, The Eagle receives its funding allocation from the Center for Student Involvement. Nina Heller, The Eagle’s editor-in-chief, is part of the student media working group and was not a part of the writing, editing or reporting of this story. Sarah Mattalian, The Eagle’s managing editor for news, is the former co-chair of the Student Media Board and was not a part of the writing, editing or reporting of this story. 
Student media organizations did not receive undergraduate activity fee funding from the Center for Student Involvement for the 2022-23 academic year, a decision that comes as a result of a CSI review of student organization structures. 
In an email to The Eagle, CSI Director Ayana Wilson wrote that all campus organizations that have previously received funding from the undergraduate activity fee will continue to this academic year. However, this is with the exception of the Student Media Board, due to “a significant amount of rollover in reserve that needs to be spent down” by student media organizations.
“The purpose of the student activity fee money is to be used for and by students during the year allocated, not for large sums to be saved in a reserve account,” Wilson wrote. “All boards have used their reserves at one point or another to supplement programs and budgets.”
According to Wilson, this change is a result of a review of student organization structures that CSI began conducting over the summer and will continue throughout the academic year.
“3 separate workgroups have been created, one of which is for student media. The student working groups started meeting over the summer to review structures and consisted of students from the respective cohort and a CSI advisor,” Wilson wrote. “The working groups will make recommendations for updated structures that support better student engagement and use of activity fee money.”
Julia Rusnak, a senior in the School of Public Affairs and the outgoing general manager of WVAU, has served on the Student Media Board for the past two years. 
She said that, in previous years, two representatives from each student media organization would sit on the board, and each person would receive a stipend of between $400 to $800 per semester from CSI. The year before she joined the board, she said this funding was reduced, with only one representative from each student media organization receiving a stipend. 
An allocation of funds from the undergraduate activity fee, which costs $88.50 in undergraduate tuition for full-time students during the 2022-23 academic year, was divided evenly among Student Media Board organizations at the beginning of every semester. Rusnak said this “new money” is how stipends for representatives were supplied.
“We would each set our budgets and then whatever was left over from that new money, we would divide evenly for the stipend and then have however much left over for the student media release party, basically,” Rusnak said.
In addition to money from the undergraduate activity fee, student media organizations could also get support from a reserve fund, which included money from the student activity fee that was not used within the previous two semesters. Each organization could also spend from its specific rollover fund, which included any money its members did not spend the previous semester. No student organizations were allowed to handle their financial resources directly; CSI had to approve each individual expenditure.
According to Wilson, there will not be funding specifically allocated for Student Media Board representative stipends this academic year. She said this is because “the purpose of stipends is to support student leaders in various governance involvement positions that are tied to governance and additional responsibilities outside of their leadership position.”
“This year is about review and assessment,” Wilson wrote. “The work group will make recommendations, which could include stipend positions for consideration.” 
Rusnak said that, when Student Media Board representatives were receiving stipends, CSI stressed that this support was to compensate for their work on the Student Media Board and not their roles within their individual organizations. She said that this led to CSI leadership “[coming] up with things for us to do just for Student Media Board in order to justify us receiving a stipend for that job” — a policy she personally disagreed with.
“Especially coming out of COVID, I was of the opinion that we should be focusing on our own organizations rebuilding and adding to the campus community and not necessarily on busywork that people were just coming up [with] for us to do for Student Media Board,” Rusnak said.
Wilson wrote that decisions about stipends are made based on the idea that “each of the student cohorts serve different needs and have different responsibilities.”
Rusnak said this decision was frustrating because it made her feel that student media’s contributions to the University were being undervalued. 
“I just thought it was so disrespectful to insinuate that we should be doing that work just for free,” Rusnak said. “And all of us agreed we would do it for free because we love it, but being paid a stipend, not only is it a practical means of support but it’s also a signifier that the institution appreciates what we’re doing and that it appreciates the work we’re putting in.” 
Rusnak said she also worries that low-income students will face more barriers for participation in Student Media Board if stipends are not reintroduced, which she believes would fly “in the face of everything that AU says that they stand for.”
“I think it’s a huge, huge mistake on their part to not place that value on supporting us financially because you’re just gonna end up with an extremely homogenous group of privileged students,” Rusnak said.
In her email, Wilson wrote that there are “a multitude of students from diverse backgrounds serving in leadership roles both paid and unpaid.”
Although the Student Media Board is the only Club Council organization that will not receive undergraduate activity fee funding this semester, Student Government has undergone structural changes, including the separation of the Kennedy Political Union, the Student Union Board, Women’s Initiative and the Founders Week Committee from the SG organization. 
Ryan Hale, a senior in SPA and former undergraduate senator, said he and his fellow SG members felt CSI could have been more transparent about why such changes have been made.
“We have been told that we do not function properly as currently structured and so they’re changing every fault,” Hale said. “And to give them a little bit of credit, they did put out an application on our side of things for a working group and students could apply and they accepted students and those students are part of the process.”
However, Hale, who previously served as chair of the Undergraduate Senate's finance committee, said he would appreciate “an explanation as to why this was the method they chose” to address issues in Student Government. Prior to this year, SG’s Finance Committee would collaborate with its programming boards and executive officials to determine a budget. This budget would be presented in a public information session, go before the undergraduate senate and then the SG president would sign it into effect. 
According to Hale, this year was different, with CSI making “almost entirely” all of the budgetary decisions for SG. He said he would like to see CSI officials provide more detailed reasoning as to why significant financial changes have been made for both SG and the Student Media Board because he does not currently feel that the restructuring has made SG operations more efficient.
“All it has done in terms of a financial perspective alone, it has made it more difficult and less transparent,” Hale said.
Rusnak said she hopes that members of student organizations will join together to advocate for more financial transparency from CSI, and that it would be “a huge mistake for students in these positions to pit ourselves against each other or to see this as a fight for funding.”
“We’re not enemies, we’re not competing for funding. There is the money, like, we know that it exists and we know that, for the most part, we are trustworthy stewards of student funds because we care about this institution,” Rusnak said. “I don’t want anyone in Student Government or on any of the programming boards to think that we’re up against each other.”
Wilson wrote that CSI will review the recommendations made by the student workgroups and take those perspectives into consideration when making decisions about how to allocate undergraduate activity fee resources in the future.
“The purpose of student activity fee is to encourage strong and viable student-sponsored programs that contribute significantly to the intellectual and social development of the student body,” Wilson wrote.

2022-10-11,AU,club,"Sophomores Magnolia Mead and Summer Anwer sell flowers and clothes to AU students at the flea market. 
The Muslim Student Association, Sunrise Movement at AU, South Asian Student Association and Hindu Students Association hosted a flea market fundraiser for flood relief in Pakistan on Wednesday.
The event took place outside Butler Pavilion and had tables selling secondhand clothes, chai, books, flowers and henna. All sale proceeds went to Helping Hand for Relief and Development, an organization that provides assistance to countries in disaster situations around the world. Founded in 2005, Helping Hand helped over 176,000 people in the wake of the recent Pakistan floods. 
Summer Anwer, a sophomore in the School of International Service and MSA member, came up with the idea to hold a flea market. 
In Pakistan, the monsoon season lasts from June to September. This year, the floods were heavier, longer and more relentless than Pakistan has seen in decades, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.  
“I wanted to do a very active fundraiser,” Anwer said. “It's very hands-on, very engaged with the community so we can educate them on the floods. The flea market just kind of happened because I was thinking, well, everyone always has something to donate.”
In the week leading up to the flea market, some of the participating clubs called on students to donate books, accessories and clothes to sell at the event. Each of the four clubs involved advertised the market on their Instagram accounts. 
Anwar said she thinks it’s imperative for students, especially those in SIS, to understand the magnitude of real-world problems.
“We don’t have much of a spotlight compared to more predominantly white organizations, so it’s definitely important that we are supported by AU so that we can be on the same level,” she said.
As a collaboration between four clubs in response to a recent issue, the event was organized with the goal of raising money, but also awareness of the humanitarian crisis the flooding has created for Pakistani residents. 
“Having a shared solidarity around these movements is really important, so we really like collaborating with other clubs,” said Qudsia Saeed, a junior in the School of Education and member of MSA.
“This is very high stakes; this is very relevant,” Saeed said. “It’s something that we really are passionate about, and that's where all these clubs come together.”

2022-10-12,AU,club,"Environmental groups on campus gathered on Sept. 3 to celebrate the AU community garden and its members. 
AU’s environmental clubs came together to kick off the fall season with a celebration for the community garden and the people that care about it. The garden is located beside Reeves Field, where the event took place on Friday, Sept. 30.
“A lot of people came out and came out in the rain, so that just makes me really happy and hopeful about the future of the garden,” said Kat Raiano, a junior in the School of Public Affairs and the Communications Director for the community garden.
The community garden provides companionship and education, as it meets every Saturday from 12-2 p.m. for workdays and requires no previous experience. 
“I think that the garden is for everybody… I couldn't tell you half of the people here, I don’t know what their names are, but I do know that every Saturday I'll be there, we’ll have a good time, and that’s community,” said Samantha Margot, a junior in the School of Communication. 
The Garden Party was a way to catch up with those who have attended workdays and to meet fresh faces who are eager to join the community. The Garden Party showcased the value of cherishing the environment through a scavenger hunt, which encouraged people to find ingredients in the garden to put towards a pasta recipe. There was also a tie-dye station with dye made from plants from the garden. 
“[We] also have garden reflections … we started a big garden drawing last week where everyone took a minute and kind of drew something that is being lost or something that they really appreciate about the space,” Raiano said. 
Last semester, community garden members learned that AU’s Center for Athletic Performance building is in the works to be constructed in place of the garden, forcing a relocation, which many members are unhappy about.
“I obviously am very sad that the space that we’ve really cultivated, that we love and have really centered our community around, is being bulldozed in the name of monetary interest and short term monetary gain, as opposed to long term stability, sustainability of our community and a community on campus related to environmental issues,” Raiano said.
The music that played out of a stereo, combined with the rainy weather, cast the party in a sentimental light. Students were at each and every station, hugging and reminiscing over their shared memories and fears for the future of the garden. The members who put together the party ensured it would still go on despite the weather, which created a sense of determination and passion. 
“I hope that with this garden move, and this new attention that’s being placed on the garden, will actually maybe tell the administration that we are important and that there’s a large swath of campus that’s actually dedicated to the garden that wants the garden in their lives.,” Margot said.

2022-10-12,AU,club,"NBS performs an original song at Community Couture.
Community Couture, a fashion event hosted by AU’s clubs EGO Magazine, Revolution, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the AU Community Garden, Her Campus, American University Student Government and the Student Union Board, took place Oct. 6 at the amphitheater and Community Garden. The night featured a flea market of student vendors, club booths, student musical talents and a fashion show. 
The event's flea market booths not only showcased clubs from campus, but also student artists selling jewelry, clothes and art pieces. The booths provided students opportunities to shop while they took in the wonderful atmosphere of the evening. Among them were Jewelry by Gia, JMR Art and Thatch and Clover, whose creative talents are shoppable on Instagram, Etsy and Depop. 
Alongside the artistic booths featured at the event, student musical talents, including NBS, Mass Ave, Sara Wiser, Wrenmo and Liv Wood, kicked off the evening, each playing short sets from 6-8 p.m. The artists showcased original work, shared song covers and kept the energy high as students shopped, ate and enjoyed the show. Songs like NBS’s “Autumn” and Wrenmo’s “Dance Party in Hyperspace” showed off the original talent in the AU community that usually goes unnoticed without events such as these. 
Following the musical stylings of bands and soloists, a student fashion show demonstrated some of the unique styles and collections of AU students. Featuring creators such as Isabelle’s Crochet and Alejandro Vasquez, student models showcased designs of several vendors also featured at the event. 
Anne Waldron, a junior in the School of Public Affairs and the president of EGO Magazine, said she drew inspiration from the magazine’s fall edition. “The event is based on the theme of the latest issue, which was community,” Waldron said. This idea brought together an unlikely medley of student clubs and organizations, and by bringing together people from every corner of the campus, Waldron and EGO Magazine transformed the amphitheater for an evening.
Community Couture was a must-see event and is sure to be continued for many semesters to come. The atmosphere, community and creativity on display showed off some of AU’s finest talents. Opportunities like this one let students branch out and share their passions and talents with audiences they never would have reached before. Waldron and the rest of EGO Magazine accomplished their goal of “[bringing] a lot of student faces out of their dorms” and showcasing the beautiful communities that exist on campus.

As Family Weekend at AU got underway on Oct. 8, AU’s student-led, classical theater troupe Rude Mechanicals performed their annual variety show, titled ""Variety Show 2022: A Shakespeare’d Silver Screen"" for family and friends, where iconic scenes from pop culture are put through a Shakespeare translator and performed live. 
This year, actors interpreted a wide range of monologues from “Little Women” (Maddie Cooper as Jo and Morgan Kullen as Laurie), “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” (Satvik Shukla as Will), “Princess Diaries” (Eva Helfter as Mia), “Shrek” (Christian Englehardt as Shrek and Rin Carroll as Donkey), “The Matrix” (Lauren Seppala as Morpheus), “Clueless” (Gabby Landis as Cher) and much more. 
The variety show had humor in mind, with jokes landing with ease and receiving positive reactions from audience members. Famous lines were spoken in Old English or Shakespearean language, bringing a whole new twist and brilliant creativity to the show, surprising audiences left and right. The costumes were simple, all-black ensembles with one exception — a white ruffle collar, giving a nod to 16th-century fashion. Siena Maxwell, Mikaila Mack, Abigail Chase and Emily Ahern directed the show, with Maxwell being the one who put the script together.  
Mack, a senior in the School of Public Affairs and the executive director of Rude Mechanicals, said she is grateful to return to in-person operations after the coronavirus pandemic sidelined in-person performances and recruiting students became difficult when the club's operations were virtual during the 2020-2021 school year.
“I think tonight was the first time in a long time that we were able to really get back to a place of normalcy where parents can come and support their children, come support us,” Mack said. “I couldn't be more proud of how this whole show went up and how everything came together. I think it went really well, and I am excited to see what this troupe is able to do in the future.”
A major allure of acting is being able to receive immediate feedback from the audience and feed off of the energy in the room, which can not be offered in the same way over Zoom. Morgan Kullen, a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, appreciated performing with a live and supportive crowd for their first show at AU.
“My absolute favorite thing is before going on for either of my scenes I was in, was being able to listen to the other things going on,” Kullen said. “I love to hear what people are doing and I love hearing the audience's reaction; like yeah, you should be cheering and laughing for my friends.”
Going forward, Rude Mechanicals wants to build off of the fun momentum gained during the variety show.
“Honestly my goal is to get our name out there as much as possible. I think as it currently stands we are one of two semi-active student-led theater troupes on campus,” Mack said. 
“I believe it is us and the AU Players trying to make their way back. I know personally how hard it is to keep this kind of theater and experience alive, and so my goal is to give people as many opportunities as possible and take this troupe as far as it can go.”

2023-02-13,AU,club,"Entering February brings about a couple changes: the constant struggle to spell the month’s name, day’s getting just a little bit warmer and, of course, the most romantic holiday of the year. But right around this candy and heart filled time of the month is a monumental holiday all about friendship, fun and hanging out with friends: Galentine’s Day.
Here’s a list of some options to help you celebrate Galentine’s Day in style.
See a comedy show
D.C. has some great comedy spots to keep you laughing all night. Going with a group of friends is sure to be a fun time and a good way to indulge in some horrible Valentine’s Day stories.
The Comedy Loft of DC has some great upcoming performers and events this Galentine’s Day, such as Alingon Mitra, Matt Rife, Yolks on You Burlesque and Variety Brunch and more. The Comedy Club has a variety of different comedians per show to give you a range of sets each night. Or why not try The DC Improv Comedy Club that has various stand-up performers, including specials on Valentine’s Day with Wil Sylvince and Couples Therapy.  
Host a dinner party
For a more intimate experience celebrating your friends, try hosting a dinner party. Theme it Galentine’s Day to have an excuse to get all dressed up with your friends. Have each person bring their favorite dish to the dinner, or if cooking isn’t up your alley, order takeout from one of these restaurants. It’s the perfect opportunity to have a great meal and try something new with your close friends. 
Have a game night
If you’re looking for a more chill game night, play a low- stakes card game that helps you get to know more about each other, like We’re Not Really Strangers, For the Girls or Let’s Get Deep. If the mood for a longer game hits, play something like Catan, Monopoly or Clue. 
Charcuterie or fondue night
Why not host a charcuterie or fondue night? Everyone can bring a dish to add to the meal. If it’s a charcuterie night and the weather is permitting, take it mobile and host it by the Georgetown waterfront, on the National Mall, at the Wharf or stay local and have it on the AU quad. 
For a fondue night, have a nice night at home, dipping all the best treats in fondue while you snuggle up to a comforting movie together. Some classic Galentine movies are Mean Girls, She’s the Man, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Clueless or The Other Woman. But really any movie that brings nostalgia is enjoyable, and, of course, a good girl power message would be perfect to pair a fondue night.
No matter what option you chose from this list, just make sure Galentine’s Day is celebrated in style, focusing on loving friendships, strong bonds and cherished relationships. In the wise words of Leslie Knope, “What’s Galentine’s Day? Oh, it’s only the best day of the year.”

2023-03-09,AU,club,"A protester holds a sign at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C. on March 24. 
One week into 2023, a 13-year-old boy named Karon Blake was fatally shot in the Brookland neighborhood in Northeast D.C. The next week, one woman was killed and another teenager and man were injured in a shooting in the district’s Benning Ridge neighborhood. At the start of February, D.C. Metro worker Robert Cunningham was killed and three passengers were injured during yet another shooting, this time in the Potomac Avenue Metro station. 
Overall, homicides are up 33 percent in the district from this time last year, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
Shootings in D.C. follow a larger national trend of rising rates of gun violence, with nearly 8,000 shooting deaths since the beginning of the year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, an online log of gun violence incidents that provides “near-real time” data on gun violence in America. 
Amid this increase in gun violence, many lawmakers and advocacy groups based in D.C. have policies and proposals to reduce shootings in the district.
Understanding the issue
Advocates and experts say that the first step in preventing gun violence is understanding the issue. 
Crime can be placed into two main categories: violent and property/socioeconomic, according to Jeff Dickinson, an economics adjunct professorial lecturer at American University. Violent crime would include events like homicide, assault and sex abuse, while property crime describes burglary, vehicle theft and arson, he said. 
D.C. was known as the “murder capital” in the early 1990s when homicides numbered over 400 for five years in a row. Experts attribute this to the introduction of crack cocaine and turf wars. 
Though violent crime in D.C. decreased 7 percent last year compared to 2021, homicides topped 200 for the second time in nearly two decades, according to MPD. Sixteen of these deaths in 2022 were of minors. 
In this graph created by Dickinson, gunshot events are shown to be relatively stable until 2020, when the city, and many others, saw a large spike in gun violence, according to Open Data D.C. 

Wards 7 and 8, both predominantly Black, historically have higher rates of gun violence than other wards due to the effects of disinvestment in these neighborhoods. Consequences of redlining, poverty and lack of economic opportunities contribute to the levels of crime. The Justice Policy Institute cites poor investment in education in the district to be a driving force of public safety. 
Wards 5, 7 and 8 in relation to American University.

Economic opportunity is an important way to decrease crime, according to Dickinson. He said that the cause of rising crime is always going to be the economic conditions of the area. 
Dickinson emphasized that, “in the absence of economic opportunities,” the cost of partaking in criminal activity is lower. But with opportunities such as schooling and careers, there is more to lose — the cost of committing a crime is higher. This is why he says it’s imperative that the D.C. neighborhoods with higher rates of crime and gun violence receive more access to resources from the government and other entities. 
One pressing issue is the lack of funding for D.C. public schools, specifically those in Southeast D.C., where Wards 7 and 8 are located. In 2020, 17 of the 20 public schools that underwent budget cuts were in Southeast D.C., according to the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Additionally, Black residents experience more aggressive and frequent policing by MPD. In 2020, a D.C. Council report showed Black people accounted for 88 percent of stops, 91 percent of arrests and 100 percent of use-of-force incidents in the district. Many community members and advocates are fighting against high levels of police presence in Southeast D.C. and say policing is not the solution to ending gun violence. 
As of March 2023, violent crime in all of D.C. is down 8 percent, while property crime is up 32 percent compared to 2022, according to MPD data.

Peace for D.C. - How a local organization is fighting gun violence
There are numerous gun violence prevention organizations throughout the nation and in the district. Peace for D.C. is taking a unique approach. 
Founded in 2021, Peace for D.C. is “dedicated to amplifying and accelerating evidence-based community-led efforts to stop shootings and homicide and heal trauma in Washington, D.C.,” according to its website. 
“While gun violence continues to spread throughout the District, it most deeply impacts our Black and Brown communities,” its website says. “These same communities have been locked out of opportunity as they endure structural and systemic marginalization, trauma, and poverty. D.C. cannot increase economic mobility, close the wealth gap, or achieve equity in education without meeting the basic need for personal safety and freedom from violence.” 
Co-founder and Strategy and Advocacy Lead Rachel Usdan spoke with The Eagle about the organization’s work. 
“I really became most passionate about trying to work with and focus on violence intervention work in D.C. because I learned about how much potential there was for stopping shootings and building peace through that work,” Usdan said. 
“These are the neighborhoods that have been disinvested and disadvantaged … for so long,” Usdan said of Wards 7 and 8.
Peace for D.C. works with community leaders who have credibility and trust in their neighborhoods to help people put down the guns and turn their lives around. Usdan believes that by using this method, the organization “can really drastically reduce violence.” 
The organization’s biggest program is D.C. Peace Academy, a 13-week classroom training program where violence intervention employees from various organizations learn about topics such as conflict resolution, healthy masculinity and cognitive behavioral theory. 
Usdan said she is really proud that Peace for D.C. seems to be “pushing the city in the right direction.” The organization communicates with local government officials; D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser even spoke at two of the Peace Academy’s graduations. 
“The city needs to implement a full plan to address this head on in a holistic way,” Usdan said. “We can’t just police our way out of this. We need to help kids understand how to resolve conflict and how to heal from traumatic experience that they’ve been through and how to … build peaceful lives.”
How D.C. lawmakers pledge to decrease gun violence
The 2022 elections elevated many new D.C. lawmakers who have pledged to work toward reducing crime and specifically gun violence in the city. 
One potential pathway to reducing gun violence is the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, a 500-page rewrite of the existing D.C. criminal code that has been in the works for over a decade. The city’s current criminal code hasn’t been comprehensively updated since 1901, and the new law would not take effect until 2025. 
The D.C. Council passed the act in November 2022, but Mayor Bowser vetoed it in January. She released a letter saying that while she supports 95 percent of the bill, she is concerned with certain aspects that would reduce maximum penalties for certain offenses. 
“It’s more important to get this opportunity right than to add policies & weaken penalties into what should be a bill that makes D.C. safer,” she wrote in the letter. 
The council overrode her veto 12-1 on Jan. 17, with only Ward 8 Council member Trayon White Sr. voting against it. 
Mayor Bowser has since introduced The Revised Criminal Code Amendment Act of 2023, which would alter some policies in the original RCCA and would not go into effect until 2027. 
However, Congress has the final say on D.C. legislation, and the U.S. House of Representatives voted to block the bill on Feb. 9 in a congressional disapproval resolution. 
On March 8, the Senate voted 81-14 to block the bill as well. Biden said in a tweet on March 2 that if the Senate overturns the bill, he will support that and sign the disapproval resolution. 
Matthew Frumin, who represents Ward 3, AU’s ward, on the D.C. Council told The Eagle, “The blunt instrument of a veto … and the blunt instrument of congressional disapproval resolution made no sense and undermined enormous and responsible work.”
A congressional disapproval resolution in D.C. has not succeeded in about three decades.

Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker considers the RCCA a “long overdue and common sense modernization” of D.C.’s criminal code. 
“I support the legislation because years of evidence-based research, dialogue, debate, public engagement, and thoughtful improvements went into producing it, and because I truly believe it will foster healthier communities by creating a more uniform penalty system, reducing sentencing disparities that fall hardest on Black men and their families, and expanding jury rights,” Parker wrote in an email to The Eagle. 
“We know that what deters crime and creates healthy communities isn’t stiff penalties: it’s sufficient support and resources,” he continued.
Frumin reiterated this, saying that, “We need to devote the resources in other parts of the city to help lift folks up so they’re not experiencing anything like the levels of crime that they’re experiencing now … We’re creating a sense of hope in communities where there hasn’t been a sense of hope.”
Ward 5 has the third highest rate of gun violence in the district, and Parker believes that the district’s current approach to public safety is not working. He says that more policing “will not address the fact that our approach unfairly and disproportionately harms our Black and brown neighbors,” according to his website. 
Parker said in an email that in briefings with MPD he has learned that over the past several months, violent crime and gun crime is down overall both in Ward 5 and across the city and that property crime is up. 
“While we are encouraged by these trends, the tragic killing of Karon Blake—along with all instances of gun violence in this city—is a direct result of the prevalence and proliferation of guns in our communities,” he wrote in the email, calling gun violence a “public health crisis.”
Parker emphasized the importance of integrating racial justice in the fight against gun violence, saying that it is “critical that lawmakers always consider racial equity impacts and accessibility to resources across income levels.” 
As for Mayor Bowser, she has been working towards eradicating gun violence throughout her three terms as rates have increased since she first took office in 2015. She created Building Blocks DC through the Office of Gun Violence Prevention in 2021. The Bowser administration identified 151 blocks that were the location of 41 percent of all gunshot-related crimes, according to its website. The strategy was a “data-driven approach that used a comprehensive block-by-block analysis to pinpoint specific areas where gun violence is a constant reality for residents.” 
The initiative shifted structure in 2022 as crime continued to rise and some worried that the program lost its initial focus and urgency. 
March for Our Lives at American University
March For Our Lives is a gun violence prevention organization and social justice movement that is “dedicated to promoting civic engagement, education, and direct action by youth to eliminate the epidemic of gun violence,” according to its website. It was started by students following the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which 14 students and three staff members died and 17 others were injured.
The organization now has a network of chapters across the country, including one at AU that began in spring 2019. Samantha Hamilton, an AU alumna and the former co-director of AU’s chapter of March for Our Lives, says that the chapter focused on lobbying training, community-based organizing and art-related activism events. Hamilton would also meet biweekly with the regional March for Our Lives director and other college chapters such as George Washington University, Georgetown University and Howard University.
However, the chapter went dormant in the spring semester of 2022. Hamilton cited fatigue from the coronavirus pandemic, a dysfunctional executive board and a lack of funding and support from AU, especially compared to chapters at other D.C. universities. 
In January 2023, after one year of hiatus, School of International Service assistant professor Elizabeth Cohn sent an email out to interested students inviting them to a meeting about relaunching the club.
The club now has a new executive board headed up by co-directors Jake Fales, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, and Aisley Harper, a senior in SPA and the College of Arts and Sciences. Fales says the revamped AU March for Our Lives chapter will focus on local and federal advocacy and lobbying, educating the AU community on gun violence and collaborating with other local D.C. chapters, specifically that of GWU.
“This club has a lot of potential, and I’m excited to see where it goes,” Fales said. He emphasized the need for the chapter to come back now, citing several recent mass shootings both in D.C. and around the country, including the recent local Metro station shooting. 
March for Our Lives AU is currently waiting on official recognition and funding from the Center for Student Involvement. 
Remembering the past while looking ahead
On Valentine’s Day, Robert Cunningham, the D.C. Metro worker who was killed in the aforementioned Potomac Avenue station shooting, was laid to rest in the Congressional Cemetery. His funeral procession stopped with his casket at the Metro station where he tried to save the lives of commuters before being shot.
A Washington Post op-ed is calling for the station to be renamed “Robert Cunningham Station” in his honor, and The Washington Post editorial board called for a permanent memorial or landmark to be erected to remember him.
Still, advocates are working for fewer memorials and more legislation. 
“The best solution is never going to be reactive. It has to be proactive,” Fales said.

This story has been updated since the time of publication with additional statements from candidates. 
The American University student body voted this week to elect Edwin Santos as the next president of Student Government.
Santos, a junior in the School of Public Affairs, won with about 62 percent of the vote during round three, accounting for around 600 students.
Santos, the president and co-founder of the AU student advocacy group Latinos En Acción, has never held a position in SG before.
“I will not take the responsibility of presidency lightly, and am ready to start advocating for students at large. I’m excited to see all the work we can accomplish next year,” Santos told The Eagle on Saturday.
His opponents, Chandler Eby, a junior in SPA, and Noah Gocial, a sophomore in SPA, received about 350 and about 300 votes, respectively. 
Turnout decreased by roughly 44 percent from the spring 2022 election.
Santos will replace Chyna Brodie, a senior in SPA, who has served for the last two years as SG president. Brodie made history at AU in 2022 when she became the first Black woman to serve a full term in the organization’s top spot, and the second Black woman elected to the presidency.
Voter turnout decreased by roughly 44 percent from the spring 2022 election. It was the largest drop in turnout since 2018, when students cast 45 percent fewer votes than they did in 2017, according to a new analysis of past data from The Eagle’s coverage of SG elections.
Last spring, turnout rose by more than 47 percent.
Arusa Islam, a sophomore in SPA, was elected vice president with just over 53 percent of the vote. Islam currently represents the College of Arts and Sciences in the Senate.
“We need to do our best to uplift and support our students, and more importantly, our home,” Islam told The Eagle on Saturday.
Julia Comino, a sophomore in SPA and the School of Communication, was elected secretary with about 74 percent of the vote. Comino is a senator for the class of 2024, and is the chair of the Senate Special Committee on Combating Sexual Harassment and Violence on Campus.
“Through this position, I will prioritize building bridges between students, AUSG and administration. I will prioritize work like publicizing the survivors’ bill of rights and other resources to make sure students know their rights and support systems here on campus,” Comino said in a statement.
Abby Wolfe, a sophomore in SPA, was elected comptroller with about 92 percent of the vote. Wolfe has served as clerk of the Senate and as the Residence Hall Association’s vice president for social programming, both during the spring 2023 semester.
“As comptroller, I will ensure financial equity among all students and provide financial transparency and outreach for students,” Wolfe told The Eagle. “I am looking forward to working with the new executive board, students, administration and clubs next year.”
Arusa Islam, a sophomore in SPA, was elected vice president with just over 53 percent of the vote. Islam currently represents the College of Arts and Sciences in the Undergraduate Senate.
Julia Comino, a sophomore in SPA and the School of Communication, was elected secretary with about 74 percent of the vote. Comino currently represents the class of 2024 in the Senate, and is the chair of the Senate Special Committee on Combating Sexual Harassment and Violence on Campus.
Referendums
1,124 voting students voted in favor of a referendum asking AU administrators to implement Sunrise Movement AU’s Green New Deal.
The second question on the ballot asked students’ opinions on the meal plan redesign for the 2023-2024 school year.
The largest group of students, 547 students, or just over 40 percent, said their opinions of the new meal plans were “Very Unfavorable.”
More than 20 percent said they were “Unfavorable,” roughly 14 percent were neutral, 11 percent found the plans “Favorable” and about 4 percent found them “Very Favorable.” About 9 percent declined to answer the question.

2023-04-11,AU,club,"Hip-hop has been the most popular genre in the United States since 2017. It’s no secret the genre has taken over the country, but what exactly is hip-hop, and how did it start? 
Before there was the modern rap scene with acts like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Drake, there was a long line of people who built the foundation for the greats we have today. 
How was hip-hop created? 
Hip-hop originated in New York City during the 1970s. It started out as strictly live music, reserved for loud nightclubs and street corners. 
Block parties started up in the ‘70s as well, and DJs found that if they played just the percussion and no melody, it could create a genre in and of itself. The term hip-hop, however, was not used until this music first started being recorded. 
DJ Kool Herc, known as the godfather of hip-hop, hosted live parties during this time with traditional hip-hop drums, building the foundation for the beats we know today. 
Artists of this time drew crowds at different parties in the Bronx and eventually moved to Manhattan once the genre got more traction within the city. 1520 Sedgwick Ave. is credited as the birthplace of hip-hop, where Kool Herc threw a historic birthday party for his sister, and where the idea of hip-hop would first come into existence.  
The main reason hip-hop gained traction and popularity was due to the oppression of Black and brown communities in New York. 
Rappers told the unfiltered truth about their environment — how it was severely overpoliced, and how their resources were taken away by external forces such as the government. 
Landmark songs
Hip-hop as recorded music originated in rap groups because resources were limited in the Bronx, and it required multiple people to pool funds in order to have adequate resources for recording time and equipment.
“Rapper’s Delight” by The Sugarhill Gang was the first rap song officially recorded and published. “Rapper’s Delight” was also the first hip-hop single to reach the Top 40, and the name “hip-hop” actually originates from the song’s lyrics. Although the genre prides itself on original songwriting, the reality is that the first hip-hop record wasn’t written by the recording artist, with the lyrics on “Rapper’s Delight” accredited to Grandmaster Caz.
Another classic is “Walk This Way” by Run-D.M.C., which was the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 5 on the charts, and helped hip-hop evolve into a fusion of rock and rap instead of just the traditional brake drums. 
Influential artists in the genre
DJ Kool Herc promoted brake drums in hip-hop to a large audience and inspired listeners of the genre to become rappers. 
Groups such as the Cold Crush Brothers and Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five were influential in starting the hip-hop genre and hosted live rap battles where emcees would take turns rapping over drum breaks. These two groups had a legendary rap battle between each other, and it got passed around in the streets, spreading the hype of hip-hop all over New York. This one battle inspired hundreds of emcees to take the craft more seriously. 
As for more recent acts, Tupac Shakur, known professionally as 2Pac, influenced the poetic side of hip-hop. Although the storytelling aspect of hip-hop was present, 2Pac was able to convey emotions from his environment better than any other MC at the time. 2Pac set the groundwork for lyrical and conscious hip-hop. 
In the modern day, many cite Drake for bringing hip-hop to intersect with pop listeners, creating a mix of traditional hip-hop combined with melodies to create something more accessible for a mainstream palate. While some may critique Drake for “watering down” the original form of hip-hop, Drake is heavily responsible for hip-hop’s rise to mainstream fame. 
Hip-hop on an international level
Hip-hop has come a long way since that fateful DJ Kool Herc birthday party, and the genre has been used in countless ways outside of music since.
For example, many rappers from Iran have criticized their corrupt government through hip-hop, and due to censorship laws in the country, many of said artists have had to go abroad to release their music. The censorship and detainment many face for criticizing the government prove the exact point that artists are trying to make about the government’s corrupt nature.
Another example of international rappers making a difference is Vietnamese rapper Suboi, with her song N-Sao?, taking aim at corrupt police in Ho Chi Minh City.
Hip-hop has affected many lives, allowing people who were given a voice a chance to tell their story, and it has and continues to be a massive vehicle for political change.
So the next time you turn on the newest Drake pop-rap record, don’t forget about how the genre came to be, and the people who laid the groundwork for it to rise.

2023-04-12,AU,club,"Ramòn Cruz answers questions from SIS professor Simon Nicholson and students. 
Ramòn Cruz, president of the Sierra Club, aims to expand social justice initiatives in the environmental organization, according to a talk he gave in honor of Nancy Weiser Ignatius in the School of International Service on April 4. 
The Sierra Club was not always inclusive to marginalized groups in the past, according to Cruz. Founded for wilderness exploration by John Muir in 1957, the club used to be invitation only. Cruz reckoned with the organization’s racist and exclusive past, which included pushing Indigenous peoples off their native lands. 
“Before the great national parks, the lands belonged also to people that had been much better stewards than us and or anybody that came after them,” Cruz said. 
Cruz said he received criticism for venturing outside the bounds of the environmental movement. He wants to include “voting rights, working rights, reproductive rights, labor rights and housing rights” in the organization’s work. These issues all intersect with the environmental movement, according to Cruz. 
“I hope that Sierra Club supporters concerned about whether we focus on a narrow definition of environment can find a way to broaden our idea of the Sierra Club,” Cruz said. 
Cruz is the first Puerto Rican and Latino president of the organization. When the organization was founded, his father and grandfather would have been excluded from participating in the organization. 
“Things are very different today thanks in large part to people of color and white allies who fought to open the doors of these organizations to people like me, but it doesn't mean that there is no discrimination in the environmental movement,” Cruz said. “For many years, I was the darkest in the room with a cute Spanish accent.”
Now, the Sierra Club is taking steps towards environmental justice by adopting the principles of democratic organizing, according to Cruz. These principles include “Be Inclusive, Emphasis on Bottom-Up Organizing, Let People Speak for Themselves, Work Together In Solidarity and Mutuality, Build Just Relationships Among Ourselves and Commitment to Self-Transformation,” according to the Sierra Club website. 
It takes more than reckoning with the past to change the future, according to Ariana Lippi, a first-year graduate student in SIS. Lippi volunteered with the Sierra Club in New York before starting her graduate program at AU. 
When Lippi volunteered on the sustainable finance committee of the Sierra Club in New York, she found it difficult to create change and mobilize in the organization due to leadership and bureaucratic processes. Although Cruz pointed out the chapter has a new president, Lippi believes there is an “infrastructure problem” in the organization. 
“I do think that there is so much that could be done to make it more inclusive,” said Lippi in an interview after the event. “I think environmentalism overall, the environmental movement in the U.S. is not inclusive towards people of color, trans people, just different identities and youth as well. There's a very white, old guard in that movement.”
Lippi wished the organization could improve its outreach since it is mostly volunteer based. There was a long application process she went through to become a volunteer. She thinks this process can be cut down or eliminated. Cruz said the organization now does student coalition training, but he recognizes that is not enough.
“I think it's the people and the old school organizing that can get us there,” Cruz said.
