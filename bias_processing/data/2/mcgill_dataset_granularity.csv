2009-02-19,McGill,China,"Human Rights Watch director weighs in on the role of the international community in Rwandan and Sudanese genocides
International politics nullified domestic law in Sudan and Rwanda, sites of Africa’s most recent genocides, argued Georgette Gagnon, Executive Director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch (HRW), at a lecture held by the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism yesterday.
“In our experience, politics trumps law every time,” Gagnon said. “Our advocacy at Human Rights Watch is about taking that into account – not giving into it, but to address it and give our recommendations credibility.”
HRW is working in Africa to make politics accountable to law, thereby ensuring that human lives are not sacrificed in a larger political game. The organization performs strategic investigations to uncover human rights violations and hold oppressors accountable for their crimes.
Gagnon suggested that political forces were at work in the international community’s reluctance to label the mass killings of nearly one million Rwandans in 1994 as a genocide. She listed Rwanda’s lack of political muscle, oil, gold or other resources; the United States’s recent withdrawal from Somalia; and an overriding sense of racism of the western world as possible causes for international apathy.
A similar situation exists with the crisis in Sudan, according to Gagnon, who said United Nations Security Council members from China and Russia have perpetuated the crisis in Sudan because they have a political stake in the oil and arms business in the country, respectively.
Gagnon criticized the international community’s impulse to deploy troops to conflict zones when alternative, non-violent methods could be more effective. She suggested that radio jamming – disrupting the signals that in Rwanda were used to spread racial hate and to communicate violent commands to troops – could have been a practical and effective method of intervention. The Pentagon ruled against the tactic, claiming the cost – $8,000 an hour – was too expensive.
A law student voiced a concern commonly expressed in developing countries: that non-governmental organizations like HRW hand down universal principles, failing to account for unique political situations. HRW is currently criticized for urging the redress of current Rwandan ruler Paul Kagami, who they claim is keeping the region stable.  Kagami’s government killed 30,000 people in its early years after the genocide.
“We don’t interfere with political decisions. All we can say is, impartially, if he is committing war crimes then he should be brought to trial,” Gagnon replied.
Gagnon noted that HRW does work with grassroots organizations.
“In Africa there are vibrant local human rights communities that are pushing for the same things we are – universal human rights – and we always try to reach out and connect to those.”
She also acknowledged that politicians are forced to choose between peace and justice.
“The law should be applied impartially. Our job is advocacy and redress, but the more practical and realistic we are, the more likely [our policies will be effective],” Gagnon said. “Thus we should acknowledge our compromise. We say there is no durable peace without justice.”
A member of the audience noted that the work of human rights organizations is mainly reactive and reports violations, asking how groups work to prevent human rights abuse.
“Everything we do is preventive. It’s corruption, lack of access to resources, nepotism, social and economic violations of rights which lead to this kind of genocide,” Gagnon said.
 Economic and social legal violations are predictors of political abuse, she added, which is where HRW can help.

2009-03-16,McGill,China,"Green Week speaker pushes for simple living
To hear audio from the walking tour of Chinatown, go to the multimedia blog at mcgilldaily.com
The pursuit of happiness should trump our desire for consumption, argued Professor Louis Chauvin during his Wednesday talk as part of McGill Green Week, hosted by the Science Undergraduate Society.
Chauvin, a management professor and President of Le Réseau Québécois pour la simplicité volontaire, an organization which promotes simplistic consumption, pointed directly to over-consumption as endangering our planet.
“For the past 14 years, I have asked myself why we are consciously destroying the carrying capacity of the Earth and what is needed for us to stop,” Chauvin told the audience.
Chauvin’s deep interest in consumption patterns and the environment inspired him to reach out to students, and teach them about responsible consumption and sustainability.
“I am a firm believer in education as a transformative process,” Chauvin said.
According to Chauvin, our society suffers from chronic dissatisfaction – a constant need for more – which harms the environment. He noted that many believe happiness is based on how much one consumes, which leads to over-consumption and depletes the world’s resources.
“People seek the high that comes with pleasure and are convinced that this sensation is the same as happiness,” explained Chauvin. “Whether it is gambling, excessive shopping, or a meaningless relationship, we give into these addictions and rely on such external factors for happiness.”
Chauvin added that usually as one consumes more and more, one requires a larger quantity of goods to maintain the excitement. He contrasted this attitude to pure happiness, which is rewarding for longer periods of time and leaves one with a feeling of fullness, without materialistic desires.
 “The pursuit of happiness is the ultimate goal for humans,” Chauvin said. “We want to be happy and we think certain commodities will make us happy or happier. The reality is, happiness comes from inside and is detached from consumption.”
During the question and answer period, one student asked whether the current economic crisis would act as a catalyst for responsible consumption.
“There is definitely an increased interest in voluntary simplicity,” answered Chauvin. “People are unable to get solutions from economists and politicians. Instead, they are looking for alternative ways to adjust their lifestyles.”
Later, one student asked whether or not a federal framework was needed for a real reduction in consumption.
“Even with federal frameworks, many societal issues, such as racism, are still present,” Chauvin said. “What we need to do is target individuals and promote personal transformations.”
Chauvin concluded with a message of hope and called for a change in lifestyle to save what is left of the planet.
“Our planet can only handle so much and so, simplicity is inevitable,” added Chauvin. “The question is, will it be voluntary or involuntary?”

2009-03-16,McGill,China,"Campaign engages students with nearby neighbourhoods
To hear the whole Green Week talk by Professor Chauvin on consumption and the environment, go to the multimedia blog at mcgilldaily.com
McGill students got to know different parts of the Montreal community last week as part of the Office of Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE)’s “Burst Your Bubble 2009.”
Events included walking tours of Parc-Extension and Chinatown, as well as visits to Kanien’kehaka Onkwawén:na Raotitiohkwa Mohawk Language and Cultural Center in Khanawake and the Multi-Ethnic Association for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities (AMEIPH) just south of Little Italy.
“With this weather we can all get stuck in the ‘McGill bubble’: [the area bounded by] Sherbrooke, Pine, University, and Peel. It is so convenient to stay in that little square,” said Adama Kaba, SEDE’s Administrative Coordinator. “But as a university student you need concrete experiences. You can come here and get As, but if you want hands-on experience you need to get involved.”
This year’s campaign included events at Macdonald campus for the first time, and allowed McGill students to interact with Montreal’s least understood community groups. The trip to the South Shore was especially ambitious.
“People don’t go out to Khanawake,” said Kaba. “There is still a lot of prejudice attached to the First Nations people. But the visit to Khanawake was the first to be completely filled. By going out there and meeting with the organization, we hope students can learn more about the community and how they can be involved.”
SEDE is staffed by a young, diverse, and enthusiastic group that joined students on Thursday evening’s visit to the AMEIPH.
“We wanted people to learn more about the issue and about the specific challenges some disabled people are faced with,” said Kaba. “If you are an immigrant with a disability, and you don’t speak the language, how do you find the services that are available to you?”
Although Thursday’s visit showed low student turnout, Kaba insists that “Burst Your Bubble” is becoming increasingly popular.
“This year’s response has been even stronger and the numbers attending the visits have doubled. We have already received feedback about our walking tours and people really enjoyed them. We also receive feedback from community organizations that let us know when students become involved with them.”
Last year’s “Burst Your Bubble” campaign allowed McGill students to learn more about Montreal’s past with a visit to Écomusée du fier monde, a museum of industrial and working class history at the corner of Amherst and Ontario. Students also learned to appreciate Montreal’s diversity with visits to the Côte-des-Neiges Black Community Association and Kapit Bisig Filipino Community Centre.
Food appears to be a key incentive in drawing support from students, with community organizations preparing a few dishes for each visit. Students visiting the AMEIPH discussed the organization’s objectives over an elaborate, multi-ethnic meal.
As well, the cafeterias in Bishop Hall, Douglas Hall, and RVC served “finger food from different countries” on March 5.
SEDE will wrap up the multi-week campaign with a “Community Connections” dinner and film screening in partnership with Radio Canada International on March 18, although the RSVP deadline has passed.

2009-03-23,McGill,China,"North America’s smallest dinosaur uncovered
EDMONTON – It was an adventure that began back in 1982, but 27 years later, Philip Currie, a paleontologist and biological sciences professor at the University of Alberta (UofA), is able to confirm that he and his colleague have identified the smallest dinosaur known to have roamed North America.
The discovery and identification of the carnivorous Hesperonychus elizabethae – a species so small it would fit in the palm of one’s hand – will be published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this month.
Originally thought to be a bone fragment from a lizard, the piece was found by a University of Calgary student hired by the UofA to work in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park.
“She was looking mostly for smaller animals, and the small fossils she found, she thought probably belonged to a lizard,” said Currie, explaining that it wasn’t until the late nineties, when a feathered skeleton named Microraptor was uncovered in China, that a connection was made.
“He realized that [the bone] is almost identical to the one in China in terms of hip structure,” Currie said.
Despite missing a complete skeleton, the ability to compare their fragment to the specimen in China allowed for a concise comparison of each structure.
While paleontologists have discovered many skeletons in Alberta over the years, Currie explained that many of the smaller specimens remain incomplete, which limited the field of study.
“[Big skeletons] only give you one side of the story. [They] preserve a lot more easily than small things because you don’t have things eating them, you don’t have slivers that are ripping the pieces apart.”
Currie’s discovery proves that there is still a lot to be learned.
“We want to know what’s going on with the other side of the ecosystem; all the small animals and that includes not just dinosaurs, but all the things living with the dinosaurs.” he said.
For Currie, Hesperonychus elizabethae is the first of many skeletons that will eventually reach the surface.
“I’m willing to bet that in a couple years, we’re going to have more small dinosaur species than big dinosaurs species.”

SFU to privatize residences
BURNABY – B.C.’s Simon Fraser University (SFU) is looking to contract a private company to fund, manage, and maintain on-campus student residences.
Citing a lack of capital available for major repairs to residence buildings and a desire to increase capacity, the university wants to avoid taking a loan out to complete these projects.
“We’re just looking for creative ways to try and deal with residences, “said Pat Hibbits, SFU’s VP Finance.
Currently, SFU on-campus residences house about nine per cent of students, a figure SFU hopes to see hit 15 per cent while doubling on-campus housing space over the next five years.
Thompson Rivers University (TRU) in Kamloops, B.C., and the University of Ottawa already have privatized residences.
“Universities are turning the housing around to the private sector due to the fact that the price to operate is definitely high,” said Mark Woloski, TRU’s residence manager.
“We can control the prices we offer the students because we’re not paying a hefty wage to all our staff, so that’s probably why a lot of universities are changing to private sectors – because the cost of operations are skyrocketing, being a union-run facility.”
In terms of cost to students, Woloski claimed it is “virtually the same” as off-campus housing.
“We follow everyone else’s lead. We keep in regular communication with all the other on-campus housing units throughout B.C., and we don’t like pricing ourselves out of the market or wanting to gouge,” he said.
Nichole DeMichelis, a second-year political science student living in the McTaggart-Cowan residence, was optimistic about what privatization could bring to the residences.
“SFU is lacking a lot of funding, and one of the big priorities is to build more residences to secure that sense of community,” DeMichelis said. “I would be all for having new buildings with proper kitchens. I think it sounds like a great idea.”

Student finds tuition in her Tim’s cup
TORONTO – At best, Khalin Elliott was hoping for a free snack when she checked under the rim of her Tim Horton’s coffee cup last Wednesday. But instead of a free pastry, the first-year media student found a tiny dollar sign followed by a big number under the rim of her medium hot chocolate – $10,000, courtesy of the Tim Hortons Roll Up The Rim contest.
The oldest of four girls, Elliot has relied on government funding and a competitive entrance scholarship to cover her tuition and residence fees this year.
“There’s six of us [in my family] so we go through struggles and stuff like that. We’re kind of in the middle in a way, like most big families are, so getting this is definitely going to help with school,” Elliott said.
She plans to spend her money on a new computer because her current MacBook runs slowly, and she wants something to handle advanced graphics work.
“Everything’s computer-based in our classes,” she explained.
The leftover cash will pay her tuition for second year.
Elliott recalled her surprise when she uncovered her prize.
“I had to get them to read it over to make sure I wasn’t going crazy,” she said, claiming that she never wins anything.
Elliott explained that she and her friends always take a break during their three-hour visual studies class, usually opting for a quick trip to the nearby Tim Hortons. All three of them ordered hot chocolate.
Her two friends said they were thrilled she won – even though they could have won if they had lined up in a different order.
According to Lucy Rocque, the employee at Tim Horton’s who handed Elliot the winning cup, more customers have been getting their coffee fix at her Tim’s since the $10,000 win, hoping to get lucky. Last Friday, someone stopped by to tell them they had won a $100 Tim Card from that location.

Alberta college launches free nursing program
EDMONTON – Bow Valley College, an Albertan institution focusing on English as a second language (ESL) training, is introducing a free 20-month pilot program designed to help immigrants with a nursing degree upgrade their skills and find employment in Canada.
“It’s designed to take people who have nursing from their own country and give them the language and Canadian health cultural knowledge that they need to be able to practice in the Canadian health system,” said Isabel Gibbins, Dean of ESL and Languages at the college, explaining that many candidates’ English levels proved to be a barrier during the qualifying exam.
The program was first introduced at NorQuest College in Edmonton, but once the provincial government was aware of its success, they introduced it to other institutions. It resembles the usual training for nurses, though it is shorter because many of the nurses already have background knowledge.
Gibbins said the program intends to create a link between those who have ventured to Canada in search of employment, and the Canadian services that are seeking that very expertise.
“We really feel that there are a lot of people who have skills from their country that they aren’t able to use in Canada,” she said. “One of the things that’s important to us is to be able to work on providing some of those transition courses.”
Initial funding for the Bow College program will come from Alberta Employment and Immigration, but once the pilot period ends, Gibbins hopes to sustain it through enrolment fees. They intend to advertise it at current ESL classes, health-care facilities, and the college’s open house.

Undergrad-made iPhone app aimed at students
FREDERICTON – While many students are wondering what they’re going to do with their degrees after they get out of school, third-year computer science student Jason Brennan has already put his education to good use.
Brennan, a 20-year-old student at the University of New Brunswick, designed an application called Keener for the Apple iPhone to help students keep track of their grades and organize their school work.
“You put in your courses when you start the semester,” said Brennan. “You put in your homework assignments, your quizzes, and the labs that are coming up. You put in the due dates, and it gives you a list of what’s due, what’s overdue, and what’s due next week. And when you get your tests and assignments back you just punch in your marks and it keeps track of your overall grades for the semester.”
Keener can also calculate weighted grades as classes progress.
Brennan, who owns an iPhone, developed Keener between November and January, and cited his own university experience as his inspiration.
“I came up with this because I am not a keener at all,” laughed Brennan. “I’m not very studious and I find that I’m a lot more organized if I have a way to record everything.”
Brennan found traditional agendas problematic, but wanted an organizer that he could keep with him at all times. Developing Keener allowed him to resolve this problem, and learn more about computer programming, one of his interests outside of school.
Keener went on sale January 25 for $4.99. Brennan gets 70 per cent, or $3.50, from each sale. The other 30 per cent goes to Apple and the company handles all the billing and shipping.

2009-03-26,McGill,China,"McGill launched the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) on Monday with an inaugural conference focusing on the future of development.  ISID will absorb the existing Centre for Developing Areas Studies (CDAS) into its broader mandate to renew energy for development in a changing global context.
 Like CDAS, ISID will continue to be committed to multidisciplinary research, but with renewed emphasis on accountability and evidenced-based policy-making. It will eventually become home to undergraduate programs in International Development Studies, African Studies, Middle Eastern Studies and Latin American and Caribbean Studies, as well as a new Development Studies option at the Master’s level.
Phillip Oxhorn, the ISID Director, stressed that the energy of youth interested in development figures centrally in the new institute.
“ISID brings under one roof what universities can uniquely do while also capturing the energy and commitment of young people,” he said, explaining that the institute is a response to changes in the global order.
 Among those present was David Malone, President of the International Development Research Centre welcomed the launch of the institute by emphasizing the importance of their goal.
“Development is a dead serious business and should be treated with the seriousness it deserves,” he said, adding that it would be important for the ISID to break from Canadian precedent by sharing its success stories and disseminating its work more widely.
 The evening’s visiting keynote from India, Dr. Pratap Bhanu Mehta, President of the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, pointed to the timeliness of the ISID given the rise of China and India.
“It will not be a shift without conflict,” he said. “Both have a sense of growth and entitlement, they are not negligible.”
Mehta expressed hope that development policy-makers and practitioners to be more critical of the various assumptions held within the field, and called on the development community to be more aware of state actions.
“The most representative and participatory states are not necessarily the most responsive,” he said.
 Other attendees at the Institute launch include McGill President Heather Munro-Blum, McGill Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi, Canadian International Development Agency President Margaret Briggs, and International Development Research Centre President David Malone, the Right Honourable Joe Clark.
Roughly seventy people – mostly academics and practitioners – were present for the opening ceremonies at the Omni Hotel, with more joining in on Tuesday panels offering perspectives from donor agencies, non-state actors in development, various development institutions, and from youth practitioners, lasting throughout the day.
In his keynote address, Save the Children CEO David Morley acknowledged the privilege of speaking about poverty while conference delegates enjoyed a decadent three-course catered lunch.
Adam Matheson, U3 International Development studies commented on the elegance of the lunch.
“I understand the need to have a professional, formal conference to attract important speakers and guests; but a lavish 3 course meal while we listened to statistics on world hunger and squandered aid money seemed a little ironic.”

2009-10-05,McGill,China,"Chinese immigrant workers awarded $164,000 in damages
The Quebec Human Rights Commission ruled this September that 15 Chinese workers should receive $164,000 in damages from their employer, Calego International, for racial discrimination in the workplace. It is the heaviest fine to be levied by the Commission in a human rights case to date.
The Commission asked that $10,000 be paid in moral and punitive damages to each worker and $5,000 paid to two workers who were forcibly thrown off the company’s premises in plain view of co-workers.
The incident took place in July 2006, when a group of 40 employees were called into a meeting with Calego International’s president, Stephen Rapps. The workers testified to the Commission that Rapps yelled at them, saying, “You Chinese eat like pigs!”
He Yong Han, a former employee and Chinese immigrant now residing in Montreal, reported to The Daily that Rapps told the workers to wash themselves daily, and that they were no longer in China.
He said that Rapps chastised the workers for unsanitary work conditions, warning them not to get urine on the floor when using the toilet.
Of all the employees at Calego International, the Chinese workers were the only ones who were called to the meeting.
He reported further that workers walked out immediately after, returning the next day to demand a written apology from Rapps, a cleaner work environment (workers say that at the time, there were no janitorial staff working), and compensation for what they saw as discriminatory actions. The demands were turned down, leading many of the workers to quit their jobs.
The workers then filed a complaint through the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR).
Calego International is a Montreal-based children’s backpack and accessories manufacturer. Rapps, a supervisor, and Agence Vincent, the placement agency through which the Chinese workers were hired, will share the payment of damages.
Julius Grey, the lawyer who represents Calego International, has denied that the incident took place.
Despite the fact that the fine is the largest sum that the Quebec Human Rights Commission has recommended in a racism case, Fo Niemi of CRARR, who helped these workers file their complaint, stated that the amount is less significant when the amount of damages awarded to each individual worker is considered.
“This may be why discrimination still goes on, because if we had the kind of damages awarded as in the United States, where we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, many people would think twice before committing racial discrimination,” Niemi said.
The former Calego employees have received support from the Montreal Chinese community, in the form of encouragement, assistance, and monetary aid. The Montreal Chinese Cultural Centre helped the workers find lawyers and gather information for their case.
Niemi notes that very few complaints are filed from people of Asian backgrounds, although Asian workers are a large number of the immigrant workers who are often forced to work in substandard conditions.

2009-10-08,McGill,China,"Nobel Peace Prize winner emphasizes the importance of compassion
This Saturday, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama made two presentations in Montreal, one to a 500-person invite-only event hosted by McGill’s Faculty of Education, and a second to a crowd of 14,000 people at the Bell Centre.
The 74-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner felt compelled to request a private audience with education students after he learned of the provincial government’s introduction of a controversial ethics and religious culture class to primary and secondary students throughout Quebec.
During both addresses, the Dalai Lama emphasized the need for a balance between intellectualized faith and secular ethics.
“His Holiness was interested in speaking with students involved to support the notion that human values, ethical issues, and respect for religious and secular traditions is a positive initiative,” said education professor Spencer Boudreau, McGill’s ombudsperson and the main organizer of the event. “[Religion] is part of our culture and history; it’s a powerful force in the world [that] we’ve neglected,” Boudreau said.
Due to the limited tickets available for the McGill talk, the McGill organizing committee decided to stream the two-hour event on learnquebec.org, where it is still available to site users.
During the McGill address, the Dalai Lama stressed to education students that instilling a positive religious tolerance in youth was critical for a compassionate society.
“Please carry your profession with sincere motivation and a sense of global responsibility,” the Dalai Lama said. “At least, with some aim or goal [that] out of this century, a more compassionate world [will come].”
Mitchell Miller, the president of the Education Undergraduate Society, had the opportunity to sit with the Dalai Lama. Miller was selected to thank His Holiness on behalf of the anglophone universities in Quebec.
“Sometimes it feels like there is a lot of unnecessary self-deprecation among students in this faculty. [The Dalai Lama’s visit] was a reaffirmation for us as educators of the power that we can have,” Miller said.
Heather Monroe-Blum served as the master of ceremonies.
Later that day, during his presentation at the Bell Centre, His Holiness asserted that he had no political or spiritual agenda. Instead, he hoped to articulate the need of shared links between humanity, to be compassionate, and work to make the world a better place.
“I am talking as a human being to another human being. Not as a monk, Buddhist, or Tibetan,” he said.
Nonetheless, the event took on a political tone as Chinese and Uyghur protesters assembled outside. Tibet has been administered and controlled by the People’s Republic of China since it occupied the territory in 1950. The Dalai Lama, recognized as the exiled political leader of Tibet, fled the territory in 1959 and is seen as a threat to the national identity and integrity of China.
“It’s our country. We love it,”one Chinese protester said, standing calmly with several others in objection to the Dalai Lama’s visit to Montreal. A couple of Tibetans yelled at them to leave Canada and go back to China.
Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority from Western China, also demonstrated in solidarity with the Tibetans. They called on China to recognize their human rights, stating that they were “the other Tibetans.”

2009-11-03,McGill,China,"Lack of appeals process, hasty deportations a growing trend in immigration policy
The number of deportations from Canada has increased by an unprecedented 50 per cent in the last decade. Statistics released by the federal government under the Access to Information Act earlier this month show that Canadian Border Services deported 12,732 individuals last year, up from 8,361 removals in 1999.
Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, criticized the federal government’s approach to refugee claimants.
“What we saw and heard was that there was an increase in the budget allocation to respond to the September 11 attacks and demands for new security measures. More money went for more detentions and removals,” said Dench. “They had more money and because of that they do more deportations.”
Dench also criticized the refugee application process, noting the inability of refugee claimants to appeal decisions made by the Immigration Board of Canada. The decision to accept or decline an application is currently made by a single decision-maker – something Dench viewed as a major flaw in the system.
“The problem in the refugee system, its failure, is that it doesn’t have an appeal [process] at the moment…. Canadians get an appeal on all manner of things – even parking tickets. But in the case of refugees, for those whose lives may be at stake, there is no appeal,” said Dench.
Last Thursday, a Montreal family of four was deported to the United States – where they face probable deportation to Bangladesh – after their final bid for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was refused by Immigration Canada late last month.
Ranjit Dey Roy, Ranta Ranni Dey Roy, and their two sons had arrived from Bangladesh in 2004 after fleeing persecution for their religious beliefs, but their application for refugee status was rejected the following year. Members of Parliament Lise Zarac and Thierry St-Cyr met with Minister of Immigration and Citizenhip Jason Kenney on Wednesday to request an emergency stay of deportation for the family but were unsuccessful.
The family received support from the Montreal Immigrant Workers Center and Hindu Association of Montreal during their stay in Quebec. Mostafa Henaway of the Montreal Immigrant Workers Center suggested that the family’s case was one of many that indicate the growing trend of hasty deportations.
“The fact that deportations are up by 50 per cent is very clear that the Conservative government has actually been making enforcement [of deportation] their major policy drive,” Henaway said, stating that the immigration officer who handled the Roy family case had overlooked the dangers the family might face in Bangladesh.
“The problem is that [the system] is so arbitrary…. There was not even a written decision as to why [the Roy family] were refused,” said Henaway.
“It is very clear that Canada is disregarding the actual safety of people’s lives, from 76 Tamil refugees off the coast of Vancouver, to the Mexican women who was killed [after she was deported]. These people are not in the few, they are in the many,” Henaway added.
Though Kenney declined to comment on the increase in the number of deportations, the federal government has suggested that the spike in deportations is a result of a rising number of refugee claims in Canada.
But statistics from the Immigration and Refugee Board suggest that the number of individuals seeking refugee status in Canada has dropped recently: 35,000 claims were received last year, significantly lower than the 44,000 claims in 2001, and the 39,000 claims in 2002.
Obiora Chinedu Okafor, a law professor at Osgoode Hall, commented that the federal government’s practices demonstrate that the enforcement of deportation orders is a growing priority.
Okafor also said that a growing focus on enforcement could easily overlook the risks faced by individual claimants.
“Anytime that you are enforcement-minded, mistakes are bound to happen,” said Okafor.
Individuals facing deportation can apply for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) which allows claimants to present new evidence of risks they may face if sent back to the home country.
Okafor felt, however, that the PRRA process was problematic. “It is not an appeal, just an assessment, done by immigration officers, not by someone who is independent,” he said.
Okafor also took issue with the Canadian government’s willingness to deport individuals to countries with shoddy human rights track records.
Most deported individuals are sent to the U.S. and Mexico, although hundreds have also been sent to countries known to violate human rights, such as China, Pakistan, Haiti, and Zimbabwe.
“It is shocking but in the past we have deported people to places where even immigration officers would not go to. If the place is not safe enough for Canadian officers to go to, then how can we deport people there? Even if they are convicted criminals, convicted criminals have rights,” said Okafor.

2010-01-25,McGill,China,"Stock portfolio tied to natural resource exploration and military
SSMU VP Finance and Operations (FOPS) Jose Diaz announced Thursday evening in his report to SSMU Council that the Society has sold its shares in a company because of its ties to the Alberta tar sands. But according to a recent report of the Finance Committee, SSMU retains bonds worth $32,200 in Connacher Oil and Gas, which owns and refines 98,000 acres of tar sands in Fort McMurray.
When questioned about the investment, Diaz said he was unaware of Connacher’s mining projects and indicated he would address the investment.
“That is definitely going to be fixed on Monday,” he said, adding that he is currently investigating SSMU’s shares and bonds in Uranium One – a uranium holding company with investments in uranium mining and exploration in Kazakhstan, South Africa, China, and Canada.
However, SSMU still owns shares and bonds worth $172,666 in eight companies that undertake the exploration or production of natural resources – including crude oil, natural, gas, and coal – in addition to $226,394 in bonds of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is heavily invested in the tar sands projects. Its stock portfolio also includes an additional $31,910 of shares in two companies with links to the Department of National Defence (DND).
Diaz stated that SSMU has no policy on investment in mining exploration, or any policy on oil, natural minerals, and base metals.
“We’ve gotten rid of [investment in] the actual mining companies – companies whose activity is extracting the material to process. What you see in the portfolio is exploration, like looking for deposits,” Diaz explained.
He added that there is an additional grey area in SSMU’s tar sands policy.
“We have a policy in companies that are involved in tar sands development, but what about all the other companies that are related to tar sands?” Diaz said, pointing to SSMU’s investment of $21,258 in the Trans Canada Corporation, which owns a 59,000 pipeline through North America.
“All kinds of oil goes through the pipeline. They don’t discriminate based on deep-sea oil, or tar sands oil. There are many ways companies can be involved in tar sands without being directly related to them, and we have to decide at what level we are going to have the restriction,” he said.
Military connections
According to the same Finance Committee report, SSMU currently owns $14,410 in shares of Discovery Air, whose subsidiaries provide assistance in arctic mining exploration as well as airborne training for the Canadian military – which includes air controllers in Afghanistan, CF18 Hornet pilots on air sovereignty patrol missions, and warship airborne defense personnel.
SSMU also owns $17,500 in shares of Calian Technologies, a telecommunications company that specializes in satellites and outsourcing. In 2009, Calian signed two contracts worth $195 million and $70 million to provide simulation training and research for the DND and the Royal Military College, as well as a $65-million contract more recently to provide “instructional training, support, and administrative services” for the DND, according to its web site.
Diaz said that while SSMU does not invest in companies with apparent ties to the military, its policy toward military investment suffers from a similar lack of clarity as its tar sands and mining policies. There is currently no policy on what degree of separation SSMU’s investments must have from the military.
“Calian Technologies [for instance] provides technology services for the government, and for a bunch of ministries: for labour, financial industries, aerospace,” Diaz said. “What they’re doing is not really focused on the military or the defence sector. They provide this tech service that happens to be used by the several industrials, and one of them happens to be the military sector.”
Down to that dolla’ bill
SSMU’s nearly $2-million investment portfolio originates from a settlement made with McGill several years ago, when SSMU sold its shares in the McGill bookstore. The portfolio is managed by Penson Financial Services, and overseen by Diaz, the SSMU Comptroller, the Investment Advisory Committee, and the Investment Advisor Committee Coordinator.
SSMU does have a Financial Ethics Research Committee (FERC), but according to Diaz, it primarily reviews spending over $15,000. While it can set guidelines and ethical policies for SSMU, the committee only meets on an ad hoc basis.
“FERC has not met this year. Nobody’s called a meeting yet [because it is] contingent on someone introducing a motion to actively refer something to [the committee],” said FERC member, Daily columnist, and SSMU councillor Joël Pedneault.
Diaz said that if students wanted to engage more actively in the management of SSMU’s portfolio, he would be open to suggestions. “[Ideally,] we’d set up very restrictive guidelines in terms of what is allowed, what is not, and specified limits, [like] when other companies might provide a tertiary service to those industries, where do they fall,” he said. “The investment manager needs to have very specific restrictions.”
Pedneault and Diaz both said it was a possibility that SSMU could invest more heavily in “green” funds – though Diaz said it could be more financially beneficial for SSMU to explore additional green stocks that had not yet been included in an environmental stock index because they might have more potential for growth.
Pedneault, though, questioned whether the entirety of SSMU’s settlement should be placed in investments. “A question [to be] raised is what do we do with this money? It’s been sitting here in stocks. It’s money SSMU could be putting to better use for student needs.”

2010-02-13,McGill,China,"Debate continues over metro expansion, Turcot re-design, and tramways
Montreal is buzzing with transit development plans that will shape the city for decades to come.
From the proposed metro expansion into Laval, Longueil, and Anjou, to the redevelopment of the Turcot Interchange in the Southwest, and the perennial promise of the streetcar resurrection, transit has once again emerged as a central issue in the city’s political scene.
“In a way, transport makes the city,” said Étienne Coutu, an architect and urban designer working with Projet Montréal at City Hall.
A central tenet to the burgeoning municipal party’s platform is the installation of 250 kilometres of tramway track to the city, ten per cent of which they hope to have completed by fall 2012. Mayor Gérald Tremblay, meanwhile, has pegged the opening of a tramway line connecting Côte-des-Neiges to downtown and the Old Port for 2013.
“With a tramway, we’re giving space back to public transit,” Coutu said.
“The point is the experience – it’s calm, and it’s stable,” he said, adding that building tramways in Quebec would create jobs, and would also provide an incentive to redesign the streets around the new lines by widening sidewalks and adding green space.
Under Projet Montréal’s plan, a tramway would return to Parc – the most frequently serviced bus route in the city, and a major streetcar artery until the City swapped streetcars for buses in the mid-fifties.
At an estimated cost of $40- to 60-million per kilometre, however, others are not convinced that tramways are the best option for the city.
McGill urban planning professor Ahmed El-Geneidy favours increased bus frequency and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems.
“Exclusive bus-only lanes still take space away from cars – and cost much less,” said El-Geneidy, whose Transportation Research At McGill (TRAM) group works closely with STM, the regional transit authority, and the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) on projects such as the implementation of the express bus route 467 along St. Michel.
On January 22, the STM issued a press release stating it was about to finalize a $3-billion contract with the Consortium of Bombardier-Alstom SA for 765 new cars to replace its aging fleet, with an option for an additional 288.
However, the plan has stalled while China’s Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive attempts to join the bidding process with its steel-wheeled trains. These wheels can run outside, and are regarded as more energy-efficient than the rubber tires currently used in Montreal’s metro system, which is set to expand soon.
Last September, Quebec premier Jean Charest announced that the provincial government would move forward with a plan to connect the orange line in Laval, extend the yellow line by five stops into Longueil, and add five kilometres on the east side of the blue line, at a potential cost of about $150 million per kilometre.
With the majority of the construction on the North and South Shores, however, both Coutu and El-Geneidy expressed concern that the proposals could clog the already-congested east side of the orange line.
El-Geneidy stressed that for the extension into Anjou to be successful, the metro expansion must be coupled with a land-use plan to attract retailers, offices, and businesses around the metro lines.
“Without a land use plan, it will succeed at the same level as the old blue line,” he said.
Coutu added that Projet Montréal would also like to see the west side of the blue line extended through Snowdon to connect to Montréal-Ouest, and a tram connecting Trudeau Airport to downtown.
As for the yellow line, “Longueil is going to be a joke,” said El-Geneidy, adding that he would rather see an enhanced BRT service to feed into the existing metro.
However, recent squabbles between the STM, Laval, and Longueil over operating costs suggest the expansion may hit more political roadblocks in the future.
Laval withheld its annual $1.5-million share of operating costs until Longueil joined them in the TRAM 3 fare zone. Longueil is threatening to do the same.
“It’s like we’re in kindergarten, and no one wants to pay for the service,” said Coutu.
The argument raises the issue of the multitude of transit operators and fares in the region, with the STM’s single-fare metro and buses, the AMT’s multi-fare zone commuter trains, and separate suburban bus services like the Réseau de transport de Longueuil on the South Shore.
El-Geneidy said that competition between the agencies is a positive thing, but that the AMT should designate a consistent fare-zone system across the region.

2010-10-25,McGill,China,"Tuesday: Global prospects
Last Tuesday, October 19, McGill hosted a Public Lecture Forum as part of its Third Annual Conference on Global Food Security.  The event featured David Nabarro, the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Representative on Food Security and Nutrition and Beverly Oda, the Canadian Minister for International Relations. The forum also marked the official launch of the McGill Institute for Global Food Security.
Daniel Jutras, Dean of the Faculty of Law, began the conference by welcoming the establishment of the new institute that would help tackle “one of the key dimensions of our collective future.”
Nabarro was “delighted that McGill is taking leadership on an issue of such importance,” adding that “we can’t move forward on food security without the combination of natural and social science research.”
He said food security should encapsulate not only universal access but also “access to nutritional food within a sustainable environment.” Because of this, any approach will require governments and communities to come together in a manner that is interdisciplinary. He continuously emphasized the importance of trade but stated that community and small stakeholder involvement is integral to any sustainable approach.  “[This] approach,” he said, “puts people at the centre, not production.”
Oda discussed the Canadian International Development Assoc-iation’s (CIDA) belief that women are key when discussing food security. “Women are the guardians to nutrition,” she said. “Small farmers are the backbone of the rural economy and the majority of these farmers are women.”
Food Security is at the heart of the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDG). “Unless we make sure that people, and not production, are placed at the centre of our goals, we risk a very embarrassing miss come the MDG 2015 deadline,” said Nabarro.
McGill hopes that its new institute will be well placed to help bring an end to food insecurity worldwide.

Wednesday: Water management
One of Wednesday’s panel discussions included representatives from Indian, Chinese, and Costa Rican institutions. The question and answer period was sometimes tense because of the disagreement that members of the audience had with India and China’s practices regarding water management.
M. Gopalakrishnan, Secretary General of the Indian International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage started off the talks by explaining the current and future situation of India.
“Extreme conditions are becoming a yearly phenomenon,” said Gopalakrishnan. “India has to learn to live with water scarcity.” he maintained that 27 per cent of the world’s undernourished are Indians, and that thus far government intervention has failed to redistribute wealth to the rural poor. However, he concluded that India may see sustainability of food production and water management by learning from “success stories.”
Zhanyi Gao, director of China’s National Centre for Efficient Irrigation Technology Research, talked about how China will respond to its foreseeable problems, involving mostly technological innovations – like building thousands of reservoirs and implementing drip irrigation systems. For China, it will be a difficult task to manage demand for food and water, as China’s population will reach 1.5 billion by 2030. With rapid development of urbanization, and there will be an increase in water competition between industry, domestic use, and agriculture.
José Joaquín Campos, the Director General of the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center in Costa Rica viewed socio-ecological rural systems not as problems of technology, as the two previous speakers had done, but as “interconnected, complex, and dynamic.” Campos stated that “both social and ecological resilience is key for local and sustainable development, [since] seventy per cent of poor live in rural areas.” Campos also stressed the importance of social responsibility and equity, which could be achieved through local “collective action.”
In the question and answer session, one audience member questioned China’s research in food diversity and resilience. Another doubted that China could solve its problems through its increase in damming and water reservoirs, especially because global warming will make such water storage facilities unsustainable because of increased evaporation.

Thursday: Response of international  agencies
Day three of the conference brought together four representatives from various international development agencies. They evaluated the different strategies used to deal with the 2008 food price crisis, and highlighted future areas of focus for improving agricultural productivity.
The panel acknowledged the importance of empowering small-scale agriculturalists, who are responsible for eighty per cent of the food production in developing countries, yet constitute fifty per cent of the worlds malnourished people.
The panel suggested helping these farmers to expand their enterprises by improving market access and scaling up their businesses. The panel said that because the world faces unprecedented population growth and a subsequent strain on global food resources, there was even more urgency to help small-scale farmers.
Rebekah Young, from the Canadian Department of Finance, cited innovative technologies as a means of accomplishing this, charging the private sector with the responsibility of funding research and development initiatives.
Meanwhile, Cheryl Morden of the International Fund of Agricultural Development (IFAD) discussed tailoring agricultural solutions to the specific ecological and economic needs of small-scale agriculturalists. Calling the population “a huge untapped potential for meeting the increasing global demand for food fuel and fibre,” she advocated for their direct involvement in the planning, development and decision-making processes, as well as the increased involvement of traditionally marginalized groups, namely women, youth ,and indigenous peoples.
The need for sustainability in any proposed solution was also heavily emphasized, despite the fact that governments tend to favour short-term solutions with immediately tangible results.
“Everyone wants results; not because they’re perverse, but because they’re out of business themselves if they can’t show results,” said Carlos Delgado, Strategy and Policy Adviser for the Agriculture and Rural Development Department of the World Bank.
Florence Rolle of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed a combination of short-term solutions, directed at consumers, and long-term solutions. She gave the example of Ethiopia, where immediate government responses such as subsidies were paired with time-intensive solutions, such as the preparation of a five-year development plan.

2010-11-15,McGill,China,"Activists voice opposition to austerity measures in Quebec and worldwide
Hundreds gathered at the intersection of Ste. Catherine and Atwater Friday to protest the Group of 20 (G20) meetings taking place this week in Seoul, South Korea. Brandishing signs in French declaring “NO to the G20” and “the real terrorism is capitalism,” protesters marched east through downtown to denounce the summit of finance ministers and heads of government.
The protest was organized by Anti-Capitalist Convergence (CLAC, its French acronym), a coalition of self-declared anti-capitalist and anarchist organizations in Montreal. CLAC has operated continuously since 2000, when it was formed to mobilize protesters for the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City. Its member groups include the Indigenous Solidarity Committee, the Regroupment Anti-G20 Étudiant (RAGE), No One is Illegal, and the Communist Libertarian Union.
Sarita Ahooja, spokesperson for CLAC and a member of No One Is Illegal, spoke to the crowd before the march describing the event as one of hundreds of “protests around the world to denounce capitalism, misery, and poverty,” as well as “the imposition of measures that contribute to impoverishment [and] only serve to fuel generalized social discontent.”
Others at the march echoed her sentiments. Aaron, a local protester, voiced concern over recent “austerity measures which have real and terrible consequences in people’s lives,” and that he was happy with what he described as “a loud display of resistance [to such measures] here in Montreal.”
Aaron explained why he thought G20 members – including the governments of France, Germany, and Britain – were implementing austerity measures, saying, “Because [the G20] represents the interests of wealth. We live in a neoliberal age where there’s a huge transfer of wealth from public coffers into private hands, even in Quebec.”
Jean, another protestor, put it more bluntly: “It’s all about the money.”
The summit this year focused on the looming specter of a currency war between the largest economies in the world. Relations between the U.S. and China have been especially tense during the lead-up, in particular on the eve of a $600-billion injection into the U.S. economy by the Federal Reserve, which other nations have criticized due to the possibility of stimulating high inflation in the future by keeping the U.S. dollar artificially low.
According to its website, the G20 nations account for  ninety per cent of global gross national product, eighty per cent of international trade, and two thirds of the world’s population.
The G20, and its predecessor the G8, have long drawn controversy due to the high-level security measures imposed on host cities. “This demonstration categorically denounces the repression experienced last June in Toronto,” said Ahooja in reference to the over one thousand arrests made during protests at this summer’s G20 summit in that city. 
In a phone interview after the event, she added that at least two attendees were arrested over the course of the evening’s protest. “They are bent on criminalizing people who are there to contest the order of things,” she said.
Ahooja concluded with a major theme of the protest: “We think society should be organized in a horizontal way, so that people can have a decent living, with dignity, so that there’s justice for everyone, and not just for the few.”

2011-01-22,McGill,China,"New enrolment plan set to change recruitment priorities, deregulate international tuition rates
An unprecedented plan to manage McGill’s student enrolment for the next decade is currently circulating through the various forums that create University policy, and will be presented to Senate for approval March 23.
The Strategic Enrolment Management (SEM) plan outlines a broad tactical approach to enrolment management for the University – including increased recruitment of graduate and international students – from now up until 2016.
Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), described the plan as something that “aligns our broad objectives with respect to enrolment at McGill, and our goals under each of those objectives.”
“An Enrolment Management plan is something that many universities have. We’ve had objectives defined, but not in as much detail and not as coherently as will appear in this plan. So that’s one of the things that was missing,” said Mendelson.
Strategically targeting empty seats
One of the “fundamental goals” targeted in the consultation draft of the SEM plan includes “increases targeted in specific programs,” yet Mendelson emphasized that the SEM plan does not strictly focus on enrolment numbers. When asked which programs were targeted for increases in enrolment, Mendelson answered, “It’s not that kind of a plan.”
“It’s not just about numbers. Enrolment management is essentially about the students’ experience, and it’s about the University’s transaction with students from the time they first visit our website to explore the idea of applying to McGill, through…their transactions with the University when they’re here, and then beyond when they’re alumni,” he said.
Mendelson identified programs in the Faculty of Engineering – such as the Department of Mining and Materials – and those at Macdonald Campus as programs that could be targeted for increases.
“This kind of thinking is very specific to specific programs here and there across the University,” said Mendelson.
Another program that could see increased enrolment is the School of Computer Science. When asked whether Computer Science was targeted for enrolment increases, Gregory Dudek, Director of the School, answered that “it looks like it.” Dudek, however, attributed such forecast increases to exterior influences, as opposed to a specific McGill agenda.
Dudek said the dot-com crash around the year 2000 led to a sharp decrease in Computer Science enrolment, so that now, as a result, the department has more room to accommodate increases.
“Threats”
The SEM plan identifies various “threats” to McGill’s enrolment aspirations, including escalating competition and McGill’s “Research Profile.” Mendelson described these threats as possible competition from other universities, and that of McGill not fulfilling its own high standards.
The SEM plan reads that “we must be mindful of threats to our reputation.”
“McGill was the most research-intensive university in Canada, but that’s no longer the case. So that’s a threat to our reputation,” said Mendelson.
“We are striving to be as student-centred as possible, but we’re not there yet, obviously,” continued Mendelson. “The degree to which students evaluate the University – as not providing as positive an undergraduate experience as they would like, for example – is a threat to our reputation.”
Mendelson also pointed out that McGill has been putting less effort into the recruitment of American high school students in recent years, saying that “complacency” with this constituted yet another threat to McGill’s reputation.
“In a recent survey – recent market research in the U.S. – we’ve learned that most U.S. high school students haven’t heard about McGill,” said Mendelson. “So the quality of the reputation, and just having McGill front-of-mind, is something that we can’t be complacent about. We can’t assume that that’s the case,” he continued.
In order to neutralize some of these threats, the draft consultation SEM plan prescribed various solutions, including shifting the University’s recruitment focus to the southern and western United States – where the university-aged population is expected to grow – and to Colorado, where the SEM plan says “the nation’s best students (approximated by SAT scores)” are, as well as developing relations with “the strongest students” by grade ten.
Deregulating diversity

A central goal of the SEM plan is increased international student enrolment, particularly from countries like India and China. The consultation draft of the SEM plan describes McGill’s desire to increase the overall international student body to approximately 22 per cent of all McGill students by 2016, possibly to offset an anticipated decline in Quebec student enrolment.
According to the consultation draft, “Statistics Canada data suggest that there will be a peak in enrolment in postsecondary institutions in Quebec in 2009-10, which should then be maintained for the following four years, prior to a steep decline, bottoming out in 2025-26.”
Total McGill enrolment is projected to decline 6.9 per cent from 2013 to 2022, while enrolment in all Quebec universities is projected to decline 9.2 per cent over roughly the same period.
The SEM draft notes that competition for students from these countries will increase due to the “improvement in the educational systems of former ‘sending countries’ (e.g. China).” The SEM plan projects that China and India alone will generate over half the global demand in international higher education by 2025.
In order to tap into this swelling reservoir of students, McGill has begun a number of international recruitment schemes. Mendelson said that McGill often participates in joint missions abroad with other Quebec universities as well as with the Quebec and federal governments.
“I myself, for example, was in India a number of years ago, on the Quebec mission,” said Mendelson.
McGill also carries its own independent missions abroad, according to Mendelson, including having faculty and graduate students pitch the University to potential students while they are either back in their home country or attending conferences.
“Our goals and our business is not one hundred per cent aligned necessarily with all the other universities. So it’s a mix of participating, lending our support to efforts that can benefit all universities in Quebec…and at the same time advancing our own interests,” said Mendelson.
In the same breath as it advocates for an increase in the international student population, the draft consultation SEM plan aims to “pursue the deregulation of tuition for international undergraduate students.”
When the Quebec government set international tuition, that revenue was taken by the government and redistributed throughout all Quebec universities.
“The money that international students paid for tuition to come to McGill did not stay in McGill,” said Mendelson.
In 2008, Quebec deregulated international tuition for six disciplines, of which McGill has four – Law, Engineering, Management, and Science – and allows McGill to keep all of that tuition money. According to Mendelson, thirty per cent of net revenue derived from tuition is going to student aid.
“That is important because it means that our students can get the benefit of the tuition they’re actually paying, and it’s important to the University because we end up having increased revenue,” said Mendelson.

2011-02-12,McGill,China,"FECQ criticizes extravagant travel costs
Outraged by CEGEP administrators’ large entertainment expenses, Quebec unions have demanded that Bill 44, a provincial law to increase transparency, accountability and reform CEGEP spending, be brought back to the National Assembly’s agenda.
A February 2 article in the Journal de Québec revealing the spending patterns of CEGEP administrators sparked the controversy. According to the newspaper, entertainment expenses in 2010 – including conferences in luxurious hotels in Brazil, Guadeloupe, and Europe – amounted to at least $324,000 dollars.
Léo Bureau-Blouin, the president of the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ), called the spending “extraordinary” and “excessive.”
“They were talking about five-star hotels to hold meetings of the CEGEP Federation, or trips to Europe, or in Morocco, that could have been avoided,” said Bureau-Blouin. “We think that it was a lot of money that could have been spent on more priority aspects of CEGEPs.”
“In many regions of Quebec, there are great needs for psychologists, or for classes, or for new computers, and we are seeing that CEGEP administrators were making trips to, like I said, Morocco, or to China,” he added.
However, CEGEP representatives have criticized the accuracy of the Journal de Québec accusations.
“We found that this article is incorrect, that it is false on many respects,” said the CEGEP Federation director of communications Caroline Tessier in French.  “There is some information that is not fair, or that in any case implies negative things that are not the reality. I am thinking for example of everything concerning international trips. This is part of CEGEPs’ mission, so it is normal for them to travel abroad.”
Nevertheless, FECQ and the Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ) – a union representing nearly 180,000 members, including over 100,000 education personnel – have used the controversy to push for the adoption of Bill 44.
Bill 44 was first introduced to the National Assembly on October 30, 2008, to tighten rules regarding the financial management of CEGEPs, by increasing transparency and accountability. However, after two years of detailed study and numerous amendments, the bill has stalled.
“We also think that by making public the meetings and the statements of administrative councils, it will be much easier to follow the activities of CEGEPs,” said an adviser for the CSQ, Gabriel Danis, in French.  “So it’s for this reason that we were making the link between the frivolous expenses that were revealed in the newspaper and Bill 44.”
It remains to be seen whether the bill will be re-introduced to the National Assembly.
“We think that we really need to have clear rules about how we spend money that comes from the Quebec government that is given to CEGEP students, because we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that are given to Quebec CEGEPs,” said Bureau-Blouin. “We can’t wait anymore and we hope that the ministry of education will hear our calls.”

2012-05-20,McGill,China,"Passage of Bill 78 and municipal “anti-mask” bylaw could mean end of student strike
In the face of a series of government legislation cracking down on protest rights and threatening their 14-week student strike, several thousand demonstrators marched through downtown Montreal for almost seven hours Friday night.
This was the 25th consecutive night demonstration protesting planned tuition hikes which – after one short and violent clash with officers from the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) – became by the longest demonstration in what is now the longest student strike in Quebec history.
The demonstration began peacefully around 9 p.m., with thousands leaving Parc Émilie-Gamelin and marching through downtown Montreal.
Around 10 p.m., the arrest of one demonstrator triggered a clash between protestors and police near the entrance to Chinatown at St. Laurent and René Lévesque. Fellow demonstrators reacted by shouting for his release, with some throwing rocks and other projectiles at police, driving police north up St. Laurent towards René Lévesque.
One protestor threw a Molotov cocktail at police at René Lévesque. Police responded with pepper spray, smoke bombs, sound grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets.
Police quickly declared the demonstration illegal, but the majority of protestors regrouped a few minutes later and resumed marching. The march continued through downtown for another six hours and ended around 4 a.m. Thursday morning near Parc Lafontaine.
There was one other incident of vandalism. Marching west on René Lévesque around 1 a.m., protesters passed a line of five police cars and a man standing in his doorway giving protestors the middle finger. Protestors smashed the man’s apartment window in a hail of projectiles, before smashing the back window of one of the police cruisers.
The SPVM reported four arrests and no injuries as a result of the demonstration early Thursday morning.
Bill 78
A frantic day in the municipal and provincial legislature precipitated Friday night’s demonstration.
Late Friday afternoon the Quebec National Assembly passed Bill 78 – a controversial bill proposed by Education Minister Michelle Courchesne – 68 votes to 48. The bill, titled “An Act to enable students to receive instruction from the post-secondary institutions they attend,” suspends the winter and summer semesters for the 11 universities and 14 CEGEPS still effected by the strike until August.
Organizers of the demonstrations of 50 people or more must also provide police with its route and duration at least eight hours before it begins. Police may require organizers to change the venue or route of the demonstration.
Fines for contravening Bill 78 provisions can reach $5,000 for individuals, $35,000 for a senior officer in a student association, and $125,000 for student associations. Fines will be doubled for any subsequent offenses.
The bill has been criticized by several civil rights groups, including the Quebec Bar Association, in part due to its ambiguity in some areas. Section 30, for example, states that anyone “who helps or induces a person to commit an offense” under the bill will also be subject to the fine.
The law went into effect Saturday morning.
Bill 78 (English)
The “anti-mask” bylaw
The Montreal city council passed a bylaw on Thursday banning the wearing of masks at demonstrations “without reasonable motive.” The bylaw, drafted following this year’s anti-police brutality march and scheduled to be voted on in mid-June, was fast-tracked in response to the now daily student protests against tuition hikes.
Both opposition parties in city hall, Vision Montréal and Projet Montréal, voted against the bylaw, but with Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s Union Montréal party holding a majority in the council the bylaw passed 33 to 25. The bylaw also went into effect Saturday morning.
Telling the council that the bylaw will be a tool that allows police to “isolate vandals and prevent acts of violence,” Tremblay declared, “It’s time to take back our streets.”
Montreal police chief Marc Parent attended the special council session, saying the bylaw will be used “with discretion, like all the other laws we can already apply to protests.
“When we think there’s a threat to safety it will be used. It’s preventative,” said Parent.
Parent noted that a few years ago only one to two per cent of demonstrations ended in violence, but lately nearly 35 per cent end in criminal acts.

2012-10-22,McGill,China,"Tuition and underfunding major concerns
Principal and Vice-Chancellor Heather Munroe-Blum addressed a crowd of 425 people last Friday afternoon on the importance of bringing international students to Quebec universities.
The event, hosted by the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations, was held at Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth Hotel in downtown Montreal. The main event of the afternoon was Munroe-Blum’s speech, entitled “Quebec in the race for global talent.”
The speech was structured around “myths” about international students in Quebec. According to Munroe-Blum, one such myth is the fact that “higher tuition rates would drive talented Quebec and international students away from [Quebec] universities.”
“Studies across the country are crystal-clear: no link exists between the amount of tuition and attendance in universities,” she said.
Munroe-Blum also mentioned that McGill seeks to attract international students for the “cultural and intellectual enrichment of our learning community,” and not for gains from higher tuition.
“Under the Quebec funding system, most of the tuition paid by students from outside Quebec returns to the government…Because of this, each year, McGill gives back around $55 million of its students’ fees,” said Munroe-Blum.
SSMU President Josh Redel, who was present at the conference, told The Daily in an email that although the Principal’s statements were based on research, there are important caveats to account for.
“While increased tuition may not affect overall attendance in universities, it is quite likely that higher tuition would certainly affect attendance by under-represented groups that might not have the privilege of being able to afford the higher tuition,” wrote Redel.
According to Redel, SSMU stands for accessible education for all.
Redel also pointed to ways of helping international students in terms of entrance and language support.
“I think [Quebec] needs to provide better support for international students by cutting down the red tape surrounding the visa and study visa process…[and] provide better language support for international students,” wrote Redel. “I think many students would love to be able to learn French and speak it while they are here, but the province provides no such framework to assist in that endeavour. By providing a better support system for teaching and learning French, more students would be able to become employed and would be way more likely to remain in the province.”
Munroe-Blum gave three recommendations: to increase the number of French courses offered at McGill, to increase the number of international student enrolment to 33 per cent, and to encourage investment in higher education.
This event also marked the first meeting of Munroe-Blum and Minister of Higher Education Pierre Duchesne.
Following the conference session, Munroe-Blum met with members of the student and Montreal press. At the meeting, The Daily asked about the effect of the Quebec student strike on McGill’s international reputation.
“The international world is used to disruption and I did a lot of interviews with international media back in the spring. At the same time, London was having riots, California was having riots, everywhere you go in the world there were things happening… It is true today that Montreal is one of the safest really cosmopolitan, big cities where students from around the world can come,” responded Munroe-Blum.
The McGill Tribune asked about the portion of international student tuition that goes into the Quebec financial aid system but which students don’t have access to.
“It is a significant portion of the tuition fee they pay [that] they don’t get the benefit of, and McGill doesn’t get the finances to support them. So if you look around McGill right now, you’ll see blue bins all over our campus asking our employees to bring coats because we have students from the South, from developing countries, who are here without winter clothes,” said Munroe-Blum.
“If you’re coming from a background where no one in your family has gone to university before and you don’t have much financial resources, you need more support than free tuition. You actually need full support for all kinds of services…. We are underfunded so we’re making a strong case – I’ll make it to the Minister – that money should stay where the students pay it,” she added.
The Daily also asked about McGill’s ability to finance international marketing considering the state of university funding.
Munroe-Blum pointed to the fact that the University depends on others – like alumni – to pay for marketing.
“Our Hong Kong alumni and our China mainland alumni are very upset that McGill doesn’t advertise there,” she said. “Queen’s University does, Toronto does, all the American universities do, the Australian universities do, the British universities do, and they are saying, ‘we want our alma mater to be seen in the newspaper and seen on television.’”

2013-01-24,McGill,China,"Endorses DPS, opposes budget cuts
Last Wednesday, Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) councillors discussed motions about the opposition to Quebec’s budget cuts, the Daily Publications Society (DPS), accessible education, and opposition to war on Iran. 
Of the five motions on the agenda, only two were actually debated, as one was resigned, one was tabled until the next council meeting, and one was tabled indefinitely.  
The council meeting began with a presentation by Associate Dean (Academic Administration and Oversight) Gillian Lane-Mercier about a new initiative named “People, Processes, and Partnerships.” 
According to Lane-Mercier, the initiative aims to re-organize the administration to ensure that the Faculty provides the best possible services to students, faculty members, and each other. 
Due to a new ruling of the Parti Québécois (PQ) government, for every two administrative or general staff members that leave McGill, the University is allowed to hire only one. 
“It’s really difficult to find back-up people to fill striking staff members’ positions,” said Lane-Mercier, alluding to the McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strike.  “Some managers turned out not to even know processes they were supposed to be doing,” Lane-Mercier told the councillors.
The administrative re-organization will be both physical and structural. In order to create a seamless experience for students, the Faculty of Arts is planning on creating hubs, whereby it will be easier for students to reach services such as advising. 
Lane-Mercier ended her presentation by emphasizing the amount of student input that is part of this initiative, and asked the AUS councillors to volunteer their support.
As part of her report on external affairs, SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser reported on SSMU’s projected involvement in the PQ government’s much anticipated education summit, slated to happen in February. 
McGill Environment Students’ Society representative Christian Elliott, and AUS VP External Brian Farnan moved the motion to oppose the provincial budget cuts required for McGill University, which passed with a single abstention and no votes against.
AUS VP Communications Yasmeen Gholmieh and AUS VP Finance Saad Qazi moved a motion to endorse a yes vote for the Daily Publications Society’s (DPS) existence referendum. The motion was passed. 
During deliberations, most councillors pointed out a previous article that was published and subsequently retracted by The Daily that openly attacked a member of the AUS council. “[The] thing about journalism is that they criticize, so we’ll take [the criticism],” Qazi said.  
In response to a suggestion of conditional endorsement, Arts senator James Gutman asked, “Is this the AUS or the Communist Party of China?” however he quickly retracted his statement.
The motion regarding the opposition of the war on Iran was tabled indefinitely, along with the motion on accessible education, which was tabled again until the next council meeting.

Zbigniew Brzezinski (McGill BA ‘49, MA ‘50) served as National Security Advisor for U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Brzezinski oversaw the normalization of U.S. relations with China, for which Carter awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Equally notable, Brzezinski’s tenure in the White House also included the Camp David Accords of 1978, which established peace between Israel and Egypt, and the Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis of 1979. Presently, Brzezinski serves as a counsellor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., and as a senior research professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. 
McGill Daily (MD): How would you evaluate the current [U.S.] administration’s handling of the Arab Spring and the war in Syria?
Zbigniew Brzezinski (ZB): I think it has been prudent and cautious, but under the circumstances, that  is justified. The Arab Spring, widely proclaimed by journalists as a great democratic phenomenon, is still uncertain of its historical trajectory. It could easily end up as the “Arab Winter.”
MD: How would you evaluate the relationship between the current administration and Israel? Do you think the administration should be tougher with Netanyahu?
ZB: I think the administration should be guided by its best judgment of the American national interest. What is good for America is almost inevitably good for Israel, given its dependence on America. 
MD: Do you think that the opposite is true, that what is good for Israel is inevitably good for America?
ZB: No, I think that what is good for America is inevitably good for Israel, given its dependence on [our] military and financial support. Now obviously, America is not dependent on Israel for support. 
MD: Do you think that, considering the backlash against the announcement of new settler homes to be built in the West Bank, that the administration should reign in Israel?
ZB: The United States reacted critically and publicly to these decisions. There were statements to that effect both from the White House and from the State Department.
MD: On a different topic, how do you feel about the funding of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan during the Carter administration?
ZB: I think it was a desirable and necessary step, supported by the overwhelming majority of the international community. The Soviet [invasion of Afghanistan] was an outright aggression and it was potentially destabilizing for the entire region. 
MD: Is there a way that America could have prevented the growth of the Taliban out of that funding?
ZB: You know, the Taliban arose about ten years after the Soviet invasion. I don’t think you are very familiar with the facts, judging by that question. The Taliban didn’t appear on the scene until about ten years later. 
MD: But many journalists and commentators have inferred that the funding of the Mujahideen in the late 1970s was somehow responsible for the rise of the Taliban. Do you contend that?
ZB: The rise of the Taliban was the consequence of the destruction of the Afghan society by ten years of war, which was waged by the Soviets against the Afghan resistance.
MD: Okay, on the subject of Iran: do you think that the United States should bear moral responsibility for the replacement of [the democratically elected president] Mossadegh by the Shah, and the backlash against the Shah by the Islamist regime?
ZB: I think the United States was unwise in the way it handled the Mossadegh challenge. I understand the Iranian resentment about what happened in the early 1950s, in other words, almost sixty years ago.
MD: What would you identify as the greatest success and the greatest failure of your time as National Security Advisor?
ZB: I think the greatest successes were several. I think the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt was a major success; I think the opening, both political and strategic, to China, was a very major breakthrough, which continues to shape international affairs to this time. I think the peaceful resolution of the Panama Canal problem created stability in America’s relations with Central America. I think the greatest setback was, of course, the failure of the rescue mission.
MD: On the topic of Iran today, how do you evaluate the nuclear threat?
ZB: I think it potentially could be serious, but in my judgment, it can be handled effectively without a war.
MD: Do you think the regime is sufficiently irrational to launch, or even threaten to launch, a nuclear weapon?
ZB: I don’t think there is one item of evidence to support that proposition. It is a self-serving regime; it is a very scheming regime; but it is not a suicidal regime. And neither is the country suicidal. The Iranians are very intelligent people.
MD: On the topic of Chinese-American relations, how do you think they should evolve? And what is the biggest challenge to the Chinese-American relationship?
ZB: I think the biggest challenge to the relationship is the rising nationalistic fervor in Asia, and the resulting regional instability. The way to cope with it is to have a close, consultative relationship with the Chinese, so that each side has a better understanding of the other side’s point of view and interests. Okay, one more question, okay?
MD: On the subject of the U.S. economy: do you think that the U.S. economy is doomed to be uncompetitive, and how does the U.S. absorb the non-service economy?
ZB: Let’s look at the economic projections for [2013]. Already indications are rising that the recovery is beginning. I think that in the advanced world, that the American economy is the engine of change. Of course, China, in the longer run, may surpass America. But that is several decades away. 
MD: How do you think the U.S. should get used to not being the hegemon; that is, how should the U.S. get used to being in a multi-polar world?
ZB: Well, I wrote a book about it, which appeared earlier this year, called Strategic Vision. It is very exactly on that subject. So let me end on a very self-serving plug for my book. If the readers find this interview of interest, perhaps they should look at that book. Could you do me the favour of sending me a copy of the McGill – it’s still called the McGill Daily? I’d love to have it. I very much valued my days at McGill.

2013-06-25,McGill,China,"An account of June’s demonstrations in solidarity with Occupy Gezi
A sepia photograph depicting Turkey’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, printed on top of a crescent moon and star on a red flag, stood visible in the distance. The date was June 9, on the grassy slopes of Mount Royal Park, where community members gathered in solidarity with the Occupy Gezi movement.
McGill engineering student Melih Cem Oluscender, and former McGill students Merve Sancak and Suna Tatlipinar, were the first to organize the Sunday protests in Mount Royal Park.
The mobilization of Turkish McGill students has since prompted a diverse gathering of Montrealers in support of freedom of speech and democratic values.
Turkish students enrolled at McGill University at the start of the 2012 fall semester numbered 110 out of 8,302 total international students (not counting those with Canadian citizenship or permanent residencies). They rank 14th on the list of McGill’s international student populations, a ranking that has been steadily rising every year.
According to Sancak, the first Sunday demonstration, held on June 2, garnered mainly Turkish people. By the second weekly demonstration, Sancak said that as the word spread of the movement, there were new faces in the crowd, with many that she did not even recognize.
On June 5, at a meeting organized by Canadian Marxist journal Fightback, 20 organizers discussed what was in store for Turkey and the Middle East. It had been one week since the beginning of unrest in Istanbul.
“Erdoğan is trying to destroy Kemalism, which is holding all ethnicities together,” said Sibel Kose, a Greenpeace member for over 20 years.
Kemalism – the political ideology of Atatürk – was founded on six principles, among them secularism and revolutionism. “They just want their democratic rights back,” added Kose, speaking about those who were protesting in the streets.
In a phone interview with The Daily, a consultant at the Turkish consulate in Montreal named Tatlipinar suggested that “the Canadian government should at least put pressure on the Turkish government.”
Although not representative of the Consulate’s stance on the issue, Tatlipinar believes that “[cutting] ties with Turkey is not good for Turkish people.”
Tatlipinar also felt that certain rights were being stamped upon by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party, most notably freedom of speech.
“The television was airing nothing,” Tatlipinar said of the movement’s first few days.
The 2012 prison census conducted by the Committee to Protect Journalists reported 49 journalists imprisoned in Turkish jails – 21 per cent of all reported jailed journalists worldwide – giving Turkey the moniker of “the world’s worst jailer of the press.” In 2011, eight journalists were in Turkish prisons, marking an 84 per cent increase over one year.
Both Iran and China tailgated Turkey in terms of the number of journalists imprisoned, with 45 and 32 reporters jailed, respectively.
McGill Economics Masters student Dilek Sayedahmed listed Turkish channels that she claimed were not broadcasting news on Occupy Gezi at the time of interview on June 3, citing CNN Turk, NTV, Star TV, and Haberturk TV.
“Thanks to the foreign press, we got to hear about what was happening,” Sayedahmed said.
McGill Operations Management PhD student Ali Inay called what the Turkish government’s practice “auto-censorship,” adding, “We can be a better democracy.”
On June 24, the BBC reported that one of its journalists, Selin Girit, was “attacked on social media by the mayor of Ankara for her coverage of the current protests.”
According to the BBC, Mayor Ibrahim Melih Gokcek has since threatened to sue every Twitter user who uses an anti-Gokcek hashtag created since the threats were made toward Girit. Over three weeks ago, Prime Minister Erdoğan said on Turkish television, “There is now a menace which is called Twitter.”
In an interview for The Daily, McGill undergraduate student Zeynep Kelioglu brought up the number of Twitter users that have been arrested for their online anti-government activity, saying “[Erdoğan] will probably put me in jail if he reads this interview.”

2014-09-22,McGill,China,"Funding approval, federal exemption still needed before sites can open

Last week, Montreal’s mayor Denis Coderre announced his intention to release the eventual locations of Montreal’s first supervised injection sites (SISs), though he gave no indication as to when that announcement will come, or when installation will begin.
A similar statement was released in December 2013, which declared that Montreal was soon to welcome four SISs, with locations across the city and one mobile clinic to serve the greater Montreal area.
Supervised injection sites are locations where injection drug users can obtain clean needles, dispose of used ones, access social workers, and receive on-site emergency medical attention if needed. They are part of an initiative known as ‘harm reduction,’ and work to provide safe spaces and non-coercive, non-judgemental care to those trying to fight addiction.
It has been over ten years since Quebec-based organizations such as the Association pour la Défense des Droits et l’Inclusion des personnes qui Consomment des drogues du Québec (ADDICQ), CACTUS Montréal, and Dopamine – located in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood – first started to campaign for SISs to be opened in Montreal after Vancouver opened its first SIS, InSite, in 2003.
The only role that these community-based organizations are playing right now is purely to raise awareness on a local level. “One thing we still can do is [to] have some groundwork [done] in our community in order to make sure that people understand why we need to have this sort of service, and what positive impacts it can have in the community,” Sandhia Vadlamudy, the executive director of CACTUS, told The Daily.
Funding for the sites has yet to be approved, according to Marie-France Coutu, a spokesperson from the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal, and until this is done the project cannot move forward. “We gave a document […] in January, and we are waiting for [Quebec’s provincial health ministry’s …] approval because we need the approbation of the federal government,” she told The Daily in an email.
The initial request for funding was filed by the Montreal Director of Public Health to Quebec’s Ministry of Health and Social Services, asking for $3.2 million initially and an additional $2.7 million annually.
Lucie Charlebois, Quebec Minister for Rehabilitation (Youth Protection and Public Health) declined to comment on her stance regarding SISs and did not respond to emails asking if funding had been approved or when the administration would announce a decision.
Once the funding is approved, the sites will require an exemption from Canada’s drug laws provided by the federal government. However, the Conservative government has shown hostility in the past toward SIS projects, when it refused to renew InSite’s exemption in 2008. Only after InSite appealed to the Canadian Supreme Court did the justices rule against the Conservatives, declaring in 2011 that InSite’s benefit to society trumped Canada’s drug laws.
Assuming the exemption request passes, it will need to be accompanied by a letter outlining security issues written by the Montreal police chief. Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) spokesperson Marie-Elaine Ladouceur confirmed in an email to The Daily that the SPVM has not publicly announced whether it intends to write one.
Only if all of these conditions are met can the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal begin working with community organizations to set up the clinics.
SISs have been controversial since their inception, as they involve the open provision of supplies to individuals who wish to use illegal substances.
InSite began as a pilot project, initiated to address the fact that Vancouver was experiencing the highest HIV transmission rates of any developed country.
While the 2008 Supreme Court decision allowed for the continued existence of InSite, its recommendation that ‘parameters be established’ has resulted in a motion called Bill C-2, or the “Respect for Communities Act.” If passed, the bill will place several conditions on any application for exemption, requiring them to include interviews of local police, doctors, and scientists. The bill is in its second reading.
M-J Milloy, a research scientist at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV and AIDS, an assistant professor in the department of medicine at the University of British Columbia, and a former McGill student, was part of a team that worked on evaluating the effect of InSite on overdose patterns among Vancouver’s intravenous drug users.
“What we’ve found [in Vancouver] is that a site is one good way to begin to meet these needs in ways [that] are not detrimental to other community members,” Milloy told The Daily in an interview. “By that I mean we did not see the site add to levels of drug use, add to levels of drug-related crime, and it does not damage communities’ local conditions to any extent.”
“InSite is right on the edge of Chinatown, and many Chinatown merchants were strongly opposed to the facility before it opened because they feared it would attract more people to the area, and that it would result in more drug use, violence, and litter,” added Milloy. “[Yet] a number of years after the facility opened, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper began making serious moves to close the facility, the heads of the merchant association wrote him a letter saying, ‘Please keep the facility open because of all the wonderful things it’s done for our neighbourhood.”
Anna Marie D’Angelo, the Senior Media Relations Officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, the organization that runs InSite, told The Daily she thinks Bill C-2 will “make it more challenging, if not impossible, for new SISs to start up.”
“For many people it’s a black and white issue. They don’t accept harm reduction, [which is] a research-supported addiction treatment.”
D’Angelo likened the process to smoking cigarettes. “If you look at people who smoke, there are a lot of people who use the patch, which is a form of harm reduction. It seems like when you go over the addiction line into the illicit drugs, everything has to change as far as the addiction treatment, when actually the same kind of principles work.”

2014-10-06,McGill,China,"Students and community members rally in support of Hong Kong student protests
In support of the Occupy Central campaign, over 100 attendees gathered outside the McConnell Engineering building in solidarity with student protesters in Hong Kong. The event was hosted by QPIRG McGill and students Michael Law, Elliot Tan, Ailisha Macharia, and Cathy Wong.
The rally kicked off around 2 p.m., as demonstrators began to assemble, many sporting a yellow ribbon – the symbol of global solidarity with the protesters in Hong Kong. All of the speakers were unanimous in their support for Hong Kong’s fight for democracy and against police violence.
“A few days ago in Hong Kong, students went down the streets […] they’re protesting against the Chinese government’s recent decision to undermine Hong Kong’s democracy by stating that the candidates that they would vote on in 2017 must be approved by Beijing prior to the election,” said Law. “That’s not how democracy works.”
In 2013, the Occupy Central movement was founded by Benny Tai Yiu-ting, an associate law professor at the University of Hong Kong.
Dubbed the “umbrella revolution,” referring to protesters’ use of umbrellas to guard against the police’s use of pepper spray, the protests in Hong Kong can trace their roots to the years of anger Hong Kongers hold against their Chinese-appointed government, undemocratically elected by partial suffrage. The city’s wealth disparity and ever-rising living costs have been another source of discontent.
However, the spark that catalyzed this built-up tension came from Beijing. In June, the Chinese central government released a white paper asserting “comprehensive jurisdiction” over the city and making alarming statements such as the requirement that judges be “patriotic.”
The last nail on the coffin was hammered in on August 31, when Beijing declared its decision on electoral reform for the election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2017, effectively blocking all candidates except those pre-approved by the central government.
In response, university and secondary school student associations started a city-wide boycott of class on September 22, triggering a series of sit-ins and protests that steadily escalated into physical confrontations with the police. This culminated in clashes between protesters and the police on the grounds of the government headquarters.
Riding on the popularity of the student protests, Tai announced the start of the Occupy Central protests on September 28. In the ensuing conflicts, the use of force by the Hong Kong police peaked when tear gas was fired into protesting crowds and gave rise to photos such as that of the “Umbrella Man,” which circulated widely on social media.
Vincent Tao, a member of No One is Illegal Toronto, spoke to the deep emotional impact of seeing fellow Hong Kongers protest in the streets.
“I am the son of Hong Kongers […] so I cannot begin to describe the complicated feelings of longing and belonging I felt when I first saw the images of Victoria Square filled with people my age marching for what they believe in,” he told the crowd.
“We recognize that an empowered people will empower others. And a freed people will free others. And democracy is contagious,” said Law.
Following the speeches made by the organizers of the protest, a petition was made available for attendees to sign in support of Occupy Central. It will eventually be delivered to the Consulate of China in Montreal.
Hui Peng, who came to Canada a year and a half ago from mainland China, compared the Occupy Central movement to past political protests. “This is really similar to what happened in China 25 years ago, which is the Tiananmen Square massacre. There are some things similar, and some things different, which is this time, the people there, they are more disciplined. They know that they are not going to fight, they are [going to] peacefully argue for their rights. I think there is hope.”
“The cause of Hong Kong is the cause of all of us; it is the cause of people in Indonesia, Taiwan […] because they want real democracy […] and everyone stands in solidarity with Hong Kong,” said Nicholas Pullen, a Masters student in History.
Despite public support for the Occupy Central movement, Tao reminded attendees to contextualize it in past political struggles in Hong Kong, as well as current labour struggles that span beyond the achievement of democracy.
“So contrary to the notion that this is the first time in Hong Kong’s history that the people are coordinating themselves with little direction from the government or institutions, and with an exceptional air of middle-class decorum at that, we must be reminded that in May of 1967, the youth of my father’s generation set off bombs in the fight for decent working conditions and social planning initiatives from Hong Kong’s negligent colonial administration,” said Tao.
“What must not be erased here is the long history of labour organizing, grassroots mobilization, and protest in Hong Kong. But more importantly, I fear what else may be erased in our hasty celebration of the pro-democracy movement is the actual content of democracy,” Tao continued. “Why is there no mention of the appalling income gap in Hong Kong, of how one in five of the island’s population are below the poverty line, of how suicide rates in the city’s poorer neighbourhoods are three and a half times higher than they are in the adjacent financial districts?”
Tao also highlighted the issues faced by foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong. “Will universal suffrage be extended to the foreign domestic workers from Indonesia, the Philippines, Nepal, Thailand, and Bangladesh that make up 10 per cent of the island’s workforce?”
Tao referenced the case of Erwania Sulistyaningsih, an Indoensian woman who was severely abused during her time as a migrant worker in Hong Kong. “When migrant workers must keep silence in the face of overwhelming rates of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse from the employers they must live with for fear of near-immediate deportation, how can we begin to talk about democracy?”

2015-11-30,McGill,China,"Research to bring together faculties of Arts and Engineering 
A $3.4 million gift from a McGill alumnus has established the Yan P. Lin Centre for the Study of Freedom and Global Orders in Ancient and Modern Worlds. The launch of the Centre took place on October 26, and while the Centre has already organized lectures and activities, the official inaugural lecture by Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson will take place on April 13, 2016.
The Centre is organized into five partly independent research groups: Global Antiquities, Transitions and Global Modernities, Constitutional Studies, Global Justice, and Democracy, Space, and Technology. Each research group is directed by one or two McGill professors who are leading scholars in their fields.
The Daily spoke to Jacob Levy, the founding director of the Centre, coordinator of its Constitutional Studies research group, and Tomlinson Professor of Political Theory.
According to Levy, the Yan P. Lin Centre “aims to bring together studies of society and of social change from across the normative, comparative, and historical disciplines – broadly speaking, encouraging interdisciplinary work from a range of departments, a range of faculties, all focused on that kind of humanistic inquiry to the nature of society and government.”
“A centre like this [… takes] us outside the box of just thinking in terms of our discipline and our department.”
Yan P. Lin, who obtained his PhD from McGill in 1992, told The Daily he was motivated to donate to the university because he wanted to “find a way to do something that is good for McGill, just like McGill did […] for me many years ago.”
According to Anastassios Anastassiadis, a professor in the Department of History and a co-coordinator of the Transitions and Global Modernities research group, “A centre like this [… takes] us outside the box of just thinking in terms of our discipline and our department.”
As noted by Levy, each research pillar will focus on one area of study. For instance, the research group on Constitutional Studies focuses on research “at the overlap of political theory and philosophy, of political science about constitutional-level institutions […] and legal philosophy.” The research group on Global Antiquities seeks to study ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and ancient China from a comparative perspective.
Hans Beck, co-coordinator of the Global Antiquities research group and History professor, stressed the need for a “new approach to world antiquity,” one that cuts across time and cultural barriers, given that McGill has “changed so dramatically” over recent years, from student population to faculty composition and disciplines.
However, Anastassiadis also noted a simultaneous stagnation at McGill, remarking that “contrary to what [universities] say, they are quite traditional in their organization and their structure,” and that he hoped the Centre would help McGill “rethink its own structure.”
Students seemed largely enthusiastic about the Centre and pleased with the use of the money.
“I think it is a very generous gift to McGill and is going to be a great contribution,” said Ashley Wood, a U0 Arts student.
Emma Ebowe, a U1 Economics and Political Science student, said, “This […] is probably exactly what McGill needs – a way of combining seemingly unrelated disciplines to help us really understand the broader themes we’re trying to study.”
Amid cuts to public education spending under the Quebec Liberal government’s austerity measures, concerns have been voiced for years that alumni donations designated for specific projects gave the illusion of financial affluence and directed attention away from the government’s lack of financial support.
“Philanthropy is no substitute for government support.”
In 2013, when Campaign McGill raised a record $1 billion in donations over eight years, former Principal Heather Munroe-Blum told The Daily that “not a dollar of the philanthropy that comes in is used for the operating budget at the university.”
“With the underfunding of universities that we experience, it is absolutely essential that government stay the course in funding universities to the high level. Philanthropy is no substitute for government support,” said Munroe-Blum at the time.
Asked whether the Centre was the most prudent use of the money, given McGill’s well-documented financial troubles, Beck stated that since the money was an endowment, it was earmarked specifically for the creation of the Centre. As a result, McGill had to comply with the donor’s choice as to how to allocate the funds.
“When we hit the point of having roughly a $3 million endowment, then we’re dependent on the McGill payout rates for what happens with an endowment,” explained Levy. “That means the whole Centre, including the five research groups and the overarching Centre, will be running at about 4 per cent per year of the $3 million.”

2016-11-14,McGill,China,"AMUSE welcomes senators and governors to talk about negotiations
On Wednesday, November 10, McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) and Senate met for its annual Joint Board-Senate Meeting (JBSM) at the University’s Faculty Club on McTavish Street. The meeting’s topic was “McGill’s sustainability plans and initiatives,” and featured presentations from three McGill professors.
“Our [sustainability mission] at McGill has three components: teaching/learning, research and service to society,” said Principal Suzanne Fortier in her introductory remarks, “and so for us, it is very important to offer on our campus, and in a variety of fields, not just environmental sciences, [the chance] to learn about sustainability, to teach about sustainability, and also to empower our students to bring that in their activities, not only while they’re at McGill, but after they leave our university.”
The presenters at the meeting were part of the McGill team that spoke at the last Annual Meeting of the New Champions of the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China. All three presentations focused on accessibility in each of their scientific subfields.
“Global agriculture is now being shaped by globalization,” said Graham MacDonald, an assistant professor in the department of Geography, whose talk focused on sustainable approaches in worldwide agricultural systems.
“This is the century of urbanization: by 2050, seventy per cent of wealth – nine billion people – will live in cities. Cities form a vast global network, connected by flows of people, energy, goods, and information,” said Andrew Gonzalez, Director of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences. “The challenge of this century is to make cities sustainable.”
“[In our research], we calculated boundaries for nine different earth systems, and together, those boundaries are defined by a safe operating space for humanity,” said Elena Bennett, a professor in the Natural Resource Sciences department at McGill, in reference to the different ‘spheres’ of Earth, such as atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, and humans’ effects on these spheres.
She focused largely on the intersection between humans’ social systems and sustainability. “If [humans] stay inside those boundaries, those critical systems are most likely to stay in the safer state,” she said.
While the night’s conversations may have revolved around McGill’s role in sustainability initiatives, no mention was made about McGill’s investments in fossil fuels, a subject that has caused controversy on campus in the past. Last year, the BoG’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) released a report which claimed that climate change did not cause “grave social injury,” and therefore divestment from fossil fuels was unwarranted.
For the first time last month, the BoG prematurely adjourned a meeting so they would not have to listen to members of Divest McGill who showed up to shed light on the recent open forums on sustainability.
Once again, the Board seemed unwilling to actively discuss environmental sustainability. Speaking to The Daily, one of the evening’s participants, who chose to remain anonymous out of fear of repercussions, said that a member of his table called the whole discussion of the night “esoteric nonsense,” refusing to acknowledge McGill’s role in issues of sustainability.
AMUSE at the JBSM
Prior to the start of the JBSM, senators and governors were welcomed by members of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) at the Faculty Club’s entrance.
AMUSE, 85 per cent of whose membership consists of student employees on campus, has been working since May to negotiate its second collective agreement with the University. The union commenced a five-day strike on October 28, when they felt that the administration was not willing to compromise. On November 10, the union re-initiated bargaining discussions with the University.
“I just came out of a bargaining session,” said Heather Holdsworth, a member of AMUSE and its bargaining team in negotiations with the administration, “and we’re hoping to increase pressure and awareness among upper administration and power holders at McGill to support and push for our bargaining priorities.”
Having listened to AMUSE members, McGill doesn’t seem to have come anywhere near their demands in recent negotiations.
“We know that the Joint Board Senate meeting is a space [where] people can advocate on our behalf and push HR [Human Resources] to widen their mandate in order for them to meet some of our bargaining priorities,” she concluded.

2016-11-28,McGill,China,"Students discuss lived experiences in McGill’s academic spaces
On the evening of Thursday, November 24, around twenty students gathered in the William Shatner Building to attend an event called “Campus Conversations: Race in the Academy,” which prompted discussion of racial issues in academia.
The event, hosted by the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Equity, was open to students who identified as Black, Indigenous, mixed-race, and people of colour (BIMPoC) from all faculties.
The event examined McGill’s academic spaces and was accompanied by facilitators and trained active listeners to foster solidarity and a safe space. SSMU Equity hoped to bring forward the experiences and voices of racialized students.
The discussion focused on themes such as lived experiences of racialized classmates and decolonizing education and de-centering whiteness in the academy.
Two main themes were presented, the first regarding “departments and courses,” and the other regarding “the atmosphere of being an ethnic, or a visible minority on campus.” Participants were encouraged to contribute to the conversation as speakers and listeners.
When participants were asked whether they were expected to behave in a certain manner at McGill because of their race, religion, culture, or ethnicity, one student claimed that they have become “disenfranchised” with their faculty.
“There’s a […] constant perpetuation of the difference between objective fact and truth, and what people who live in the experiences of neo-colonialism actually experience,” explained the student. “For me, it’s often difficult to sit and hear peers speak with a certain air of expertise of things that are far more nuanced than they are projecting them as.”
This was echoed by a second student who decided to leave the same faculty due to “the hegemonic discourses.” Microaggression was a prominent sentiment among students who felt that “certain people like to take up space.”
A third participant spoke of an instance where a classmate was told that they “speak really well for a Black girl.”
“How can your race just define your intellect?” that person asked.
“There’s a […] constant perpetuation of the difference between objective fact and truth, and what people who live in the experiences of neo-colonialism actually experience.”
During the discussion, some students mentioned that instructors have the ability to exacerbate marginalization when faced with a racist or sexist comment, especially “when someone in your class or conference says something clearly problematic, but the prof […] or TA […] nuances it, and [says] it’s fine.”
While students in the group participated in course evaluations, they questioned the effectiveness of these evaluations, as they were “dependent on the class size,” and held a “risk of identifying yourself.”
“How can your race just define your intellect?”
A fourth participant mentioned that they felt intimidated by that power dynamic.
“What we recognize is that professors […] have power over your grade,” they explained. “They hold this […] position of power [on] how to change your grade, [and] it’s a confusing complexity.”
“How do you correct it, […] when there is that power dynamic?” they asked. “I feel like as we come as that one angry person in the room, people know, when my hand shoots up, what’s coming.”
The group also discussed the lack of lived experiences in McGill’s academic curriculum.
“I was in class, […] and one of the topics that came up was [China’s] Cultural Revolution,” a fifth student began. “It’s a very emotional experience for them [those with firsthand experience]. I felt that the topic was very objectified in class.”
“As a student, I would have liked to see more lived experiences, stories that were integrated into that class,” they concluded, “because specifically, the professor isn’t even Chinese. […] I felt very threatened in that class.”
Participants shared sentiments regarding professors who are not representative of the identity group being studied in the course, such as a white professor with no Indigenous background teaching Indigenous studies.
“How do you correct it, […] when there is that power dynamic?”
A sixth student pointed out that “when professors who identify as people of colour (POC) teach a course that is relevant to courses with cultural implications, it really makes a difference for POC identified folks.”
A seventh student mentioned that McGill professors rarely seem to be conscious of that fact: “It’s so strange [..] except for two classes, maybe […] they [professors] never address the fact that they are white.”
Within the group, humility and open disclaimers from professors were discussed as potential solutions.
“I think that coming from a place of humility both in terms of engaging and in terms of problematic comments when teaching material from historically marginalized communities is so important,” the student explained.
“Coming from a place of being humble, accepting that […] you don’t know everything” was very important for them. They added that when a professor addressed the fact that he is white, they “didn’t expect it,” but was pleasantly surprised.
“When professors who identify as people of colour (POC) teach a course that is relevant to courses with cultural implications, it really makes a difference for POC identified folks.”
An eighth student echoed this statement, saying that: “It’s really important to come into it, I think, with that humility.”
“I found that […] also having profs who aren’t racialized who talk about race [and] feature racialized academics in their syllabus, […] when they come from it from a point of humility where we […] are […] engaging with the theory, that has been very meaningful for me,” the student continued, “because […] it’s also allowed me to explore […] ways of thought I was never introduced to before.”
“It seems like within the group, humility from the professors […] and […] an honest disclaimer from the class should be suggested collectively,” said the active listener.
One participant who attended the event said, “I think that there should be more spaces like this and opportunities for BIMPoC people to get together,” as marginalized students “find so much encouragement and solidarity” from open dialogue among students in informal spaces.
“I think that coming from a place of humility both in terms of engaging and in terms of problematic comments when teaching material from historically marginalized communities is so important.”
“There is a dire need for […] space for underrepresented voices,” said a final student.
*This event was a safer space for BIPOC students, so the participants asked to remain anonymous.

2017-04-01,McGill,China,"Panel discussion dismantles pervasive social stigma
On Thursday March 30, around 35 students gathered in the Shatner Building to attend a panel discussion called “The ‘Leftover’ Women in East Asia.” The event, organized by the McGill University Society of China Studies (SCS), centred on ‘leftover’ women, a term that stigmatizes those unmarried by their mid-twenties. The discussion highlighted the origins of the term and the social stigma toward working women who choose to set aside marriage to advance their careers.
The panel featured presentations by Jeremy Tai, an Assistant Professor in History and Classical Studies specializing in modern China; Wanming Wang, a Ph.D Candidate in East Asian Studies; and Brian Bergstrom, a course lecturer in East Asian Studies. 
The talk opened with an introduction by Yolanda Zhang, the Event Coordinator of SCS. The discussion focused on the ways in which social and political institutions in China and Japan perpetuated the stigma of being a ‘leftover’ woman.
“We agreed to do this talk because we observed that it was a hot topic on social media in China, and it definitely relates to the direction of feminism today,” Zhang told The Daily in an interview. “The topic of leftover women resonates strongly with women with higher education, so it’s really pressing in an academic setting like McGill.”
Jeremy Tai discussed the history of the term ‘leftover women’ and how it became widely used in Chinese society. The term was popularized by Leta Hong Fincher’s 2014 book Leftover Women: The Resurgence of Gender Inequality in China. According to Tai, the stigma around ‘leftover women’ – or shengnu – has existed in Sinophone communities for over ten years. The term originally applied to women over thirty, though the age limit involved has gradually decreased to 25.
“The Chinese state is currently invested in pressuring women from a certain class and educational background to marry for the sake of social stability,” Tai explained. China’s existing gender imbalance resulted from the increase in sex-selective abortions following the one-child policy introduced in 1979.
Currently there are twenty million more men than women under thirty which, according to Tai, explains why marriage is a state concern in China.
“The Chinese state is currently invested in pressuring women from a certain class and educational background to marry for the sake of social stability.”
“The theory is that within the context of a slowing economy, these restless single men will ferment political unrest out of personal dissatisfaction,” Tai said. “I think we all should be very troubled here by the seeming quantification of self-worth.”
Wang’s presentation was centred on the pushback against the misogynistic label of ‘leftover women’ by individual women and activist groups. Wang mentioned the ways in which the ‘ticking biological clock’ concept is entrenched and accepted across different cultures. She displayed viral posts made on Chinese social media expressing anger and indignation against the social pressures to marry out of obligation.
“Leftover women are becoming more and more confident,” she said. “They choose to be so-called leftover women and this is a gesture, a strong reaction, to the propaganda of the state that has been prevalent for decades in China.”
Brian Bergstrom’s presentation discussed the Japanese context, elaborating on the term makeinu, referring to a single woman in her thirties who has not had children. The translation of makeinu is “loser dog.”
“When makeinu became a sort of word in the late 90s, it was more about makeinu women who had not succeeded, which meant that they were not married,” Bergstrom said. “In response to makeinu discourse, you had people like Sakai Junko who wrote books that were like, ‘Yeah, I am a makeinu.’”
Zhang, an organizer of the event, stressed that the discourse around ‘leftover women’ often excludes the non-middle-class population: “One thing I want to point out […] was the concern with intersectionality in the context of middle-class women, because the whole topic still speaks to a middle-class audience.”
Thomson Yu, the President of SCS, spoke about the relevance of ‘leftover women’ to North America in an interview with The Daily.
“The topic of leftover women is directly relevant to the experiences of ‘career women’ in North America,” he said. “It’s important to realize that Chinese women in North America have the so-called east-west culture clash they need to deal with. Again, you have an immigrant culture that celebrates and values family life clashing against the North American culture that celebrates individual freedom and liberties.”
Yu mentioned that the issue is a result of competing expectations. “In my opinion, the issue of ‘leftover women’ emerges due to the frictions between these two cultures. And for the foreseeable future, will likely to continue to be a hot issue as Chinese communities continue to negotiate and adapt to social changes,” Yu said.

2017-11-06,McGill,China,"North Korean activists must be empowered, not victimized
On October 28, McGill Students for Hanvoice hosted a panel called “What would you ask a North Korean.” The panel was attended by over 200 people, and featured Ellie Cha, a human rights advocate who left North Korea with her family in 2012. McGill Students for HanVoice is a non-profit grassroots organization created to raise awareness on the North Korean humanitarian crisis. The event was part of the HanVoice Pioneers Project (HPP), an initiative which aims to empower North Korean activists to lead the North Korean human rights movement. The event included an introduction by Dr. Juan Wang of the McGill Political Science department. Later, Cha shared a testimony on her life experiences followed by a Q&A session with the participants.
Danny Yeo, the president of HanVoice Ottawa, spoke on the challenges resettlement poses to many North Koreans, specifically, the difficulty of working around the immigration regulations of surrounding countries.
“When North Korean refugees […] defect from North Korea, their goal is to get to Thailand. […] It’s known as a safe haven, and more than 90 per cent of refugees end up there,” said Yeo, “In China, if they get caught, they will be deported back to North Korea.”
Thailand has become a popular transit destination for North Korean resettlement. In the first six months of 2016 alone, 385 North Koreans entered Thailand. While the Royal Thai Government (RTG) does not recognize North Koreans’ refugee status, they permit illegal entry.
Throughout the migration process, refugees face the risk of deportation back to North Korea. The North Korean government considers unauthorized departure a criminal offense, meaning that returning to North Korea leads to prosecution. Many choose to cross the eastern border out of the country, using a paid broker for travel arrangements. This route involves travelling through China, where North Korean refugees are considered economic migrants instead of asylum seekers.
Yeo explained that North Korean citizens face limited options after leaving the country. “Another problem is that when they arrive [in] Thailand, they only have two options; South Korea [or] the US,” said Yeo. “Currently, the US is not the best place to go, because of the […] administration. […] The process is very long, whereas South Korea is very quick.”
Under the South Korean Constitution, all North Koreans are recognized as South Korean citizens. Even so, North Koreans in South Korea face marginalization and other barriers in resettlement.
“In South Korea, there is another problem. […] There is a lot of discrimination against the refugees.” said Yeo. “Most North Korean refugees […] come as single mothers, meaning that […] they themselves struggle to get by. […] Even at home, […] North Korean children do not receive [adequate] attention and help. Even the education system is very competitive.”
Yeo told the audience that HanVoice has been in talks with the Canadian federal government about establishing a program that would allow Canadians to sponsor North Korean refugees.
“We wanted to create an opportunity for these North Korean refugees to come over to Canada. [We] not only have a strong Korean-Canadian community, […] but I’d like to believe that Canada will take care of people who are displaced.”
Canada has historically shown favorable policies towards North Korean refugees, with a 90 per cent acceptance rate in 2011 and 2012. However, the Immigration Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) began rejecting applications in 2013 and 2014, citing that South Korean citizenship is guaranteed to North Koreans by default. In 2014, only one out of the 327 refugee claims was accepted.
“We wanted to create an opportunity for these North Korean refugees to come over to Canada. […] I’d like to believe that Canada will take care of people who are displaced.”
“Today I am here to share my story as a North Korean refugee,” said Cha. “I remember my first visit to Pyongyang. I remember the busy men and women rushing down the streets to ride shiny new buses to work. […] Young children playing by the grass. But, most of all: I remember my father. I remember walking up the steps of his university holding his hand. I remember his sharp suit, a uniform worn only by the very best in the country.”
Cha’s father was a high-ranking official before falling out of favour with the North Korean government. He was subsequently dismissed from his position as the vice president of a large mining company. The family’s socioeconomic situation deteriorated after this, and they decided to leave North Korea and seek asylum in South Korea.
“We would no longer be cared for in a way we were for the past eight years. […] In North Korea, our family had no future anymore, especially for me and my brother.”
The family initially planned to travel to the South Korean embassy and request asylum in Vietnam. However, the family was found by Vietnam authorities and detained, then sent to the Chinese Border. After five failed attempts to enter Vietnam from China, the family decided to enter South Korea through Thailand, where they met South Korean embassy officers. During this process, Cha was separated from her family for several days, during which her mother suffered a high fever and malaria.
“From North Korea into China, to Vietnam, to Laos to Thailand, and into South Korea. The world felt big. But, I’m here to tell you — still, there’s no space for me and my family. As a refugee, my journey continues. We’re still searching for [a] home. It is only last year that my family finally had the time to reflect and talk. Not as refugees trying to survive, but [as] people, a family, trying to move forward.”
“It is only last year that my family finally had the time to reflect and talk. Not as refugees trying to survive, but [as] people, a family, trying to move forward.”
When asked what motivated her to pursue advocacy work, Cha recalled meeting others who “did not know that their [refugee] life was not normal.”
Such experiences led Cha to promote human rights for North Korean refugees. “From these experiences I [have], and heard, I couldn’t shut my eyes from [these] people who will have the same experiences as I did. […] Personally, I am not an extrovert, I am an introvert and don’t like doing public speaking. […] But if I don’t do this, if we don’t do this because we don’t like it, who can do it? That’s why I decided to do advocacy.” Cha is currently pursuing a media communications degree at Seoul University in South Korea. She worked as an intern in the office of Senator Yonah Martin, and has spoken in multiple universities about her experience.
Cha emphasized the importance of empowering North Korean activists as the leaders of their own movement, “North Korean refugees […] can act as a bridge, and as a main voice […] [representing] North Korea. […] When people just see us as victims and media or organizations paint us as victims, they can get more attention, but that’s it. We cannot see any changes. […] but when you see them as a powerful potential, North Korean refugees can [assume] an important role as agents of change, said Cha.
“North Korean refugees […] can act as a bridge, and as a main voice [representing] North Korea.”
“Only five years ago, I was just a victim by regime. Even when I first arrived to South Korea, I considered myself as a victim because people looked [at] and treated us as victims. But there [were] some people who supported, encouraged me. […] I [was] empowered to become an agent of changes and to help my homeland. […] It is not because I have a special ability, I am just one of [the] 23 million North Koreans. So, if I can do this, my family, my friends can do this, and all […] 23 million people in North Korea can do [the] same things to make North Korea’s change. […] And I believe that change starts in a small step.”
Cha concluded her testimony with a reminder of shared humanity. “I believe that I will end my journey in a free North Korea. […] I don’t want you to feel sorry or pity hearing my stories. My story is not one of weakness. My story is one of great strength. It’s one of great power; the power of parents’ sacrifice for their family. The power that resides in our shared humanity, […] including North Koreans, this humanity gives us the same chance to live.”
“My story is one of great strength. It’s one of great power; the power of parents’ sacrifice for their family. The power that resides in our shared humanity, […] including North Koreans, this humanity gives us the same chance to live.”
An earlier version of this article incorrectly mentioned that more than 9 per cent of North Korean refugees end up in Thailand, when in fact, more than 90 per cent of North Korean refugees end up in Thailand. The Daily regrets the error.

2018-03-26,McGill,China,"SPHR organizes discussion on contemporary colonialism
On Tuesday March 20, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill hosted a workshop comparing the contemporary colonialisms of Tibet and Palestine, presented by Khando Langri, a Tibetan-Canadian member of SPHR McGill and an activist for the liberation of Tibet. The workshop was held in conjunction with other events as part of Israeli Apartheid Week in Montreal.
Langri began the presentation by explaining the need to recognize Palestine and Canada as both occupied territories.
“In order to resist colonization abroad, we must first address how we are complicit in the continuous colonial process in Montreal,” explained Langri.
She established that although there is a “universal perception within university settings that we have entered the age of postcolonialism […] colonialism is not only alive but is thriving in the modern age” as exemplified by the occupation of both Palestine and Tibet.
The NGO Freedom House, which according to its website is “an annual comparative assessment of political rights and civil liberties,” ranks the political rights and civils rights of the occupied territory of Tibet at -2/40 and 3/60, those of the occupied West Bank at 6/40 and 24/60, and those for the occupied Gaza Strip at 3/40 and 9/60, respectively. In comparison, Canada is ranked at 40/40 for its political rights and 59/60 for its civil rights.
Portrayal of child prisoners
Langri compared the occupations of Tibet and Palestine first in terms of child prisoners held in both regions. The eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a “high reincarnate Lama,” an important religious leader in Tibet, was recognized by the Dalai Lama on May 15, 1995 and was subsequently rejected by the Chinese government which “abducted both [the Panchen Lama] and his family,” explained Langri. Neither him nor his family have been heard of or seen since and no charges have been exposed nor have any trials have been held.
“[The Panchen Lama] was […] removed from Canada’s list of prisoners last year” which is a list of different prisoners compiled by Canada used in order to lobby against certain countries, stated Langri. “The list that was […] for China […] omitted the Panchen Lama so clearly China’s winning here since [Canada doesn’t] remember him anymore.”
This example was juxtaposed with the situation of Ahed Tamimi, a sixteen-year old child prisoner facing eight months in prison after slapping an Israeli soldier who trespassed onto her home in the occupied West Bank, and consequently is being tried in an Israeli military court.
“Because Tammi is portrayed as an adult in mass media and […] the Panchen Lama’s identity as a tuku […] a high reincarnate Lama […] are the forefront of any discussion involving these two people they are not allowed to exist as children in the popular psyche,” elaborated Langri.
“It’s important to talk about them even if they’re politicized so we can’t let the fact that […] many are perceived as being […] very controversial figure[s] […] to stop us from talking about them because this politicization does not [take away from] their childhood.”
Ecology of occupied land
Langri also discussed the concept of China’s “greenwashing” of the occupation in Tibet. Greenwashing is “the act of packaging something to make it seem eco-friendly and thus more acceptable to mainstream media,” she explained. This concept is part of China’s “Ecological Migration Scheme” which displaces Tibetan nomadic families and relocates them to “ghettos called ‘Socialist New Villages’.” These nomadic inhabitants do not have skills for the labor market, are not offered education, and face an increased living cost, Langri explained.
“What’s ironic is that […] the Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N. has recognized the role that pastoralists play in preserving the environment so in terms of Tibet the nomads […] were very crucial in maintaining […] soil carbon because the animal’s waste added nutrients to the soil […] maintaining fertility and also the hooves would aerate the soil by pressing in seeds and trampling dead plants.”
This concept of ecological manifestation of colonialist occupation is also present in Palestine. Langri used the example of the establishment of the “South Africa Forest,” a tree-planting initiative by the Jewish National Fund in the destroyed Palestinian village of Lubya published in article by Heidi Grunebaum.
“By using nature against indigenous people we can […] erase their narratives,” said Langri.
“Changing the land [of native peoples] physically […] translates into […] [a change in the] conception of national homelands.”
Apoliticism of traditional symbols
Langri explained how “we as a consumer culture really enjoy indigenous aesthetics but that means on the one hand as we consume them we render them apolitical.” She explained how in the case of Tibet, “Tibetan struggles [are] consistently erased from news struggles and has been substituted with this fascination for the Dalai Lama [the spiritual leader of Tibet] as a media personality.”
“As a society we are charmed by him but we don’t want to engage in Tibetan issues because they’re not very savory.”
For example, the use of Tibetan prayer flags, flags which contain mantras which are believed to blow in the wind and spread compassion and peace and the usage of the keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism and protest against Israeli occupation, as decoration and fashionable pieces is testament to a “love for Tibetan and Palestinian aesthetics but [a lack of] […] love for the people themselves.”
Tourism as a “tool of occupation”
In terms of tourism, Langri discussed how “tourism is in fact the tool of occupation.” She explained how in the case of Palestine, Birthright trips to Israel which are offered to Jewish young adults ages 18-32 “erase all traces of the land’s original […] inhabitants.” These trips represent an “unequal spreading of […] touristic resources” because Palestinian refugees cannot return to their homeland in the regions of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s prevention of Palestinians from returning to their homeland is parallel to China’s prohibition of movement for Tibetans even though China advocates for tourism within Tibet. All Tibetan passports have been confiscated by the Chinese government and only government-affiliated individuals are offered “semi-official public affairs passports,” Langri explained. Additionally, traditional Tibetan “sky burials,” a religious and sacred Tibetan custom, are being advertised as a tourist attraction and are being photographed and recorded.
Mobilization
Anna* a student who attended the workshop explained that “Tibet has now officially stopped requesting to be an independent nation and now wants […] political recognition […] these rights are inscribed in the Chinese constitutions and so it’s simply asking that China now respect these rights to autonomy […] but they’re not [upholding these rights] […] [and] in fact nothing is really being respected on paper.”
“That’s […] the political way that we could mobilize,” Anna continued. “Canada for example hasn’t taken a stance […] with regards to recognizing Tibet’s desire to […] have these autonomy rights respected and that’s something that the [Canada Tibet Committee] tries to do […] to [get] the Canadian government to take a stance.”

2018-09-17,McGill,China,"Divest and status of Saudi-Arabian students among September’s Senate meeting’s discussion 
McGill Senate convened for its first meeting of the 2018-2019 academic year on September 13. Principal Suzanne Fortier discussed this year’s increased participation in, and success of Frosh, as well as the demographics of the current student body. There was an influx of students from China, who make up the second largest part of the international student body, followed closely by students from the United States, France, and Saudi Arabia. 
Fortier also brought up the conflict between Canada and Saudi Arabia arising from a Twitter dispute between Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the subsequent effect it has had on students, particularly on postdoctoral fellows and graduate students at the University. Fortier stated that approximately 350 McGill students were forced to return to their country following the declaration from the Saudi Kingdom. 
In addition, Fortier announced that McGill and other universities up in the Bureau de coopération interuniversitaire (BCI) have scheduled meetings with the leadership of all political parties in preparation for the upcoming Quebec elections on October 1. Fortier stressed the importance of this meeting, saying that the universities will “do our work to put on the agenda the important role that higher education plays in this province.” 
The central topic of the Senate meeting revolved around the motion set forth by Professor and senator Gregory Mikkelson, an associate professor in the School of Environment and the Department of Philosophy, regarding the possibility of McGill fully divesting from all fossil fuel companies. 
In May 2018, the Steering Committee reviewed Professor Mikkelson’s motion and agreed to defer the question of divestment to the Senate during the September meeting. The Committee then decided to propose their own motion inquiring into whether Senate members believe it to be “necessary or desirable to express an opinion on a matter that has been considered by the Board [of Governors] (BoG),”  and whether it was within their responsibilities as a Senate. 
“ This is a matter that is both outside the authority and confidence of the Senate” said Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) Christopher Manfredi. He did not believe Senate should hear the issue of divest “because there already exists a clear mechanism in the Board’s own procedures through which members of the McGill community can bring this matter to the Board’s attention.” He continued, “I’d argue that action by the Senate is undesirable because it would violate a fundamental aspect of the division of authority on which the bicameral nature of the university’s governing structure depends.”
In an interview with the Daily, Jed Lenetsky, one of the chief organizers of Divest McGill said, “I think the overwhelming interest in the vote and in the issue, and […] also the passion that so many people had about this issue” make it important for the motion to be brought to the Senate. Lenetsky also spoke of McGill’s past instances of divestment, including  McGill’s apartheid divestment, which was carried out in Senate. “Senate does have a historic role in these discussions at McGill […] Given that the Senate is a larger, more diverse body and [its] stronger connection to the McGill community it definitely made sense for the Senate to step in,” explained Lenetsky.
After many questions and comments regarding whether this motion proposed by the Committee was to be applied to all future issues or topics, Professor Mikkelson read the motion. Citing three circumstances over the past decades in which McGill chose to divest from problematic investments, the motion urges the current Senate to follow suit. McGill divested from South African companies, including fossil fuel corporations in 1985, and then again during the 2000’s from corporations doing business in Myanmar, as well as from tobacco companies in 2007.  Mikkelson urged the university to reconsider their “current policy of investing endowment funds in fossil fuel corporations.”
Mikkelson expressed his desire for the board to go into more detail into how divestment should be executed at McGill once the motion passed. Important questions that need to be answered, such as the feasible time frame for divesting, were the subject of his questioning. Mikkelson also brought up more logistical issues, like whether or not McGill should divest immediately, or start with a subset like the University of California system, who are now selling off all coal and tar sand stocks.
McGill is among many universities in Canada that have not yet divested; the University of Laval being the only university in the country which has committed to divestment. During the meeting, Mikkelson pointed out that McGill currently invests in 29 corporations, nine of which are in coal, and eight of which are in tar sands.
“In the Canadian context it’s especially important for public institutions to insist on targeting both ends of our fossil-fuel problem, […] the consumption end by working toward carbon neutrality, and the production end through our investment policy,” stated the Senator.
“[In the winter 2015 semester] [Canadian financial magazine]Corporate Knights came out with a study showing that if the Board had divested when students first asked them to and re-invested the money in greener stocks the university already owned, McGill would have made a profit of $40 million dollars,” Mikkelson pointed out.
While McGill as a university has not yet pledged to divest, the issue of divesting brought to the Board’s Committee to Advice on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) initially in 2013 by Divest McGill, is strongly endorsed by the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS), the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT), and the faculties of Arts, Law, and Environment.
Fortier, who sits on the Investment Committee, was asked if the motion passing in Senate would incite the Board to take any definitive action. She said that it would, and that she “[thinks] it is not accurate to say that the Board is not concerned, […] in fact our investment practices and policy have very much focused on these questions.” Fortier continued, “The Board now has a mandate in sustainability. […] [We] are not ignorant to these issues.” 
Another Senator weighed in on the discussion, pointing out the reality of investment. Senator Bouchon explained, “we don’t control the companies in which [our managers] invest and in some of the investments we have to lock in those investments for five or ten years, so even if we decide tomorrow to divest we won’t see the impact [soon].”
The motion was subject to a last minute amendment in its wording, altering the original intention of forcing the Senate to create a committee on outlining how to divest, to one that has the Senate simply advising the BoG to divest from all fossil fuel companies.  
Lenetsky explained what he believed the passing of this motion meant in the broader scheme of divestment at McGill. “The main significance is that it really showed how out of touch the BoG’s decision was in terms of where the McGill community is at on this issue,” he told The Daily. “If anything we’re more invigorated to do whatever it takes to make the will of the McGill community manifest itself in the BoG deciding on divestment. […] We have never had more of a community backing behind us.”

2018-10-01,McGill,China,"Maldivian Presidential Elections: Opposition Claims Victory
The Maldives held their presidential election on September 23. The incumbent President Abdulla Yameen represented the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM). Ibrahim Mohamed Solih represented the opposition, Maldives Democratic Party (MDP). Solih won the election with 58 per cent of the votes, which was 17 points more than Yameen. Mariyam Shiuna, executive director of Transparency Maldives, said that “prior to Sunday’s elections, many feared about potential fraud [in Yameen’s favour] due to limited freedom of mass media.” According to BBC News, international monitors have been banned from observing the election, and most of the foreign media’s access was restricted on election day, which raised questions about the elections’ integrity. For Solih, his election is “the first successful step on the road to justice.”
Yameen recently signed a free trade agreement with China, and accepted Chinese investments in current and future construction projects in the Maldives. Solih supports an alliance with India and strongly opposes business with China. Solih believes China is allying itself with the Maldives to access the essential trade routes of the Indian Ocean. According to analysts, the Maldives’ association with China was an important issue for voters, and for China itself. Yameen’s loss could mean the loss of trade access for China. The Maldives’ future, and its new foreign policies, will be determined once the national electoral commission approves Solih’s claim on winning the election.
More Detentions of Nicaraguan Activists
Amaya Eva Coppens, a Nicaraguan-Belgian activist and medical student, was detained in León, Nicaragua on September 10, 2018. The police
accused her of “terrorism,” “assaults,” and the “illegal possession of firearms.” Together with the imprisonment of dozens of other
activists, the arrest of Coppens is part of the latest wave of Nicaraguan authorities detaining activists, many of which are student members of the April protests. In April 2018, Nicaragua’s Ortega administration announced a social security reform that would increase workers’ tax contributions, and ultimately lead to a decrease in pensions. Nicaraguan pensioners, students, merchants, members of feminist and Campesino (farmer) movements, and other citizens protested the proposal until it was revoked 22 April 2018 by President Ortega. 
Discontent with the Nicaraguan authorities’ violent handling of the demonstrations has resulted in ongoing protests since April 2018. The protestors demand the resignation of President Ortega and of Vice-President, Rosario Murillo, who is also Ortega’s spouse. Concerns of police violence, infringements on free speech, violations of Indigenous peoples’ land rights and violence against women in the country are among the reasons people believe the government should resign.
According to the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (Asociación Nicaragüense Pro Derechos Humanos), the Nicaraguan authorities’ violent response to the protests has resulted in the deaths of over 500, the injury of over 4,000 and the detention of over 1,400 individuals since April 2018. The Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights (Centro Nicaragüense por los Derechos Humanos), as well as the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, criticize the detention of Coppens and other activists.
Coppens was held in incommunicado detention for nine days. This means that she was denied access to a lawyer, family members, or an independent physician. She has now been transferred to the women’s prison “La Esperanza” in Tipitapa. According to a statement from her father, despite a visit from her parents being monitored and filmed by prison staff, Amaya managed to communicate that she was beaten up while in detention. She also revealed that she has not been tortured due to her diplomatic position as a Belgian citizen. However, her fellow Nicaraguan prisoners may not be immune to this treatment. A Nicaragua Today article described the conditions in the prison as “inhumane” and reported that prisoners are denied medical attention despite some of them enduring critical illnesses such as terminal cancer.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford Testifies at Kavanaugh Hearings 
Supreme Court nominee Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 27, following allegations of sexual assault. Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, Justice Kavanaugh previously worked as a top aide to President George W. Bush, and in the US Court of Appeals. He is considered to be a likely opponent of Roe v. Wade. 
The allegations against Kavanaugh by a then-anonymous woman first arose in July, Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had requested to delay Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote to the Supreme Court. Ford came public with her allegations against Kavanaugh on Sept. 16. In the past week, three other women, Deborah Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, and one other anonymous woman
have come forward with allegations against Kavanaugh. 
In Ford’s testimony, she described her experiences with Kavanaugh in detail, stating that her “motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr Kavanaugh’s actions have damaged [her] life, so that [the committee] can take that into serious consideration as [they] make [their] decision about how to proceed.” Remaining composed during her testimony, she recalled the alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge. When asked her most vivid memory of the night, she responded with “all of them having fun at my expense.” Kavanaugh adressed the allegations in a heated testimony, describing the current allegations as a political smear campaign by the left. He spoke of his good character as attested to by the women in his life, his relationship to alcohol, and his high school experience as he remembers it.
War, Famine, and Disease Plague Yemen
Content warning: death, war, terrorism
In 2017, 50,000 children lost their lives due to war in Yemen. Now, as the UN reports, Yemen faces a famine, which is expected to put 5 million children at risk of starvation. For almost three years Yemen has endured civil war between Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed forces who support Yemen’s former government. The Houthi rebels have been fighting for terms surrounding political and economic demands. By the end of this year, the country may be facing “the world’s worst humanitarian disaster for 50 years,” says Mark Lowcock, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Seventy-five per cent of the population is in need of assistance, but fighting near the main port Hodeidah is blocking the distribution of vital supplies.
In September 2014, the Houthi rebel group overtook the capital Sana’a and tried to seize Yemen’s second largest city, Aden, in order to overthrow the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. In response to the Houthi’s actions, a coalition backed by neighbouring country Saudi Arabia, launched airstrikes in an attempt to restore Yemen’s official government. These missiles, as well as other weapons and intelligence, came from the USA and the UK. Without this support, it would be difficult for Saudi Arabia to continue the war. The US has also claimed to have deployed a small number of troops on the ground, and France and the UK are also supplying the Saudi-led coalition with weapons and intelligence. Although Canada has provided upwards of $65 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen, it has also sold more than $284 million in weapons to the countries that are bombing Yemen. As a result of the war, both Al-Qaeda and ISIL have spread within the country; Al-Qaeda has taken over territory in the south of Yemen, while ISIL has launched an attack killing more than 140 people. The bombing operations have killed tens of thousands of people and caused the displacement of over 3 million. Many members of the US Congress, as well as humanitarian organizations, have called for the US and others to be charged with war crimes for the crisis in Yemen. Yemen’s people and economy are suffering greatly because of the war; the price of food has doubled, and the nation’s currency, the Yemeni riyal, has collapsed.
The war has taken a great toll on an already impoverished society. Airstrikes are killing civilians in hospitals and schools; most of the casualties are children. In August of this year, a US-backed Saudi missile hit a bus carrying children killing at least 29 children and wounding 30 more. Now, citizens of Yemen face famine and an outbreak of cholera. “We may now be approaching a tipping point, beyond which it will be impossible to prevent massive loss of life as a result of widespread famine across the country,” said Lowcock to the UN’s Security Council. “We are already seeing pockets of famine-like conditions, including cases where people are eating leaves.” Last year, the UN declared that Yemen had seen “the world’s worst cholera outbreak,” with a million suspected cases in December 2017 and 5,000 new cases being reported each day — over 2,300 lives have been lost. Even though Yemen has since reduced and recovered somewhat from the disease, the World Health Organization has reported that the country is about to face a third wave of cholera.
The fighting near the port of Hodeidah is making it nearly impossible to get any sort of aid to citizens. Understaffed and under-equipped health centres are noticing a spike in the amount of malnourished patients they come across. In August, Aslam’s health centre saw up to 99 cases of malnutrition, half of which were in the most severe stages. The UN is trying to raise more money and resources for the people of Yemen, but Lowcock claims that “humanitarian organizations simply cannot look after the needs of all 29 million Yemenis. That is untenable.”

2018-11-26,McGill,China,"HanVoice McGill Hosts North Korean Refugee
On November 16, McGill Students for HanVoice, a non-profit club that increases awareness of North Korean refugees and fundraises for their cause, hosted the event “Alice Kim: The North Korean Defector.” Two speakers led the discussion: McGill International Development Professor Kazue Takamura, and Alice Kim a 23-year old student and North Korean defector.
Takamura described how there are currently 50,000 to 200,000 North Korean refugees believed to be taking refuge in China. “They are repressed [in North Korea] and repressed in other Asian countries that they have escaped to,” she said. “Advocacy is particularly important, but also we have to listen to the voices of refugees, for documenting those voices.”
HanVoice is also leading a project called North to North, which aims to provide private sponsorship opportunities for refugees from North Korea to settle in Canada. Kevin Seo, co-president of McGill Students for HanVoice, stated his belief that Canada will become a place for North Korean refugees to start a new chapter of their lives.
Alice Kim was born in 1995 in Pyongyang, North Korea, and the following year Kim’s family got the chance to escape North Korea when her father was promoted to a diplomatic position in China. North Korean diplomats who travel abroad must leave a family member in the country. Since she was a baby and was sick at that time, her family chose to take her with them, leaving Kim’s older sister behind, who was six years old. Kim did not know she was from North Korea until she was seven years old. Her peers at school in South Korea bullied her for her background. “My origin became a fact, I became Alice Kim the North Korean,” she recounted, “I didn’t understand why I was discriminated against. […] In South Korea, I am [considered] a North Korean with all the negative connotation attached to it.”
Kim also shared the economic struggles that her parents faced after moving to South Korea. They lived in poverty for years. She stated that many North Korean refugees were once elites, or government officials back in their country; however, these people ended up working in low paying jobs in South Korea. The government fund for North Koreans is not enough she said.
Closing her speech, she spoke to the split of South and North Korea. Kim stated, “the [border] shouldn’t be there in the first place.” She wished “to remind future policy-makers and young generations in this room, [their decisions] impact real people in real time. As my family story shows, this can leave devastating marks.” She continued, asking Canadians, especially young students, for their continued support. “Your determination is the driving force for change. With the right support, the right content, and with plenty of cooperation, maybe we can change the lives of North Korean refugees like me.”

Anti-Muslim Concentration Camps in China
content warning: concentration camps, Islamophobia, racism, religious persecution
On November 14, American legislators introduced bills in the House and Senate that aim to put pressure on the Trump administration to condemn Chinese detention camps. These camps currently house up to one million Uighur Muslims, as well as other Chinese Muslims. The legislation would impose sanctions targeting the sale of Chinese goods, but have no direct impact on individual members of the Chinese government. Canada, France, Germany, and other countries have written to the Communist Party leader of Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, asking him to explain the detention camps. 
In response to accusations of massive internment camps in Xinjiang, a western region of China, a Chinese Communist Party official said, “there is no arbitrary detention. […] There is no such a thing as re-education centers.” 
However, over one million ethnic Uighur Muslims are being detained in what the government presents as “re-education schools,” aimed at “combating religious extremism” through legal theory and language learning. Abdusalam Muhemet, who was arrested in 2014, describes the facility in which he was detained as “not a place for getting rid of extremism, [but] a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.” 
Roughly one tenth of the Uighur population of Xinjiang has been sent to these camps. These detentions target Muslim minority members exclusively. These camps are a result of a crackdown on the Uighur Muslim minority that has grown in the past four years, including a broader context of policies to erase, or at least conceal, Uighur Muslim identity in China. 
Legislation prohibits wearing headscarves and long beards, as well as religious instruction. Islamic-sounding names have also been banned. Uighur Muslims face extremely strict travel restrictions and have to relinquish their passports to authorities for “safe-keeping.” Specific prohibitions further target Uighur government officials, who are prohibited from practicing Islam. The expansion of security services and surveillance in Xinjiang have been described by BBC News as “some of the most restrictive and comprehensive security measures ever deployed by a state against its own people.” 
Wildfires in California 
Over 1,000 people remain missing and at least 81 have died as a result of recent California wildfires. Recovery crews in Paradise, California, are still searching for victims, while disaster relief organizations have set up sites for crisis relief. 
The fires in northern California, considered to be the deadliest in the state’s history, erupted on November 8, causing thousands to flee their homes. An estimated 13,000 homes and another 15,000 buildings have been destroyed. 
In addition to work by disaster and recovery crews, firefighting efforts have been underway for several weeks. Civilian firefighters have been joined by over 200 prisoners in California’s Conservation Camp program. Inmates are compensated $1.45 a day on average. California has a longstanding history of relying on its prison population to assist with firefighting, dating back to World War II. It is estimated that 40 per cent of firefighters are inmates from these working programs. 
Private firefighters have been employed by insurance companies and celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, to salvage expensive homes in the area. The use of private firefighting services, in contrast to the use of prison labour to quell fires, has called into question how divisions of labour exacerbate inequalities in the face of natural disasters. 
Rain storms this past week have brought deadly “Camp Fire” close to containment after several weeks of burning. With some relief, authorities are pushing evacuees out of tent cities, telling them to seek refuge in shelters that are already full. However the struggle is not over yet as the rainfall is also warranting flash flood advisories for about one million people in the area of Paradise.

2019-11-19,McGill,China,"Nadine St-Louis Talks “Healing Trauma Through Art”



Content warning: gender-based violence, death
Continue or go back to the main page

Every Wednesday, beginning on September 4 of this year, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous women have gathered at the Ashukan Cultural Space to tell stories, sew, and heal from trauma. This meeting – the Femmes, Mes Sœurs workshop, organized by Sacred Fire Productions – is an opportunity for survivors of violence to share their experiences and seek support from one another, while creating art to raise awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Led by Melanie Morrison and Sedalia Fazio, participants join in a Mohawk prayer, recount how violence has affected them, and embroider an image symbolic of their trauma. In spring 2020, the works of embroidery will be sewn together into a piece called the Memory Quilt, which will be revealed at a march along with a book titled Women are Sisters. The book will feature photos of the embroidery, alongside explanations of the images these women chose to depict.
Content warning: gender-based violence, death
Continue or go back to the main page
The workshop is the creation of Nadine St-Louis, the Executive Producer and founder of Sacred Fire Productions. In an interview with the Daily, St-Louis, who is herself a survivor of violence, has long wanted to create an opportunity for women to tell their stories; she asserts that storytelling is a powerful healing tool, both for the storyteller and their audience. By sharing their personal journeys, she said, women not only liberate themselves of the silence about gender-based violence which many are subjected to – they also end the isolation of navigating their traumatic experience, and build a sisterhood with other survivors.
“It’s first and foremost a healing project […] the idea behind this project was to bring awareness to missing and murdered Indigenous women, and to come together as women of all nations and say, ‘break the silence,’” St-Louis said.
Quilting is a custom shared by women from cultures all over the world, according to St-Louis. She hopes that in the tradition of quilting, women can find solidarity with other survivors, regardless of their background. The activity of sewing takes on a metaphorical nature for St-Louis, as women are “sewn together” in expressing their stories and healing through art. Furthermore, the medium of quilting is a way of “rematriating” history, St-Louis told the Daily: “The quilt has always been in my head; instead of history, it would be her story.”
In spite of the pain that comes from sharing stories of violence, the workshop is intended to remind women of their strength and resilience. “Women are strong. Women are the backbones of their families, women are the backbones of society,” St-Louis stated. In breaking the silence which typically surrounds instances of gender-based violence, women can reclaim their stories of resilience and promote a dialogue in which Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls – a topic that is often marginalized in contemporary culture – are the central concern. This reflects the mission of Sacred Fire Productions – to create visibility for Indigenous peoples in a contemporary context and to promote awareness of Indigenous issues, especially in an urban landscape like Montreal, where there is little exposure to traditional Indigenous culture. St-Louis attributes this ignorance about Indigenous peoples which she has encountered to a lack of opportunities for Indigenous cultures to be properly exhibited and appreciated: she stated that more than 85 per cent of the so-called “Indigenous items” sold today are made in China, and there’s little opportunity for modern Indigenous artists to enter the market.
The ultimate goal of the Femmes, Mes Sœurs project, according to St-Louis, is to educate the public on the impact that violence has on women, their families, and society as a whole. When asked what women can take away from the workshop, St-Louis replied firmly and without hesitation: “Empowerment. Solidarity. Being able to walk out of these workshops knowing that you’re making social difference, social change; you’re breaking the pattern for your children, for your neighbour, for your cousin.” In attending the workshop, women can also receive guidance on how to navigate their trauma from Melanie Morrison, one of the aforementioned leaders of the workshop. Morrison’s sister, Tiffany, was murdered in 2006; Morrison uses her painful experience recovering from grief to help others cope with their trauma.
What is shared in the workshop will remain confidential; St-Louis stresses that no names will be published in the Femmes, Mes Sœurs book. Nevertheless, the publication of the book as well as the presentation of the quilt is meant to bring awareness of gender-based violence to the general public, so women may anonymously share explanations of their embroidery if they choose to do so.
Ultimately, the workshop is an opportunity for individual women to find a sisterhood and cope with their traumatic experiences. As StLouis said, “It’s not a project for discovering art, but it’s a project for healing trauma through art.”
St-Louis invites women at McGill who have experienced violence to attend the Women are Sisters workshop. It takes place at the Ashukan Cultural Space, 431 Place Jacques-Cartier, every Wednesday from 6:00 – 9:00 p.m. She would also like to emphasize once more that the workshop is confidential, to make women as comfortable as possible in sharing their stories. St-Louis can be contacted by email at nadine@productionsfeuxsacres.ca

2020-03-14,McGill,China,"UPDATE: Saturday, March 14, 10:00 p.m.
In an email sent from Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau at 9:15 p.m., the University announced that “All classes, teaching labs, exams and other assessments are suspended for two weeks – except theses defenses.” McGill will be working on resuming teaching and academic activities online during this time.
While food services in residences will remain open, a number of other food options on campus may be closed during the next two weeks, or open with reduced hours.
Additionally, the Wellness Hub will remain closed over this coming week, but may attempt to move online after. Athletics facilities and libraries will be closed until March 30.
Due to the governmental change in classification of all outside countries as “Level 3,” McGill is recalling ALL students abroad. These students are expected to receive additional information soon, including information about academic accommodations. It is unclear at this time if McGill will be financially compensating students abroad for unexpected travel due to COVID-19.
—Original article published on Saturday, March 14, 7:30 p.m.—
In the last 72 hours, Quebecers have received a myriad of instructions from the provincial government meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. At around 11:45 a.m. on Thursday, March 12, Quebec premier Francois Legault informed the public of these measures, including the barring of all indoor events with more than 250 people in attendance, the mandatory self-quarantine of all employees (in both the private and public sectors) in the health and education systems for 14 days upon return from abroad, and the request that those who have returned from other countries recently – or have flu-like symptoms – voluntarily self-isolate for two weeks.
McGill Campus Closures
Less than 24 hours later on Friday, March 13, the province announced new measures – all universities, CEGEPs, schools, and daycare centres are set to be closed for two weeks starting on March 14. Upon this announcement, McGill University sent out an email informing the community that “all student travel outside Canada for internships, student exchanges, international mobility programs, competitions or conferences is suspended until further notice” and that intake of new international students will be suspended for the time being. The exact status of future and incoming international students is unclear at this time.
In an additional administrative email sent on Saturday, March 14, Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau confirmed that all in-person events at McGill, both on- and off-campus are canceled. Campus libraries and athletic facilities will be closed until Tuesday, March 17. The Student Wellness Hub will also be closed – and subsequently all pre-booked clinic appointments canceled – between March 15-21, as per the latest information students have received via email.
Though the details of the two-week closure have not been officially communicated to students, there are conflicting reports at this time as to what the structure of classes will be. Some professors have posted online modules and lectures, but others are claiming that no new materials or assignments will be introduced while classes are cancelled. A March 14 email from Deputy Provost Labeau stated that “the University is suspending all teaching activities until further notice.” It is unclear at this time what that means for assignments due in the next week, or if online materials will be available.
The most recent measures the provincial government announced on Saturday, March 14 include the banning of all visits to public senior homes and the request that all those who are elderly or immunocompromised avoid all non-essential outings, among other instructions.
The Status of McGill Students Abroad
For McGill students on exchange, the last couple of days have been uncertain. According to an email received by students studying abroad on Friday, those in the only countries that had been previously classified as “Level 3” (“avoid non-essential travel”) by the Canadian government – Iran, Italy, and China – had been recalled by McGill. Students in countries that had been labeled “Level 1 and 2” were told they would receive more information in the next few days. However, on Saturday, March 14, the Canadian government announced that all countries outside of Canada are to be classified as “Level 3.” As of 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, students abroad have not received updates from McGill.
The initial email received by students encouraged McGill students in those countries to leave their institution abroad and return home if they are concerned for their safety. For students that opt to leave, McGill Abroad had instructed them to inform their host institution, as well as McGill, and to ask the former about remote studying options.
William von Herff, a McGill student who was studying abroad for the Panama Field Study Semester, has left the country due to the virus’ quick spread. The number of cases in Panama has risen steadily in the past few days; the first death from COVID-19 was recorded on Tuesday, March 10, and as of March 13, the country has 36 confirmed cases of infection, three of whom are foreigners.
“The country has only 100 respirators and was down to 30 available as of yesterday,” von Herff told the Daily in a message on Friday, March 13. “We were recalled so as to not endanger ourselves nor put a burden on the Panamanian healthcare system.” The country has 2.3 hospital beds per 1,000 people, fewer than both Canada and Italy.
Von Herff thanks the program coordinator, Catherine Potvin, for the quick turnaround in getting students out of the country. Thanks to Potvin, he said, students returning to Montreal will be group-quarantined in Mont Saint-Hilaire, and once in isolation they will receive two days of groceries and three catered days of meals from McGill.
“[Potvin] is trying to get McGill to pay for some flight stuff, and if not, leftover program money will cover it,” he added.
For Sarah Gao, a McGill student on exchange at the University of Sydney in Australia, classes are still taking place in-person. If the situation escalates, however, Gao says that the University will consider a switch to online courses.
“It feels a little bit surreal because I’ve been seeing wash your hand signs everywhere since I first arrived [on February 9, 2020],” she told the Daily in a message on Friday, March 13. According to Gao, one of the student residences has shut down in order to quarantine international students who are just arriving.
“I think that students panicking and blaming McGill […] is causing more panic and more anger and so I’m just trying to stay as calm as possible and trust that they’re going to figure something out,” she concluded. Australia has reached over 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, as of March 14, 2020, with 112 cases in New South Wales, where Gao’s university is located. There are reports that the number of testing kits available is “rapidly deteriorating.” The country’s ratio for the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people is 4.0.
Another student on exchange in the U.K. has similar thoughts. “Many of my peers are angry at McGill for not reaching out earlier, but many others (including myself) are not,” they told the Daily on Friday. “It must be very difficult for an administration with a massive body of international students to keep track of whose home country is issuing a travel ban, and whose home country is locking down entirely.”
Other students are much more concerned and dissatisfied with McGill’s response, especially in light of the change in travel levels for all countries outside Canada. The past few days have seen a flurry of social media posts from students abroad, confused as to what next steps they should take, considering that every student is now in what classifies as a Level 3 country.
In a phone interview with the Daily on Friday, March 13, SSMU President Bryan Buraga also spoke to the status of the administration’s communication with exchange students, stating that the University “is crafting plans for how best to move forward, because so many students […] are spread throughout the world.”
Though he expressed that McGill acknowledges that “each student [abroad] requires different ways of dealing with the situation,” and that there are a variety of possibilities and solutions depending on the student’s region, communication to exchange students remains general and not region-specific.
“Depending on the situation, it’s not like all of the facts can be applied widely to all students,” he said, “which is why there hasn’t been more information being sent out at the moment.”
Communications and Services
Buraga emphasized that this is a “rapidly evolving situation.” Admitting that this is a difficult time for students, he detailed his liaisons with the University administration. Speaking to the delay in communications from them, Buraga said that “because the situation changes on a daily basis, plans are being recruited to comply with government directives and regulations.”
In meetings with Deputy Provost Labeau, Buraga was told that the administration is working to ensure that “contingency plans are in place”, and that the University is “relying on the expert guidance of the Quebec Health Authority.”
“I ask the student body to be patient and to trust […] that both the SSMU and the University are working to ensure the health and safety of students,” he said. “This is, again, a very difficult time. But I know the McGill community, I know the goodness that’s in everyone – so I trust that we can all get through this together.”
According to one student in residence, members of McGill security have broken up “gatherings of any kind” in common spaces and told students to go back to their rooms, despite this not being officially mandated in any email communications. Per online communications to residents and Residence Life employees, programming is suspended until further notice, though Floor Fellows are mandated to stay on duty in residence. Students in residence have been told that McGill will not ask anyone to leave campus, and that those who are advised to self-quarantine will be provided an isolated space to do so.
MSERT will no longer be posted regularly in each residence, but is shifting to coverage in residences on a day-by-day basis, and they are updating their schedules online. They can still be reached at their regular emergency dispatch number, but recommend that students call the COVID-19 hotline (1-877-644-4545) instead if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.
There have been more than 132,000 cases of the virus in the world, with more than 200 in Canada and more than 20 in Quebec, as of Saturday, March 14.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that SSMU President Bryan Buraga’s understanding was that incoming international students’ would not be able to attend in the upcoming fall semester until further notice. He has contacted us to let the Daily know that there is no indication that the suspension of international student intake will extend to the fall.

2020-03-17,McGill,China,"“I feel like the administration has treated us all like an aftersight,” Student Says
When the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus – also known as COVID-19 – a pandemic on Wednesday, March 11, many McGill students abroad had not received any specific communications detailing the status of their programs. On Sunday, March 15, Isabel Robertson, a McGill student studying abroad in the U.K., told the Daily, “This whole experience has been stressful and shows how fragile our systems are and how ill-prepared they are for a disaster.”
By the weekend, McGill had informed all study abroad students that they were being recalled due to the federal government’s classification of all outside countries as “Level 3” – meaning all “all non-essential travel” should be avoided. The email was sent out to the McGill community on Saturday, March 14 at 9:15 p.m., more than 24 hours after Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu labeled all external travel “high risk” at an early afternoon press conference on Friday, March 13.
“This whole experience has been stressful and shows how fragile our systems are and how ill-prepared they are for a disaster.” – Isabel Robertson, McGill study abroad student in the U.K.
Prior to these developments, McGill had only recalled students studying abroad in Italy, Iran, and China. The rest were told in a March 13 email, “If you feel concerned about your safety, you are encouraged to leave your study abroad activity and return home.”
Before the March 13 email went out, that’s what Robertson did. In a message to the Daily, she explained that McGill’s response was delayed in comparison to other Canadian schools, and that they did not respond to emails.
“Their late action made me get a flight prior to them encouraging students to go home because I don’t trust McGill to make decisions about my safety,” Robertson added. As of March 15, she had not heard from McGill about her credits, academic accommodations, or any financial compensation for unexpected travel costs. “To be fair all universities have been [unclear and confusing] because no one has any plan set for a pandemic,” she granted.
Many other McGill students abroad shared these grievances. For Melanie Rose, a McGill student in Ireland, it was particularly frustrating to be left in the dark while other exchange students at Trinity College Dublin heard from their home universities.
“The first email we received specifically about exchange was on Friday March 13. All of my friends at private universities in the U.S. had [already] been recalled, and my other friends at both American and Canadian schools had received some sort of communication from their universities on Wednesday, March 11,” Rose explained. “While it was only a difference of two days, the situation in Ireland, Canada, and around the world was escalating quickly, so it felt like a very long time.”
In comparison to McGill, Trinity College Dublin began online courses early last week, and Rose says they plan to continue to teach students online for the rest of the semester. McGill plans to be “as fully online as possible” on March 30. 
When the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus – also known as COVID-19 – a pandemic on Wednesday, March 11, many McGill students abroad had not received any specific communications detailing the status of their programs.
Other students abroad have also said that their host institutions have handled the situation better than McGill. Nicole Luongo, an American student at McGill who was studying in Spain, is one of them. In a message to the Daily, she stated, “There was a 2 day period in which Spain qualified as a level 3 country and I had no contact from McGill.”
In contrast, Luongo explained, her host institution in Spain was “extremely transparent” and “intent on continuing online studies until the university opened up again.”
“As far as I know, I will be completing my credits through online courses with my Spanish university,” she told the Daily. “They have been extremely accommodating and helpful throughout this process.” Luongo has already returned home to the U.S.
One McGill student, who requested anonymity, is worried about leaving the Czech Republic – if they do, it’s unlikely that they will be able to return.
“Technically I can go home [right now,] but it’s just risky [because] if they reopen classes in-person at some point, it’ll be really difficult for me to come back compared to other exchange students who live in Europe,” they explained to the Daily in an interview on Monday, March 16.
The Czech Republic, as a member of the European Union, is planning to limit all non-essential travel into the country, as was announced earlier that day. Only those from the U.K. and members of the Schengen travel area that allows freedom of movement in Europe – in addition to a few other exceptions – will be exempt from the ban. The Czech government also announced a nation-wide quarantine, effective Monday.
“My host institution has been great at keeping me informed, McGill really didn’t tell me anything,” the student emphasized. “[McGill was] really late in contacting exchange students, to the point that things had already largely gotten out of hand here by the time they chose to email us with information specific to students abroad.”
They explained that they have asked McGill about penalties for choosing to remain in the country of their study abroad program, and have not received a response. “By the time they DID choose to recall us, it was already incredibly difficult to get out of the country,” the student added.
“By the time they DID choose to recall us, it was already incredibly difficult to get out of the country.” – an anonymous McGill student, studying abroad in the Czech Republic
This is not the first time study abroad students have had difficulty getting a hold of McGill during an emergency. Chelsea Mang, a student who has been studying in Australia, has had concerns about the university’s responsiveness since January.
“McGill only contacted students going to Australia about the bushfire crisis two weeks into my host university’s semester here because we had a summer class and trimester as compared to other Australian universities starting in mid-late February,” she explained. “That email for us here showed that McGill seemed to have ‘forgotten’ about us who had been experiencing the dangerous bushfire smoke first hand for two weeks already at that point.”
Mang added, “Just hearing stories about mutual friends being trapped in Italy […] makes me concerned and I feel like the administration has treated us all like an aftersight.” She has not yet been able to go home, as her flight is scheduled for next week. CTV News reported on Monday that a group of McGill students and a professor have been stuck in Morocco after the country cancelled all international flights, and Mang is worried that similar measures may be taken in Australia.
“People say that flights may be cancelled, and if the U.S. doesn’t allow me in there’s not really another way for me to get home,” she expressed.
The situation across the world has placed an added financial burden on students abroad, whether it be through the cost of an emergency plane ticket or costs-of-living abroad. While most students the Daily spoke to had not received information from McGill about financial compensation by the time that interviews took place, the student in the Czech Republic shared an email they received from the Government of Canada on Tuesday, March 17, detailing information on the COVID-19 Emergency Loan Program for Canadians Abroad. 
The situation across the world has placed an added financial burden on students abroad, whether it be through the cost of an emergency plane ticket or costs-of-living abroad.
Through this program, “[The government] will provide the option of an emergency loan to Canadians in need of immediate financial assistance to help them return home or to temporarily cover their life-sustaining needs while they work toward their return,” as per the email. The loan can total up to 5,000 CAD, and application guidelines will be posted at https://travel.gc.ca/. It does not appear that international students at McGill who are currently abroad are eligible.
“McGill loves to pride itself on being very international and having a huge culture on exchange,” Mang explained, “but when it comes down to it I personally feel like the institution has let me and my fellow students abroad down.”

2020-09-18,McGill,China,"An introduction to McGill Students for a Free Tibet
McGill Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) is a student-run group on campus that seeks to end the Chinese occupation of Tibet through activism and awareness work. They are a chapter of the Students for a Free Tibet Canada organization, which is based in Toronto.
McGill SFT’s Maria Radu and Rebecca Parry (both U2 Arts students) spoke to The McGill Daily, discussing their group’s past and present activities, the importance of cross-movement solidarity, and the principles of their movement.
McGill SFT is organized as a collective of 3-6 governing members and a broader group of general members. They hold weekly meetings and plan events on a monthly basis, “from speaker series to workshops to critical film screenings to dumpling-making sessions!” For this year’s QPIRG Rad Frosh, they organized a workshop discussing different depictions of Tibet in Chinese, American, and Tibetan film – one of the most attended workshops of the weekend. This semester, they’re planning a socially distanced Momo (Tibetan dumpling) night in the park.
This summer in Montreal, McGill SFT participated in the August 23 protest in support of Uyghurs, organized by International Support for Uyghurs (ISU). “We were simply there to support and to listen,” explained Radu and Parry.
“I think the most incredible thing about that protest (and so many others like it) is that organizers from across movements came together to stand against CCP [Chinese Communist Party] oppression of Uyghurs.” They pointed to the #BoycottMulan campaign as another example of this cross-movement action.
Radu and Parry told the Daily that “solidarity work is a huge component of our organizing practice,” as they work with Montreal-based groups facing Chinese oppression like International Support for Uyghurs and Action Free Hong Kong Montreal. They also work with groups fighting against colonialism elsewhere in the world, including the Indigenous Student Alliance (ISA) and Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR).
Former McGill SFT member Khando Langri gave a speech at the August 23 protest, calling out the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for using ethnic minorities as “social labs for creating vast entrenched networks of settler-colonial violence”
In keeping with this cross-movement spirit, former McGill SFT member Khando Langri gave a speech at the August 23 protest, calling out the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for using ethnic minorities as “social labs for creating vast entrenched networks of settler-colonial violence.” She highlighted the shared experience of Tibetans and Uyghurs as victims of these social experiments. She also pointed out that current Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who supervised the construction of “re-education” camps for Uyghurs, was the Party Secretary in Tibet prior to becoming the Xinjiang Party Secretary. Radu and Parry said that for their group, Khando “[brought] urgency to the calls for pan-movement solidarity against PRC oppression.”
Radu and Parry described that history of oppression to the Daily, writing that “For the past 60 years, Tibet has faced cultural genocide at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. […] [The party] and its regional arms have been engaged in projects of assimilation through multiple tactics including: incentivizing mass migration of the Han majority into Tibetan territory, erosion of Tibetan language rights, and forced displacement of drokpa (nomadic pastoralists) from their ancestral lands.”
The SFT sees student activism as a powerful tool in the face of this oppression. Parry quoted a “long late night conversation” with SFT’s Executive Director Dorjee Tseten, on the power students have to fight these injustices:
“He described it to me like this: ‘In their occupation of Tibet, China has to weigh the costs and benefits. Every day, with every action we take, we are making it more costly for China to occupy Tibet.’”
For instance, Radu and Parry wrote, the work of SFT and other activist organizations was able to convince the World Bank to withdraw a loan that “would have seen massive disruption and displacement in Tibet under the guise of poverty reduction.”
“It is easy to be daunted by the Chinese Communist Party,” they continued. “But the CCP is simply a regime. Regimes rise and fall. […] There are brave and committed Tibetans, Chinese and allies from across the world who are committed to Tibet’s freedom and independence. Together, we are pushing the needle towards justice.”
“Many people see Tibet through an orientalist lens: as mystical, as homogenous, as inherently peaceful, even as “backwards.” We’re here to complicate visions of Tibet.”
Radu and Parry stressed the importance of cultural education to this project, as well as engagement with new ideas and scholarship produced by Tibetans in Tibet and the diaspora: “Many people see Tibet through an orientalist lens: as mystical, as homogenous, as inherently peaceful, even as ‘backwards.’ We’re here to complicate visions of Tibet. Tibet stretches over multiple million square kilometers and is home to 6 million people.”
They also upheld the value of direct action, including protesting and nonviolent demonstration: “We seek to uplift the lived experiences of community members who hold knowledge from lifetimes of practice outside of the academy.”
In reaction to a political and media climate that uses the oppressive tactics of the Chinese governement as an excuse to spread xenophobic rhetoric, Radu and Parry made clear McGill SFT’s rejection of sinophobia and racism: “In the current context of US-China relations, politicians and right-wing think tanks pose as supporters of Tibet but use racialized rhetoric when addressing China. […] We reject the support of politicians, public figures and any individuals who […] enact policies fundamentally implicated in settler colonial and racist ideologies and systems. At SFT, we seek to build a space that is affirmining to people of every race, class, gender, ability, sexual orientation and other aspects of identity.”
McGill SFT’s weekly meetings are held online this semester and are welcome to anyone. They are looking for members to join their leadership collective, as well as general members to freely attend meetings and get involved with organizing. Visit their Facebook page here.

2022-02-14,McGill,China,"What the latest protections mean for the future of the cultural and historic hub
In a January 24 virtual news conference, Quebec Minister of Culture and Communications Nathalie Roy announced the decision to classify parts of Montreal’s Chinatown as a heritage site, a hard-fought outcome for many activists and Chinatown residents. The area to be protected lies within de la Gauchetière, Rue St-Urbain, Rue Côté, and Avenue Viger, designated as the “institutional hub” of Chinatown by government officials.  
The newly assigned heritage block houses the historic British and Canadian School building, which is still in operation today as Wing Noodles, the oldest running business in Chinatown. The company is run by the three grandsons of Hee Chong Lee, an immigrant from China who started the business in 1897. The S. Davis and Sons cigar factory, built in 1884, will also gain heritage status, along with the historic city block which surrounds the two buildings. The area continues to serve as a cultural hub, home to active community organizations, a Buddhist temple, senior housing, and small businesses.  
This announcement comes alongside the City of Montreal’s adoption of interim measures which require any new construction projects to respect new specifications regarding the density and height of buildings, as well as increase historic Chinatown’s boundaries. May Chiu, a member of the Chinatown Working Group (CWG) and the Progressive Chinese of Quebec (PCQ), told the Daily that these new specifications are perhaps more significant than the province’s heritage designation as they will effectively “put a gel on many construction projects” threatening the community. 
Emphasizing the importance of these interim measures, Chiu cites nearby St. Laurent Boulevard, which was given heritage status by Parks Canada in 1997: “[there weren’t] any laws or regulation to underscore what historical protection meant – that’s why you see so many modern high rises on St. Laurent.” In contrast, the measures protecting Chinatown will regulate economic activity and specify what kind of development projects will be allowed to ensure the same doesn’t happen there. 
Though temporary measures until bylaws are established, these interim controls will serve as a moratorium to development that community members have been seeking since 2018, when Chinatown’s main cultural centre was lost to an outside creditor. This sounded alarms for many community members who feared the further loss of their neighbourhoods, leading to the creation of organizations like the CWG, a solidarity group originally stemming from the PCQ. In April 2021, the CWG released a detailed action plan to protect Chinatown and its heritage. The plan called for official heritage status, along with concrete actions such as the construction of affordable housing and the promotion of community gathering spaces.
A multi-level committee comprised of Chinatown community members and representatives from the Quebec and municipal governments was tasked with outlining the heritage protections to be accorded to Chinatown, an eight-month process spanning from October 2020 to June 2021. A final report compiled from these consultations resulted in the January 24 announcement. Chiu notes that it was important to make sure the whole community was involved in the consultation meetings – “[t]he Chinese community is very diverse, coming from a variety of different sectors, including small businesses, social service organizations, low-income residents, and seniors. When we talk about the plan for Chinatown, we have to take into consideration the needs of all this diversity”. 
While many community members see the new protections as significant steps in the right direction, a likely lengthy process towards a finalized plan lies ahead. At a January 24 outdoor press conference, activists and community organizations gathered to advocate for the immediate rights of residents to a better quality of life in Chinatown. Organizers held signs reading “Chinatown is not a museum,” referencing the need for heritage designation to encompass both tangible and intangible culture. “It’s about more than just streets and buildings,” says Chiu. 
“The Chinese community is very diverse, coming from a variety of different sectors, including small businesses, social service organizations, low-income residents, and seniors. When we talk about the plan for Chinatown, we have to take into consideration the needs of all this diversity.”
Residents spoke of the impacts of ongoing construction on their quality of life – “the dust, the smells, the noise […] it’s relentless […] I can’t even use my own yard,” said Kent Chong, an organizer and Chinatown resident. In the middle of the press conference, a construction worker came to ask the residents to move, stating that standing under the construction site raised safety concerns.  
According to Chiu, deeming Chinatown a historic site and pushing for all-encompassing heritage protection “doesn’t mean that it becomes a shell and that we let buildings dilapidate.” Instead, she argues for a “living heritage: people have to be protected, housing has to be protected, social services need to be provided.” 
The only remaining historic Chinatown in Quebec, Montreal’s Chinatown has fought development projects threatening the area since its establishment. In the 70s and 80s, Chinatown lost a significant amount of territory to real estate projects like the Guy Favreau Complex and Palais des Congrès.  
Developments continue to encroach on Chinatown’s neighbourhoods, including the REM project, an automated rail network criticized for supporting residential construction around its routes. CWG voiced opposition to the project, but its cancellation has not been confirmed. As community members continue to push against unabated development, they work against the rhetoric of big developers and contractors. “It will be really easy for the big developers to come in and say, we need to put in luxury, high-rise condos because we need to keep the economy running, and if we have more rich people [in the neighbourhood], it will keep the economy running,” Chiu told the Daily.  
[Chiu] argues for a “living heritage: people have to be protected, housing has to be protected, social services need to be provided.” 
“We have to push for a human vision of development, and the challenge will be how to make everything economically viable,” she continued. Chiu says that the city is currently focusing on building social housing units, a call from the CWG’s action plan. 
During the January 24 press conference, Montreal mayor Valérie Plante echoed the sentiments of community organizers. She said that while heritage protection is a “big step,” it is not the only one, pointing out that Chinatown’s increasing prices have been pushing out its current residents.  
The fight for Chinatown is multigenerational, encompassing family, community history, and deep connections to culture and language. Says community member Parker Mah, “…although a temporary moratorium is in place, the war is not over. A public consultation on the proposed changes will take place in the spring.”  According to Chiu, community organizers are currently mobilizing different sectors to participate in the public consultation towards the finalization of bylaws, along with specifying the roles of the many organizations working towards this goal. 
Regarding the upcoming consultation process, community members are preparing for a challenge. “We know that the huge developers with all their trillions of dollars are going to try to pack the consultation,” says Chiu. 
If you are interested in making submissions to the public consultation, which will be announced in the spring, you can contact the co-coordinator of the Chinatown Roundtable, Andy Vu, at andy.vu@faubourgstlaurent.ca.

2022-04-04,McGill,China,"Amidst critiques from Montreal residents and the city council to rethink its design, the project has been placed on hold.  
In January, Montreal’s Chinatown was granted heritage protections by the city of Montreal, signaling progress towards its protection against further development and gentrification. Today, despite this change in status, Chinatown residents and community groups remain at work against threats of infrastructure development.
Since its announcement, Chinatown residents have expressed concern over the design of the REM de l’Est, a $10-billion electric light rail project set to connect downtown Montreal with the eastern neighborhoods of Pointe-aux-Trembles and Montréal-Nord. Among its 23 stations is one planned to occupy Chinatown’s only remaining vacant lot, located at the corner of René Lévesque and Saint-Laurent. 
The REM de l’Est, the second phase of the Réseau express métropolitain (REM), is set to “become the ‘backbone’ of transportation in the east end of Montreal” with a fully automated electric light rail car system connecting eastern Montreal to the downtown core. The proposed railway will double the coverage of the metro network in eastern Montreal and connect to existing public transit networks, utilizing driverless train cars running on elevated tracks. 
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) emphasizes REM de l’Est’s economic and environmental benefits, notably its potential to move residents away from solo driving, reduce the city’s greenhouse gas emissions by 35k tonnes/year, and generate $6.3 billion for Quebec’s GDP during construction. However, many residents have expressed concerns about the introduction of such obtrusive infrastructure into their neighborhoods, calling it a “scar in the city’s landscape.”  
On March 17, CDPQ Infra announced that it would delay hearings by Quebec’s environmental law agency, the Bureau d’Audience Publiques sur l’Environnement (BAPE). This was to be the next step in the process before beginning construction and ultimately finishing the light rail by mid-2029. Now, this timing will be skewed, rendering its completion date unknown. 
The Chinatown Working Group, a community-based collective that played a large role in advocating for Chinatown’s heritage designation and is now involved in the public consultation for bylaws protecting the neighborhood from future development, first raised concerns about the project last August. In a letter to CDPQ, they called REM de l’Est “detrimental to the integrity of the living and built environment” of Chinatown. Among a list of recommendations, the letter called for the inclusion of the Chinatown community in the planning process and for an underground option to be privileged over an aerial railway and ground structure. They ended their letter by expressing the potential of REM de l’Est to “contribute to the improvement of Montreal’s quality of life,” so long as the CDPQ considers their proposed changes.
On March 13, CWG echoed its August recommendations in a second letter, emphasizing the project’s need to respect Chinatown’s heritage through a “holistic integration from a design and planning perspective.” It emphasizes the significance of prioritizing an underground track, claiming that “an elevated track and road closures would have a huge impact on Chinatown’s community and its future development, especially so close to [the institutional core] of this area.” Though a revised project was released following their August letter, CWG writes that CDPQ still has not addressed their previously stated concerns: “the updated version of the REM de l’Est is unacceptable and prejudicial to Chinatown and its community.” 
Donny Seto, a member of CWG and lecturer in the Geography, Planning, and Environment department at Concordia University, told the Daily that the project – if completed as currently planned – would effectively corner off the northern sector of Chinatown. This is significant, he notes, “given that Chinatown [already] has three barriers on the east, west, and south side.” 
Building the station underground, Seto says, “will reduce the physical impacts on Chinatown in terms of cutting it off from its surroundings.” He points to some of the major development projects that have left a mark on Chinatown in the past – “from the Guy-Favreau building, Palais des congrès, and now the CHUM hospital – we don’t want additional heavy infrastructure [in Chinatown],” Seto told the Daily. He refers to the Complèxe Guy-Favreau, which replaced a cultural center in 2019, and to the recently constructed Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM) hospital which is located partially in Chinatown and partially in the Quartier Latin. Chinatown “has survived in spite of these efforts – but it won’t if this is going to continuously happen,” says Seto. 
CDPQ has responded to CWG’s second letter with the offer of having a conversation about the project and its impact on Chinatown, says Seto. However, at the time of our interview, they had not responded to CWG’s calls for the promoter’s presentation of the project in front of the Chinatown community followed by an open discussion. 
Despite interim controls put in place to protect Chinatown from development in January, Seto says that since the heritage bylaws are still in process, “we don’t necessarily know how they will impact the project in the future.” However, he says that the heritage protections will dampen the real estate speculation that could come about if the REM was confirmed – “if they weren’t in place, a lot of developers would start buying out land without second thought […] so they will dampen the development pressures in Chinatown and give us a moment to reflect on how to properly protect and envision the future of Chinatown.” 
Seto says that CWG has been in contact with Mayor Plante and other city councilors regarding the project’s impact on Chinatown. The group’s advocacy, along with calls from east-end residents, has influenced the city to rethink its strategy and ultimately for the expert advisory committee on the project to request changes. Montreal Mayor Valorie Plante has expressed support for REM de l’Est, saying that “the progress of transportation in Montreal and in the east end depends on it.” However, Plante has also been vocal about the need to reform the project, demanding that the city be given a seat at the table in the planning process and adding provincial funding to integrate the aerial rail into the urban landscape. 
Seto emphasizes that the REM de L’Est has low social acceptability so far, not only in Chinatown but among commuters and city residents in other affected neighborhoods: “those [who] would seemingly draw the most benefit from the line itself are [the ones] who are the most concerned about its impacts,” he says. 
A new report by a city expert advisory committee working to ensure the project’s integration into its surroundings expresses “strong worries” about the large gap to be created between de Bleury and Saint-Urbain streets, where trains would enter an elevated track from an underground tunnel. The committee also asked for the layout of René-Lévesque to be “fundamentally revised” to keep the area around the elevated track livable and accessible. 
Christian Ducharme, vice-president of engineering at CDPQ Infra, said that the company’s new designs, released last week, address “more than 80 per cent” of the concerns raised in the city’s report. The new designs include an “urban lookout” overlooking the tunnel entrance on René-Lévesque to make the area pedestrian-friendly. It also suggests the use of transparent glass-like materials in locations where sound barriers up to four meters tall are necessary on tracks close to buildings, which Ducharme says will be “less heavy in the [surrounding] environment.” Ducharme added that two options remain for a small section of the project’s route through the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough: one that would run along Sherbrooke and connect with the Honoré-Beaugrand Metro station and the other that would run further south, along de Souligny. 
According to Seto, Ducharme’s words are “empty promises to make the project look socially acceptable, when in reality [the new design] has no teeth.” He and his CWG colleagues disagree that the new design shows improvement: “when we saw the plan…there was some beautification, but the plan itself hasn’t changed very much – it didn’t address any of the concerns that we had posted in our letter to CDPQ,” he added. Although promises to include green spaces and biking infrastructure were included in the design, Seto says that they would not be funded by the project – instead, these additions would be left up to the city. Seto, whose academic focus is on sustainable development and urban planning, says that while the current analysis focuses on the project’s potential in terms of economic returns on investment, “in terms of its social, environmental, and health impacts, I don’t think that work has been done thoroughly.” 
Originally from Quebec City, the vulnerability of Montreal’s Chinatown to threats of infrastructure development is sentimental for Seto. “I witnessed Quebec City’s Chinatown disappearing with the development of highway infrastructure and [the expropriation of land] that housed many Chinatown residents…It disappeared pretty much overnight,” he told the Daily. “I don’t want to see this kind of event happening again [in Montreal].”
The REM de l’Est’s process has a long way to go, and for its critics, this pause signals the potential for reflection and the creation of a design that best suits all of Montreal. “[CWG] will definitely be vigilant in terms of what happens [with the project]. Hopefully, we will be invited to comment and consult on how this project could benefit Chinatown into the future,” says Seto. 
In the meantime, CWG continues to push for its demands to be met. “The fight isn’t over,” says Seto. “CDPQ Infra should take this time to reflect on what the ultimate benefit of this project is, and who is benefitting the most.”

2022-10-24,McGill,China,"Panel discusses motion M-62 and McGill’s investments
On October 18, SSMU hosted an event with the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project (URAP) in solidarity with Uyghur rights activists and to raise awareness about an investigation led by McGill students about tainted investments from the McGill Endowment Fund. 
According to the United Nations (UN), since 2017, the Chinese government (CPP) has held over one million Uyghurs in concentration camps in the Xinjiang region, also known as East Turkestan. Many individuals detained in these camps were never charged with crimes and were denied a legal defense. It seems that their only crime is their ethnicity and their religion. Months after her visit to China earlier this year, Michelle Bachelet released a report 11 minutes prior to the end of her term as UN Human Rights Commissioner describing the extent of human rights violations occurring in Xinjiang, stipulating that they might amount to crimes against humanity. The report is partly based on the testimonies of 26 former captives, who have reported having been subject to “patterns of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment […] including rape.” Beyond the barbed wire gates, the 11 million Uyghurs living in the region are under constant harassment and continuous surveillance. Bachelet’s report details how at the camps children are separated from their parents and brought to reeducation schools, and captives are subject to forced labor, forced sterilization, and banned from practicing their religion,among other human rights violations. In the past years, reports have been issued, incriminating documents have been leaked, and stories have been told, yet action from the international community has been minimal. In addition, the CCP denies any of the allegations of human rights violation; for example the government  responded to the OHCRH report with a 121 counter report saying that the terrorist threat required/forced the creation of “de-radicalisation” and “vocational education and training centres.” 
Among the panelists invited, Kyle Matthews, director of the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, talked about how these atrocities were characteristic of genocide according to international law. He said “there is a common myth that genocide only entails mass killings […] just the planning of it, is an act of genocide. We have seen [in Xinjiang] the separation of children from their families, the destruction of cultural heritage sites, and attacks on places of worship precursors of genocide attempts to destroy their identities. That is what genocide is.”
Much of the world has condemned China for its violations, yet countries still haven’t recognized the genocide. In 2021, the US was the first to do so. Since then, the European Parliament has recognized ongoing human rights abuses in East Turkistan citing “crimes against humanity and serious risks of genocide,” becoming the largest legislative body to do so. This has been followed by many parliaments in the world doing the same.  The Canadian Parliament passed in a non-binding motion in February 2021 stating that the treatment of the Uyghurs constitutes genocide. Nonetheless, the Canadian government, like many others, still hasn’t officially recognized it. MP Sameer Zuberi spoke about this issue in conversation with the Daily: “the recognition of a genocide triggers requirements on the part of the signatories of the Geneva convention to respond in very dramatic ways […] and it necessitates complete proof of the crime. Although there is a body of evidence […] journalists and researchers cannot access the region […] I would guess that the government wants to have a larger body of evidence inorder officially recognize the genocide.” 
On October 26, Motion M-62 initiated by MP Zuberi will be discussed in parliament. “This motion calls on the Canadian Government to create a specific stream of immigration [to Canada] of 10,000 Uyghurs in  third [party] countries such as Turkey, Pakistan or Saudi Arabia where they risk being deported back to China and placed in concentration camps,” he says. 
Another obstacle to concrete action and recognition of the genocide is the complex and intertwined presence of the Chinese government in many layers of Canadian society, as discussed by Doctor Susan Palmer during the panel discussion “China is everywhere.” She explains that China is present in our economy but also in our investments and in objects we use on a daily basis. For example, approximately 25 per cent of the world’s cotton is being produced in China, and 85% is cultivated in Xinjiang and most probably comes from forced labor. In the first part of the event, URAP organized mass mailings to MPs in order to support not only motion M-62 but also Bill S-204, introduced by Senator Leo Housakos, which would amend the Customs Tariff to prohibit the importation of any and all goods produced in the Uyghur region. 
In March 2022, an article from the McGill Tribune detailed that $15 million of the McGill endowment fund was being invested in Chinese government bonds, organizations contributing to mass surveillance, and businesses exploiting Uyghur people. In an interview with the Daily, Leo Larman Brown, co-author of the article, explains that “after the article came out we didn’t get a lot of attention, it’s disappointing but not surprising.” They were then contacted by URAP to create a project called “Clean Universities Campaign,” which intends to expand the research done by Brown and co-author Massey to all universities in Canada and eventually the US. Brown added that they now work with a research analyst, and “by looking into McGill’s $1.8 billion endowment fund, he found that $65 million are invested in complicit companies and  $148 million are invested in Chinese companies.” Furthermore, Brown highlighted that they “are trying to show that this is student dollars that are going into the endowment fund, if students knew that their money was funding a genocide, I think they would have something to say. This is about transparency for the university.” On the matter of student activism MP Zuberi added that “student action is crucial in this kind of battle. […] You have the power to put pressure on your administration, by raising awareness and organizing.” 
After the panel, traditional Uyghur food was offered to the attendees, including Polo, which is rice with carrots and meat, and Laghman noodles from the restaurant Urumqi Ozgu Uyghur Cuisine. Other Uyghur restaurants in Montreal include Le Taklamakan and Dolan Uyghur. 
The event concluded with the screening of the documentary In Search of my Sister by Jawad Mir. It follows the story of Rushan Abbas, an Uyghur activist, in her journey to open the eyes of  people to the horrors of what is happening in East Turkmenistan while trying to find clues about the disappearance of her sister. Abbas then joined the event on Zoom to talk more about her experience and her mission. She emphasized the importance of speaking out but also the risk that comes along. “They took my sister because I spoke out,” she says. When asked if she has advice for people that are afraid to speak out, she said “ the power of love is what drives me, love for my sister, for my people, for my homeland, and love for freedom and democracy, that is what’s at stake. Today, the conscience of the world is being tested. […] The Chinese government depends on people remaining silent. […] Anyone who cares for humanity should speak up. Educate yourself and the people around you.”

2023-01-23,McGill,China,"Motion for Uyghur rights and McGill divestment from genocide moved to Council
On Monday, January 16 SSMU held its Winter 2023 General Assembly (GA) over zoom, in addition to being live streamed on Youtube. Yet,  the ongoing issue of low engagement and participation in student affairs permeated the meeting. As was the case at the Fall General Assembly – which became the Fall Consultative Forum due to low attendance – the student attendance rate was far from what was necessary in order to reach quorum. Less than 30 students were present, thus failing to meet the 350 members required to meet a quorum. 
Members of the GA started by raising the question of how to improve attendance and engagement and asked if there were any kinds of specific plans that were being put forward by SSMU. President  Risann Wright responded that “plans include having a comprehensive communication […] with online and virtual communication as well as posting around campus to promote the GA’s.” 
The meeting continued with discussion of the Motion Regarding Uyghur Rights and the Uyghur Genocide Divestment, moved by Samuel Massey and seconded by Leo Larman Brown. This issue was also brought forward when SSMU hosted an event on Uyghur Rights along with the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project. McGill’s implications in the Uyghur Genocide were discussed by Kyle Matthews and MP Sameer Zuberi, amongst other pannelists. During the GA, the motion was presented by Samuel Macy as a “call for McGill to divest from the companies implicated in the Uyghur Genocide.”  Responding to the recent report written with the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project concerning “McGill University’s Endowment Fund Complicity in Uyghur Genocide,” the motion moved is an attempt to expand the motion regarding the adoption of the divest for Human Rights Policy, which was voted to be approved back in the 2021 GA. The report states that out of its 1.9 billion dollar endowment fund, McGill invested more than 115 million dollars in 111 companies with potential implications in the Genocide of the Uyghur population in the Xinjiang region in China. In addition, the report categorized the different complicit companies in which McGill invests, from “low complicity companies” to “medium complicity companies” to “High complicity companies.” The latter involves  26 companies, amongst which “15 are partnered with the XPCC (Xinjiang Production and Construction Company), seven are reported to have participated in labour transfers, eight are reported to be involved with surveillance in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous  Region, and six companies appear on U.S. sanctions lists.” The XPCC is under four different sanctions in the US because of its connection to serious human rights abuses, which reportedly include “mass arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious abuses targeting Uyghurs” as indicated by the US Department of Treasury in a 2020 statement. It is also the only Chinese company to be sanctioned in Canada, under the Special Economic Measures Act.  This short list includes companies such as Alibaba (in the textile industry), Tencent (in the tech and surveillance industry), and Daqo New Energy.
The members present at the GA expressed unanimous support for the motion. One member highlighted that “as a university and as members of our university we have the responsibility to make sure that the endowment fund goes towards good causes and not towards genocide.” Adding on to that, another member expressed  that “human violations shouldn’t be sponsored by our endowment fund.” A few students expressed their concerns about the effectiveness of this motion and continued to draw attention to the lack of responsiveness from the McGill administration since the beginning of calls for divestment from harmful entities such as fossil fuel companies, or in this case, companies complicit in human rights abuses. One of the members recalled to the assembly that  “we all know that for many years McGill has been ignoring everything that SSMU has been doing to divest from these companies.” To add on to this, a member spoke about the necessary caution SSMU needs to take when implementing this kind of motion since “there is a slim possibility that McGill may have a similar reaction to this as they did to the divest boycott and sanction motion which was successfully passed by referendum which resulted in McGill threatening SSMU’s existence.” In response to the comments made by attendees, Larman Brown underlined that the “difference with [their] movement was that there is broad political support for divestment from investments in [the genocide in] China.” Indeed, the matter has been taken to the Canadian Parliament, and numerous companies related to the Uyghur genocide are on Canada’s sanctions list. He added that “this is the first step in our long process, we [have] research to back us and we are looking to bring this right to the center of the administration.” As indicated in the motion, once adopted, it “would clarify SSMU’s commitments to solidarity with the victims of human rights abuses by establishing a well-defined set of criteria for divestment from entities tied to human rights abuses against Uyghurs.” 
After the statements, the motion was voted unanimously with 28 in favour. However, 28 is far from the 350 needed to reach quorum and therefore the meeting was established as a consultative forum. Subequently, on Thursday, January 19, the motion regarding Uyghur Rights and Uyghur genocide divestment was presented to the Legislative Council, and was passed with 17 votes in favour, one vote against and no abstentions. Some concerns were raised during the session about postponing the motion in order to wait and have the approval of the student body. Thus, the motion will be presented to the next Administrative Council. While it was not passed through direct democracy, it will retain the same legislative power as if it had been passed during the GA. 
When the Daily asked Larman Brown about the next steps of this new initiative that is part of the “clean universities campaign,” started in collaboration with URAP, he mentioned the continuation of research especially concerning the “division of investments between mutual funds and direct investments,” and emphasized  the “need to raise more awareness.” Most importantly, he highlighted the fact that the movement “doesn’t want to alienate [themselves] from the McGill administration” and that it is most important to establish a “dialogue with the McGill administration.” 
Monday’s GA continued with the Report of the Board of Directors presented by President Wright,  followed by the Reports of the executives. Wright highlighted the work on the Equity Diversity and Inclusion working group policy audit, a new Sustainable Development Goals policy draft which is scheduled to be released soon. They have also been working on different advocacy and representation campaigns including an initiative around housing and accommodations. In addition, the SSMU External Affairs is developing a permanent grocery program to aid students. 
Overall, student engagement during GA’s gives students the opportunity to bring forward motions and amendments that they feel are important. Furthermore, when successfully ratified, a motion can have greater symbolic significance because it is the result of direct democracy and therefore could be more convincing to the administration — specially for motions such as the one presented on Monday. As one student mentioned during the GA, “it is our duty as a Canadian and International university to pass this motion.”

2009-01-22,McGill,India,"Eugenics sparks debate on abortion rights
Pro-life speaker Mary Meehan was met with general applause and a significant number of boos at her talk on liberal and feminist support for the pro-life cause during an event at McGill on Monday.
The question and answer period, which lasted over an hour, saw many heated and a few virulent arguments.
The talk, organized by Choose Life and entitled “Why Liberals and Feminists Should Defend the Unborn,” drew almost 100 individuals of varying opinions on the issue of abortion. The left side of Leacock 232 attracted the pro-choice supporters, while the pro-life supporters and event organizers opted to sit on the far right.
Meehan criticized the left side’s current position of “worship[ping] at the shrine of choice.”
“Some choices really should not even be considered, because they do involve harming or taking the lives of other people,” she said. “Liberals indeed are anti-choice on many issues… the death penalty, most wars, torture, rape, racial discrimination, and many more. They should add abortion to the list.”
Speaking at length, Meehan suggested the existence of a “eugenics influence” in the pro-choice movement. She alleged that abortion is a new tool used for population control in the United States and around the world.
Meehan also cast abortion as a civil rights issue.
“Early in the 20th century, the eugenicists in the U.S. used compulsory sterilization of poor whites and poor African-Americans to keep their numbers down,” Meehan said. “But eugenicists did not have to use coercion after our Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade…. One of the ways they do it is by supporting public funding of abortion.”
Elise Eisenkraft Klein, U2 Jewish Studies, objected to what she believed was Meehan’s conflation of eugenics and the pro-choice movement.
“Choosing to have an abortion is not the same as forced sterilization,” she said.
Charles Pitman, U2 Economics and Philosophy, argued that support from eugenicists does not invalidate the legitimacy of the pro-choice position.
“All sides of the [abortion] issue have allies that they aren’t proud of. It’s not like the pro-life side has only friends that are reputable,” he said.
Meehan argued that abortions performed after neonatal testing for disabilities were wrong and that access to abortions increases paternal irresponsibility.
“Guys have to talk to guys about walking out [on women]. We need to reinstate the old stigma against guys walking out on their children.”
During the question period, Salma Moolji, U1 International Development Studies, told her story of becoming pro-choice while running a school for abused girls in Nicaragua.
“The day that I decided to be ‘pro-choice’ was the day that I saw the child [of a] child die of starvation…. If I put myself one generation back, I would be in India, where my grandfather was sold into child slave labour…. I might have been that girl.”
A few students in attendance were particularly incensed by Meehan’s sentiments. One such student, Elsa Beaulieu, a PhD candidate in Anthropology, called Meehan “arrogant” and “insidious.” At the end of a detailed and emotional criticism of Meehan’s points, she pleaded, “What about addressing the reality of women’s lives? What about the consequences of illegal abortions on women’s lives? What about it?”
But derogatory comments from the audience toward Meehan convinced Raphael Dumas, U1 Civil Engineering, to reconsider his position.
“Those few rude students actually pushed me in the direction of [the pro-life stance],” Dumas said.
Meehan insisted that her position is not hostile to women who have had abortions.
“I want to say to [those women who have had abortions] that I’m not out to make you feel badly or send you on a guilt trip, but I appeal to you to take another look at this issue, because there are more lives at stake every day. I hope that you will help save some of them.”
Choose Life, granted interim club status by SSMU in October 2008, will be applying for full club status at the end of this month. According to Choose Life’s Community Outreach coordinator Kathryn Sawyer, the group tries to offer resources to “women who want an alternative to abortion” on campus.

2009-01-26,McGill,India,"Participants hope to raise $40,000 for libraries in India
Sharone Daniel awoke at 4 a.m. last week to find a floor buffing machine inches from her face. Daniel, who had been sleeping In Concordia University’s Webster Library for the past five days, simply rolled over and tried to get back to sleep while the janitor operating the buffer apologized.
“It’s called Live-in for Literacy,” explained Daniel, a fourth-year Human Relations and Religion student at Concordia. Students live in a university library for ten days to raise money for education in developing countries.
Since the fundraiser began at Queen’s University four years ago, Live-in for Literacy has raised $50,000. The money has gone toward building computer labs in Cambodia and libraries in Nepal.
This year, seven Canadian university libraries are housing two students each until the end of the fundraiser today at 1 p.m. The students hope to raise $40,000 for the construction of nine libraries in India.
Daniel started by sharing a tent in the library foyer with third-year Concordia student Neeka Fedyshyn, but she soon decided to sleep on an adjacent couch because it was more comfortable.
“It was impossible to sleep on the floor,” she said, looking a little tired.
Fedyshyn, who had brought in a cot from home, stayed in the tent. Beside the tent, two large suitcases overflowed with clothes and schoolwork, while a rope barrier just in front of the suitcases doubled as a clothesline.
As the Concordia team explained, despite the positive reaction to the fundraiser, there were a few misunderstandings.
“One girl walked past, like, ten times,” said Daniel.
The hardest challenge, however, was missing a week’s worth of classes.
“The constant interruption makes it difficult to study,” said Daniel. “But one of my professors stopped by and donated $20 and said, ‘Don’t worry about your assignments.’”
According to the event’s rules, participants are only allowed to leave the library for five minutes each hour, but are allowed to accumulate unused breaks, leaving enough free time to run to the gym in the morning and shower.
The library allowed them to bring in a small fridge to hold food – most of which had been donated by friends. In the evening, when the building was closed, they got their exercise.
“Yesterday we were running up and down the stairs and doing sprints around the stacks,” said Daniel.
Still, the students didn’t find it that tough.
“I would do this week after week,” said Fedyshyn.
Donations can still be made at liveinforliteracy.com.

2009-02-05,McGill,India,"TA shows  movies while prof remains ill in India after conference
The students of RELG 353 – Ghandi: His Life and Thought – have been without their professor all semester, and some in the class of around 80 students are concerned that the material presented in their professor’s absence has not prepared them for the upcoming midterm.
Professor Arvind Sharma, an authority on Hinduism and the life and beliefs of Mahatma Ghandi in, was scheduled to miss the first few weeks of the semester in order to attend a conference in India, but fell ill and has, up to this point, been unable to secure a flight back to Montreal.
Ellen Aitken, Dean of the Faculty of Religious Studies, wanted to assure students that despite Sharma’s prolonged absence, the course plan was being followed.
“Professor Sharma was in India for a conference the Faculty [of Religious Studies] was co-sponsoring,” said Aitken. “Suitable arrangements were made for covering the first few weeks of class.”
Lecture time, for the past five weeks, has been filled with film screenings on Hinduism and Jainism – including the feature-film Ghandi – and multiple lectures given by teaching assistant (TA) Tom Pokinko.
“We’ve had class discussions, and I asked the students to write a personal response on two aspects of the film [Ghandi],” said Pokinko, as examples of different lecture activities.
Yet some students questioned the relevancy of the material they were watching to the course as a whole.
“What are we paying for if there’s no prof? We could watch the movies on our own,” said a student in the class, who asked to remain anonymous. “The class cost $600, and $200 [a third of the semester] of that wasn’t going to anything.”
As of yesterday, Professor Katherine Young has assumed Professor Sharma’s role, a replacement Aitken said the Faculty was fortunate to secure.
“Most universities don’t have multiple professors in single subjects,” said Aitken. “We were lucky that someone like Professor Young, who is familiar with the information, was available during class time.”
Aitken also supported the instruction given by Pokinko, a PhD student in Hindu and Jain ethics, who ran the class for the first third of the semester, providing several lectures, organizing movies, and distributing assignments, all under the instruction of Sharma.
“Often grad students and TAs know the course material best, and are in the best position to follow the course plan,” Aitken said.
Pokinko added that the material presented in class was approved by the absent professor.
“I’ve been in email contact with [Professor Sharma],” said Pokinko. “He advised me to lecture on Ghandi’s life and the course outline, interspersed with various concepts relevant to the course.”
Some students said that the quality of their learning had not been affected.
“Everything was really fine,” said Emily Blake, U2 International Development Studies. “We understand why the prof has been away, and the TA has been great.”
Still, with the midterm approaching students expressed concern over the content of examinations due to the relative lack of time spent on lecture. Because RELG 353 is a high level course, students committed to majoring or minoring in Religious Studies feel particularly worried.
“A decent amount of the [students in the] class are specialized,” said the student. “For most people, it’s not just an elective.”
The midterm has since been changed to a take-home examination. Aitken believed that there has been good instruction in the course, given the circumstances, and that the course has been running as planned.
“Generally, courses gel at various points [and] many students don’t understand how various concepts fit together until a few weeks into the semester,” said Aitken. “When the professor returns, he will be able to tie the first few weeks of the course together.”

2009-02-19,McGill,India,"Students push to scrap cap on aboriginal postsecondary education funding
An ongoing petition by the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation Community and the First Nations Education Council is asking Parliament to remove its cap on funding for aboriginal postsecondary education.
While the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) – a national student lobby group – and its member union at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) have not officially endorsed the petition, they are working for similar results.
“Even though aboriginal people are a growing demographic in Canada, the funding stays at this two per cent cap. It’s not enough funding for all the people who want to attend postsecondary institutions,” said Melissa Penney, director of advocacy for the MUN Students’ Union and regional aboriginal representative for the CFS.
Penney is also Newfoundland and Labrador’s representative on the National Aboriginal Caucus (NAC), a CFS caucus that acts as a voice for aboriginal students in Canada. She said the petition has been on NAC’s radar, and it is starting to get materials together to push a similar campaign of its own.
Penney felt putting more money into aboriginal education would mean increased enrolment and higher success rates among Canada’s First Nations Peoples.
“There’s not a lack of aspirations keeping people from attending post-secondary studies,” she said. “There’s no lack of interest; there’s a lack of funding to go.”
The petition, expected to reach 10,500 signatures this month, calls for the removal of Parliament’s two per cent annual growth cap for the amount given to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada – the federal ministry that funds aboriginal education through the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP).
After PSSSP gives the money to the individual bands, they are then given the responsibility of deciding where the money must go.
“Some bands are facing really hard decisions, like: ‘Should we fund everyone in their last year of education, or should we give so much to each student and then they don’t have enough money for rent and food?’” Penney said.
Last year, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Development published a report titled “No Higher Priority: Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education In Canada,” which recommended dealing with the extension of postsecondary support to non-status First Nations and Métis students.
In the Conservatives’ 2009 budget, funding for on-reserve aboriginals and schools was directed to infrastructure projects alone, while also directing $200-million for skills training to help reduce unemployment rates.

2009-03-19,McGill,India,"Colonial policies leave communities susceptible to violence
Violence against native women is linked to larger problems and racist provisions in the Canadian judicial system, speakers said at two talks on missing indigenous women this week.
According to a 2004 Amnesty International report, entitled “Stolen Sisters,” 510 native women have disappeared or been murdered in Canada since 1980.
In a panel discussion at the Atwater Library on Tuesday, relatives of missing and murdered women denounced the Canadian justice system for having failed First Nations communities. The speakers decried malpractice and negligence on the part of the police.
When Gladys Tolley was killed in a collision with a Quebec police officer in 2001, an independent investigation was not conducted until long after the incident, according to Tolley’s daughter, Bridget. Though the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg police force, the Sureté du Québec took control of the case. Bridget Tolley recounted incidences of misconduct, including a coroner’s report being filed though the coroner never saw the body, and the brothers of the perpetrator being the officers in charge of the scene.
Lack of support and neglect in bringing perpetrators to justice was a common theme in the speakers’ accounts.
After the murder of Susan Martin’s daughter Terry, there was a marked lack of police support. “The only suspect is walking the streets free,” Martin said. “It’s happening every day, unfortunately. We have to wake up our justice system; we have to wake up our government.”
Police are often slow to act on the cases of missing women, labelling them as runaways and telling families to wait for them to return, according to Ellen Gabriel of the Quebec Native Women’s Association. Laurie Odjick’s daughter has been missing for six months. “I believe no thorough investigation was held because of the early assessment that Maisy was a runaway,” Odjick said, adding that Maisy left all her belongings, including her purse, behind.
Odjick pointed to racial discrimination in the handling of her daughter’s case, both on the part of the police and the media. “No one showed up…asking for our story – why? Was it because my child is native?” She recounted how painful it was to see the strong response to disappearance cases involving white victims, which often included helicopter and ground searches.
The speakers pointed out that the Montreal area is built on Mohawk land, and that much of Canada’s natural resources are drawn from contemporary First Nations territory. “We are all concerned about the economic crisis, the energy crisis…and where do you think all that energy is coming from? It’s coming from indigenous territories,” Gabriel said.
In her Monday talk, Beverly Jacobs, an aboriginal rights lawyer and the Native Women’s Association of Canada president, linked the trend of violence against native women to Canada’s colonial policies, including the creation of the Residential Schools, and certain provisions of the Indian Act – first enacted in 1876, although amended at least 18 times since.
“In my opinion, [the Indian Act] is one of the most racist pieces of legislation in the world,” said Jacobs.
Until the act was amended in 1985, women lost Indian status by marrying a non-Indian. Paternal, not maternal band membership is indicated on compulsory identification cards.
According to Jacobs, imposing a patriarchal registry system has undermined the social fabric of native communities, in which status is traditionally passed down through the female line. “Women were forced to leave their own territory and move to the man’s, were forced to be registered to his territory,” Jacobs said. “In international law that’s called forced displacement….and that’s generations – this has been since 1876.”
The formation of male-dominated Band Councils also disrupted communities in which women were previously major decision-makers. Forming these bodies to decide where government money is allotted within communities also created internal tension in communities, Jacobs said.
She described the Residential Schools as a mechanism for systematically stripping a generation of their culture, in which children were  beaten for speaking their language or had needles put through their tongues.
Gabriel called on the federal and provincial governments to institute policies that will alleviate systemic problems leading to violence, like poverty and lack of access to affordable housing, which can render communities vulnerable to violence – both from within and from outsiders.
The speakers said that there needed to be concrete missing persons policies put in place, and increased cross-cultural awareness training among police officers.
Family members and survivors of abuse should make their anger constructive by engaging in grassroots community activism and giving each other needed support, the speakers added.
Tuesday’s talk was followed by a candlelight vigil in Cabot Square to honour the missing and murdered women.
Gabriel stressed the responsibility of the Canadian government to take these cases seriously. “The government of Canada apologized, but they continue the status quo. Nothing has changed in that relationship, so that apology remains empty.”

2009-03-26,McGill,India,"McGill launched the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) on Monday with an inaugural conference focusing on the future of development.  ISID will absorb the existing Centre for Developing Areas Studies (CDAS) into its broader mandate to renew energy for development in a changing global context.
 Like CDAS, ISID will continue to be committed to multidisciplinary research, but with renewed emphasis on accountability and evidenced-based policy-making. It will eventually become home to undergraduate programs in International Development Studies, African Studies, Middle Eastern Studies and Latin American and Caribbean Studies, as well as a new Development Studies option at the Master’s level.
Phillip Oxhorn, the ISID Director, stressed that the energy of youth interested in development figures centrally in the new institute.
“ISID brings under one roof what universities can uniquely do while also capturing the energy and commitment of young people,” he said, explaining that the institute is a response to changes in the global order.
 Among those present was David Malone, President of the International Development Research Centre welcomed the launch of the institute by emphasizing the importance of their goal.
“Development is a dead serious business and should be treated with the seriousness it deserves,” he said, adding that it would be important for the ISID to break from Canadian precedent by sharing its success stories and disseminating its work more widely.
 The evening’s visiting keynote from India, Dr. Pratap Bhanu Mehta, President of the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, pointed to the timeliness of the ISID given the rise of China and India.
“It will not be a shift without conflict,” he said. “Both have a sense of growth and entitlement, they are not negligible.”
Mehta expressed hope that development policy-makers and practitioners to be more critical of the various assumptions held within the field, and called on the development community to be more aware of state actions.
“The most representative and participatory states are not necessarily the most responsive,” he said.
 Other attendees at the Institute launch include McGill President Heather Munro-Blum, McGill Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi, Canadian International Development Agency President Margaret Briggs, and International Development Research Centre President David Malone, the Right Honourable Joe Clark.
Roughly seventy people – mostly academics and practitioners – were present for the opening ceremonies at the Omni Hotel, with more joining in on Tuesday panels offering perspectives from donor agencies, non-state actors in development, various development institutions, and from youth practitioners, lasting throughout the day.
In his keynote address, Save the Children CEO David Morley acknowledged the privilege of speaking about poverty while conference delegates enjoyed a decadent three-course catered lunch.
Adam Matheson, U3 International Development studies commented on the elegance of the lunch.
“I understand the need to have a professional, formal conference to attract important speakers and guests; but a lavish 3 course meal while we listened to statistics on world hunger and squandered aid money seemed a little ironic.”

2009-10-08,McGill,India,"The University kicked off the conference on Monday by inviting several speakers from various countries to describe the impact of the financial crisis on their nation’s experience with food production.
The dean of McGill’s Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Chandra Madramootoo, introduced the event, which featured speakers from Ghana, Haiti, Central Asia, India, Nigeria, and Canada.
Mukuteswara Gopalakrishnan, Secretary General of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, mentioned that the financial crisis has presented a significant challenge.
“India could withstand the impacts of 2008’s economic downturn, particularly with respect to food security…. However, this year, things are going to be much more difficult,” Gopalakrishnan said.
He also said that while India has made progress in areas such as food production and caloric intake, hunger remains a serious problem.
Gopalakrishnan explained that the majority of farms rely on rainfall, and that deficient rain in recent months may cause Indian food production to suffer.
“India has made impressive strides,” Gopalakrishnan said.  “But we must also simultaneously admit that the total riddance of food insecurity is still at a distance.”
Victor Dukhovny, director of the Interstate Coordination Water Commission of Central Asia, asserted that Central Asia’s governments must make progress in protecting their farmers financially.
“If you want to have food security, we need to protect the farmer by a proper system of financial support,” Dukhovny said.
Dukhovny argued that the amount of irrigated land in the region decreased following the collapse of the Soviet Union because of a failure to subsidize agriculture appropriately, and went on to cite the European Union and United States as examples of countries with successful agriculture subsidy programs.
Dukhovny also focused on water’s role in agriculture, and suggested the creation of a global campaign to strengthen water rights with regards to irrigation.
Daniel Uza, vice-chancellor of the University of Agriculture in Nigeria, offered a description of his nation’s efforts to ensure food security.
Nigeria, Uza noted, has experienced an increase in food prices as a result of government efforts to subsidize tractors, irrigate more land, and manage livestock.
Uza stressed the nation’s need for improved farming technology and emphasized the Nigerian government’s focus on private-public partnerships to achieve its goals.
“Because of the stable, democratic government which we have had in Nigeria for the past 10 years, we are very hopeful that the food security situation in Nigeria will continue to improve.  And it is our desire that in the year 2020, Nigeria will be one of the most developed 20 countries.”

2009-10-08,McGill,India,"On Wednesday, experts weighed in on the effects climate change could have on agriculture in the coming years.
At the panel discussion, “Climate Change: the Challenges for Food Security,” four presenters pointed to several general anticipated climate changes that could affect agriculture: rising carbon dioxide levels, rising air temperature, and more extreme environmental events.
Bano Mehdi, a McGill PhD student working at the Brace Centre for Water Resource Management, said that the gradual increase in air temperature and subsequent droughts could have a major effect on crops that are already struggling in hotter climates.
“Crops are already at the threshold of their temperature limits,” said Mehdi.
Sam Gameda, a McGill alumnus who works for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, talked about the effect climate change could have on Canadian and East African agriculture.
“The [Canadian] prairies suffer from relatively frequent droughts,” said Gameda, citing a drought in 2001-2002 that resulted in economic losses upwards of $5 billion for the Canadian crop industry.
Issues are considerably worse in East Africa.
“Areas of East Africa are under stress of food security because of drought. [East African countries] are experiencing droughts, groundwater depletion, and disruption of rainfall,” Gameda said.
“Rainfall is a critical factor,” said Gameda, who pointed to an increase in variability of amounts of rainfall as a major concern. He cited a 23 per cent reduction in rainfall in the past Indian monsoon season as an important indicator, adding that these factors have put 24 million East Africans at risk of hunger and destitution.
Bert Drake, a plant physiologist for the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland, added that greater environmental stress could reduce crop production.
“More intense hurricanes and rising sea levels could affect low-lying areas, particularly rice production areas,” said Drake.
The projections weren’t overwhelmingly negative, however. “Possible climate changes create favourable conditions for plant growth,” said Galina Stulina, of the Central Asian Scientific Research Institute for Irrigation in Uzbekistan.
A rise in carbon dioxide levels and an increase in season length due to rising air temperature may be positives for plant and crop growth.
“There will be an increase in productivity in developed countries that have strong agricultural markets,” said Mehdi. “There will be opportunities for farmers to plant higher value crops.”
Despite the immediately beneficial climate change effects for Canada, Mehdi warned that the global effects will be far worse.
Mehdi described an anticipated northward extension in crop land, as the northern regions get warmer and southern regions get too hot. North America and Russia may be some of the only regions to benefit from this change, leaving already impoverished nations worse-off.
Mehdi said that the global population will have risen to nine billion by 2050, and as the crop yields of southern nations decrease due to the various climate changes, it will be the responsibility of countries with growing yields to provide for the growing population.
Those in attendance were left with the loaded question of how to distribute limited agricultural goods around the globe.
“There will be higher demands on agricultural commodities,” Mehdi said, “But it has to be done in a sustainable way.”

2009-11-03,McGill,India,"In a talk entitled “Colonial Canada 101,” members of Defenders of the Land, a cross-Canada network fighting for the rights of indigenous peoples, exposed the audience to the origins and manifestations of the injustice faced by indigenous peoples in Canada today.
Former Daily editor Martin Lukacs and Courtney Kirkby, activists who work in the Barriere Lake community five hours northwest of Montreal, led the workshop. They spoke on the existence of an alternate Canadian history to the one taught in schools, a history of malicious imperial agendas, and of repression of Native people by the Canadian government.
“One of the aims of the workshop is to help people to understand what the government’s role has been in propagating problems and not creating solutions,” explained Lukacs
A pattern brought up by Lukacs and Kirby during the workshop was the Canadian government’s systematic attempts to either repress Natives or assimilate them. They described how the Indian Act of 1876, which remains a part of the Constitution today, was designed to transform individual Natives into “wards of the state” with no Native-specific rights.
Lukacs referred to the Indian Act as “assimilation 2.0” and referred to the reservations it designated for Natives as “little factories for their demise.”
Kirkby and Lukacs explained how these patterns of oppression have continued into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
“Pierre Trudeau is supposed to have been a good prime minister,” said Lukacs, describing Trudeau’s reservations toward the 1969 White Paper that proposed the abolition of the Indian Act. “But he believed that since Natives faced discrimination, they should be assimilated.”
Kirkby brought the discussion back to Montreal when she announced the Barriere Lake community had received that morning notice that it would lose its right to internal governance and would be forced to hold monitored elections.
One of the most striking points during the workshop was that Canada continues to violate Native rights even though they are firmly established under Section 35 of the Constitution.
“The Canadian government is in violation of its own laws,” said Lukacs. “Section 35 is talked about as being a treasure chest or an empty box. The Canadian government wants it to be an empty box.”
Canada remains one of three countries, with the U.S. and New Zealand, which have not signed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

2009-11-03,McGill,India,"Members of No One Is Illegal spoke Wednesday afternoon at a session on First Nations solidarity activism, to discuss how the struggle of Native peoples can be supported from a no-borders perspective. In their presentations,  Jaggi Singh, Robyn Maynard, and Sareta Ahooja all discussed aspects of anti-capitalist resistance, decolonization, and anti-racism.
Singh began the presentation by explaining No One Is Illegal’s belief that the institution of national border protection represents an inherent system of violence and racism. He discussed various examples of border protection policies that result in the death or imprisonment of thousands of would-be immigrants all over the world, and asserted that all people deserve the right to migrate, resist displacement, and return to their lands of origin.
“Migration today is not just some arbitrary phenomenon; it’s the result of hundreds of years of colonialism and imperialism,” said Singh.
Maynard then focused the discussion more narrowly on Canada’s history of displacing, subjugating, and disenfranchising First Nations peoples. “It’s important that we see Canada as a settler state that came about as a result of genocide, theft, and warfare,” she said.
Maynard explained that status Indians were barred from voting in federal elections until 1960, and briefly discussed the federal government’s residential schools, which operated under a largely pro-assimilation mandate and were notoriously abusive toward their students.
“Colonialism isn’t over in Canada,” she said. “There’s still land being taken on a day-to-day basis.”
Ahooja expanded upon Maynard’s presentation by discussing the conditions faced by Mohawks living near the Canada-U.S. border, including the loss of their traditional lands, and a history of working as migrant laborers and steelworkers in urban centres across North America. She then launched into a discussion of the border dispute stemming from the arming of customs agents at the Mohawk reserve of Akwesasne.
“We have to get beyond the legalese of these struggles and focus instead on principles of humanity, as a part of the larger point of resisting global apartheid,” Ahooja said.

2009-11-05,McGill,India,"Colonialism and the creation of borders
The keynote panel at Culture Shock 2009 was presented yesterday by Radha D’Souza, who discussed the rise of border conflicts in the wake of British colonialism. Hosted by SSMU and QPIRG, Culture Shock’s week-long events deconstruct the myths surrounding Canada’s immigrant communities. D’Souza, an Indian lawyer, social activist, and a current reader for law at Westminster University in London, shed light on the impact of the border conflicts that followed Indian and Pakistani independence in 1947. The Daily sat down with her to discuss the emergence of border conflicts in the post-colonial era.
McGill Daily: What role has colonialism played in the contemporary border conflicts that afflict ex-colonial states?
Radha D’Souza: The past 500 years of modernity have shown that capitalism intrinsically is linked to forms of colonialism. As capitalism has changed, so have forms of colonialism – from a mercantile form of capitalism which created colonies in South America to large-scale imperialism perpetrated by industrializing nations. By forcibly bringing different communities together, colonialism created the pretext for contemporary conflicts. Look at the Malaysian example: different ethnicities were brought into Malaysia to work in different economic sectors – the Tamils to work on rubber plantations, the Malays to till the soil, et cetera. As soon as one of these sectors experienced a downturn, the issue became one of ethnicities. So, you see how colonialism, albeit in a different form than the British imperialism, still has a continued influence.
MD: Do national or international governments have an obligation to resolve these conflicts?
RDS: The idea of legal obligations suggests an assumed notion of legal objectives, a certain normative order that obliges people to act. Instead, we need to step back from these kinds of assumptions. We tend to look at conflicts at an empirical level; we perceive them as conflicts between Hindus and Muslims killing each other. With any social phenomenon, it is never that one-dimensional. We should start looking at what lies behind the forces that make people suddenly take up violence, particularly people who, centuries before, managed to live peacefully next to one another.
MD: Do you think that the way border conflicts are portrayed in the media can be seen as a form of ongoing colonialism? What do you think of Angela Davis’ notion of a “racialization of the media”?
RDS: Eisenhower spoke of a “military industrial complex” when in fact it is a “military industrial media complex”. We should not forget that the media is intrinsically bound to and evolved with the development of technology for warfare. Huge amounts of money have been put into psychological research by the government; the results are equally used by the military and the media. Furthermore, it is important not to forget that it is the victors who write history. The notion that the UN still is a truly “international” body – although the Security Council to this day is dominated by the victors of the Second World War – demonstrates the power of  this discourse. Who is the “international community”? The UN was created without the consent of the colonies. Can it be seen as truly representative?
We have to understand that the coverage of conflicts that we see is very much projected in a specific way by this “international community” and the same goes for the democracy discourse. There are a lot of myths about democracy which show a prevalent distaste for analytical thinking. We do not ask why certain conflicts are happening. Never before has so much money been around as today. A large part of this is bound to be channelled into sustaining conflict due to the power of the media as well as states. Although we talk about the importance of putting democratic systems in place in  Afghanistan, we neglect the people on the ground. Instead, we focus on individuals such as [Hamid] Karzai and [Abdullah] Abdullah. This demonstrates the power of discourse, as we have stopped questioning such representations and do not recognize the disconnect between not acknowledging the people and wanting to see “democracy”.
MD: To what extent does colonialism still live on in countries such as India and Pakistan? Do you find that elements of it have been appropriated by the respective governments and continue to be perpetrated with a new face?
RDS: What we forget, however, is that although the modalities of colonialism may change, the substance has remained the same. Colonialism is a living thing; the governments [of India, Pakistan]may have changed. However, the bureaucracy and the rulers essentially have remained the same. The notion of “legacies” is a powerful one, especially because we like to think that former colonies now are independent. This, however, is not necessarily the case. With the transformation of the character of capitalism to finance monopolies,  the character of colonialism and therefore all the nuts and bolts which hold it together have changed as well.

2010-02-01,McGill,India,"Federal recognition of First Nations could vanish in three generations
The Sheaf (CUP) – SASKATOON — A large contingent of First Nations people in Saskatoon protested the prorogation of Parliament, due to its impact on a planned revision of the Canadian Indian Act. The action was part of a national day of protest on January 23, when thousands of Canadians accross the country rallied against Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s decision to suspend Parliament until March 3.
Section six of the Indian Act, which deals with who is entitled to status, was judged by the B.C. Court of Appeals in 2009 to contravene the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Eldon Okanee of the Thunderchild First Nation spoke to the Saskatoon crowd about recent changes to the Indian Act and what they might mean for Canada’s aboriginal population.
Last Saturday in Saskatoon, amid signs of “Pierogies not Proroguing” and “King Stephen (The Last),” more ominous ones could be found,  bearing the slogan, “Let’s stop genocide in our country.”
According to protester Albert Angus of Thunderchild First Nation, the signs were intended to refer to the Indian Act and the “cultural genocide” it currently facilitates by tying registered Indian status to blood quantum.
Blood quantum refers to whether or not someone is eligible for Indian status depending on racial inheritance. The child of one aboriginal and one non-aboriginal parent is eligible for “registered” Indian status. However, if that person has a child with another non-aboriginal, that child will not be eligible for status.
“Since it’s been found that 50 per cent of our young people have children with one non-Indian as a parent,” Angus said. He explained that this would be “analogous to genocide” because there will be next to no Indians under the current Indian Act within three generations.
It is this provision that led to many First Nations protesters carrying signs asking to end the “genocide” in Canada. It is also this provision that was ruled unconstitutional.
The B.C. court suspended this ruling for one year until April 6, 2010, to allow the federal government to amend the law.
The Indian and Northern Affairs Canada web site reads, “The government intends to introduce legislation in early 2010 with the goal of having the proposed amendments in place by April 6, 2010.” But because the prorogation will set all parliamentary business back until March, this is unlikely to happen that soon.
This has caused consternation among Canada’s indigenous population.
In a recent media release, Chief Guy Lonechild of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations said, “There are serious issues that need to be dealt with in Parliament, including citizenship.”
Shawn Atleo, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, shares Lonechild’s sentiment. In a January 15 statement, he called on parliamentarians “to form a special legislative committee to examine the fundamental barriers inherent in the current Indian Act framework rather than focusing on issues in isolation.”
While politicians continue to duke it out in the national media over the issue of prorogation, many of Canada’s First Nations population wait for a change in the Indian Act that could strongly affect their lives.
“It may affect funding because they count Indians’ social services according to the Indian Act and when that’s in suspension, like now, it may not legally be possible for them to fund on a status quo basis,” Angus said. “People who live hand to mouth on these poor Indian communities, what are they going to do then?”

2010-02-11,McGill,India,"Scientists slam province for hazardous exports
Over 100 doctors and scientists from around the world have drafted a letter to Premier Jean Charest urging Quebec to stop the export of asbestos to developing nations. The letter was issued in late January, shortly before the premier left on a trade mission to India, the largest importer of Quebec-made asbestos.
The Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA), which sponsored the letter, cited statistics from Quebec that show that asbestos-related diseases remain a major threat to public health in the province.
“The Quebec Workers’ Compensation Board shows that 60 per cent of occupational deaths were caused by asbestos…. This gives a total of 612 new cases of asbestos-related disease in Quebec in 2004,” wrote CANSA in the letter.
Linda Reinstein, co-founder and executive director of the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization noted that the figures were inaccurately low. “Large numbers of deaths caused by asbestos-related cancers and cardiac arrest are not properly attributed to asbestos,” she said.
The majority of all asbestos produced in Quebec is exported to developing nations, where regulations on their usage are generally absent. “It’s sad to see workers in developing countries dying of preventable disease,” said Reinstein. “People in developing nations need money desperately, corporations take advantage of this, and workers end up working with asbestos in compromising conditions with no protection.”
According to the Canadian Press, Charest was questioned on the issue during a press conference in Delhi. He responded that his government has no control over asbestos exports.
Canada is the second largest producer and exporter of chrysotile asbestos in the world, and the majority of Canadian asbestos mines are located in Quebec. In 2002 Quebec’s Ministry of Natural Resources adopted a policy encouraging “municipalities to increase their use of products containing chrysotile.”
Kathleen Ruff of the Rideau Institute on International Affairs commented that asbestos use has, however, declined in the province.
“There is no legal ban. But except for in towns like Asbestos [Quebec] where asbestos is even used in pavement, there has been a large decrease in asbestos use. Quebec is removing asbestos from schools and workplaces, as once it is in place it is a problem for decades,” said Ruff.
The letter criticized Quebec for having a double standard toward asbestos exposure.
“We find it shocking that the exposure level you endorse for people overseas is 10 times higher than the level permitted by…other Western industrialized countries…. We applaud your government for seeking thus to protect Quebec workers from asbestos harm. We call on you to show equal concern for the lives of workers in the developing world” the letter read.
The industry, however, claims that if used properly, asbestos is not harmful. The Chrysotile Institute, founded in 1985, is a joint initiative by the federal government of Canada and the government of Quebec. According to Clément Godbout, the president of the institute, it “receives 60 per cent of its funding from the provincial and federal governments and the remaining 40 per cent from industry.”
Godbout also stressed that the institute’s mandate “is not to promote chrysotile itself, but merely to promote the safe and responsible usage of it.” The institute has said that chrysotile is safe for use if air contamination levels are kept below one fibre per cubic centimetre.
Godbout commented that a person working in an environment that maintains those standards, even over a long period of time, is subject to “a very low risk, certainly no more than that of the average worker in another industry.” To the anti-asbestos groups he said, “show us research that proves there is significantly high risk for our standard of one fibre per cubic centimetre. To my knowledge I haven’t seen any scientific reports or proof yet.”
In reference to the countries that import Quebec’s asbestos, Godbout said, “The information on safe use is available and we encourage them to use it. The small enterprises that don’t adhere to the safety standards should be shut down.”
In response to these claims, CANSA has stated in a press release, “The [World Health Organization]…and the fifty countries who have banned chrysotile asbestos, state that there is no safe exposure level for chrysotile asbestos.”
CANSA also stressed that the lack of awareness abroad is supported by the province’s attitude toward its use. They also criticized the asbestos industry for attempting to silence anti-asbestos science, citing various lawsuits and attempts at intimidation.
“The asbestos industry has tried to represent asbestos as a political issue of Quebec culture and pride,” said Ruff. She added that at the October 2006 UN Rotterdam Convention, Charest’s government successfully lobbied Canada to block the addition of chrysotile asbestos to the UN’s hazardous substances list.
McGill principal Heather Munroe-Blum accompanied Charest as part of his delegation. On February 6, Munroe-Blum and Charest presented at a high-profile sustainable development summit in Delhi.

2010-03-18,McGill,India,"Ruling permits commercial logging on land under investigation for title claim
On March 12, judge Caroline E. Brown will hear the Okanagan Indian Band’s (OKIB) application to appeal a February 1 order prohibiting their interference with commercial logging operations by Tolko Industries on contested land. The band alleges that the initial decision by the Supreme Court of B.C.  did not consider the irreparable harm that logging will cause to an ongoing investigation to determine the band’s title claims to the area.
The OKIB has taken all measures to prevent Tolko from initiating the project at Brown’s Creek Watershed near Vernon, B.C. – an area that supplies drinking and irrigation water for the 1,800 residents of the OKIB. Logging will also affect the headwaters of the Bouleau and Nashwito Creeks, disturbing the habitat of Okanagan fisheries.
The band has constructed a checkpoint on Westside Road and a blockade of the Bouleau Creek Forest Service Road. They also intend to file a complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Commission for the failure of government agencies to protect their water supply.
The Ministry of Transportation has challenged the blockade, claiming ownership of the roads,  – but OKIB chief Fabian Alexis has defended his band’s rights.
“We have a specific claim: the road runs through our land on our trails, and we haven’t been compensated. Our community is adamant that no commercial logging will take place in our territory anymore,” said Alexis.
He and other members of OKIB were issued a “cease and desist” letter by Tolko in October of last year.
The watershed has been legally disputed territory since 1999. Under economic pressure, the OKIB began harvesting trees for domestic use under a permit issued by the Okanagan Nation Alliance. When the province issued a stop-work order on these activities, the OKIB challenged its constitutionality in connection with ongoing title claims over the watershed.
According to Louise Mandell, a lawyer representing the OKIB, the litigation “challenges the province’s claim to 100 per cent ownership and jurisdiction in the absence of [a] treaty.”
“Tolko knew that the Brown’s Creek Area was before the court and about the conflict on the ground. Tolko went into it with its eyes wide open,” said Mandell.
Despite the ongoing case, B.C. granted Tolko Industries cutting permits in the disputed area. According to Alexis, the logging threatens the archaeological collection of aboriginal title evidence.
Tolko hired its own third party consultants to carry out archaeological investigation over the winter, which concluded on February 25.
Alexis asserted that the investigation disregarded adequate Okanagan involvement, as ordered by Brown.
“We have to first prove our existence, which is ridiculous. There is no bill of sale; we never sold this land. They are saying that there is no evidence of Indian people in higher mountain elevations, but how can you find trails under feet of snow?” said Alexis.
In a March 5 press release, Mark Tamas, Tolko Industries’ Okanagan Woodlands regional manager, described OKIB’s blockade as “in defiance of B.C. Supreme Court Orders…. Tolko has a court-issued injunction and enforcement order to allow access to our legally approved cutting permits.”
Will Koops, a coordinator for the B.C. Tap Water Alliance, a group that advocates for the protection of community water supply watersheds from resource use exploitation, has voiced support for the OKIB. Skeptical of any B.C. court decisions, he argued that in the ‘60s, the attorney general’s department began systematically acting for corporate interests.
“In whose interest does the provincial government act? On behalf of the companies. There is no legal mechanism that looks at both the companies’ and indigenous and non-indigenous public interest. This means unequal representation to the courts,” he said.
The majority of watersheds in B.C. were protected until 1962, when the Social Credit government moved to protect them from commercial logging.
“The province has been granting tenure to companies for decades without honouring First Nations, and the forestry is not sustainable,” said Koops.
Alexis also commented on the fact that most B.C. First Nations have never formally ceded their territory. “The government presents a facade of trying to recognize rights, but meanwhile nothing is happening. If anything, our rights are being lessened.”

2010-03-18,McGill,India,"Community raises funds for relief efforts in Concepción
Since last month’s massive earthquake in central Chile, the Associación de Chilenos de Québec (ACHQ) has spearheaded the effort to connect Montrealers with their friends and families in the affected region, and has coordinated a number of relief efforts.
“We had to be creative,” said ACHQ vice president Ledda Urbani in Spanish. “There were people who still had some access to the Internet, so we had to form a chain of communication from which the details could flow little by little.”
Contact with the area has been difficult due to the breakdown of electricity, telephone lines, and road networks since the earthquake rocked Chile in the early morning of February 27.
Measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale, the three-minute earthquake was the seventh strongest ever recorded, and the strongest since 2004’s Indian Ocean earthquake. It has caused widespread devastation in the country’s second largest city, Concepción, and the surrounding area. The number of confirmed deaths currently stands at over 700.
Urbani said the most important problem is currently reconstruction, as “500,000 houses have been destroyed and two million people  [have been] left without a roof.”
ACHQ has planned a series of events ranging from folklore shows to club nights to fund Chile’s National Office for Emergencies and the Chilean Red Cross.
“The volume of the damage has left people without jobs, schools, or health services,” said Urbani.
Nicole Collier, a U1 Sociology student at McGill who has lived in Chile with her family since 2005, was in a suburb of Santiago during and after the earthquake. She described the situation as surreal, stating that although “most of the damage was in [Concepción], there were clues of destruction everywhere: broken light bulbs, cracks in the pavement.”
Collier described a trip to the supermarket the following day as “a typical end-of-the-world movie scene where everyone is running for supplies.”
Chilean president Michelle Bachelet declared a state of emergency in response to the quake, which was followed by a series of aftershocks and a tsunami warning for much of the Pacific coast.
Nelson Odeja, president of ACHQ, said that Bachelet handled the situation responsibly and competently. “Things are much better, though there are still problems at the epicentre” said Odeja in Spanish. “Not of a lack of [basic goods], but problems of sheer destruction, problems of getting things to those who need them.”
He extended deep thanks to the Quebec community for the support it has given the organization, while calling attention to the ongoing aftermath of Haiti’s earthquake earlier this year. “We need to harmonize coordination; this isn’t about absorbing or polarizing attention from Haiti.”
Odeja added that Chile is well-prepared for such natural disasters, partly due to their frequency.
Rex Brynen, a professor in McGill’s political science department, stated in an email that “there will be major long-term reconstruction costs, but Chile’s relatively high gross national product per capita means that it wouldn’t qualify for assistance from many aid agencies.”
Brynen added that “the impact of natural disasters is always shaped not only by the disaster itself but the social, political, and economic context within which it occurs.”
According to NASA, Chile’s earthquake shortened the day by approximately one-millionth of a second, and shifted the earth’s axis by eight centimetres.

2010-03-18,McGill,India,"Community programs cut despite $65.9 million in federal budget for aboriginal health
The 2010 federal budget  has cancelled funding to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF), a national non-profit that finances 134 aboriginal support services across the country. Funding for the community-based programs will come to an end on March 31, when available funds are expected to run out.
On Sunday, the Native Women’s Shelter of Montreal (NWSM) held a policy meeting with Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff to call on the federal government to reinstate its support for the AHF. The shelter depends on the AHF for funding.
“We have been receiving funds from the AHF for the last 10 years, and it goes toward our healing program, and the basics, a roof over the head and food to eat…A lot of people [are] out of work, and we are going to be grasping at straws now to try to meet the needs of the women,” said Nakuset, the shelter’s executive director.
Nakuset also said that the shelter will now have to cut the positions of sexual assault counsellor, program coordinator, and clinical supervisor.
“It is quite devastating; we have an art therapist that comes in on a weekly basis, a psychologist, and psychotherapist who is Mohawk. People over the last decade have come to depend on our services for more than just the basics,” Nakuset added.
Women community leaders from across Montreal, Ignatieff, and Liberal MP Justin Trudeau attended the policy meeting to express their support for the shelter and AHF.
“At the moment when aboriginal women and aboriginal families are under maximum pressure, increased pressure in an economic downturn, it is the worst possible time to cut funding to these healing centres that provide so much good,” said Ignatieff.
He added that working with the Conservative government is extremely different, and that co-operation on its part is the exception, not the rule.
“These groups depend on public money. We don’t think it’s appropriate for them to have to go begging to private sources…. We think these institutions perform public services; they protect women, they shelter women, they help women, and they deserve public support,” added Ignatieff.
According to Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs spokesperson Margot Geduld, the federal government has allocated $65.9 million over two years for aboriginal health programs to be distributed by Health Canada. The federal budget also allocates $199 million for the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.
The federal program provides former residential school students with a lump sum payment of $10,000 for the first school year plus $3,000 for each subsequent year they spent in the residential school system. Students who suffered serious physical and sexual abuses may apply for additional compensation.
Geduld would not comment on why funding to the AHF was not renewed this year, though she thanked the foundation for providing support to aboriginal peoples and said that officials had met with the AHF to discuss moving forward.
Terri Normandin, the shelter’s sexual assault counsellor, said that the federal budget did not specify how the allocated funds would be distributed, and that it remained unclear whether existing programs would receive any support.
She added that she was surprised that the funding was cut considering the magnitude of the trauma caused by the residential school system.
“It may be from the past, but when you look at the social issues we are dealing with, we have a loss of cultural identity, poor self esteem, a lot of health issues, addiction, a lot of domestic violence. The whole thing is inter-generational trauma…years and years of habits that we were starting to help with, issues that are not laid to rest,” said Normandin.
The NWSM sent an open letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper Tuesday to demand the renewal of funds for the AHF.
AHF communications director Wayne Spear said the foundation is prepared to support the transition of 11 healing centres and other programs.
“We will continue to inform the government of the work we are doing and our research and experience. We’ve been clear that there is five years of truth and reconciliation work, mental health counselling, and support for survivors that are needed. We’ve also said that there are a lot of unreached communities, and that communities with service are still early on in this work,” said Spear.

2010-03-20,McGill,India,"Loss of federal and provincial funding could push institution toward insolvency
Amid accusations of financial irregularities and mismanagement, the federal government announced last week that it will not reverse a decision to cut $7.2 million in funding from the First Nations University of Canada (FNUC).
Combined with the $ 5.2-million loss in funding from the Saskatchewan government that was announced in February, this decision could mean that the university is headed for insolvency.
The government made the announcement in spite of the recent decision of the FNUC and its owner, the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN), to address the government’s concerns by transferring control of the university to the University of Regina and establishing a new board of governors.
“The [federal] government claims that the university has not managed its funds appropriately and has not taken the action recommended to address the issue,” said Jean Crowder, the NDP’s critic for aboriginal affairs.
“However, what I know from meeting with both the Canadian Association of University Teachers, with somebody from the Board of Governors, with the grand chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, with someone from the student union, from the faculty association, is that they have presented a plan to the government to address the issues, and the government really has had no conversation with them about this,” said Crowder.
FNUC’s finances have long been under scrutiny, and in a press release Indian affairs minister Chuck Strahl attributed the federal funding cuts to “long-standing, systemic problems related to governance and financial management.”
Critics of the university have alleged that it is not independent enough from the FSIN, and in both 2007 and 2008 it ran deficits of over $1 million. Rumours of unnecessary business trips to Hawaii and Las Vegas have been circulating, and most recently, Saskatchewan’s ministry of justice launched an investigation into whether $390,000 of a scholarship fund was mishandled.
Randy Lundy, who heads FNUC’s faculty council, compared the funding cuts to the residential school system.
“After having issued an apology for [the residential school] legacy, minister Strahl is enacting yet another policy of enforced assimilation by refusing to restore the $7.2 million in funding to the First Nations University of Canada,” Lundy said at a press conference on March 11.
The funding cuts precede a financial audit of the university, which is expected to be finished by the end of this month.
“The federal government has announced that they need to save money, and they are looking at all kinds of opportunities to cut programs or services. This would fall in line with that,” said Crowder.
“The provincial government has signaled that they would be prepared to come to the table if the federal government would,” said Crowder on March 15.
However, a meeting between Saskatchewan advanced education minister Rob Norris and Strahl the following day did not yield any sort of deal, and both governments’ previous promises to end funding by April 1 remained.
FNUC is the only university of its kind in Canada, and it offers an opportunity for First Nations students to study in a culturally supportive environment.
“First Nations have had such a terrible experience through residential schools,” Crowder explained. “What the First Nations University does is provide an avenue for students to get culturally appropriate education. There’s a lot more support around tradition and language… that makes it easier for students to return, to come to school.”

2010-04-09,McGill,India,"The Daily talks to Salman Rushdie about some of his major influences and political views
British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie spoke about the role of literature in the public and private sphere, and several other topics at a free event hosted by SSMU on Friday evening. Rushdie is the author of several novels which tackle themes from the partition of India to the immigrant experience in Britain. He won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was knighted for his literary achievements in 2008, but may be best known for receiving a fatwa ordering his death from Ayatollah Khomeinei of Iran in 1989 for his novel The Satanic Verses. The Daily was able to sit down with him for a few minutes after his talk.
McGill Daily: The Master and Margarita is said to have a large influence on you. One of the quotes associated with you from the novel is the idea that “manuscripts don’t burn.”
Salman Rushdie: It’s very strange, I think, in retrospect the way in which the story of Bulgakov’s novel has come to echo what happened to The Satanic Verses. That novel was also banned and ridiculed, and really didn’t even exist in a full Russian version until more or less the fall of communism. It’s really quite extraordinary that the books should have those parallel lives.
And then of course [The Master and Margarita] contains the question of destroying the text. In that case, of course, the text [in the book] is destroyed by the author, the Master himself. He doesn’t like his creation, and the Devil is the one who is shocked by the idea that he should try to destroy the book. It’s the Devil that says “Manuscripts don’t burn.” I’ve always thought it’s a very beautiful line, because what it means, of course, is that ideas are imperishable. There’s a line like it in a great play by Swiss playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt, a play called “The Physicist,” in which one of the characters says, “What has once been thought cannot be un-thought.” I think that’s true and I think Bulgakov knew that was true.
MD: Another Bulgakov quip associated with you is that “Books survive, writers don’t.” Clearly you’ve survived, but 38 people associated with The Satanic Verses did not, or received death threats.
SR: There were all kinds of people who were attacked. It was a terrible time and I think that the courage with which publishers and booksellers withstood these threats has never been given enough credit. Really, this was a battle fought by ordinary people. It was not fought by great public figures…. [There were] other attacks of bookstores around the world, and attacks on people connected with the publication – at least one of whom was sadly murdered, which was the book’s Japanese translator.
MD: A major theme in The Satanic Verses is a “critique of the closed, and absolute belief system.” In your 20 years since writing it, how have you seen “closed and absolute systems” change or evolve, either politically or religiously?
SR: Well, I think there is more now about than there was then. It’s easy to say that that’s something that’s been happening in the Islamic world, and it has. But it’s also been happening in the extremes of North American Christianity. And more depressing, I’ve just come back from India, and it’s quite clear there’s a growth of sectarian extremism in India. It’s not just in Islam but in Hinduism as well: a kind of intolerance and censoriousness which was never characteristic of Hinduism.
MD: Why do you think that is?
SR: Everybody wants to get in on the act. What happens is people see it working for one community and they think they want some of that too. I’ve always thought one of the things about extremism, of which the extreme form is terrorism, is that there is a kind of glamour about it. It makes otherwise unimportant lives feel momentarily important.
MD: In your talk, you discussed a tendency in Britain to “define yourself by your rage” in identity politics. Have you seen that to be true in North America or Canada?
SR: Well, I think it’s true worldwide, actually. People seem to be defining themselves by what they are against, whereas, I come from [another] generation. There is much to be said about the ’60s which is critical, because it was a kind of nonsensical time. But the one thing that was true about it is that people tended to define themselves by what they were for, and not what they were against. And that seems like a much more constructive way to lead a life. This kind of definition by negatives… damages the soul.
MD: You said the way we relate to narratives, or who has control of them determines the level of freedom in the world. Conversely, you talked about the disintegration of journalism. Do you see those things as related?
SR: Yes, absolutely. I think that what journalists do is one of the most valuable things in a free society. And it’s dangerous. If you look at the Iraq war, this is a war where more journalists have been killed than in any war ever before. It’s getting more dangerous to do this job properly…. And it will enormously diminish the quality of life in any society if that job can’t be done properly.
I think there is very good reason to think that’s going to happen. Because what happens in a moment of great change is that there are interregnums. I’m sure that at another point in the future there will be electronic news media that will be able to fulfill the role that the print media have done. The problem is what happens if there is twenty years in between.
MD: In 2006 you signed a manifesto with several other writers against religious extremism, and have spoken about the need to reform Islam. Can you discuss that?
SR: I think there’s no need to reform Islam itself as the need to reform Islamic society, because religion is religion. If religion is a private matter, then it’s nobody’s business but the person’s whose feelings are like that. It’s when religion becomes the basis for social and political organization, then that’s when you have to look at it. I think almost always, almost everywhere that that has happened, it has been, to put it mildly, a very conservative force, and often an oppressive force. It’s that aspect of it that needs reform.
I do think it’s very regrettable that within Muslim culture it is very difficult to historicize the study of Islam. I think a great deal would result from being able to look at the birth of this religion as an event inside history rather than some kind of supernatural event. I think it’s very important that attitudes towards women change; that attitudes towards sexual minorities change. I think it’s very important that people be allowed to speak more freely.
I think I’m right in saying that there is no Arabic speaking country now in which The Arabian Nights can be published in an un-explicated edition. The greatest, greatest work of fiction to be generated by the Arab world has to be censored to have all the naughty bits taken out. The Arabian Nights is an interesting book in that it’s really very low on religion and very high on sexual shenanigans, and that means that this great book is in very Bowdlerized editions. And that seems indicative of a problem.

2010-04-12,McGill,India,"Ottawa sit-in ends in arrests, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada cites security concerns
Six non-native women protesting the recent discontinuation of federal funding to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF) were arrested in Ottawa on March 29, approximately one hour into a sit-in at Indian Affairs minister Chuck Strahl’s office.
The protest was organized to express solidarity with the AHF, which funds the work of 134 community-based aboriginal support services that aid survivors of Canada’s residential school system. The organization began in 1998 with a $350-million grant from the federal government. However, the 2010 federal budget did not renew funding.
According to protester Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, once the police arrived, the women were given 30 seconds to either leave or be arrested.
“I asked them if we could have 60 seconds, if we could have a minute to discuss this, and they said, ‘No – 30 seconds,’” she said.
“What was surprising was how quickly it escalated. Normally, at least as far as I know, the police have protocols where they escalate fairly slowly, and it usually lasts several hours,” Rolbin-Ghanie continued.
Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) spokesperson Margot Geduld said that the women were arrested because of a “security consideration.”
But Marc Menard, spokesperson for the national capital division of the RCMP, would not comment on whether or not security had been a concern. He said, however, that the women were ticketed for trespassing.
The decision to cut AHF’s funding has been met with widespread “disbelief and shock,” according to AHF communications director Wayne Spear.
“We had no guarantee that we’d get additional funding beyond March, but since there aren’t many services available in aboriginal communities people were quite upset that these services would be disappearing,” he added.
Funding was not renewed despite an INAC-commissioned evaluation of the organization that was overwhelmingly positive. The evaluation found that “the healing is gaining momentum, but that in relation to the existing and growing need the healing ‘has just begun;’ project reports and interview results indicate a high level of continued need for healing according to an array of negative social indicators attributed to [residential school] trauma.”
The evaluation went on to say that “that there are few if any viable alternatives to achieve the positive healing outcomes the AHF has been able to achieve with such a degree of success.”
According to Geduld, the 2010 allocated budget $199 million over two years “to ensure that survivors [of residential schools] continue their important path to healing.”
“Certainly Health Canada will continue to work closely with the aboriginal communities,” she continued.
Health Canada will receive $65.9 million over two years for the Indian Residential Schools Resolution Health Support program, an existing Health Canada program, according to Paul Duchesne, director of Health Canada’s Media Monitoring Unit.
The remaining $133.2 million will go toward the Independent Assessment Process (IAP) and the Common Experience Payment (CEP). Both the IAP and CEP programs award money to residential school survivors as part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.
But critics worry that operating programs through government agencies rather than community-based groups will have detrimental effects on residential school survivors. “There’s been a history in Canada of aboriginal people having solutions brought in from outside, depending on government, being dependent on these resources,” said Spear. “[With the AHF] we had examples of people being self-sufficient and taking control of their own well-being. It was successful, all the research said it was doing good work, but [the government] is not going to encourage that any longer. It should be clear to anyone who’s looked into it that this is a step backward,” he continued.
The loss of AHF funding is just one in a recent series of federal funding cuts to aboriginal organizations. Federal funding of $7.2 million was withdrawn from First Nations University of Canada earlier this year. Sisters in Spirit, a national project that addressed violence against indigenous women and raised awareness about the issue, also lost its funding in the 2010 budget.
“It seems to me that there’s a broader phenomenon going on here,” said Rolbin-Ghanie. “The people who are actually doing the on-the-ground work are no longer being funded.”
Geduld, however, refused to draw a connection between the recent funding cuts.
“[These are issues] that have been in the media recently, but there’s really not a link between them at all. I don’t even see how you can link them,” she said.

2010-10-25,McGill,India,"Tuesday: Global prospects
Last Tuesday, October 19, McGill hosted a Public Lecture Forum as part of its Third Annual Conference on Global Food Security.  The event featured David Nabarro, the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Representative on Food Security and Nutrition and Beverly Oda, the Canadian Minister for International Relations. The forum also marked the official launch of the McGill Institute for Global Food Security.
Daniel Jutras, Dean of the Faculty of Law, began the conference by welcoming the establishment of the new institute that would help tackle “one of the key dimensions of our collective future.”
Nabarro was “delighted that McGill is taking leadership on an issue of such importance,” adding that “we can’t move forward on food security without the combination of natural and social science research.”
He said food security should encapsulate not only universal access but also “access to nutritional food within a sustainable environment.” Because of this, any approach will require governments and communities to come together in a manner that is interdisciplinary. He continuously emphasized the importance of trade but stated that community and small stakeholder involvement is integral to any sustainable approach.  “[This] approach,” he said, “puts people at the centre, not production.”
Oda discussed the Canadian International Development Assoc-iation’s (CIDA) belief that women are key when discussing food security. “Women are the guardians to nutrition,” she said. “Small farmers are the backbone of the rural economy and the majority of these farmers are women.”
Food Security is at the heart of the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDG). “Unless we make sure that people, and not production, are placed at the centre of our goals, we risk a very embarrassing miss come the MDG 2015 deadline,” said Nabarro.
McGill hopes that its new institute will be well placed to help bring an end to food insecurity worldwide.

Wednesday: Water management
One of Wednesday’s panel discussions included representatives from Indian, Chinese, and Costa Rican institutions. The question and answer period was sometimes tense because of the disagreement that members of the audience had with India and China’s practices regarding water management.
M. Gopalakrishnan, Secretary General of the Indian International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage started off the talks by explaining the current and future situation of India.
“Extreme conditions are becoming a yearly phenomenon,” said Gopalakrishnan. “India has to learn to live with water scarcity.” he maintained that 27 per cent of the world’s undernourished are Indians, and that thus far government intervention has failed to redistribute wealth to the rural poor. However, he concluded that India may see sustainability of food production and water management by learning from “success stories.”
Zhanyi Gao, director of China’s National Centre for Efficient Irrigation Technology Research, talked about how China will respond to its foreseeable problems, involving mostly technological innovations – like building thousands of reservoirs and implementing drip irrigation systems. For China, it will be a difficult task to manage demand for food and water, as China’s population will reach 1.5 billion by 2030. With rapid development of urbanization, and there will be an increase in water competition between industry, domestic use, and agriculture.
José Joaquín Campos, the Director General of the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center in Costa Rica viewed socio-ecological rural systems not as problems of technology, as the two previous speakers had done, but as “interconnected, complex, and dynamic.” Campos stated that “both social and ecological resilience is key for local and sustainable development, [since] seventy per cent of poor live in rural areas.” Campos also stressed the importance of social responsibility and equity, which could be achieved through local “collective action.”
In the question and answer session, one audience member questioned China’s research in food diversity and resilience. Another doubted that China could solve its problems through its increase in damming and water reservoirs, especially because global warming will make such water storage facilities unsustainable because of increased evaporation.

Thursday: Response of international  agencies
Day three of the conference brought together four representatives from various international development agencies. They evaluated the different strategies used to deal with the 2008 food price crisis, and highlighted future areas of focus for improving agricultural productivity.
The panel acknowledged the importance of empowering small-scale agriculturalists, who are responsible for eighty per cent of the food production in developing countries, yet constitute fifty per cent of the worlds malnourished people.
The panel suggested helping these farmers to expand their enterprises by improving market access and scaling up their businesses. The panel said that because the world faces unprecedented population growth and a subsequent strain on global food resources, there was even more urgency to help small-scale farmers.
Rebekah Young, from the Canadian Department of Finance, cited innovative technologies as a means of accomplishing this, charging the private sector with the responsibility of funding research and development initiatives.
Meanwhile, Cheryl Morden of the International Fund of Agricultural Development (IFAD) discussed tailoring agricultural solutions to the specific ecological and economic needs of small-scale agriculturalists. Calling the population “a huge untapped potential for meeting the increasing global demand for food fuel and fibre,” she advocated for their direct involvement in the planning, development and decision-making processes, as well as the increased involvement of traditionally marginalized groups, namely women, youth ,and indigenous peoples.
The need for sustainability in any proposed solution was also heavily emphasized, despite the fact that governments tend to favour short-term solutions with immediately tangible results.
“Everyone wants results; not because they’re perverse, but because they’re out of business themselves if they can’t show results,” said Carlos Delgado, Strategy and Policy Adviser for the Agriculture and Rural Development Department of the World Bank.
Florence Rolle of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed a combination of short-term solutions, directed at consumers, and long-term solutions. She gave the example of Ethiopia, where immediate government responses such as subsidies were paired with time-intensive solutions, such as the preparation of a five-year development plan.

2010-11-15,McGill,India,"State of emergency declared October 21 in isolated Ontario community
Chief Lewis Nate of the Eabametoong First Nation (pronounced Yab-mAh-tung) was tired during his interview with The Daily, because there had been another fire in his community the night before. On October 21, he declared the Eabametoong – which has a population of 1,200 and is one of 28 remote fly-in communities in northern Ontario – to be in a state of emergency.
“It kind of escalated, the last two homicides that we had…also the amount of drugs that [are] coming into our community,” Nate said in describing the situation before October 21. “It’s compounding into one big problem. It’s not something that happened overnight…but it was just too much to handle – we’re a small community.”
“Right now it’s pretty hard to work when you’re numb from all this stuff and it’s hard to get motivated,” Nate continued.
“We didn’t only have these two homicides, we’ve had 13 deaths in the last eleven months. If you have one death…that’s hard, but when you’re having a lot of deaths, you know, that’s really, really hard…You’ll get numb.”
According to Sergeant Jackie George of the Nishnawabe-Aski Police Services (NAPS), the problem of prescription drug abuse in Eabametoong has been noticeably increasing for the last five years. But in the view of Denise Fontaine, principal of John C. Yesno Education Centre – which teaches 336 Junior Kindergaten to Grade nine students and was the site of an arson in late September – the events prompting the declaration of emergency occurred suddenly.
“In a very short time…[people] just started acting out, and I really do believe it was displaced anger [and] frustration – [there is] no safe outlet for expressing frustration and anger…[so] that expression of anger trickles down to others you didn’t intend,” said Fontaine.
State of emergency
The arson of John C. Yesno resulted in the school’s closure for three and a half weeks along with $200,000 worth of smoke and water damage. The arson was bookended by two murders of local youth. Other recent incidents include the fire-bombing of a church minister’s house while five people were inside.
 “It seems to be the perfect storm…all of the conditions that already existed that are compelling, complex and dire are boiling over in this community,” said Nanda Casucci-Byrne, Chief of Staff in the Ontario Lieutenant Governor’s Office.
Casucci-Byrne added that in her eight years at the Lieutenant Governor’s office she had never before heard of a community declaring a state of emergency.
Nate explained the process behind his declaration: “We were having conference calls before that…to see how we could get help, but that wasn’t going anywhere, so that’s we decided…we had enough of talk we wanted to bring it to light- admit that we have a problem.”
In response to the declaration of emergency, Eabametoong received two Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officers to help the five currently policing the community. One OPP officer stayed for two days; the second officer is estimated to remain in the community for up to five weeks.
“It’s short-term assistance for our police service,” said George. “The Nishnawabe-Aski Police Service, we have jurisdiction there. We have five members there but we need [to] double that. And we can’t double it because the federal and provincial bodies are not coming to the [negotiating] table.”
“[The OPP officers] accompany local officers during their shifts, they just ride together and learn from each other,” said Band Administrator Andrew Yesno.
Yesno also noted that the OPP officers help maintain 24-hour policing, “whereas before we had officers work from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and then 6 p.m. to 4 a.m. And then there was always a gap between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. where there was no police.”
Response to the crisis
After Eabametoong’s declaration prominent vistors flooded the community. Chris Bentley, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, was among them. So was Ruth Ann Onley, wife of Ontario’s Lieutenant Governor David Onley, who came with Sharon Johnston, Governor General David Johnston’s wife.
Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) and Health Canada officials visited the community on November 5, and Greg Rickford, MP for Kenora, the local riding, visited last week.
Rickford acknowledged that structural issues were behind the recent violence. “It’s the underlying issues that give rise to [these acts] that we are ultimately interested in,” he said.
“There’s been a lot of response from people in Canada to help,” Yesno said.
“We want to be there on a personal basis…it means a great deal to express our support on a tangible basis,” Casucci-Byrne said. “[The visit was] trying to let them know that people care, that they’re not forgotten, that others are listening.”
However, some are still pessimistic about Eabametoong’s position. Nate recalled seeing a headline in the Toronto Sun that read “Fort Hopeless” (Fort Hope is another name for Eabametoong First Nation).
“Now what kind of message is that to the people? We’re not hopeless,” Nate said, “I’d rather be here than any place else in the world.”
He is not taking the derision to heart, though. “You’ll always get that negativity no matter what,” he noted. “Anytime you want to make a change people will act negatively.”
In an email to The Daily, INAC Communications Officer Peter Sero said the ministry was committed to investing $400,000 in Eabametoong.
“[Funds will] help because we don’t budget for crises like homicides,” Yesno explained. “We get a limited amount of funds every year and what we do is we create a budget and make sure that we still get …[all the] basic things to make a town run, but we don’t really budget for emergencies or for having to charter for counselors to come in or trauma units.”
Going forward
Yesno said that money originally allocated for services such as water, sewage, and road clearing has been spent on combating various crises the community has faced. Nate said that up $174,000 of the band’s funds have been spent in order to deal with the recent string of emergencies.
Some in the community are skeptical that the INAC funding will make a dent in Eabametoong’s problems.
“Nobody believes in long-term plans – they say they do but they don’t supply funding for long-term projects,” Fontaine said. “There’s a fictional belief that Aboriginal communities get whatever they ask for.”
“We’re not looking for the quick fix, we’re looking for sustainability… Our kids need opportunities that they don’t get, that are easily available outside of a fly-in community,” Fontaine continued, referring to benefits students could have from external professionals leading workshops.
“We’re not just asking for money, we’re also asking for the resources … I think that’s one of the big misconceptions out there that we’re just asking for money but that’s not the reality,” added Yesno. “We want the professional help to come and help us, and to help us turn this around.”
 Nate sees a bigger dilemma facing his community. “I think the number one [is] going back to the land. [There are] two things that we [have] lost: one is the connection to the Creator, and the second was the connection to our homeland, to the traditional area,” he said.
Nate outlined a seven-point community development plan that has been forged through ongoing discussions between members of the council and community members.
“We’re meeting with the people, especially our elders and youth because they’re the forgotten lot,” Nate said. “We haven’t really had contact with them over the years…we’re kind of losing touch with them. The engagement with the seven-point plan [and] the ownership will come from them. If it’s going to work, its going to have to come from them, not the chief and council.”
Nate and Fontaine emphasized that internalized tension and emotions are a factor in the outbursts they have seen this year.
“Things have been happening over the years and a lot of internal stuff too that needs to be dealt with,” Nate said. “There are some things maybe that are uncomfortable, things that will come out. So I’ve got to walk that fine line too, I’m offending some community members because of this…because you know the truth hurts: that is the bottom line.”
“We have to start talking life into our community,” Nate continued.
“All we’ve been talking about is this person’s dead or this prescription drug issue and so forth, we’ve got to start talking about other things – about the future that lies ahead.”

2011-01-13,McGill,India,"Customer focus turning the program into one of SSMU’s key revenue sources
An ongoing eighteen-month revamp of SSMU’s Mini Courses has turned the program into one of SSMU’s most profitable and popular operations.
Mini Courses – semester-long, publicly available evening classes in subjects as diverse as Japanese language, sketch, and Caribbean cooking – more than doubled its profits in the 2009-2010 school year and continues to generate strong profits in 2011. The courses have also drawn the attention of organizations outside McGill, including businesses wishing to subsidize Arabic language or public speaking training for their employees.
Mini Courses Supervisor Nell Slochowski, who took charge in the fall 2009, has overseen an ongoing Mini Courses overhaul that has included implementation of online registration, reassessment of course profitability, and greater variety in Mini Courses’ offerings.
“We’ve gone out [and] found new teachers for unique courses, changed prices around, and improved the website significantly,” Slochowski said of the improvements.
Slochowski also credits the increased interest in Mini Courses to the program’s higher focus on customer satisfaction. The Mini Courses team audits courses and solicits student feedback throughout the entire semester.
“We are on top of our teachers and we keep notes on everything,” Slochowski said. “There’s a lot of commitment to making Mini Courses better.”
Mini Courses sources both professional and student teachers in an effort to balance profitability, student involvement, and course quality. Slochowski has also sought to integrate Mini Courses with other McGill clubs, both to find knowledgeable teachers and to potentially provide the clubs themselves with a new revenue stream.
Surbhi Gupta, a U2 Engineering student who taught Indian cooking during the Fall 2010 semester, found the teaching process daunting at first but ultimately rewarding.
“I’ve never taught such a huge group, so it was a little bit of a challenge,” Gupta said. “[But] I thought it would be a good idea to expose students to all of the varieties of Indian food…and it was a very good experience.”
The Mini Courses team’s methodology has been accompanied by dramatic profit increases. Mini Courses revenue represented 18.7 per cent of SSMU’s Building operations revenue during the 2010 school year, up from 10.2 per cent the previous year. In March of last year, former SSMU VP Finance and Operations Jose Diaz cited Mini Courses’ profitability as a key factor in the balancing of SSMU’s budget.
Although some of the improvements have resulted in operational snarls – including traffic-based stalls in the online registration and the cancellation of courses with low registration, such as LSAT Practice and Ukrainian for beginners – Mini Courses saw almost as much profit this fall as the 2009 school year’s fall and winter semesters combined. Slochowski stressed, however, that even as profitability climbs, the focus remains on student satisfaction.
“It would be easy to let profit be the driving force behind all we do,” said Slochowski. “[But] I think we’ve really kept a sense of ‘customer comes first.’”

2011-01-22,McGill,India,"New enrolment plan set to change recruitment priorities, deregulate international tuition rates
An unprecedented plan to manage McGill’s student enrolment for the next decade is currently circulating through the various forums that create University policy, and will be presented to Senate for approval March 23.
The Strategic Enrolment Management (SEM) plan outlines a broad tactical approach to enrolment management for the University – including increased recruitment of graduate and international students – from now up until 2016.
Morton Mendelson, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), described the plan as something that “aligns our broad objectives with respect to enrolment at McGill, and our goals under each of those objectives.”
“An Enrolment Management plan is something that many universities have. We’ve had objectives defined, but not in as much detail and not as coherently as will appear in this plan. So that’s one of the things that was missing,” said Mendelson.
Strategically targeting empty seats
One of the “fundamental goals” targeted in the consultation draft of the SEM plan includes “increases targeted in specific programs,” yet Mendelson emphasized that the SEM plan does not strictly focus on enrolment numbers. When asked which programs were targeted for increases in enrolment, Mendelson answered, “It’s not that kind of a plan.”
“It’s not just about numbers. Enrolment management is essentially about the students’ experience, and it’s about the University’s transaction with students from the time they first visit our website to explore the idea of applying to McGill, through…their transactions with the University when they’re here, and then beyond when they’re alumni,” he said.
Mendelson identified programs in the Faculty of Engineering – such as the Department of Mining and Materials – and those at Macdonald Campus as programs that could be targeted for increases.
“This kind of thinking is very specific to specific programs here and there across the University,” said Mendelson.
Another program that could see increased enrolment is the School of Computer Science. When asked whether Computer Science was targeted for enrolment increases, Gregory Dudek, Director of the School, answered that “it looks like it.” Dudek, however, attributed such forecast increases to exterior influences, as opposed to a specific McGill agenda.
Dudek said the dot-com crash around the year 2000 led to a sharp decrease in Computer Science enrolment, so that now, as a result, the department has more room to accommodate increases.
“Threats”
The SEM plan identifies various “threats” to McGill’s enrolment aspirations, including escalating competition and McGill’s “Research Profile.” Mendelson described these threats as possible competition from other universities, and that of McGill not fulfilling its own high standards.
The SEM plan reads that “we must be mindful of threats to our reputation.”
“McGill was the most research-intensive university in Canada, but that’s no longer the case. So that’s a threat to our reputation,” said Mendelson.
“We are striving to be as student-centred as possible, but we’re not there yet, obviously,” continued Mendelson. “The degree to which students evaluate the University – as not providing as positive an undergraduate experience as they would like, for example – is a threat to our reputation.”
Mendelson also pointed out that McGill has been putting less effort into the recruitment of American high school students in recent years, saying that “complacency” with this constituted yet another threat to McGill’s reputation.
“In a recent survey – recent market research in the U.S. – we’ve learned that most U.S. high school students haven’t heard about McGill,” said Mendelson. “So the quality of the reputation, and just having McGill front-of-mind, is something that we can’t be complacent about. We can’t assume that that’s the case,” he continued.
In order to neutralize some of these threats, the draft consultation SEM plan prescribed various solutions, including shifting the University’s recruitment focus to the southern and western United States – where the university-aged population is expected to grow – and to Colorado, where the SEM plan says “the nation’s best students (approximated by SAT scores)” are, as well as developing relations with “the strongest students” by grade ten.
Deregulating diversity

A central goal of the SEM plan is increased international student enrolment, particularly from countries like India and China. The consultation draft of the SEM plan describes McGill’s desire to increase the overall international student body to approximately 22 per cent of all McGill students by 2016, possibly to offset an anticipated decline in Quebec student enrolment.
According to the consultation draft, “Statistics Canada data suggest that there will be a peak in enrolment in postsecondary institutions in Quebec in 2009-10, which should then be maintained for the following four years, prior to a steep decline, bottoming out in 2025-26.”
Total McGill enrolment is projected to decline 6.9 per cent from 2013 to 2022, while enrolment in all Quebec universities is projected to decline 9.2 per cent over roughly the same period.
The SEM draft notes that competition for students from these countries will increase due to the “improvement in the educational systems of former ‘sending countries’ (e.g. China).” The SEM plan projects that China and India alone will generate over half the global demand in international higher education by 2025.
In order to tap into this swelling reservoir of students, McGill has begun a number of international recruitment schemes. Mendelson said that McGill often participates in joint missions abroad with other Quebec universities as well as with the Quebec and federal governments.
“I myself, for example, was in India a number of years ago, on the Quebec mission,” said Mendelson.
McGill also carries its own independent missions abroad, according to Mendelson, including having faculty and graduate students pitch the University to potential students while they are either back in their home country or attending conferences.
“Our goals and our business is not one hundred per cent aligned necessarily with all the other universities. So it’s a mix of participating, lending our support to efforts that can benefit all universities in Quebec…and at the same time advancing our own interests,” said Mendelson.
In the same breath as it advocates for an increase in the international student population, the draft consultation SEM plan aims to “pursue the deregulation of tuition for international undergraduate students.”
When the Quebec government set international tuition, that revenue was taken by the government and redistributed throughout all Quebec universities.
“The money that international students paid for tuition to come to McGill did not stay in McGill,” said Mendelson.
In 2008, Quebec deregulated international tuition for six disciplines, of which McGill has four – Law, Engineering, Management, and Science – and allows McGill to keep all of that tuition money. According to Mendelson, thirty per cent of net revenue derived from tuition is going to student aid.
“That is important because it means that our students can get the benefit of the tuition they’re actually paying, and it’s important to the University because we end up having increased revenue,” said Mendelson.

2011-02-10,McGill,India,"Engineering Career Centre subsidized student networking trips to Calgary
Last September, Total E&P Canada Ltd (TEP), a division of the multinational oil company Total SA, gave a gift of $100,000 to the newly founded McGill Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (ISEAD).
ISEAD hasn’t officially launched, but has been sponsoring speakers and has provided a few undergraduate scholarships and fellowships. According to McGill Electrical and Computer Engineering professor Geza Joos, the newly appointed director of ISEAD, the institute will attempt to “make students sensitive to the whole issue of sustainability in engineering and design.”
The gift was donated after Jean-Michel Gires, CEO of TEP, gave an ISEAD-sponsored presentation in September titled “The Sustainability of the Tar Sands.” TEP has recently been the target of scrutiny by environmental groups including Sierra Club Canada after being approved to build Alberta’s ninth oil sands mine in Joslyn North.
Andrew Kirk, associate dean of Research and Graduate Education in the Faculty of Engineering, said that the money will be used to “support graduate and undergraduate fellowships and scholarships for projects of ‘general sustainability.’”
Kirk, the previous head of ISEAD, continued, saying, “The rest of money is going in to support the speaker series.”
Alex Briggs, an activist with Climate Justice Montreal and U2 Mechanical Engineering student, reflected on Gires’s presentation.
“The tar sands are the only thing that are sustainable to our society, because they are the only source of oil that is acceptable to the current world order. But that’s not the definition of sustainability that most people would identify with,” said Briggs.
“Anything that makes people more self-sufficient loses Total business, so they have a conflict of interest in making the world a more sustainable place,” he added.
When asked how Gires’s presentation fit into ISEAD’s sustainability mandate, Joos replied: “I don’t want to comment on Total’s commitment to sustainability, because it is not our purpose as an institute to make any comments either way.”
Briggs defined a sustainable system as one “where all negative effects that your life imposes on the world are balanced by positive effects at the same time.”
ISEAD, however, is keeping its definition of sustainability more fluid.
“We will accept the notion of sustainability that is offered to us, to the extent that there is an effort made to make it ‘sustainable,’ not necessarily sustainable indefinitely, but more sustainable, less destructive,” Joos said.
The institute will focus purely on the engineering and design aspects of sustainability, without providing a forum for talking about the societal aspects of sustainability.
“We are just focused on anything that is associated with engineering, urban planning, and architecture. We try to stay away from environmental issues that are covered by the McGill School of Environment, Law, Social Work, Psychology. These are essentially secondary issues,” said Joos.
“The institute itself will not take a position related to First Nations, Hydro-Québec, dams, et cetera. Those are more environmental type issues, social justice type issues,” he added.
As a new institute, ISEAD is still searching for a consistent mandate. Joos replaced Kirk as director on June 1, 2010.
ISEAD is currently focusing on seven key research and teaching themes, including sustainable manufacturing, design and construction of the built environment, and greenhouse gas capture and storage.
Joos explained one of the rationales behind researching greenhouse gas capturing.
“It is one of the solutions to keep on using coal. …At the moment, coal is by far the cheapest energy resource,” he said.
Kirk differed with Joos on this research direction: “Just because someone is doing research on something, it doesn’t mean that it is necessarily a good idea. There is an argument against this, in that if we build carbon sequestration systems, are we just giving high carbon fuels just a bit longer to run?”
Joos also confirmed that the research would not look at the effects of carbon capturing on the environment.
“The research at the moment is how to do it using the minimum amount of energy, how to extract the carbon dioxide,” he said.
Kirk questioned the commitment to making carbon fuels more sustainable, given rapidly depleting carbon fuel resources.
“I’m afraid that if we look at the Chinese economy and the Indian economy and look at how much coal they have available to them, I’m pretty convinced all that coal is going to get burned at some point. I think we need technology to capture it, unless we come up with a sufficiently low-cost form of energy. There isn’t really anything in the next ten years, as far as I see it, that’s going to cut it,” said Kirk.
Gires first came to McGill in March, when he gave a similar presentation at the “Engineers in Action” speakers series, put on by McGill’s Engineering Student Centre.
Engineering student services have a history of promoting oil and gas companies who operate in the tar sands. Last month, the Engineering Career Centre subsidized a group of students to visit Calgary to network with a number of these companies, including Imperial Oil, Shell, Syncrude, Suncor, and Total SA.
Darlene Hnatchuck, industry liaison for the Engineering Career Centre and organizer of this subsidized trip – named “Energy Tour” – was asked whether she vetted the companies that were asking students to come work for them.
“If we were to vet all of the companies, it would take us down a very slippery slope in terms of making decisions for adults,” she said. “So we don’t vet companies.”
Hnatchuck added, “we don’t have one focus, we are not tied to any one particular industry, because it is important to get McGill Engineering graduates to all industries if we want them to make a difference.”
The next speaker in the ISEAD speaker series is Pierre Duhaime, CEO of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, one of the ten largest engineering firms in the world. SNC-Lavalin has also recently been the subject of activist scrutiny, after engineering the G20 security fences in downtown Toronto, and providing 300 to 500  million bullets for the U.S. military after the ‘shock and awe’ attacks on Iraq in 2004. Duhaime will be at McGill on February 14.

2011-03-12,McGill,India,"Correction appended

Last Thursday the Aboriginal Law Association of McGill hosted the panel discussion, Stolen Sisters, addressing issues of violence and discrimination that Aboriginal women continue to face within Canadian society.
The discussion was a part of the event: “13 Days to Honour Aboriginal Women,” which aims to celebrate Aboriginal women, as well as raise awareness about missing and murdered Aboriginal women.
Official statistics estimate that since the 1980s, approximately 520 Aboriginal women have been murdered or gone missing.
Walk4Justice, a women’s grass roots activist organization founded by Gladys Radek and Bernie Williams Poitras, estimate that the actual number is almost 4,000.
Both Radek and Poitras spoke candidly at the panel discussion about the prejudice that Aboriginal women face.
“You are a fucking squaw. What have you done for our community? What have you contributed to Canada?” said Poitras, with reference to personal experiences.
“This is how Indian women are treated,” she stated.
Ridek and Poitras also referenced strong societal prejudice against Aboriginal women as extremely damaging, to both individuals and communities.
“When one woman is violated it affects a whole community, when one woman goes missing it affects a whole community,” said Radek.
“These are racist attacks against our women. Society has told [the children of these women] that your mother was a whore, your mother was nothing but a drug addict, your mother was society’s throw-away,” added Poitras. “We [have] to tell their children that this [is] not so. Your mother loved you.”
Speaking about “the Highway of Tears,” a stretch of highway in northern British Columbia closely linked to many missing women’s cases, Poitras explained that many women were victimized when trying to escape violent situations.
“If they are leaving a violent situation in those isolated communities the only way they can come out is highway 16 and, more often than not, they will be caught on that highway,” said Poitras.
“They don’t have to be hitchhiking, they don’t have to be sex trade workers – they could be walking along that highway and they just disappear because there, at that moment, is a moment of opportunity for a predator,” she continued.
Panellist Craig Benjamin, a national campaigner for the human rights of Indigenous peoples for Amnesty International, explained that part of the problem is the lack of national policies regarding the status of Aboriginal victims of crime, for police to use.
“In 2001 [Amnesty International] could not find a single police force that had implemented a single policy or procedure in recognition of this pattern of violence,” said Benjamin, who interpreted the lack of real statistics as an affirmation that police forces have not been active on this issue.
“There is no good reason that the federal government has not directed the RCMP to establish a national standard that says this is why you must record the Aboriginal identity of violent crime. There is simply no good reason why this is not happening except that it is not a priority,” he added.
In his concluding remarks, Benjamin spoke to Canada’s failure to protect Aboriginal women.
“The failure to provide services and support, to show that Aboriginal women are not endangered is the first point; these are basic human rights violations and should be unacceptable to anybody,” he said. “We are talking about the society we all live and participate in, we all have the responsibility for bringing about this change.”

2011-04-02,McGill,India,"Election campaigning begins with action-packed first week
The first week of the federal campaign proved to be tumultuous for all five of the major parties. Liberal Michael Ignatieff, Bloc Québécois Gilles Duceppe and Conservative Stephen Harper all visited Montreal last week to kick off the six-week campaign period leading up to the May 2 vote. Following three consecutive minority governments, this will be the fourth federal election in seven years.
Harper held a rally Wednesday afternoon, amidst sudden media scrutiny of two of his party’s Montreal-region candidates. Agop Evereklian, the Conservative candidate in Pierrefonds-Dollard riding, replaced his campaign manager Giulio Maturi after Le Devoir made public Maturi’s work in Benoît Labonté’s 2009 mayoral campaign in Montreal. Labonté dropped out of the race for accepting kickbacks from local construction entrepreneur Tony Accurso. The same day, Larry Smith, the Tory candidate in Lac-Saint-Louis riding, also caused a stir when he said to Le Devoir, “What is important is the world, not the protection of French in Quebec. That’s a thing of the past.”
Also on Wednesday, the broadcast consortium organizing the leaders’ debates announced that Green Party leader Elizabeth May will not be included in the debates scheduled for April 12 in English and April 14 in French. May’s exclusion is the result of the Green Party not currently holding a seat in the House of Commons.
On Thursday, Duceppe faced backlash against the Bloc when exiting Bloc MP for Northern Quebec, Yvon Lévesque, commented on the Cree background of the riding’s new NDP candidate Romeo Saganash. Lévesque said in an interview to Rue Frontenac that “certain voters will not vote for the NDP now that they have an Aboriginal candidate.” The NDP is now pushing for Lévesque to leave the party for his “very startling comments,” as NDP MP Thomas Mulcair said.
“They are in full flight, not a position [the Bloc] is used to,” Mulcair added.
Meanwhile, Harper continued to denounce Ignatieff’s plans for a “reckless,” “illegitimate,” and “dangerous” coalition with opposition leaders despite Ignatieff’s repeated statements he has absolutely no interest in forming a coalition.
NDP Thomas Mulcair, who has been an MP in Outremont since 2007, embraced the idea of a coalition of opposition parties.
“Jack is the one who proposed the coalition back in 2008 and for us it’s a constant in our political activity,” he said.
“This is not any ordinary election we are facing right now. We’ve got to get rid of Harper, we’ve got to be smart about it. That’s why our signs say ‘Work together,’” Mulcair added.
Harper’s biggest policy announcement came last Thursday when he announced that if re-elected, the Conservative government would seek to complete negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union by 2012 and India by 2013. Reaffirming his party’s commitment to the economy, Harper went on to criticize the Liberals’ economic policy.
“The choice is clear,” said Harper.  “Canadians can choose between a stable national government with a low-tax plan that will create jobs by expanding trade, and Michael Ignatieff’s high-tax agenda that will put our businesses and workers at a severe disadvantage relative to our international competitors.”
Subsequently, Michael Ignatieff has been campaigning hard to convince Canadians that his party will focus on “the things that really matter to Canadian families.” He says this includes issues such as education, health care and job creation, but not billion dollar fighter jets.
One of the most ambitious promises so far is the Liberal party’s Canadian Learning Passport.
“The Canadian Learning Passport is taking a billion dollars and investing it in a registered education savings plan so that every Canadian student that chooses to go to university, college or CEGEP will get a thousand dollars a year over four years, over $1,500 a year for low-income families,” explained Liberal Youth Critic and MP for Papineau Justin Trudeau. “It’s money upfront, it’s not a tax credit, it’s not reimbursable, it’s $1,000 cash per year towards education.”
The plan would do little to address rising tuition fees, however. Other opposition parties, including the NDP, were skeptical of the Liberals’ proposal.
“Tuition fees increased four times faster than inflation during the 13 years of Liberal governments,” said Joanne Corbeil, NDP candidate for Westmount-Ville Marie.
Liberal candidate for Outremont, Martin Cauchon, defended his party’s platform.
“You have to be able to strike the right balance. That’s why I like the Liberal party. We’re not far, far left, we’re not far, far right. We’re in the middle and when needed we go left in order to keep the balance in our society,” said Cauchon. “You can’t have unity among the opposition parties because our standing point is so different.”

2011-09-15,McGill,India,"Bill C-21 opens up complaint processes against federal and First Nations governments
Corrections appended on September 15, 2011. 
Since its application in 1977, the Canadian Human Rights Act has pledged to uphold the principle that “all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices.” Until last June, however, the Act included a special provision, Section 67, which restricted the right to file claims of discrimination from First Nations peoples.
“For thirty-five years, people living under the Indian Act were not able to avail themselves of recourse to justice when they felt themselves to be victims of discrimination in many matters of their daily lives,” said David Gollob, communications director for the Canadian Human Rights Commission, in an interview with The Daily.
The Indian Act is a broad piece of legislation that affords First Nations communities the right to a certain level of autonomy on their lands, and determines the relationship between Aboriginal citizens living on reservations and the federal government. First drafted in 1876, it has broad implications in Aboriginal law. According to then-Justice Minister Ron Bassford, Section 67 was included in the Human Rights Act in order to avoid potential conflict between the two pieces of legislation. Its implication was that anyone living or working on an Indian Reservation was not legally able to pursue discrimination claims against First Nations governments under the Human Rights Act if the discrimination was related to the Indian Act. It also prevented complaints of discrimination against the Indian Act itself.
“This was recognized by successive governments as an anomaly that needed to be rectified,” said Gollob. “The [Commission] has been calling for the repeal of Section 67 for many years, and the United Nations also echoed this need to end what has been a historical injustice of not giving all people living in Canada the same human rights protections.”
The House of Commons passed Bill C-21 in 2008, allowing First Nations communities immediate access to the complaints process against the federal government, and affording First Nations governments a three year transitional period to allow for possible complaints against them. The Bill did not come into full effect until this past June, when the transition period ended.
Post-repeal, the Commission – through its National Aboriginal Initiative – had been working to “understand all the implications of the act as it regards First Nations people” said Gollob.
Sherri Helgason, director of the Initiative, said that the role of the commission “is to accept complaints where complaints are filed.”
“We also have an education role, a role in expanding knowledge and identifying policy or systemic issues that could be problematic, with the goal of reducing, or eradicating, discrimination,” she continued.
Helgason explained that the application of Bill C-21 on First Nations reserves has the potential to address issues of inequality, including the division of matrimonial property.
“From a human rights perspective, we did identify that the absence of regimes or laws that would allow for equitable distribution of marital assets was a problem,” said Helgason.
Already, cases have been brought to court challenging certain aspects of the Indian Act that some individuals living under it perceive to be discriminatory.
Gollob described one case in particular which “could have a very significant impact on the quality of life and quality of services” on First Nations reserves.
A joint complaint brought forth by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada and the Society of First Nations, currently working its way through the court system, reveals the amount of state funding available to First Nations children in need of intervention by child welfare services is less than what is available to services for children living off-reserve.
“This is a discriminatory practice,” Gollob asserts. “It’s going to be a very important case in that it will help shape the impact of the inclusion of First Peoples under the Canadian Human Rights Act.”
Attempts to contact representatives of First Nations governments for comment, including the Assembly of First Nations and the Grand Council of the Crees, could not be reached at the time of press.
A previous version article stated that Sherri Helgason is the Director of Communications for the National Aboriginal Initiative. She is in fact the Director. The article subhead incorrectly described the changes to the complaint processes under Bill C-21. The subhead has been altered to accurately describe the processes. The Daily regrets the errors.

2011-11-07,McGill,India,"Newly implemented Strategic Summits aim to facilitate discussion within campus community
SSMU’s third Strategic Summit took place last Friday, with  discussion focusing on how to promote equity and diversity within the McGill community.
The Strategic Summits are an initiative implemented this year by SSMU with the goal of facilitating discussion on various topics relevant to the McGill student body. Previous summits have focused on tuition hikes and student consultation.
SSMU’s Equity Committee moderated Friday’s summit. The committee’s mandate, as outlined on their website, is “to confront historical and current inequities at McGill through active engagement and public education.”
According to SSMU Equity Outreach Coordinator Ryan Thom, “the strategic summits are an effort on the part of SSMU to really gauge what the spectrum of opinions and ideas and, perhaps frustrations, are from the student body.”
SSMU VP University Affairs Emily Clare and former Equity Commissioner, added that, “strategic summits are a platform for students to get together and talk comprehensively about one issue.”
The summit lasted for five hours, during which students, members of the administration, and representatives from other SSMU committees discussed issues surrounding equal opportunities for those of various races, genders, abilities, and socioeconomic statuses. Issues were discussed on a global scale, as well as in the context of the local community, particularly concerning the inclusivity of McGill’s current policies and possible amendments to them.
According to Janina Grabs, a U3 Political Science student, “in a rather intimate setting, [the summit] gives you the opportunity to talk to a lot of people very directly that normally you don’t get the opportunity to [talk to].”
The most recent challenge for the Equity Committee presented itself at SSMU’s 4Floors Halloween party on October 27, where certain ethnic costumes – such as Indian princesses and people taping their eyes to appear East Asian – created an environment that offended members of McGill’s student body.
Before Halloween, the Equity Committee circulated posters depicting people of various ethnicities and corresponding stereotypical costumes, which read, “We are a culture, not a costume.” Despite this campaign, there remained a noticeable number of ethnically offensive and stereotypical costumes at the event this year.
One of the main goals of Friday’s summit was to discuss possible solutions to this problem, and to increase dialogue on issues of equity and diversity in general.
Among proposed solutions was the inclusion of a statement in class syllabi to promote mutual respect among McGill’s diverse student body – a project that the Equity Committee is currently working on with the administration.
According to Thom, “Policy itself is always a work in progress. We have different ideas, but there are always going to be points of contention.”

2012-02-04,McGill,India,"Media scrutiny over her and McGill’s role in the Quebec asbestos industry led to Roshi Chadha’s decision
Roshi Chadha, member-at-large on McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG), took a leave of absence last Thursday as media scrutiny mounts over her and McGill’s role in the Quebec asbestos industry.
Chadha is director of the export company Seja Trade Ltd., which exported asbestos – primarily to India – from the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec for 16 years, until the mine suspended operations last fall.
The company is a subsidiary of Balcorp Ltd., which is owned by her husband, Baljit Chadha. He sits on Concordia University’s Board of Governors.
Balcorp is seeking a $58-million loan from the Quebec government to re-open the Jeffrey Mine.
Roshi Chadha also took a leave of absence from her position on the Board of Directors of the St. Mary’s Hospital Foundation, and resigned from the Canadian Red Cross’s Board of Governors over two weeks ago.
Chadha said in a statement that she is proud of her contributions to the various boards, and that she expects to contribute again in the future.
“I have worked tirelessly in public institutions that are important to me, and I appreciate the many supportive messages that have demonstrated appreciation for my efforts,” she said.
“I do not want my personal and professional life to interfere with the governance and performance of institutions that are important to me and to society. My values, principles, integrity, and professional interests remain intact,” she continued.
Chadha has sat on McGill’s BoG since 2003 . Her second and final term as a member-at-large ends in 2013.
In a statement, Chair of the Board Stuart Cobbett said, “Mrs. Chadha is a distinguished senior volunteer in the McGill community, and has given years of sustained service to the University through a range of important roles and contributions.”
“We respect her wishes, though reluctantly, and look forward to her return,” he continued.
Ron Critchley, BoG administrative and support staff representative, said, “I’ve been extremely impressed by [Chadha’s] loyalty and dedication to the University.”
Kathleen Ruff, senior human rights advisor with the Ottawa-based  Rideau Institute, said she was surprised at McGill’s continued support of Chadha, citing international scientific consensus on health threats posed by asbestos.
“If you [play] a key role in an academic institution, you should show a commitment to the clear science, and to the clear scientific facts,” said Ruff. “Someone who is on the Board of Governors of McGill should be supporting the public interest.”

2012-02-11,McGill,India,"Over 10,000 eligible First Nations students denied financial support
Students across Canada are calling upon the federal government to honour Aboriginal treaty rights to post-secondary education by removing a cap on funding growth.
Despite increases in tuition across Canada and the expansion of the Aboriginal population, the growth of the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP) – a government-funded program that provides financial assistance for Status Indian and Inuit students enrolled in post-secondary education – has been capped at 2 per cent since 1996.
Kakwiranoron Cook, outreach coordinator at McGill’s First Peoples’ House, said that while each First Nation has signed its own treaties with the government, they all guarantee Aboriginal access to education.
According to Aboriginal Students’ Representative for the Canadian Federation of Students Patrick Smoke, “It is a treaty responsibility for the federal government to ensure that every First Nation and Inuit student has a right to education.”
Before the 2 per cent growth cap was put in place, Smoke explained, there were 27,000 students receiving funding from the program. Now there are only 22,000.
Not only are tuition hikes outpacing the growth of PSSSP funding, but the number of Aboriginal individuals who are eligible for funding is rapidly increasing as well.
According to the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), the cap has meant that 10,589 eligible First Nations students were denied financial support from 2001 to 2006 as a result of the limited funding available. In 2007-08, AFN estimated that an additional $197 million would be required to overcome the impact of the cap – this number continues to grow.
According to Smoke, “We’re the fastest growing demographic in Canada. We’re outpacing the birthrate by six times… The number of First Nation and Inuit students who want to attend secondary school is going to expand as well.”
Geneviève Guibert, spokesperson for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, confirmed that the department’s approved annual growth rate for the program stands at 2 per cent, but clarified that “the overall annual growth rate is larger due to significant investments – nearly two billion dollars – made in priority areas through successive budgets since 2006.”
Regardless of the actual growth rates, many students are finding that PSSSP funds are still not enough. Many students have to take out loans, and Non-Status First Nations and Métis peoples aren’t eligible for funding.
Cook works with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities across Canada to connect with youth and promote higher education. He has found that “a lot of people are interested in McGill, but the biggest issue is funding.”
Indeed, as the number of students asking for funding increases, Aboriginal communities are forced to make compromises in how they distribute financial assistance.
For Smoke, this may complicate the continuation of his studies. Smoke is from Alderville First Nation outside Toronto, which recently had to divert funding away from healthcare in order to serve the students who had applied for funding. Because of these budgetary constraints, only the students with the best marks will continue to receive funding come September.
“The thought of having to take on $10,000 of debt to pay for my education next year is a scary thought,” he said. “It’s not right because I am entitled to funding, as is every First Nations student in Canada.”
Removing the current growth cap on the PSSSP to fund all eligible students would require an additional investment of about $250 million annually. According to some calculations, however, this is a small figure compared to what the government might save.
Assembly of First Nations Chief Shawn Atleo recently told the National Post, “If in one generation, we close the education gap, and the labour market gap, this could result in new revenue for the Canadian economy of $400-billion, and savings in government expenditures of $115-billion.”
In spite of these figures, Smoke explained, “It is going to be a difficult task with the conservative government that’s currently in place. Considering their cost-cutting mode, to invest $250 million back a year into post-secondary education for Aboriginal students really isn’t on their agenda right now.”
What may be on the agenda, however, is the complete reform of the PSSSP to a government loan program. The current program – which has been under formal government review for seven years – provides financial assistance that does not need to be paid back by its recipients.
“I can’t imagine what the day would be when they decided to change [the PSSSP] into loans,” said Cook. “There would be a lot of outcry for sure, and it’s hard to imagine what that would do to sway students away from pursuing post-secondary education.”
Smoke added that “a lot of First Nations and Inuit students cannot take on debt… By making [PSSSP] a loans program you’re going to see our numbers drop [in post-secondary education].”
For many of those calling on the government to increase funding to the PSSSP, it is a matter of the government responsibility to honour treaty rights and promote equity.
First Peoples’ House Aboriginal Student Advisor and recent McGill graduate Alyse VanEvery, who received funding from PSSSP, explained that “I’ve heard my non-native friends say, ‘Oh, you’re so lucky, look what you get.’ No, look back, look at the bigger picture. I’m not so lucky. There is such a thing as discrimination in this world,” she said.
“At the end of the day, the government funds students [because of treaty rights], and I don’t think it’s a lot to ask for,” she continued.

2012-02-18,McGill,India,"Academics and health experts question impartiality of departmental review
Correction appended Feb. 23, 2012
The research work of Professor John Corbett McDonald, an emeritus professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health at McGill, is now under review after allegations of research misconduct.
McDonald retired from McGill in September 1988, after over two decades as a McGill epidemiology professor. According to a recent episode of CBC’s The National, McDonald received at least $1 million between 1966 and 1972 for research into the health effects of chrysotile asbestos from the Quebec Asbestos Mining Association, which received a large portion of its funding from the asbestos mining giant Johns-Manville.
McGill’s review is being lead by Rebecca Fuhrer, chair of McGill’s Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health. A group of academics and health experts published a letter last Friday calling for an external review of McDonald’s research. McDonald’s research holds that chrysotile asbestos is less harmful than other forms of asbestos, and only deadly when a person is exposed to large quantities of it.
“Hardly anybody else but the McGill team believed that,” said lead signatory of the letter and professor emeritus of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at the Université Laval Fernand Turcotte. “The rest of the world was really arrested by this,” he continued.
In a statement released last Thursday, Dean of Medicine and Vice-Principal (Health Affairs) David Eidelman said, “Holding scientific views that are different from those of the majority does not constitute research misconduct.”
Imperial Tobacco is also believed to have paid McDonald to review a paper on the health effects of tobacco. An October 1988 letter from McDonald to Imperial Tobacco states: “As agreed, our fee for this work is $10,000.”
A postscript to the letter adds, “I would wish to emphasize that there must be no publication of any part of this review under [my] name.”
Turcotte worked with McDonald early in his career, and described him as “one of the superstars of public health in this country” at the time. This fact, Turcotte continued, jeopardizes the impartiality of Fuhrer’s review.
“Because I have worked with Corbett McDonald in the past, I would have refused that kind of mission, and God knows that I have worked [with him] much less than his immediate colleagues in the departments,” he said.
“When I got the documents that proved that he worked secretly for the tobacco industry, it took me months to overcome my depression,” said Turcotte.
Politicians at the federal and provincial level have called for an end to the Canadian production and exportation of asbestos, a policy long defended through McDonald’s research. Westmount-based company Balcorp Ltd. is also seeking a $58 million loan from the Quebec government to re-open the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec.
Roshi Chadha, a member of McGill’s Board of Governors and director of the export company Seja Trade Ltd., took a leave of absence from McGill two weeks ago. Seja Trade, which exported asbestos – primarily to India – from the Jeffrey Mine for 16 years before the mine closed operations last fall, is a subsidiary of Balcorp.
Kathleen Ruff, senior human rights adviser for the Ottawa-based Rideau Institute, told The Daily that McGill’s review was coming at a “critical moment” for the Quebec and Canadian asbestos industry.
“The global asbestos industry has used Macdonald’s research constantly, and still today uses it to deny the harm caused by chrysotile asbestos,” said Ruff. “This is not an issue from the past.”
Another signatory to the letter criticizing McGill’s preliminary review, Edward Keyserlingk is the former director of the Biomedical Ethics Unit in the McGill Faculty of Medicine. Keyserlingk lost his brother, Robert, to mesothelioma in December 2008. Robert’s widow, Michaela Keyserlingk, said he was exposed to asbestos on naval ships in the early 1950s.
“Forty years later they suddenly found that he had fluid on his lungs,” she said.
“It’s a horrible death. They are really suffocating. And if you think we have all the morphine and all the opiates available to modern medicine to mask all these horrible symptoms, and nobody in India has that and these people must be dying the most excruciating death I can possibly imagine,” she said.
“I think McGill would do well choosing people outside of their own community. I think this is much too serious to have your own people investigating your own people,” Keyserlingk added.
In the original version of this article, it stated that Edward Keyserlingk is a McGill professor emeritus of Medical Ethics & Health Law; he is in fact the former director of the Biomedical Ethics Unit in the Faculty of Medicine. The Daily regrets the error.

2012-10-18,McGill,India,"Professor cleared of misconduct despite corporate funding and controversial methods
Dean of Medicine David Eidelman announced yesterday that after an internal review, the University will not be pursuing an independent investigation into allegations of research misconduct made against professor emeritus J. Corbett Macdonald, who conducted asbestos industry-funded research on the health effects of asbestos at McGill in the early 1970s.
The inquiry was launched in February after a CBC documentary revealed that Macdonald had accepted nearly one million dollars from the asbestos industry.
“Professor McDonald [sic]properly acknowledged financial support from the asbestos industry in his publications […] There is no evidence to suggest that the sponsors influenced the data analyses or the conclusions,” read a statement released yesterday by the University.
The report, prepared by McGill Research Integrity Officer Abraham Fuks, claims that Macdonald’s findings were often corroborated by others and that his research demonstrated a link between asbestos exposure and lung cancer.
The work of Brown University professor David Egilman – a vocal critic of Macdonald’s research for over ten years – was cited numerous times in the report.
However, Egilman told The Daily that he was never contacted by the University during the course of its investigation, despite offering to meet with them.
“McGill has its own definition of an investigation,” he said. “You would assume that you would talk to the person who filed the complaint and published a peer-reviewed paper that laid out the issues.”
The report also acknowledges that asbestos companies exploited a distinction made by Macdonald’s research between chrysotile asbestos and other forms of asbestos, particularly his reference to chrysotile as being “essentially innocuous” at certain concentrations.
One of Macdonald’s studies concluded that “most, if not all” cases of mesothelioma were related to exposure to tremolite asbestos and not chrysotile.
The study described certain mines in Quebec as containing higher or lower amounts of tremolite – mines in area A and mines in area B – but MacDonald never refers to these mines by name.
“Their whole theory is based on comparing the mesothelioma rates and they don’t say which mine is which,” Egilman said. “If they didn’t make up the data, they hid information […] That’s worse than scientific misconduct.”
Fuks admits in the report that he could not “find direct identification of which specific mines were in areas A and B and all the published data are coded both for subjects and mine.”
“It is therefore not possible to make these linkages by name,” he concludes.
Despite this, Fuks argues that there is “no basis to presume that the analyses performed by [Macdonald] and his colleagues are flawed” because the data Macdonald used was consistent across his studies.
Egilman claimed in a paper published in 2003 that Macdonald did not use the right equipment to assess the levels of asbestos exposure.
Fuks’ report addressed this by stating that although Macdonald was aware of the drawbacks of his equipment, it was impossible for him to use the latest measuring tools because he was comparing his numbers with data obtained using older instruments.
“[Macdonald] did not have the opportunity to carry out prospective measures of exposure and [was] forced to either use the data available or not initiate the study,” the report read.
Egilman also claimed that the relationship between Macdonald and the asbestos industry was greatly understated.
“[The asbestos industry] said they were looking for Macdonald because they were looking for someone who would want to be a champion for them, like the tobacco companies did with cancer,” he told The Daily.
Macdonald testified before the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1972 and proposed lowering U.S. safety standards, according to a 1973 book by investigative science reporter Paul Brodeur.
Eidelman said at a press conference on Wednesday that MacDonald’s public advocacy of the use of asbestos was not “germane to an issue of research misconduct.”
“We don’t regulate the speech of our professors,” he said.
Earlier this year, a group of Canadian scientists criticized McGill for its continued ties to the asbestos industry and called for the resignation of Roshi Chadha from the University’s Board of Governors.
Chadha is the director of an asbestos-exporting firm and the wife of Baljit Chadha, the president and founder of Balcorp Limited – a prominent exporter of asbestos to India.
Eidelman declined to comment on Chadha’s relationship to McGill.
The report concluded by recommending that McGill hold an academic conference on the topic of alternatives to asbestos and the challenge of asbestos removal.

2012-10-22,McGill,India,"Critics accuse government of glorifying war and distorting details
The Harper government renamed a federal building in Old Montreal on Wednesday, October 10 as part of a $28 million campaign to commemorate the bicentennial of the War of 1812. Located at 400 Place d’Youville, the Édifice des douanes is now officially the Dominique Ducharme Building.
“Mr. Ducharme fought both at the Battle of Beaver Dams in Upper Canada and at the Battle of the Chateauguay, and played an important role in Canada’s development,” Minister of Public Works and Government Services Rona Ambrose stated in a press release.
“The building’s proximity to the Battle of the Chateauguay site gives it special historic significance for the region,” Jacques Gourde, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, said at the October 10 naming ceremony.
According to the government press release, the Battle of Chateauguay was a decisive loss for the Americans, who abandoned their Saint Lawrence campaign.
Pierre Nantel, vice-critic for Canadian Heritage for the New Democratic Party, told La Presse in French that he is “concerned to see new symbols being imposed as new icons of Canada, implying that the symbols which have been built over the years have not been sufficient.”
In an interview with The Daily, Canadian military history expert and Hiram Mills Emeritus Professor Desmond Morton explained that the federal government is not giving the full story on Ducharme.
“[Ducharme] was the British Army’s Indian Department agent with the Mohawks who defeated the Americans at Beaver Dams, using the information Laura Secord had brought to Lieutenant Fitzgibbon. As usual in our history, reference to the Mohawks is never part of the Laura Secord story,” said Morton.
“The real victors in the War of 1812 weren’t the Upper Canadians [Ontario]; it was the Lower Canadians [Quebec] who provided much of the troops in the early victories,” Morton continued. “The best militia in North America was the militia that had evolved in Lower Canada.”
“Nobody in Ontario ever hears about this. I’m not sure Mr. Harper wants them to, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to recognize that the French Canadians saved them so they could go on being Canadians,” he added.
History Students’ Association (HSA) President Hannah Wood told The Daily, “Canadian history as taught in elementary and secondary schools is highly selective. The War of 1812 was never discussed.”
However, according to Wood, the war was symbolically formative to the Canadian nation. “A fundamental part of popular Canadian identity is the fact we are not American. Although the War of 1812 may technically have been a British war, Canada has historically identified with Britain over America,” she said.
Wood said she hopes “there is a concerted effort to represent events such as the War of 1812 accurately, and not idealize them as the government has done in its press releases and television commercials.”
She specified that these views are her own and do not necessarily represent those of HSA constituents.
In an interview with The Daily, Alan Taylor – Pulitzer Prize winner, Distinguished Professor of History at the University of California, Davis, and author of The Civil War of 1812 – said, “in Upper Canada at the start of the war, most of the inhabitants were settlers from the United States. During the first two years of the war most of them sought to avoid any service in the war, on either side, and some of them did join the invaders.”
“By the last year of the war, most of the Upper Canada inhabitants did reluctantly become more active in defending the colony and the war did create a greater sense of Canadian patriotism,” said Taylor.
However, Taylor noted, “Canadian militia played an important role but of lesser importance when compared to the leading roles played by the British regulars and the First Nation peoples.”
“My dissent from the government position is that it implies that all Canadians immediately rallied to defend the colony [and] that there was already a unified Canada when in fact there were seven distinct colonies,” he said.
Taylor also criticized the Canadian government for glorifying the war. “The government line also misses a golden opportunity to treat the war as a tragedy that persuaded both Americans and the British that they should avoid future wars,” he said. “The 200 years of peace warrant our celebration far more than does the supposed glories of a war full of miseries.  At the 1912 centennial commemoration there was much more bi-national cooperation around the message of shared peace.”
“While spending $29 million on TV ads and reenactments, the federal government has gutted the budgets of Parks Canada and the Library and Archives Canada, which strikes me as a misallocation of priorities and resources,” Taylor added.

2012-11-26,McGill,India,"Quebec lacks complaint procedure
Indian Status Cards have recently been refused by major Montreal stores, according to several sources. The cards, issued by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada under the Indian Act, provide federal tax exemptions to Status Indians. While the majority of major department stores recognize the cards, Walmart and Zellers reportedly only offer tax exemptions to Aboriginal people from Kahnawake, and recent reports indicate instances of stores in downtown Montreal also refusing the Status Cards.
Céline, a Saint-Constant Walmart employee who declined to provide her last name, confirmed that the store previously only accepted cards from Kahnawake, but also cited a policy change in the past year to include all Status Indians, of which there are over 70,000 in Quebec.
Ken Williams, who lives on the Ontario Moose Deer Point Reserve, claims otherwise, reporting that his card was refused only a few weeks ago, on October 24. According to Williams, Walmart’s receipts intended for store records state that only Kahnawake cards are to be accepted. Williams was unable to obtain a copy of the receipt.
There is no consistent complaint procedure in Quebec for those whose Status Cards are refused, though such avenues exist in other provinces. The Assembly of First Nations is officially responsible as a resource for support, but has failed to respond to Williams’ complaints.
Larger Quebec bands, including the Cree, Algonquin, and Mohawk, choose to represent themselves independently of band associations. The lack of affiliation networks between Quebec bands means that negotiations are often done on a smaller scale, such as in Kahnawake’s recent agreement with the provincial government granting them an exemption from the Quebec Sales Tax (QST).
According to Williams, the refusal of Status Cards is evidence of a “lack of understanding of what the Indian Act is all about.”
In a 1986 conference of Native lawyers, the Indian Act was described as a recognition that “the government understands that they took our land without paying.”
Williams also said that a “lack of understanding” on the part of employees regarding the Indian Act and its requirements might explain the lack of consistency in the application of tax exemptions under the Act.

2012-12-24,McGill,India,"Indigenous groups decry Bill C-45
Thousands of indigenous activists and their allies marched across several Canadian cities on Thursday as part of a nationwide effort from First Nations groups to denounce omnibus Bill C-45, a modification to the Indian Act that makes it easier for indigenous communities to surrender their lands.  
The movement, known as Idle No More, was formed after Attawapiskat chef Theresa Spence began a hunger strike two weeks ago. 
In Montreal, about 600 protesters gathered at Cabot Square – formerly the site of an indigenous meeting ground – before convening at Place des Arts.
“If [the hunger strike] is not a reason to call for action for Native people, I don’t know what is,” said Mélissa Mollen Dupuis, one of the organizers of the Montreal protest. 
Under the new federal legislation, indigenous land can be leased with approval of a majority of those in attendance at a community meeting or in a referendum; previously, a majority of all eligible voters was required.
Idle No More activists and the Assembly of First Nations have denounced the lack of consultation with indigenous groups. 
“It’s important for us to keep the momentum up, because Stephen Harper is stealing lands and resources that are not his to claim. […] All it takes is for him to take a five minute drive to Victoria Island to meet with [Theresa Spence],” Mohawk activist Ellen Gabriel told The Daily.
“He doesn’t want to do that. Why? Because we’re expendables, we’ve always been expandable in Canada’s eyes. I just hope that this movement continues,” she added. 
Several other protests were held simultaneously across the country, including more than 1,000 demonstrators in Ottawa. In Alberta, activists erected barricades across several highways. 
First Nation groups have also decried the bill’s impact on the environment. The bill includes significant amendments to the Navigable Waters Protection Act, the Environmental Assessment Act, and the Fisheries Act. 
Thousands of lakes and waterways are set to lose government protection, and the term “Aboriginal fishing rights” was enshrined in federal law. 
In an article for Global News, indigenous activist Eriel Deranger said the change could pave the way for a constitutional amendment since Aboriginal fishing rights are already protected in the Canadian constitution. 
“The concern is that if the government is able to push this bill through, it could completely erode democratic rights in our country,” she said. 
So far, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has rejected calls to meet with Spence. Instead, he has suggested a meeting with Minister of Aboriginal Affairs John Duncan. 
Spence, however, has vowed to continue her hunger strike until she can meet with the Prime Minister.

2013-01-13,McGill,India,"Mohawk Traditional Council expresses ambivalence about the movement
Idle No More protesters filled the sidewalk outside the Palais des congrès on Friday, spilling into the streets. Protest organizers and aboriginal leaders chanted, pleaded, and preached into a loudspeaker, eliciting cries of encouragement from an excitable crowd.
The protest marked Montreal’s second rally as part of the indigenous rights and environmental protection movement that has come to be known worldwide as Idle No More.
Daphne Mitchell, a demonstrator, said that Friday’s protest was her first, after decades of living in Montreal.
“I think that it’s important to open up a dialogue about aboriginal issues between aboriginals and non-aboriginals,” she said. “I don’t know that much about it, but I’m here to learn.”
Lise Yolande, an Atikamekw woman who moved to Montreal from Obedjiwan, a reserve in the Mauricie region of Quebec, held her three-year-old daughter among the crowd of protesters.
“Everyone always says that aboriginal people are invisible, but I’m here to show that we’re visible, that we’re always here, and that we’ve always been here,” she said.
The demonstration was part of an international day of action in honor of the meeting that took place between aboriginal leaders and Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Friday.
Since early December, Attawapiskat chief Theresa Spence has been fasting with the goal of obtaining a meeting between Stephen Harper, Governor General David Lloyd Johnston, and aboriginal leaders.
Because the Governor General did not attend Friday’s meeting, neither did Theresa Spence, although both attended a ceremonial reception with hundreds of aboriginal chiefs following the Harper meeting.
The chief is continuing her hunger strike, and has said publicly that she is “ready to die for [her] people.”
The meeting between the Prime Minister and aboriginal leaders resulted in a promise by Harper that he would participate in “high-level talks” about the situation of native peoples in Canada.
Some aboriginal leaders and activists have already expressed disappointment at the meeting, citing a lack of commitment to concrete change.
The Idle No More movement, which has continued to grow even despite Harper’s meeting with aboriginal leaders on Friday, has come to represent a general indignation about the situation of aboriginal peoples in Canada, as well as tense relations between First Nations peoples and the government.
“It’s terrible to see that native communities [in Canada] live in poverty without housing, without electricity, without schools, without proper health care, even though we consider them to be fellow Canadian citizens,” commented Ahmed Mashouf, a retired doctor who marched in the Montreal protest, holding a sign for progressive provincial party Québec solidaire (QS).
The movement has also singled out federal omnibus Bill C-45, which has been criticized for weakening environmental regulations and aboriginal land rights.
The Montreal Gazette reported that QS MNA Françoise David was in attendance, and quoted her as criticizing the PQ’s plans for development and resource extraction in the north of Quebec, stating that “we can’t just hand out mining permits to the highest bidder. There has to be oversight and there has to be consultation and meaningful participation from the aboriginal communities affected by this.”
Idle No More struggles to encompass the wide swath of complex problems faced by Canada’s aboriginal population. In Montreal on Friday, the Mohawk Traditional Council expressed its ambivalence about the movement.
“The Mohawk Traditional Council cannot directly support the ‘Idle No More movement’,” began a statement released by the Council, “due to the fact that there are too many voices saying too many different things, allowing those responsible for these problems within the Assembly of First Nations to hijack the movement.”
The Council called on native and non-native peoples to take specific steps to “undo the wrongs they have perpetuated on native peoples”, including dissolving the Indian Act and renouncing the band council system.
Stewart Myiow is the Wolf Clan representative to the Council, and he read its statement publicly at the protest.
“[Idle No More] is only positive in the sense that everybody is here today, together. Everybody here knows that something is wrong. But the way it is currently, the government has all the people like a dog chasing its tail, getting nowhere,” he told The Daily. “This is why we had to present our position, to identify clearly what the steps are that must be taken.”

2013-01-29,McGill,India,"Idle No More teach-in held at Thomson House
“How can this happen in a developed nation?” 
That was the question posed by Chelsea Vowel, a Métis writer, at the teach-in on Friday.
Since the passage of the Harper government’s controversial Bill C-45 in November, teach-ins nationwide have tried to address difficult questions surrounding the situation of Aboriginal peoples in Canada. 
A poll conducted by Forum Research for the National Post indicated that Canadian support for the movement is highest in Quebec. Demonstrations in solidarity with the movement, however, have been held across the country.
The First Peoples’ House and the Centre for Society, Technology and Development at McGill (STANDD) hosted the teach-in, with help from the Indigenous Students Alliance (ISA). 
“[This is] a huge teachable moment in history right now,” said Jessica Dolan, a PhD candidate studying anthropology and one of the event’s organizers.
The importance of educating Canadians, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, about the movement was a central theme. 
“A teach-in is what can mobilize us…it is [the basis] which will give us the background to know what were talking about when we go out to rallies and to round dances,” said Tiffany Harrington, a U1 Anthropology major and vice president of the Indigenous Students Alliance.
The teach-in featured three speakers who addressed issues relating to Bill C-45 such as indigenous law and misrepresentation of Aboriginal peoples in the media and in society. 
Focusing on tax exemptions, free housing, and free education, Vowel explained how these apply only to Status Indians (about half of Aboriginal Canadians), and even then with great limitation, or in the case of housing, not at all.
The second speaker was Jameela Jeeroburkhan, a lawyer who has worked on cases concerning treaty and Aboriginal rights across Canada. Jeeroburkhan discussed the three changes imposed by Bill C-45 that are likely to have the greatest impact on Native people.
Amendments to the Fisheries Act will reduce the ability of Aboriginal fisheries to partake in commercial activity; changes to the Navigation Protection Act (formerly the Navigable Waters Protection Act) will drastically reduce the number of sheltered from industry and development; and changes in the Indian Act will expedite the leasing of band property for commercial purposes, Jeeroburkhan said. 
All of the speakers and organizers agreed on at least one thing: non-Aboriginals have an important role to play in the Idle No More movement, and getting educated is the first step. 
“[One of the] best things settlers can do is seize this momentum and learn,” said Dolan. 
The next step, she said, is writing letters to our provincial and federal representatives.
“Our governments in North America are supposed to be democratic and are supposed to represent us, so it is up to us to say, ‘Don’t make this law that doesn’t represent how I want to live.’”
Harrington, like many others, is happy that Canadians are having these conversations. 
“It’s about realizing that we need to start privileging the ideas of Indigenous peoples…so that we can start talking…on own terms, with people instead of against them.”

2013-02-04,McGill,India,"Harper characterized as a despot by prominent Mohawk activist
Katsi’tsakwas Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk activist, and Warren Allmand, the former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development under Pierre Trudeau, debunked myths surrounding the Idle No More movement, on Wednesday.
The event, which took place in the Leacock building, drew about fifty students, First Nations people, and other members of the Montreal community. 
The organizers, Madeleine Pawlowski, a U1 Arts student, and Chanel Fournier, a U0 Arts student, felt a need to inform people – especially students living in residence – about the Idle No More movement.
“It’s hard for someone just reading the news and the media to know what’s going on,” Fournier said. 
“This event is as much for Montreal citizens as for international students who are coming here and don’t really know what’s going on in Canadian politics,” Pawlowski told The Daily. 
The organizers and the speakers agreed that it was time for Canada to make changes. “I’m so fed up with being silenced because I am an indigenous person, and on top of that, I’m a woman,” Gabriel said.
During the two-hour talk, Allmand and Gabriel spoke about social and political roots for dissatisfaction, environmental, and cultural concerns for Aboriginal communities across Canada. 
Allmand drew on his past experience as both a Liberal Member of Parliament, and a former minister involved with Aboriginal affairs. He focused his frustration on what he saw as a long-term trend of significant misconceptions by the general Canadian public.
“Some Canadians say Indigenous people are just another minority. They’re not a minority, they were here before we arrived!” Allmand said. “All these resources in the land, all this land, belongs to another people. They offered to share it with us, but not to take it from them!”
Gabriel also addressed discrimination against Aboriginal communities in academia, the media, and the general public.
This discrimination not only stemmed from vitriolic attitudes, but from simple ignorance, Gabriel argued. 
“It’s as if we are slowly being wiped away from history, and [being] put into the museums. That’s one of the things I’m really scared of happening, that our language and our culture will one day be in the museums,” she said.
Gabriel blasted Harper for his treatment of Indigenous communities in Canada, characterizing the prime minister as a “despot” who ruled cruelly and maliciously. 
“Stephen Harper has put a price tag on the human rights of Indigenous peoples,” she said. 
She also accused the Canadian government of failing to properly atone for past sins. “Thank you for the apology for the Indian residential school system, but it has to be more than mere words. You apologized for something that is classified as genocide…. You are apologizing for saying that we were inferior to you. But where is the proof that you are sorry?”
Allmand agreed with Gabriel and noted that Canada had been the last to sign the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in 2007, and that action on these rights had yet to materialize.
“How can we [as Canadians] ask Iran, Iraq, North Korea, to live up to human rights standards, if we don’t do it ourselves?” Allmand said.
The two agreed that the issues were not new, but that pressure was building. “Enough is enough,” Gabriel said. “We have had our ancestors die, going to their graves, questioning and appealing to government with the same words that we have been using for [an entire] generation.”
Despite a history of negligence regarding Aboriginal rights, Gabriel was confident that the movement would not falter. “The government looks at us and says, ‘they’re crazy Indians, and they’re going to phase out. Idle No More is just a fad.’ And I can tell you that, maybe we’ll take a break, maybe we’ll take a rest, because you know, we’re tired of being in the cold. [But] we’re going to speak up. We’re going to speak up because we cannot stand it any more.”

2013-09-30,McGill,India,"McGill hosts third annual series of talks, workshops
Correction appended October 1, 2013.
From September 23 to 27, McGill hosted its third annual Indigenous Awareness Week, which aimed to create awareness about oft-overlooked Indigenous issues at the university. The week, organized by for the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office (SEDE), saw over 480 students, staff, alumni, and community members, take part in events ranging from informational talks to interactive workshops and movie screenings.
Allan Vicaire, Indigenous Education Advisor at SEDE, spoke to the importance of the week at McGill. “I think there is a big misconception over what Indigenous people are, we have a lot of international students, and just even Canadians […] we’re not taught the proper history – we’re taught the watered down history,” he said. “We need to break down misperceptions with the truth.”
This year saw a change of the name of the week from “Aboriginal” to “Indigenous”, which, according to Vicaire, “is more of an inclusive term.” Looking to the future, Vicaire stated that the organizers were looking to alter the title once again. “It’s more than awareness […] you also want to talk about the achievements and struggles.”

“‘Who Makes the Call?’ A Panel on Indigenous Identity”
Thursday saw a critical look at the complex questions of identity faced by many Indigenous peoples in Canada, as well as issues of status and inclusion, with a panel titled “Who Makes the Call.” Paige Isaac, coordinator of McGill’s First Peoples House, moderated the panel discussion between Cecile Charlie, Skawennati Fragnito, and Michael Loft.
The panelists discussed their experiences of what it means to be Indigenous, as well as their thoughts on the importance of Indigenous legal status. After the Indian Act was enacted in 1876, many Native people faced the dilemma of being non-status – in other words, they had no legal right to own land on reserves and often faced exclusion from their own band.
In 1985, Bill C-31 amended the Indian Act to grant status to the children of Native women who married non-status men – an issue that directly affected the family of Fragnito, one of the panelists. Still, this did not end the conflicts between the legal definition of identity and self-identification.
Loft, a social worker and associate professor with McGill’s School of Social Work, explained that “bloodism,” or the practice of defining status by the amount of non-Native blood, “didn’t come from our people” but instead stemmed from the Indian Act itself.
“Once you lose your status, you can never get it back,” Loft said, explaining that status was important within a community for inclusion. He also pointed to low high school graduation rates in some Indigenous communities as an effect of a lack of inclusion.
All of the panelists emphasized that identity – and not just the oft-discussed issues of land rights or the Indian Act – was a crucial fight in the struggle for Indigenous rights.
“This isn’t just talking about numbers, or talking about rights, but this is about people,” Loft said.

“Challenges and Barriers for Indigenous Women”
The opening ceremony of Indigenous Awareness Week featured a talk given by Teresa Edwards, Director of Human Rights and International Affairs at the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC), on the struggles faced by Indigenous women across the country.
Touching on Aboriginal women and the justice system, missing and murdered women, and domestic abuse, Edwards highlighted the systemic racism within the Canadian justice system. For instance, she noted that one in three females in the federal correctional system is Aboriginal.
Edwards also spoke out against the common misperception that the women who go missing live high-risk lifestyles, stating that instead, “a high-risk lifestyle for Aboriginal women is being an Aboriginal woman.”
Edwards also spoke on the need for allies. When asked by The Daily how a student at McGill might act as an ally, Edwards said, “Education is always powerful. Non-Indigenous people can be great allies – they are going to go into the world and be judges, police, teachers. And they can in turn educate people on the real situation of Indigenous people, good and bad, to make a better Canada for everyone.”
“As an ally you can come to show your support at public, peaceful demonstrations, or on October 4 to honour the many missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada and across the globe,“ she said.
According to NWAC’s Sisters in Spirit Database, which started in 2005 to gather information on missing and murdered women across Canada, there are 582 cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women across the country.
Speaking to The Daily on the importance of Indigenous Awareness Week, Edwards stated, “If people knew and had the information they would be in a better place to make decisions and behave differently, and to be more informed with politics, with legislation, all the decisions that they make.”

“Restructuring the Indigenous-Crown Relationship in Canada: The Promise of Indigenous Multilevel Governance”
Last Tuesday, Christopher Alcantara of Wilfrid Laurier University spoke at Thomson House about strained relationships between the Crown and Indigenous communities, critiquing at the top-down approach traditionally used by the government under the Indian Act.
Canada has a history of exploiting and oppressing Indigenous populations. The Indian Act, first enacted in 1876 and later amended, is seen as an attempt to assimilate Indigenous peoples to Canadian culture, contributing to poverty and their disempowerment. While it does not govern Inuit or Métis peoples, to this day, the Act remains the main piece of legislation that governs the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Crown, despite a general consensus that the act has failed First Nations as a whole.
This, Alcantara said, is because the Canadian government continues to impose its own vision on Indigenous populations, with little consultation with tribes and band members – though recent developments, such as certain tribes’ transitions to self-governed land ownership, show that this trend may be shifting.
Alcantara argued that a multilateral governance system, in which Aboriginal groups are empowered to create policies tailored to fit the needs of their communities, should replace the current top-down approach of the Canadian government. If Indigenous populations are given freedom of choice, they will be able to experiment with different courses of action and determine how best to proceed in raising the standard of living, he said.
Some audience members questioned the effectiveness of Alcantara’s idea of “slow, incremental change” in making right the wrongs faced by Indigenous peoples at the hands of settlers.
“We must always be motivated by justice,” said Alcantara, but he noted that while large attempts at change may seem appealing, they usually do not work. Through the empowerment of First Peoples and celebration of their culture, Canada may one day see the healing of a nation that has been oppressed for centuries.

“Indigenous Health For First Nations, Inuit and Metis”
To close off the talks and lectures of Indigenous Awareness Week, Simon Brascoupé, an adjunct research professor at Carleton University, gave a presentation on the status of health and well-being of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples in Canada. Brascoupé began the talk by reciting statistics disclosing the relative poorness in both health and healthcare for Indigenous peoples as compared with non-Indigenous peoples.
According to Brascoupé, Inuit infants die at 3.6 times the rate of other Canadian babies; in 2010, tuberculosis had doubled among Inuit infants to 185 times the rate of Canadian-born non-Indigenous infants; and by mid-2010, 116 First Nations communities across Canada were under a drinking water advisory.
The health challenges for Aboriginal, Métis, and Inuit peoples range from a crisis of chronic disease to lung cancer rates. Brascoupé supported the notion that solutions to such problems should be community-based.
Brascoupé also noted the importance of advocacy in improving Aboriginal health, from organizations to individual doctors and researchers.
Aboriginal doctors, such as Malcolm King, do important work in increasing attention to Aboriginal medical care.  These doctors also cite the causes of health disparities as including factors such as colonization, migration, loss of language and culture, and disconnection from native lands.
“I’ve met a lot of Aboriginal people that say ‘I’m on my healing journey, but I’m not healed,’’’ Brascoupé said. “[It’s] because they want to break the cycle of colonization.”

“Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance”
Friday saw the screening of the documentary Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance, followed by a speech from Elder John Onawario Cree. Onawario Cree was present at the 1990 Oka Crisis, a land conflict between the Mohawk, the Quebec police, and the Canadian Army.
Director Alanis Obomsawin took the viewers through the struggle, which started in Kanehsatà:ke and the town of Oka, when the local Mohawk community attempted to protect their sacred land from development as a golf course.
After the Mohawk community decided to barricade the bridges that led to their land, the Quebec police led a raid on Mohawk territory that ended with Mohawk elders arrested and thrown in jail. The film essentially painted a portrait of the people behind the barricades.
During his presentation afterwards, Onawario Cree explained that many people didn’t understand why the Mohawk would stage an uprising. “In the [1990s], there were a lot of promises broken,” he said. “They sign treaties, and don’t honour them.”
“Now, we are protecting the land against the pipeline, but the oil companies do what they want,” he added. “It hasn’t gotten any better – it has gotten worse. We are still fighting for our land.”
Ultimately, he said, “the most important thing that came out of all this was the pride of being a human. Being a human being first, and then being a Mohawk.”

“Understanding Mohawk: Language and History”
On Tuesday, a group gathered to participate in “Kanien’kéha 100: A Super Crash Course in the Language of the People of the Flint,” a Mohawk language learning session. The session, led by Akwiratékha Martin of Kahnawake, provided a basic introduction to the Kanien’kéha language, its history, and the ongoing language revitalization efforts in Kahnawake and beyond.
Martin, a language instructor in Kahnawake, began his session – as is customary in Mohawk tradition – with the Ohenten Kariwatkwa, or the “words that come before all else.” He then began a brief history of the language and explained the etymology of the name ‘Mohawk,’ a word in the Algonquin language that translates to ‘Man-Eaters.’  For this reason, many Mohawk people prefer to refer to themselves as Kanien’kehá:ka, or ‘the People of the Flint.’
Martin also provided some context for the state of Indigenous languages today, many of which have gone extinct. For instance, there are no longer any living speakers of the Laurentian, Neutral, Erie, and Susquehannock languages, to name a few.
According to Martin, there are approximately 1,300 first language Kanien’kéha speakers today. There are also several Mohawk immersion elementary schools in various Mohawk communities; the schools continue to grade six, after which Kanien’kéha is offered as a second language course.
“While children do develop a solid base of the language […] there is something missing,” Martin said. “Many children do not become fluent speakers due to governmental standards for the curriculum, and most of the children’s parents are not speakers, often turning Kanien’kéha into a kind of ‘school language’ that goes unpracticed in the home.”
Shortcomings aside, Martin highlighted the importance of revitalization projects. Above all, he stressed the “absolute beauty” of the language, emphasizing the meaning that can be awarded to a single word. “Think of any sentence you can,” he urged the audience, “then crush it into one word. That’s how awesome Kanien’kéha is.”

“Law vs. Justice: How the Courts are preparing the way for one last, fatal, round of treaty negotiations with Indigenous Peoples in Canada”
For in-depth coverage of the talk, see the article “Problematizing Canada’s history” by Ralph Haddad in our Health and Education section.
When Mary Eberts  – a longtime lawyer whose practice is centered on equality and Indigenous rights – began her Wednesday lecture on Canadian law and Indigenous people, she considered the traditional thanks given to the Mohawk people whose ground McGill rests upon. “We as settlers should […] be in a state of perpetual thankfulness,” Eberts said. “But what have we been doing instead?”
As part of the annual Wallenberg Lecture series hosted by the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism, Eberts focused her talk on “what [Canadians] have been doing instead” – taking the land of the Indigenous peoples of Canada, and perpetuating complex legal negotiations over treaty rights.
One of the legal underpinnings of colonization, Eberts explained, was the Doctrine of Discovery, which Eberts described as “a sort of gentlemen’s agreement between the Europeans” that originated during the 1400s to govern the colonization of overseas land.
According to Eberts, under Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982, there are still cases of Indigenous rights “that are being decided by the Supreme Court of Canada today [… that invoke] the Doctrine of Discovery.”
Now, in disputes over land rights, the Canadian government requires that Indigenous peoples participate in negotiations that Eberts called inherently unequal. The government employs a “take-it-or-leave-it” approach, she said, and the court system for settling land claims is often terribly slow.
Apart from the legal precedent of land claims and negotiations in history and presently between the Canadian government and Indigenous communities, Eberts criticized the Canadian government for shying away from its past treatment of Indigenous peoples.
Although Eberts conceded she was not an expert on this particular matter, she argued that the historical treatment of Indigenous people constitutes genocide. After listing the five elements of genocide, as per the UN Convention adopted in 1948 – including killing or harming members of a particular group, or forcibly transferring children of the group to others – Eberts said, “Certainly, the intention was there.”

“McGill’s Vision: Indigenous Studies Program”
On Wednesday, Haley Dinel and Joey Shea – the former and current SSMU VP University Affairs, respectively – hosted an information session on the University’s ongoing efforts to instate an Indigenous Studies minor, an ongoing effort since the early 2000s.
 The session highlighted the findings from a forum, held by SSMU last November, that brought in participants to discussion a vision for the program. The Indigenous Studies effort will likely see its status as a minor program solidified in 2014.
 As it stands now, the minor would be nestled under the Canadian Studies program. Dr. Will Straw, Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, noted that such a move would help the “disciplinary neutrality” of the program.
One participant asked if the program would use disciplines such as sociology and social work to delve into contemporary problems facing Indigenous people, such as alcoholism and homelessness. “[It’s] a whole slew of really dark issues that First Nations are facing right now,” he said.
Dinel responded that the program, at least for the short term – especially as it was currently planned as a minor rather than a major – could not touch upon every issue that planners might like to see.
“You have to take it in baby steps,” she said.
Straw also noted that, once established as a minor with existing resources, the program would begin to mobilize to grow using outside resources. Straw predicted a move toward a major within two to four years of the program’s inception as a minor.
As for the bureaucracy tying up the program at the moment, Straw said that organizers had foreseen and planned for such an obstacle.
“I think we’ve done our homework,” he said.

2013-10-21,McGill,India,"Since 2006, Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill and SSMU have teamed up to offer Culture Shock – eight days of panels, workshops, art, and film screenings, dedicated to breaking down myths about communities of colour, Indigenous peoples, immigrants, and refugees. The annual event series openly addresses issues such as race, white supremacy, colonialism, xenophobia, and anti-migrant sentiments.
Series like Culture Shock, said Kira Page, External Coordinator at QPIRG, are important in a “broader context of neoliberalism that is telling people that racism is not an issue – that colonialism is not an issue.”
“At McGill specifically, I think there’s a comforting discourse [about] multiculturalism – that this is a diverse school, it’s all good, there’s a lot of diversity,” Page said. “Representation is certainly a barometer we can use […] but just the fact that it isn’t just white people who go to this school doesn’t mean that people don’t experience institutionalized racism in a McGill context.”
Another motivation for Culture Shock is McGill’s position on unceded Mohawk territory, Page said. “The fact that McGill is on stolen land is not just a historical issue. It’s a current issue.”

“Canada Behind Bars: On the Incarceration of Indigenous Communities”
Written by Hannah Reardon.
Statistics Canada findings show that 30 per cent of female offenders in federal prisons are Indigenous, and this figure is steadily climbing, according to Patricia Eshkibok, one of the speakers at the Canada Behind Bars panel on October 10.
Panelists Eshkibok, Jessica Danforth, and Kawate Tawe, focused mainly on the incarceration of Indigenous women in Canada, while also highlighting the crisis facing Indigenous youth. The “pipeline from school to prison,” as Danforth referred to it, is an intergenerational effect of the residential school system. Many of its effects, such as alcohol and drug abuse, identity loss, and high suicide rates, are all serious and pervasive problems, the panelists stressed, which push Indigenous youth disproportionately out of the education system and into the prison system.
Dismal health conditions, extreme homophobia, racism, and violence are all issues that face Indigenous people within the prison system. However, some efforts are being made to improve the rights of Indigenous people in the prison system. Danforth is the founder and executive director of the Native Youth Sexual Health Network, an organization that works to protect the health rights of incarcerated individuals. “You don’t lose your right to health as soon as you enter prison. Just because you’re incarcerated doesn’t mean you lose your rights as a human being,” she said.
“Colonization is happening,” said Danforth, adding that racism and loss of identity are day-to-day realities for Indigenous people. There is a pressing need, according to the panelists, to spread the truth [about] the present-day effects of colonization. Raising awareness and fighting for justice for marginalized Indigenous people is the only way to move forward, the panelists stressed. “We are here to speak truth to power,” said Danforth.

“Roundtable Discussion on Solidarity City”
Written by Olivia Larson.
QPIRG McGill and SSMU co-hosted a roundtable discussion on Montreal’s Solidarity City declaration, presented by migrant justice network Solidarity Across Borders. Dozens of public service organizations across Montreal have signed the declaration in an effort to make basic resources such as education, food, and housing accessible to non-status migrants. At the roundtable discussion, representatives from various public service organizations were present to share their successes and to discuss the challenges they have faced in implementing the declaration.
Quebec’s residency clause bars thousands of undocumented children from free schooling every year, pointed out Anne, a CEGEP teacher. She works with the committee on education, which has successfully “made this problem exist” for the government through persistent lobbying in the hopes that the word ‘resident’ will be omitted from the law.
The Food For All committee, a part of the Solidarity campaign, reaches out to food aid organizations and banks, asking them to adopt the declaration and implement a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy in regards to immigration status. So far, the committee has had relative success in signing organizations on, and thereby increasing “food justice,” as one representative put it, for non-status migrants.
Several organizations are working with Solidarity City to increase the number of subsidized housing projects across Montreal, and to make shelters for those who identify as trans* or as women safe spaces for those who are undocumented.
The shortage of available social housing for Quebec residents has made the government reluctant to expand the list of people who qualify for public housing, leaving many who are non-status homeless. Shelters have had issues with the Canadian Border Services Agency raiding and subsequently deporting paperless immigrants. The declaration, for both social housing agencies and shelters, has been extraordinarily difficult to implement, as the struggle for increased accessible living is being waged at all levels of government.
Despite myriad obstacles, Solidarity City’s powerful declaration to “fight back with solidarity, mutual aid, and direct action” is making headway in achieving equal status for all those living in Montreal.

“Race at McGill”
Written by Dana Wray.
Racial microaggressions, systemic and institutional racism, and the specific experiences of racialized people at McGill were all topics of discussion at a workshop co-facilitated by Shaina Agbayani and Annie Chen on October 16. The first half of the workshop, presented by Chen, focused on the basics of racial microaggressions, in addition to systemic and individual racism.
Microaggressions are small, everyday actions – whether verbal, behavioural, or environmental – that are hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights. Although not always done intentionally, the slow accumulation of these microaggressions over a lifetime adds up to a marginalized experience.
Agbayani gave an example of the McGill-centric website McGill Microaggressions, where people at McGill send in their experiences with racism on an interpersonal, often casual and everyday level.
Chen’s part of the workshop also debunked the myth of reverse racism. A term thrown around to describe discrimination against white people, reverse racism is often used in arguments against programs such as affirmative action.
Agbayani focused more specifically on race at McGill, and how racism manifests itself on an institutional, day-to-day, and curricular level. She highlighted that there is an underrepresentation of people of colour within McGill’s faculty, as well as a lack of financial support for initiatives addressing racism, such as the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office.
Agbayani attributed the underrepresentation of faculty and staff of colour at McGill to a “feedback loop” between a lack of diversity in the student body and in staff. “Some [people of colour] who were offered jobs at Counselling Services rejected the offers because they noted that they wanted to serve student populations that [was] more diverse, and they wanted to be a mirror of identity in a position of authority for students of colour, which they didn’t see a lot of at McGill.”
In interviews with a former McGill dean and his daughter, a current staff member, Agbayani said the lack of diversity appeared to be a systemic problem that wasn’t getting any better. “[The former dean and his daughter] haven’t seen much progress [over the past few decades]. They’ve seen a decrease in diversity visibly – not of students, they noted more students of diverse backgrounds – but in terms of faculty and staff.”
According to Agbayani, diversity is used as a superficial buzzword for McGill. “Diversity for McGill [as stated online] would reflect a pursuit of diversity as a pursuit of cosmopolitanism, as opposed to diversity as a pursuit of social justice and [a process of] redressing historical injustices.”

“Ongoing colonization: Addressing systemic violence against Indigenous women”
Written by Dana Wray and Anqi Zhang.
At the trial of two men for the brutal murder of an Indigenous woman named Pamela George, the judge presiding over the case lamented that it would be “dangerous” to convict the “bright, promising young men” that were her murderers, and that George was “just a prostitute.”
According to Candice Cascanette, a member of Missing Justice, a Montreal-based organization and the leader of the workshop, this racist and sexist language is common in the media and the broader Canadian society when talking about Indigenous women. In Canada, there are 600 missing or murdered Indigenous women, although some activists argue that the number is closer to 3000. In addition, Indigenous women are five times as likely to face violence, a fact Cascanette called proof of “ongoing colonization.”
“Talking about the colonial present requires us to go to the colonial past,” asserted Cascanette, before giving a brief historical account of the theft of Turtle Island and subsequent colonization. As Indigenous women had power connected directly to this land within their communities, Cascanette explained, they were a threat to the patriarchal European forces, and therefore a target.
More recent practices like the residential school system continued the process of colonization by separating families, forcing Christianity upon Indigenous children, and attempting to destroy Indigenous culture. According to Cascanette, the “cultural genocide” extended past the schools, into the forces – such as the Indian Act – that imposed patriarchy, capitalism, and other oppressive European structures on Indigenous communities.
However, Cascanette also dispelled the notion that Indigenous people were victims without any agency. “There have been over 500 years of colonization and over 500 years of resistance – I just want to make that clear.”

“Teach-In Against the Charter of Values”
Written by Cem Ertekin.
In preparation for the October 20 demonstration organized by the Ensemble Contre la Charte Xénophobe Coalition, Aishah Nofal, Bochra Manaï, and Vincent Tao facilitated a teach-in on resisting the proposed Quebec Charter of Values. The event focused on what the Charter is presently, and what social ramifications it could have.
Tao, one of the lead organizers of the upcoming demonstration on October 20, outlined the Parti Québecois’s proposed content of the Charter. The Charter aims to ban the wearing of religious symbols, a goal which Tao critiques as discriminatory. “This is state sanctioned social exclusion of women of faith who need government services,” said Tao.
Manaï, a PhD candidate in Urban Studies at Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, said that the Charter has a clear electoral agenda. After conducting research looking at inter-ethnic relationships in middle class neighbourhoods, Manaï has concluded that people see diversity mostly when there is political discussion surrounding it.
Nofal, a second-year Law student at McGill, called the Charter blatantly discriminatory. “The PQ claims that the ban of religious symbols will neutralize [the] public sector. It deprives minorities of choice. They can’t simply discard their beliefs. What this Charter is saying is that some beliefs are suitable while others are not. […] This is really frightening.

“Political Prisoners’ Struggles in Palestine”
Written by Ralph Haddad.
Tadamon!’s workshop on October 16 discussed the harsh reality that Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip face when arrested by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Tadamon! – an Arabic word for solidarity – is a Montreal-based collective that works in solidarity with struggles for self-determination, equality, and justice in the Middle East as well as diaspora communities in Montreal and beyond.
As of 2013, there are an estimated 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel. These prisoners are illegally held in poorly-maintained facilities, tortured in interrogations, and are subject to immediate maltreatment upon arrest. Israel was condemned by the UN earlier this year for its “abusive” treatment of prisoners, who are also denied family visits, Palestinian-based education, and basic healthcare.
What is important to note is that Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to separate legal systems – Jewish settlers are seen by an Israeli civilian judge, while Palestinians are seen by an Israeli military judge. Furthermore, rates of incarceration for Palestinian children are almost ninefold compared to those for Jewish children in the occupied territories, according to the workshop. Some Palestinians are arrested using administrative detention, supposedly used in times of emergency for strict security reasons (though Israel has an almost perpetual state of emergency). This form of detention allows for prisoners to be prosecuted without trial and charge, and are kept in prison for a period for up to six months, subject to renewal.
Today, there are around 178 Palestinians under administrative detention. The number has decreased “due to international grassroots pressure,” claimed Paul Di Stefano, a member of Tadamon!, “but the number is still extraordinarily high.” He continued that this form of detention allows the state to “circumvent” people’s rights.
According to Tadamon!, Israel also outsources its human rights violations by employing a private security company, G4S, to run its prisons. This privately-owned British security company also provides the IDF with equipment for checkpoints. Pressure in the form of hunger strikes on behalf of prisoners, or from movements such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) are still used today in order to pressure Israel to stop its maltreatment of prisoners and give them better care and humane services.
“Palestinians can be tried as adults as young as 16, and are interrogated by Israeli soldiers,” said Amy Darwish, an organizer for Tadamon!

“Unsettling and Decolonizing: An Introductory Workshop”
Written by Joelle Dahm.
Heidi Pridy and Philippe – who preferred not to give his last name – of the Anti-Colonial Solidarity Collective led an introductory workshop on unsettling and decolonizing, urging settlers to be respectful and effective allies to Indigenous populations on Turtle Island – also known as North America.
After an introduction to the vocabulary of decolonization and the history of colonialism in Canada, and specifically in the Montreal area, participants engaged in an interactive discussion on works by Cree artist Kent Monkman and documentaries dealing with decolonization.
Later in the workshop, Pridy explained that people often react to negative stereotypes, but feel comfortable about positive stereotypes that might glorify the group in question and give it a preconceived identity. “It does not matter if a stereotype is negative or positive. The problem is that it’s is a fixed representation and an abstraction of a complex dynamic.”
“When one group is marginalized, another one is benefitting. We need to understand ourselves as complicit in and beneficiaries of the illegal settlement of Indigenous people’s land,” said Pridy. “This appropriation often leads people to experience feelings of guilt. Guilt is a state of self-absorption that upholds privilege in a lot of ways and can really immobilize people from doing anything. We would encourage people to embrace that discomfort as a sign of a much-needed shift in self-consciousness.”
In special regard of upcoming Halloween festivities, Pridy urged people to be conscious about their self-representation, especially considering “sexy Native women costumes” sold in stores.
“Given the grade of sexual violence against Native women, that is really problematic,” Pridy stated. “Using someone else’s cultural symbols to exercise a personal need in self-expression is an exercise in privilege. That does not mean that cultural exchange never does happen and that we never partake in someone else’s culture, but there needs to be some element of mutual understanding for it to be a true exchange.”

“Indigenous feminisms and historical and contemporary two-spirit identities in North America”
Written by Hannah Besseau.
On October 10, Molly Swain and Lindsay Nixon facilitated a workshop on contemporary Indigenous feminisms, anti-capitalism, and two-spirit identities. The workshop tackled what Swain described as ‘the sexist and racist colonial values” of Canada’s ongoing violence against Indigenous people.
“We hear a lot about the victimization of Indigenous women, but not a lot about the resistance,” Swain told The Daily. “I wanted to introduce people to the topic of Indigenous feminisms and get them thinking of it not just in terms of within [academic settings], but in their daily lives.”
Swain emphasized environmental degradation and the role of capitalism in the oppression of Indigenous peoples. “Canada was […] founded very much on the principles of resource extraction, pushing further and further inland. […] John A Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada, and his project of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was very much an extension of that need to keep pushing and [to] quell Native dissent and any Natives’ resistance to bring these dissenters under the fold.”
According to Swain, “colonialism, misogyny, and capitalism are deeply intertwined.” Decolonization – a continuous process whereby settlers, or non-Indigenous people, attempt to help heal the consequences of colonialism – is a crucial step in the struggle.
“It’s one thing to talk about decolonization and to acknowledge the land that we’re on, but it’s another thing to go out there and actually get involved in the struggles that are taking place, and to learn from those communities to figure out how to engage in a real responsible relationship with these folks. I think that’s a really important aspect of decolonization.”
Swain and Nixon are both co-founders of QPIRG McGill’s new working group, the Indigenous Women and Two-Spirit Harm Reduction Coalition. The group aims to provide resources and materials to Indigenous women and two-spirit people.
“We’re hoping to provide people with free materials such as needles, condoms, as well as resource guides to things like consent, safe sex, good drug-use practice, navigating the prison system, and guides to Montreal services,” said Swain. “Our group is open to Indigenous-identified folks only because we wanted this to be very much work we’re doing for our community.”
Culture Shock also featured a workshop on decolonization for settlers – scroll up to read Joelle Dahm’s article on it. For more information on the Indigenous Women and Two-Spirit Harm Reduction Coalition, contact ndn.harmredux@gmail.com.

2014-01-27,McGill,India,"Deepan Budlakoti finds himself in bureaucratic limbo
In May 2010, Deepan Budlakoti officially became stateless. Although he was born in Canada and held a Canadian passport, the government claimed that the passport had been issued in error, and that he had never been a Canadian citizen to begin with.
Budlakoti’s immigration troubles began when he was in prison for five months in late 2009 and was put into solitary confinement.
“I had an altercation with a guard, I was thrown in the hole, and a guard came up to me and asked me, while I was in the hole, if I was a citizen or not,” he said.
After providing his birth certificate and passport as proof of his Canadian citizenship, Budlakoti was informed that he was nonetheless not a citizen.
The government’s claim was based on the sole exception to the act granting Canadian citizenship to babies born on Canadian soil. The exception denies automatic citizenship to children born in Canada to diplomats without Canadian status. Although Budlakoti’s parents did work for the Indian High Commissioner in 1989, according the family diplomatic status in Canada, they stopped work there several months before Budlakoti’s birth.
After a series of hearings and investigations by the Canadian government, he was served with a deportation order in 2011 while serving a second prison sentence in Ottawa.
The term “double punishment” is used to describe the phenomenon of non-citizens being deported in addition to serving time in prison for a crime.
Double punishment is enshrined in a provision of the Immigrant and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which states that a “foreign national” can be deemed inadmissible on the grounds of “criminality” or “serious criminality” if they are convicted of a crime in Canada landing them with a sentence of over six months in prison.
“I had an altercation with a guard, I was thrown in the hole, and a guard came up to me and asked me, while I was in the hole, if I was a citizen or not.”
“[Double punishment] is racist, because it’s highly racialized in terms of who gets criminalized and how people get criminalized. There are certain communities that are disproportionately affected by double punishment, and that happens to completely coincide and completely correlate with those communities that are racially profiled,” said Jaggi Singh, No One Is Illegal activist, during a panel on double punishment co-hosted by CKUT and The Daily.
A person is considered stateless when, as in the case of Budlakoti, they no longer have citizenship in any nation of the world. The implications of statelessness are far-reaching and complex; when a person has no official citizenship they have no status where they are, but also no papers to cross any borders and go elsewhere.
The 1961 United Nations (UN) Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness entered into force in 1975. The convention pronounced it “desirable to reduce statelessness by international agreement.”
It is unclear how many people in Canada are currently stateless. Many of them are likely living in detention centres, something mandated by Canadian law if they are judged to be a flight risk or a risk to society, or if their identity is in question according to the IRPA. (This is also the policy for refugee claimants and other people without status in Canada.)
Budlakoti himself was detained for several months at the Toronto West Detention Centre, but was released after Peter Stieda, his lawyer, successfully made the case that he did not fulfill the conditions for detention under the IRPA.
According to a document obtained by The Daily, Budlakoti found himself under many restrictions as a condition for his release, including a curfew and an order to “keep the peace and be on good behaviour.” The restrictions were later lightened, but only slightly. He also found himself bound by his newfound statelessness and lack of Canadian status: everything became a struggle.
“I had to apply for a work permit, I had to apply to get my [driver’s] license back, I had to apply for a social insurance card. Everything was a challenge,” he said at a talk on his case in Montreal on January 21.
“It doesn’t matter what I think, but Deepan will stay. There’s no way they can let [him be deported], there would be an uproar,” offered Singh during the panel.
Budlakoti and his supporters haven’t always been so sure. In December 2012, just before he was released from prison, the Ottawa Citizen reported that Budlakoti was “resigned to the fact that his life outside prison will begin in India.”
The situation took a turn once he found out through an access to information request that India was refusing to accord him status and wouldn’t accept him if the Canadian government attempted to deport him there.
Now, Budlakoti has thrown himself entirely into a campaign for his case and against his deportation. The Justice for Deepan campaign has social media support, and several high-profile human rights associations have written letters of support for the campaign, including Amnesty International and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.
“[Double punishment] is racist, because it’s highly racialized in terms of who gets criminalized and how people get criminalized.”
As part of his campaign, Budlakoti is currently on a speaking tour through several cities in Canada. When he passed through Montreal on January 21 and 22, he paid a visit to Justin Trudeau’s office with supporters from Solidarity Across Borders (SAB).
According to Budlakoti and SAB, Trudeau had pledged his support to Budlakoti’s case in 2011. Trudeau, who was elected as the leader of the Liberal party in April 2013, now remains silent on Budlakoti’s case. In response to Budlakoti’s campaign’s repeated requests that Trudeau take a stand, his assistant recently wrote, “I am very sorry to have to inform you that unfortunately Mr. Trudeau will not be able to intervene in this file.”
When Budlakoti and his support team arrived at Trudeau’s Montreal riding on January 22, they were met by Max Roy, the office manager. Once they had passed over a prepared letter and made prepared statements on Budlakoti’s situation, they found that Roy wasn’t willing to set up an appointment with Trudeau, the real goal of their visit. When the group insisted, Roy escorted them out of the office, punctuated by different permutations of a request to “please leave the office now.” They left empty-handed.
“Some [politicians] have been [supportive], some neutral, and some don’t respond. Thomas Mulcair’s [the leader of the New Democratic Party] office, in general, [has been supportive],” said Budlakoti, standing outside Trudeau’s office’s glass double-doors after the visit.
Mary Foster, an activist with SAB, jumped in. “But [Mulcair] has refused to take a public position […] when we’ve asked him to speak out actually where it counts on the public scene, it’s been zero,” she said, adding, “The hypocrisy of these people…”

2014-03-17,McGill,India,"Commissioners connect residential schools to violence against Indigenous women
On March 13, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) visited McGill, as part of a conference entitled “Whose Truth? What Kind of Reconciliation? The Importance of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions for Promoting Democratic Good Governance,” sponsored by the Institute for the Study of International Development.
The Canadian TRC, established in 2008, aims to document the legacy of the Canadian Indian residential schools system, and the lived experiences and histories of those affected by it. Residential schools, the last of which closed in 1996, were notorious for their brutal treatment of Indigenous children, who experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of caretakers.
Children also suffered the more insidious effects of forced assimilation and separation from their families and native cultures. At least 4,000 children died while attending the schools.
Commissioners stressed the longstanding, intergenerational effects of the school system, and emphasized the need for healing, mutual understanding, and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians.
“Recognition, for us, is about changing this history of oppression and negativity, and allowing Canadians to relate to each other in a more positive way,” said Murray Sinclair, Chair of the Commission, and former judge.
Marie Wilson, another one of the commissioners, implicated Canadian culture and society as a whole, and stressed that the residential schools system was a product of Canadian policy, and not solely an Indigenous issue.
“It says right here, in the agreement, that reconciliation is ongoing – it’s individual and collective, and it names all the parties to the agreement – and it also names the people of Canada,” she explained.
“How will we get that word out there, and how will we make it so that the people of Canada register that this belongs to us all?”
Commissioners also noted that many of the challenges facing Indigenous people today are reflective of the damage incurred by the system, not only on the survivors of abuse, but also, through them, on their families and their communities.
One audience member, who identified as an Aboriginal woman, asked commissioners about the need for action regarding missing and murdered Indigenous women.
“While the government doesn’t see a commission on Aboriginal women as a necessity at this time, could you please find some safeguards for Aboriginal women on our behalf? Because we trust in your vision, we believe in your mandate, and all we want is pretty small compared to what the world offers,” the audience member said.
Research has shown that while Indigenous women make up approximately 3 per cent of the Canadian population, between 2000 and 2008 they represented 10 per cent of all female victims of homicides.
“I think that the fact that [the Commission] is given the trust as widely as they are and given a justice mission, that we have to respect that opportunity,” the same audience member later said to The Daily. “They’ve asked us to care and to be involved, and so caring and being involved means asking them to consider ideas that matter to us, that we suffer silently around.”
Chief Wilton Littlechild, another one of the commissioners, agreed with the audience member, emphasizing to The Daily not only the urgency behind growing numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women, but also the connection of the issue to the residential school system.
To illustrate the connection, he related a story to The Daily in which he attended the funeral of a murdered woman, who turned out to be the daughter of classmates of his from his time in the residential school system.
Littlechild also pointed to the recent release of a report by Members of Parliament on the Special Committee on Violence Against Indigenous Women that failed to recommend a public inquiry into the problem – a move that advocates have long pushed for.
“Our first sacred teaching that we use in our hearings and our national events is respect,” Littlechild said. “What I’m seeing here now, through the parliamentary committee, is a lack of respect for life.”

2014-09-29,McGill,India,"University refuses to acknowledge responsibility toward Six Nations
Last week, during a panel titled “Indigenous students at McGill: before and beyond graduation” that was held as part of the Indigenous Awareness Week, McGill graduate and Columbia University anthropology professor Audra Simpson spoke about a little-known aspect of McGill’s legacy: its link to a federal debt owed to the Six Nations of the Grand River Indigenous community.
“The common way of narrating the founding of McGill [is as one of] Canada’s most important and illustrious universities that came into being because of this 1811 endowment from this Scottish so-called merchant from Glasgow, James McGill. In other commemorative accounts […] that [detail] the financial problems of the first forty years of McGill, no mention is made of the crucial transfer of funds from the Six Nations of the Grand River in the 1850s that helped to save McGill from bankruptcy […] in fact, helped the university stay open,” Simpson said.
In the mid-1800s, amidst a financial crisis, the pre-Confederation government of the Province of Canada loaned money to McGill. The government funded the loan with money taken from the Six Nations’ Trust Funds, of which the government was the fiduciary trustee. The transfer of money was made without the permission of the communities of the Six Nations.
While McGill paid back this loan and a subsequent loan by 1881 to the federal government, the government never reimbursed the Six Nations’ Trust Funds. This was discovered by Philip Monture, previously the director of the Land Claims Research Office at the Six Nations of the Grand River.
“I was doing research into the history, and found out the government was misusing funds,” Monture told The Daily in an interview. “Using the Indian Affairs’ own records of their trust funds, we were able to trace the transfer of money to finance McGill [when the university was] near bankruptcy.”
After the discovery, Monture began litigation for the government’s accounting with the funds, which, if returned with interest, would now amount to around $1.7 billion.
Acknowledging that the Canadian federal government cannot afford the amount owed to the Six Nations, Monture has attempted since 1989 to form other arrangements to compensate for the federal government’s failure to repay the debt.
“The Crown at the time was acting as our trustees – to do the best for the beneficiaries of our trust – and they failed,” Monture said. “In reality, they were using any revenues that were created from our lands and our resources to finance the country. We were the only bank in town. They were given the power of fiduciary trust, and they were fraudulent.”
“We tried to set up an arrangement with McGill where we could talk and perhaps set up a subsequent arrangement with Six Nations to be able to give [Six Nations community members] education there,” added Monture. “It was unheard [by McGill].”
Monture hoped the University would at least acknowledge that Six Nations funds saved the University from bankruptcy. “I feel there’s a moral obligation to at least step up to the plate for the people of McGill to at least do something,” he said.
The McGill administration, however, disagreed. “[The loan was contracted] from the government, which was managing Aboriginal lands and proceeds derived from such lands, including rental and sale,” Vice-Principal (Communications and External Relations) Olivier Marcil told The Daily in an email. “McGill University has fully repaid its debts and owes nothing to the Six Nations.”
According to Social Work Academic Associate and Kahnawá:ke community member Michael Loft, there is little pressure or advocacy on this issue from within the McGill community. Loft said that while he had heard quiet musings about the conflict, no one he works with knows much about it, so “there’s no point in squabbling.”
Since McGill contracted the loan from the government, the majority of legal effort in this case has been directed toward the Canadian federal government.
The Six Nations, represented by an elected council, filed a statement of claim in 1995 against Canada and Ontario regarding the Crown’s handling of Six Nations property, money, and other assets before and after the Confederation.
In 2004, the Six Nations council put this action on hold, hoping that discussions with the government would be successful. They were not, and the 1995 litigation was reintroduced in 2009.
“The government of Canada has not made any public statements about this case, stating that these matters are in litigation and cannot be commented on,” Monture told The Daily in an email.
“I think that everyone knows about it – McGill knows about it, the Crown knows about it,” said Monture. “[They’re] denying it and delaying it, saying that ‘Canada should do that,’ and [then] Canada says ‘well, McGill benefitted from that loan.’ Whether it’s paid back, I don’t know. The only thing I know is that we don’t ever see that [money] coming back to Six Nations. We have never seen it come back.”

2014-10-30,McGill,India,"SSMU Equity Committee hopes to minimize offensive costumes at 4Floors
Last Monday, around thirty people – mostly students of colour – attended the SSMU Equity Committee’s forum on cultural appropriation, which invited students to join the Committee for a discussion of how oppression and privilege leads to cultural exploitation. The forum was held in the AUS Lounge and was facilitated by SSMU Equity Commissioner Sta Kuzviwanza, as well as by Committee members Aishwarya Singh and Roma Nadeem.
To begin, Kuzviwanza and Singh shared their own experiences with cultural appropriation. Kuzviwanza described her relationship with the music industry, where white artists have for years been appropriating elements of black music that are deeply rooted in culture and identity. “I’ve found a lot of offence in how certain people have taken these elements of music, these elements of people’s identities, and they have made it their own without acknowledging where it comes from,” she said.
Singh described her experience as an immigrant from India who moved to Delaware in the period following 9/11.
“One thing that does go unacknowledged is how much fear there was in South Asian and Middle Eastern communities after 9/11 happened,” Singh said. “Around this time, I got to notice a lot of brown immigrants making an effort to change their image, policing what they would wear so they would look more assimilated. My own mom, for example, wouldn’t wear the bindi anymore, or when we were going out then she wouldn’t wear anything vaguely Indian or South Asian.”
“Now, when I see a white girl wearing a bindi, it’s like, ‘Really? Now it’s okay?’ My mom still can’t go out to the airport wearing Indian clothes without getting a ‘random security check,’ but somehow when the same white people belonging to the same social group who were causing this are appropriating our fashions, it’s somehow acceptable,” said Singh.
To initiate discussions on cultural appropriation, facilitators gave attendees a list of terms along with definitions. The list/handout defined cultural appropriation as the adoption of items or elements from another culture that is not one’s own, especially from the culture of a marginalized group, without invitation from the original culture.
“My mom still can’t go out to the airport wearing Indian clothes without getting a ‘random security check,’ but somehow when the same white people belonging to the same social group who were causing this are appropriating our fashions, it’s somehow acceptable.”
However, many participating in the forum had difficulty with the last part of this definition.
“Some people justify it by saying, ‘I have an Indian friend who says it’s okay to wear a bindi, so it’s okay’ – that doesn’t make it right,” said one attendee.
Students also discussed how even if the appropriation is done out of a false sense of solidarity or ‘appreciation,’ it is still disrespectful. “I feel like when people exoticize and fetishize a culture, it really dehumanizes the people that belong to that culture,” said Singh.
“They have the privilege of being the ones who are able to give this perspective of Asia, and a lot of times it’s not accurate of the actual cultural things that are happening in those regions,” said one participant, drawing on the example of orientalism in the 19th century.
Throughout the evening, participants found it difficult to explicitly distinguish instances of cultural appropriation from those of cultural exchange, where people of different cultures share their heritage and customs. Some questions that arose included whether using souvenir trinkets, particularly ones with religious or cultural significance, for decor might be cultural appropriation, or whether a person of a certain ethnicity who has never experienced or encountered the culture associated with their people could potentially appropriate their own culture.
One participant suggested that it is important to give weight to certain appropriations over others, and that not all injustices are created equal. “I think it’s very dangerous to say that all of these appropriations are equally wrong, because not all of these cultures are equally treated in society,” she said.
“I could be spat at and told that I’m a ‘fucking terrorist’ because I’m wearing a headscarf, but then some other person could be a) wearing it to be cool and b) wearing it because they find it nice or whatever, and not have that same reaction,” the participant continued. “No one is going to attack you in the street […] for wearing a cross. So even though I do agree with you that whatever religion, whatever culture, it’s always wrong, it’s not fair to say that it’s equally wrong.”
One participant, a first-year PhD student, challenged the entire idea of cultural appropriation. “What has always bothered me about the cultural appropriation narrative is that it doesn’t challenge identities that are thought to be solid. It reapplies them and it polices their borders.” He said that he thought identity should be fluid and that the restrictions discussed at the forum on what a person can and cannot do should be fought entirely.
Other participants disagreed, saying that while the situation he described might be ideal, it is not realistic considering the oppressive and unequal power structures that have been established over time.
Though Nadeem expressed high satisfaction with the discussion overall, one thing she noted was that most of the attendees already had quite a bit of prior knowledge on cultural appropriation. “I know that there’s a huge population out there that doesn’t quite understand these terms and concepts, so I would hope to reach out to a broader audience, and hope they would be able to partake in these conversations too.”
The forum was held as part of a campaign to raise awareness of issues related to culturally apropriative Halloween costumes in preparation for 4Floors, SSMU’s annual Halloween party.
Last year, SSMU faced criticism for its costume campaign, as it consisted of pictures of people in culturally apropriative Halloween costumes demonstrating how students should not dress. That costume campaign was a response to an incident of blackface at 4Floors in 2012. However, according to Nadeem, the campaign has changed significantly this year, as the photo promotions have not been employed, and the overall push to keep offensive outfits from entering 4Floors has been limited to the forum as well as informative worksheets, definitions, and articles to educate students on cultural appropriation.
According to Nadeem, SSMU executives, Equity Committee members, and volunteers will be present at 4Floors this year to bring people aside if they feel a costume is overtly problematic.

2014-11-24,McGill,India,"Concordia Sikhs host discussion of the events of 1984
Warning: This article contains discussion of graphic violence and rape. 
On November 13, the Concordia Sikh Students Association held an event to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the 1984 Sikh genocide, during which thousands of Sikhs in India were killed and displaced from their homes. Around twenty people, most of whom were Sikh, attended the event, which featured screenings of short films followed by a discussion.
Two of the videos shown described the events of 1984, when, in June, the Indian government enacted Operation Blue Star, a military operation intended to “break the backbone” of Sikh ‘separatists.’ It ordered the bombing of a prominent gurdwara (a Sikh place of worship) and the massacre of the people inside, under the guise of combating a separatist, terrorist movement in the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab.
The following November, India’s prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. In response to the assassination, anti-Sikh mobs engaged in a genocide of approximately 30,000 Sikhs.
Many attendees had relatives in India at the time, and some described how their families had been directly affected by the events of 1984.
One participant said that her family lived in South Delhi at the time, and, for three weeks, did not leave their house, during and after the period of genocide. When they did go outside they saw that the gutters were filled with bodies.
“[The bodies] were dismembered, but the only thing you could tell was you could see kara [a metal bracelet Sikhs wear] and you could see the person had long hair.” She said they were left for around two or three months.
“My family had Hindu neighbours and tenants, so when the mob did come, when they were passing the street, these guys stood in front of the gate and warded [the mob] off,” said one participant.
Some of the videos played reflected participants’ experiences, as they depicted refugee camps filled with Sikhs displaced by the genocide, many covered in burns where mobs had poured kerosene on them and tried to light them on fire. Another video showed the aftermath of the genocide twenty years later, speaking to women in the “Widow Colony,” in Western New Delhi, where impoverished women whose husbands and children were killed in the genocide still live today.
All of the videos shown said that, in addition to the systematic killing of Sikh men, women, and children, Sikh women and girls were also targeted with sexual violence – many of the women who survived the genocide were raped while their husbands and children were killed.
An elder Sikh man present at the discussion, whom everyone at the discussion referred to as “uncle,” explained that the tensions between Sikhs and Hindus dated back to the independence of India from British colonial rule. He said that, when India received its independence from Britain, the Hindus asked the Sikhs to remain a part of India instead of splitting into their own country. 
Sikh leaders sat down with prominent Hindu figures, including Mahatma Gandhi, and were promised that the Punjab would be an independent state. However, many at the discussion said that the Sikhs suffered great oppression as a minority: they were paid very little for their agricultural products, they had limited access to clean water, they were not allowed to list Punjabi as their first language, and they were forced to adopt Hindu customs.
According to one participant, the Indian government unofficially facilitated the genocide, sending buses full of jailed criminals, who were promised shorter sentences in exchange for their participation, to villages for the purpose of killing the Sikhs. 
The prisoners were provided with addresses, voting lists, and other government information, and were authorized to stop trains to look for, and murder, Sikh passengers. Civilians were also encouraged to kill the Sikhs, storming their houses as police turned a blind eye.
Speaking to the legacy of the genocide, many agreed that it is important to raise awareness of it, and spoke against “forgiving and forgetting” the past. One participant noted that the Indian government actively tries to hide the truth from the general public.
“One thing I find that’s very shocking is, when you go to India and you look at their history textbooks in high school, even at the university level, there’s no mention of it at all, like absolutely none,” she said.
The uncle brought up the point that, while the Indian government may not want the world to know about what happened, the presence of the Widow Colony serves as a constant reminder for Sikhs about the injustice they still face, and may be intended to prevent further Sikh mobilization and activism.
Some mentioned the immense danger of speaking about the oppression of Sikhs in India. The uncle told the story of Jaswant Singh Khalra, a human rights activist who was extremely vocal about the Sikh children who went missing in the years following the genocide.
Khalra discovered the cremation of around 25,000 unidentified Sikh bodies by the Indian government, and presented his findings to the Indian high court. In 1995, Khalra left India and traveled around Canada to present his findings. According to the uncle, Khalra returned to India knowing it would be a threat to his life, and within 15 days of his arrival, he was abducted by the police and killed.
Some said they had not known much about the genocide prior to attending to the discussion, or knew other Sikhs who knew nothing or were misinformed of the events. The information on the genocide has been coming out recently, and much is still not known, as the Indian government continues to cover up its actions.

2015-02-23,McGill,India,"Community cites mismanagement, demands control over own finances 
As part of their ongoing struggle against the Canadian government, the Chief and Council of the Algonquins of Barriere Lake (ABL) have filed a lawsuit against the government and their current and previous third-party managing companies, Hartel Financial Management Corporation and BDO Canada.
The lawsuit, filed on January 30 for $30 million in damages, claims that the government and managers have harmed the community “by mismanaging and withholding funds that were to be used for the benefit of the community and its members,” according to a press release from the ABL.
The managers currently hold the community’s money in a trust, according to the press release, effectively placing the ABL community’s funds out of their control and leaving the community with little agency over its own finances.
“As it is now, the community is dissatisfied with how third-party management has continuously kept us in the dark,” Barriere Lake’s Interim Director-General Tony Wawatie told The Daily.
“We have requested information regarding our financial status, and it was repeatedly refused or ignored,” Wawatie continued. He added that the managers did not work well with the ABL and did not listen to what the community members asked of them.
The press release expanded on this discord, noting that managers have “ignored our reasonable requests for basic information, and have bounced cheques to suppliers, interfered with our economic relations with suppliers, hired and fired employees without authority, and otherwise proven themselves completely unconcerned with the interests, wellbeing, and future of our community.”
According to both Wawatie and the press release, the managers charged millions of dollars in fees to the community, as they take a 10 per cent fee of every project they take on, whether or not the deficit is reduced. This money was paid by the ABL community, even though the ABL did not want the help of the managers.
This lawsuit comes after growing tension between the third-party management program and the ABL. Last December, the ABL sent out a press release calling for food and donations for 15 Algonquin families, including 25 children, to whom the federal government refused welfare checks after the ABL failed to comply with the First Nations Financial Transparency Act as protest against the community’s lack of agency over its own finances under the third-party management system.
“We will not back down. We will never back down, our parents and grandparents did not back down, and that is why our land is still protected.”
Wawatie also noted that the infrastructure and training programs the managers were supposed to arrange for the community were never provided. “One of the things that the third-party managers were supposed to do was to come up with some capacity development [and] training for the community members,” he said.
According to a document released by the ABL in 2014, Barriere Lake has been reduced to 59 acres of reserve, on which “the socioeconomic conditions of the community are extremely poor.” The unemployment rate ranges from 80 to 90 per cent, and a housing crisis has lead to on average seven people living in a home, though this number can be as high as 18 to 23 people.
“Our members continue to experience [abject] living conditions, in spite of the tremendous wealth generated through resource extraction within our traditional territory,” the press release reads. “Our roads, water, hydro, school, and social services remain gravely underfunded, when compared to the funding available to Canadians living in non-First Nations communities.”
The Hartel corporation declined to comment. BDO also declined to comment, citing the fact that the lawsuit is currently ongoing. As of press time, neither Hartel nor BDO have responded to ABL’s claims.
James Campbell, a member of the educational activist network Educators for Peace and Justice, condemned the management system and expressed solidarity with the ABL.
“The imposition of third-party management is simply the latest stage of the federal government’s attempts to break any and all forms of resistance by the people of Barriere Lake,” Campbell wrote in an email to The Daily on behalf of Educators for Peace and Justice.
“It is only possible because of the continued existence of an explicitly racist [and] white-supremacist piece of legislation [The Indian Act]. It is a direct attack on the people of Barriere Lake and we support their fight against the racist laws and policies of the Canadian government.”
“There [have] been many different ways that the Canadian and Quebec governments have tried to destroy the community and the language and the culture and the way of life that the Algonquins of Barriere Lake have,” noted Kira Page, external coordinator of Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill.
Educators for Peace and Justice and QPIRG McGill were two of over fifty organizations who supported a list of demands set forth by ABL in 2008 to the governments of Quebec and Canada, insisting these governments honour the agreements of 1991, 1997, and 1998, and respect the self-sufficiency of the ABL and the conservation of their languages and culture.
Wawatie noted that the current management system goes against these two agreements, and that since the signing of the 1991 and 1998 agreements, the Quebec government has done little to nothing to ensure the self-sufficiency of the ABL.
The ABL has long resisted the Canadian government’s attempts to impose regulations and programs and promote resource extraction on their lands.
They have employed legal actions in the past – they filed a lawsuit against the federal government in 2010 after the Minister of Indian Affairs forced them into adopting an elective governance system, under Section 74 of the Indian Act, which implements a foreign system of governance onto the community, invalidating customary leadership structures as a legitimate source of governance.
“The imposition of third-party management is simply the latest stage of the federal government’s attempts to break any and all forms of resistance by the people of  Barriere Lake.”
According to barrierelakesolidarity.org, a platform sustained by the Barriere Lake Solidarity QPIRG McGill working group, this band council has made deals with forestry companies and other industries, against the general desires of the community, and now Barriere Lake sees the extraction of $100 million in resources annually, none of which goes to the ABL.
The ABL have also worked in collaboration with other communities and community organizations to resist these measures, holding protests in Ontario and Quebec to protest the Section 74 electoral process.
In 2008, the ABL created a blockade on the highway that passed through their lands, demanding the government give the community a voice in the decision to develop 10,000 square kilometres of the land on which they live.
A video on their website describes the struggle of the ABL.
“Our Algonquin community of 400 people is fighting for control of our land, our government, and our way of life,” says an unidentified voice. “We will not back down. We will never back down, our parents and grandparents did not back down, and that is why our land is still protected.”

2015-09-28,McGill,India,"Events bring attention to Indigenous cultures
From September 21 to 25, the Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office hosted McGillís annual Indigenous Awareness Week. During the week-long series of events, participants honoured and celebrated Indigenous cultures in McGill and beyond, with the aim of increasing awareness. Events included a speech by Truth and Reconciliation Commissioner Marie Wilson, a Kairos blanket exercise, dreamcatcher making workshops, and much more.
On September 24, organizers of Indigenous Awareness Week held a symposium on the gendered nature of colonialism and activism by Indigenous women, featuring a talk by Audra Simpson, a Mohawk woman from Kahnawake.
Simpson is a professor of anthropology at Columbia University, and author of Mohawk Interruptus, a book about the struggles of Mohawk people in so-called Quebec to maintain political sovereignty. At the talk, Simpson shared one of her new articles, which describes the way society overlooks the Indigenous movements which are organized and led by Indigenous women.
The catalyst for Simpson’s article was a 2004 interview with Yasser Arafat, former leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, who said Palestinians “are not red Indians,” implying there might actually be hope for the Palestinian struggle against colonialism, whereas colonialism has triumphed over Indigenous groups in the U.S. and Canada. This idea that Indigenous groups have bowed down to colonial forces and are no longer capable of effective resistance, Simpson noted, is commonly held, but is also completely false, and stems from a broader lack of understanding of Indigenous histories and societies.
Simpson described how colonialism is known only by “inaccurate and heroic versions of what is fundamentally a dispossession – a scene of stealing.”
Simpson also described how colonialism is known only by “inaccurate and heroic versions of what is fundamentally a dispossession – a scene of stealing.” She explained how the concept of sharing, perpetuated by stories such as those told at Thanksgiving, paint a picture of equality and camaraderie between settlers and Indigenous peoples, hiding the betrayal of Indigenous nations and the “dismembering violence and wars that raged on for hundreds of years.” Simpson also noted how the treaties between Indigenous peoples and Canada can create the semblance of a consenting relationship between the state and Indigenous communities, which does not do justice to the realities of their tortured and oppressive relationship.
Simpson argued Indigenous peoples have not failed in their resistance of colonialism, and “persist with their sovereignty intact in spite of the grinding historical and political process of settler colonialism.” Groups such as the Sioux have not only been resisting colonialism for centuries, but have continued to militantly defend their territories, saying they will under no circumstances allow the Keystone XL pipeline to pass through their lands. Simpson also noted that Indigenous women spearheaded the movement to raise awareness about missing and murdered Indigenous women and play a central role in Indigenous resistance.
Rachel Baker, a French language and literature Master’s student said, “[Simpson] has an ability to frame the issues in a context that is just not available to me as a non-Indigenous woman, and also I certainly don’t have her level of scholarship either. It definitely informed me of the larger contexts.”
The symposium was co-hosted by the the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies (IGSF). “For us at IGSF, this is not a one-off – this is the start of something that we want to commit to and we want to hear like a beat over the course of the year and over the course of years to come,” a representative from IGSF said during the talk. She noted that IGSF will be offering a course on Indigenous feminisms in the upcoming Winter 2016 semester.

The seminar “Reflections on the Truth & Reconciliation with Aboriginal People” took place on September 23. It was facilitated by Michael Loft, a member of the Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) community of Kahnawake and an academic associate at the McGill School of Social Work.
Loft is an intergenerational survivor – his father, Mitchell, attended a residential school for 11 years, followed by Loft, who also attended an “Indian Day School” for three years. At the event, Loft shared his personal experiences of overcoming challenges despite spending his childhood at an Indian Day School. He also spoke on how “respect, responsibility, and cooperation can work” to achieve reconciliation.
Loft described residential schools as “institutions of cultural and linguistic genocide, leaving survivors with no education and emotionally unattached to endure the abuse inflicted upon others and themselves.”
“Even after coming out [of the residential schools], love is so deeply buried in your soul, [it doesn’t] come out right half the time. All you’re left with is the feeling of shame, fear of authority. How do you be cool in a situation like that?” Loft said.
At the seminar, Loft spoke on the significance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) as an attempt to understand history, despite it being emotionally draining for the survivors, who have to relive their experiences.
“Even after coming out [of the residential schools], love is so deeply buried in your soul, [it doesn’t] come out right half the time. All you’re left with is the feeling of shame, fear of authority. How do you be cool in a situation like that?”
He showed the audience a poem titled “Monster” written by Dennis Saddleman, a survivor who attended a residential school for seven years.
In the poem, which Saddleman read at a TRC gathering in Ottawa, he compares his residential school experience to a monster that took away his native culture and childhood.
“I hate you residential school, I hate you. / You’re a monster. / A huge hungry monster. / Built with steel bones. Built with cement flesh. / You’re a monster,” Saddleman writes.
Loft encouraged the audience to engage with the poem in smaller groups. “When [Saddleman] talks about that monster, I heard about that monster,” Loft said, adding, “I don’t know how many times I heard about the monster over the course of my career.”
In addition, Loft told the audience reconciliation between Indigenous people and Canadians, although an inevitable process, can only be reached by honouring past treaties and through mutual respect.
Loft said, “There has to be a responsibility somewhere to set that right. […] Let’s settle something. Deal’s a deal.”

2015-10-19,McGill,India,"Karel Mayrand and Camil Bouchard talk with The Daily
At a Divest McGill rally held on September 23 as part of Fossil Free Week, alumni Karel Mayrand and Camil Bouchard announced their intent to return their diplomas if McGill failed to freeze its investments in the fossil fuel industry. Mayrand is the director general of the David Suzuki Foundation for Quebec and the chair of Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project in Canada. Bouchard was a professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) for over thirty years, where he developed a research centre for human and social ecology. The Daily spoke to Mayrand and Bouchard about climate change, McGill’s reputation and financial management, and the responsibilities of alumni.
The McGill Daily (MD): Can you tell me what your plan is regarding returning your diplomas to McGill?
Karel Mayrand (KM): [During Fossil Free Week] we called upon all McGill alumni to join us in asking McGill University to divest from fossil fuels, and we’re giving McGill until March 30 to announce its intention to divest. Otherwise, we will come back with a group of alumni and hand back our diplomas on that date.
MD: What are the implications of McGill failing to divest?
KM: If we exploit all the fossil fuels that are currently in the reserves of fossil fuel companies, we will end up warming the planet by over four degrees [Celsius]. It’s not possible to combine our civilization with four degrees of warming.
If we say that we’re going to address the climate risk, as countries and businesses are [doing], it means that the value of these fossil fuel assets will fall, will actually collapse; because the value of fossil fuel assets is based on the potential of exploiting the entire reserves of fossil fuels that are in the books of these companies. So if we say that we’re only going to exploit 20, or 25, or 50, or 60 per cent of these reserves, it means the value [of the investment] will fall by that much. You’re investing in a stock that will be a “stranded asset” soon. 
So if you’re to keep your investment in fossil fuels, you’re making a bet that the world will not be acting decisively on climate. […] It’s a completely unethical posture for any investor to say, ‘I’m betting on the destruction of the planet.’ 
MD: Some people have said that McGill divesting would be just a symbolic gesture rather than an actually effective economic tactic. They argue that divestment will only serve to cause fossil fuel prices to drop and create an opportunity for other value-hunting investors to pick up shares at a discount.
“The fossil fuel folks have never had any concerns about energy poverty, or delivering cheap energy to the masses.”
KM: I think that argument has some value. But at the same time, if you look at the value of assets in the coal sector right now, they’ve been falling for four or five years. And I don’t see people rushing and saying, ‘Wow, coal is cheap now, I’m going to buy more coal!’ It’s actually the contrary that’s happening. 
You see major investment funds in the world – for example, the Norway investment fund, the California pension fund, Stanford, Oxford – divesting from coal. […] Mainly, they do this because they’re losing so much money by staying in coal. That’s a sign of the times, I believe. It’s a sign that there’s a massive shift of investment money that’s going to occur in the next couple years from fossil fuels toward other, cleaner energy sources that are delivering much more interesting returns.
MD: Do you think that the investment in alternate energy sources is happening at a rate that is able to keep up with our movement away from fossil fuels? The worry is that the choice is between energy poverty [leaving low-income people without energy] and slowing climate change.
KM: The fossil fuel folks have never had any concerns about energy poverty, or delivering cheap energy to the masses. […] I haven’t seen Exxon say, ‘We’re going to deliver cheap energy to the masses.’ Basically, their concern is much more profit than cheap energy. 
[People in India and Bangladesh] are moving to solar without ever having [grid] electricity. Right now, renewables are helping [people in poorer countries] get electricity much more than coal. Of course, coal is cheap energy. But as the cost of solar [energy] is falling, coal will not necessarily be competitive in ten years from now. 
“I don’t understand how an institution such as McGill can do that. You just can’t operate a university endowment fund without having minimal scientific and ethical screens.”
MD: It’s safe to assume that many members of McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) understand the science behind climate change. Why do you think that McGill is still so hesitant to divest?
KM: I think it’s really a sign of moral duplicity. […] Basically, they’re not making any choices, because they are risk-averse, and they want to make a short-term profit. And they’re betting that somehow the problem will solve itself. 
I don’t understand how an institution such as McGill can do that. You just can’t operate a university endowment fund without having minimal scientific and ethical screens.
Camil Bouchard (CB): I don’t have any numbers, but I would be curious to know […] how many researchers [at McGill] are supported in their private or semi-private contracts […] by fossil fuel companies. I suspect that could be a reason why there is so much hesitation around the issue [of divestment] with the BoG.
MD: Why do you think that it’s important for alumni to focus their energies on getting McGill, specifically, to divest, as opposed to other institutions?
KM: I’m sure that most alumni chose McGill because of its reputation, because it’s a place of science. I would be sad to see McGill become perceived by the younger generation […] as an institution that is trying to avoid change.
CB: When I’m asked to describe my bio, I’m very proud to say that I got my PhD from McGill. But I’m not able, now, to be as proud as I should be, because I don’t like to be identified with an institution that blindfolds itself for the sake of irresponsible investment returns.

2016-03-14,McGill,India,"Charges of sedition against students in India spark criticism worldwide
In response to controversies surrounding the arrest of students at India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) following a pro-Kashmiri separatist event, a group of McGill students have responded to a call for an international day of protest and action on March 2, creating a statement of solidarity for students at JNU and collecting signatures.
On February 9 students at JNU, a university in New Delhi, held an event to discuss the struggle of Kashmiri people for their democratic right to self-determination. Students also questioned the controversial hanging of Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri separatist convicted as a terrorist who played a role in an attack on India’s parliament in 2001.
On February 12, Kanhaiya Kumar, president of JNU’s Students’ Union (JNUSU), was arrested after the university administration had let police, who were wearing civilian clothes, into the JNU campus to find students who were involved in the event.
Kumar was charged with sedition after “anti-India” slogans were allegedly shouted at the February 9 event. According to The Indian Express, Kumar and his supporters were allegedly beaten by lawyers on court premises, in police presence. Home Minister Rajnath Singh, in a tweet, said that any individual who opposed the sedition charge has been labelled as an anti-national by the Indian government, which is currently led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has close ties to Hindu nationalist ideology.
Kumar has now been released from jail on a bail period of six months, based on a lack of any evidence that Kumar participated in anti-national slogans. However, two other students, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, remain in police custody under charges of sedition.
Kumar’s arrest and the subsequent handling of the situation by the government have generated massive protests across India and international criticism.
In an interview with The Daily, Vertika, a first-year McGill PhD candidate and alumnus of JNU, said, “The stance of the JNU community has been that [the arrest] was a pre-planned political move by the right-wing forces […] so as to generate this polarization in [India] about nationalism, and then define who is an anti-national.”
“India is such a diverse country. How can there be only one idea of nationalism?” Vertika continued.
Bayar Goswami, a first-year McGill Law student, and a member of Stand With JNU, told The Daily that the sedition charges themselves are problematic.
“The Supreme Court has a clear ruling that for sedition to exist in any act, incitement of violence has to occur,” said Goswami, yet noted that the students charged with sedition were not violent. Additionally, many separatists have called for the freedom of Kashmir in the past and were not charged with sedition.
Speaking to The Daily about India’s political state, Arunima Sharan, a U1 Economics and International Development Studies student who signed the statement of solidarity and is a member of the Indian Students Association, said, “We call ourselves the biggest democracy in the world but are we getting our rights as a democracy?”
Vertika, Goswami, and Sharan, along with Gaurav Singh, a first-year MBA student, and Aishwarya Nair, a first-year PhD candidate, organized a meeting to support JNU’s cause and created a statement of solidarity from concerned individuals of McGill, which has gathered fifty signatures so far.
“As students […] we need to stand up for the rights of other students across other parts of the world for the right of freedom of speech and expression. Why? Because universities are spaces where students should be able to critique even the ideas of the state, critique the policies of the government,” noted Vertika.
Universities across the world have also created their own statements, with some holding public rallies. According to Goswami, “This kind of peer solidarity […] creates pressure on the government to think about its actions.”
The pressure resulting from international statements of solidarity has undeniably had an effect, said Vertika, as media that was aggressively branding students as anti-national have had to back down, and the administration of JNU no longer lets police enter the campus to arrest students.
Vertika suggested that McGill faculty could write public letters to the administration of JNU. Vertika has also submitted a motion for the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) to take a position on the issue in order to raise more awareness in the McGill community.

2016-03-21,McGill,India,"Concerns arise at Council that proposed positions are not “originating from within” 
The need for the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) to increase its political presence was the main topic of discussion at the March 16 Council meeting, following the circulation of a list of proposed positions for an emerging student federation, the Association pour la voix étudiante au Québec (AVEQ). The Annual General Meeting (AGM), also scheduled for March 16, was cancelled due to lack of quorum.
Secretary-General Danielle Toccalino explained that, because PGSS currently has very few political positions, it was difficult for her to represent PGSS in the elaboration of AVEQ’s political stances. Toccalino sought Council’s feedback on the proposed political stances that AVEQ had not yet adopted due to a lack of mandate from a majority of the associations at the table. PGSS is not a member of AVEQ, but External Affairs Officer Bradley Por told Council that a referendum on provincial affiliation would likely be held in April.
Several councillors saluted Toccalino’s initiative in increasing PGSS’s political presence, but some noted concern that this list of positions, which covers a set of social justice and fiscal policy issues and does not include stances already adopted by AVEQ, was not a good starting point.
“It’s a reasonable idea on the surface that PGSS have a new position book, but […] it’s being developed from ideas from AVEQ, which is an organization that we haven’t decided whether we want to be a part of yet, rather than coming from PGSS and PGSS members – it makes sense that our positions should be originating from within,” said Graduate Student Association of Neuroscience representative Brent Dawe.
“I know that this document is trying to start a conversation, but I’m not sure it’s the right start, because it seems to me that a lot of these positions lack nuance.”
Toccalino expressed that the list was not intended to be adopted as is, and more substantive policies on the respective topics would be written if PGSS were to adopt them.
“I really want things to come from the ground up, but there’s been a history at PGSS of very few things coming from the ground up,” said Toccalino. “There are things […] that other people bring from external parties that could be very well beneficial to our members, so […] it’s simply to get the discussion started.”
Equity Commissioner Régine Debrosse emphasized that many of the proposed positions would require detailed and nuanced examination before potential approval.
“A lot of these positions have to do with equity questions […] and reading these is a little bit hardcore,” said Debrosse. “I know that this document is trying to start a conversation, but I’m not sure it’s the right start, because it seems to me that a lot of these positions lack nuance – some of them are incomplete, some of them go against the work of some people on campus, some of them take sides on very big debates. […] It’s going to be a complicated discussion if it’s framed in terms of this document.”
The discussion was tabled indefinitely, with the understanding that councillors would consult with their constituencies regarding next steps. In addition, as part of a set of bylaw amendments, Council adopted the separation of the Policy and Positions Manual into two sets of documents, one containing internal policies and one containing external political positions.
Environment Commissioner Amir Nosrat brought to Council an updated version of the Environment Policy, the first such update since 2007.
The updated version was unanimously adopted.
“What’s happening here is an update of the language […] that’s needed to make the policy relevant to modern conceptions of environmental sustainability, and it also provides more specific actionable policy directives,” said Nosrat. “Primarily, it’s co-curricular education that really drives the policy, and there’s also […] advocating for policies that improve our communities, whether it be in a local setting or in a global setting.”
In the wake of an incident last November where a student was sued in order to destroy his Master’s thesis, Council adopted amendments to the University/Industry Research Partnerships policy, introducing additional conflict of interest disclosure requirements and stating PGSS’s opposition to “efforts by private corporations to revoke research publications or theses.”
Council also passed a short mental health policy focused on advocacy, and a statement of solidarity with students arrested at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in India.

2016-04-04,McGill,India,"“Incompleteness” of report poses challenges to implementation
On March 30, the Newman Institute of Catholic Studies hosted a panel at Moot Court in Chancellor Day Hall to discuss the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada, and the unique challenges these findings present to universities.
The panelists were former prime minister Paul Martin, Michael Loft, an academic associate at McGill and member of the Mohawk community, TRC Commissioner Marie Wilson, and Ronald Niezen, a professor of law at McGill.
Speaking to The Daily, several students remarked on the fact that there was only one Indigenous speaker on the panel. Two audience members who spoke at the panel also identified themselves as Indigenous and spoke about their experiences.
“Those children going into off-reserve communities, losing their ability to have their culture, losing their parents, losing their language, is probably the single greatest tragedy and the single greatest black mark that this country has faced.”
Established in 2008, the TRC aims to document conditions in the Canadian residential school system, and the experiences of the survivors, families, and communities affected. Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families and placed into residential schools, where they experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of their caretakers. The conclusion of the TRC report contains 94 recommendations to help non-Indigenous Canadians and Indigenous peoples move toward reconciliation.
Speaking to the impact of residential schools, Martin said, “Those children going into off-reserve communities, losing their ability to have their culture, losing their parents, losing their language, is probably the single greatest tragedy and the single greatest black mark that this country has faced.”
“Last I looked, there were about 1,500 institutions that were claimed unsuccessfully as Indian residential schools. The majority of these were Indian day schools.”
Wilson focused largely on the TRC’s mandate of informing Canadians about the truth behind residential schools. She noted the importance of Canadian leaders who are “well rounded in our notions of country and notions of relationship to the other and a truthful understanding of our national history.”
Niezen called for caution about what truth is discussed, and whose truth it is. According to Niezen, the TRC has an overly limited definition for residential schools. “We see this focus on federal, federally funded, federally mandated Indian residential schools in the subject matter of the TRC. Last I looked, there were about 1,500 institutions that were claimed unsuccessfully as Indian residential schools. The majority of these were Indian day schools,” Niezen said.
This limited definition, and the “incompleteness of the TRC,” Niezen explained, poses a challenge to universities hoping to implement the TRC’s calls to action, which include, for example, requiring medical and nursing students in Canada to take a course concerning Aboriginal health issues, including the history and legacy of residential schools.
According to the panelists, another challenge faced by universities stems from the lack of space given to Indigenous narratives on campuses.
“For me, it’s about what’s missing – signs that are able to connect Indigenous people to the promise of education at this institution.”
Loft conceded that there has been some progress made in Indigenous visibility at McGill, such as the creation of the First Peoples’ House and the minor in Indigenous Studies; however, he also argued that there was room for improvement.
Loft said, “For me, it’s about what’s missing – signs that are able to connect Indigenous people to the promise of education at this institution. […] For example, when walking up from Sherbrooke, we see on the right the James McGill statue. We go a little further and we see the Quebec flag and Canada flag. We see the classic Greek columns of the Arts Building, and on the top, of course, the martlet flag. That’s it.”
Loft continued, “Yes, we have the Hochelaga rock, but the problem with that is that no one knows about it. […] It’s been staring at everyone since 1925, right by Roddick Gates. It’s impossible to see.”
Jimmy Gutman, a McGill student in attendance at the panel, spoke to The Daily about the small number of Indigenous students in universities, which Gutman believes stems from Indigenous students getting less funding for primary and secondary education per student.
“Yes, we have the Hochelaga rock, but the problem with that is that no one knows about it.”
“In general, if you live in an upper middle class neighborhood, you get more than if you live in a poor neighbourhood, and you get even less if you live on a reservation. So there’s a big discrepancy in what Indigenous people have historically received,” Gutman said.
Audience members and panelists alike discussed the necessity of including Indigenous voices in materials taught, as well as encouraging diversity on campus.
Loft proposed “a micro-approach,” for McGill, which would consist of two steps: moving the Hochelaga Rock to a more visible space, and raising the Hiawatha Belt flag on the Arts Building on June 21, National Aboriginal Day. “It’s nice to talk about big ideas, but we’ve got to get the ball rolling,” he explained.

2016-07-15,McGill,India,"Grand Chief Stewart Phillip and Divest McGill speak out against McGill’s Enbridge investments
On June 30, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned Ottawa’s approval for Enbridge’s Northern Gateway pipeline. A panel of three judges ruled that the previous Conservative government failed to adequately consult the would-be affected First Nations communities before approving the $7.9 billion pipeline.
The ruling was has been lauded by Divest McGill, a student group campaigning for McGill to divest from fossil fuel corporations like Enbridge. McGill had invested $3.4 million in Enbridge according to McGill’s latest investment portfolio published in March 2016. 
Divest McGill submitted petitions in 2013 and 2015, urging McGill’s Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), to recommend to the Board of Governors (BoG) that McGill divest from fossil fuel corporations.
“There is not the degree or extent of injurious impact at this time that results from the activities of fossil fuel companies that would warrant a finding of grave injurious impact.”
Accompanying the 2015 petition was a 150 page document titled “Carbon at All Costs,” which outlined Divest McGill’s arguments and singled out Enbridge as a particularly harmful corporation, both environmentally and socially.
In response to that petition, CAMSR released a report to the BoG in March 2016, stating that divestment from fossil fuel companies “would not be an effective means of addressing climate change.” 
“Arguably, cutting off access to fossil fuels would be more likely to result in grave injurious impact in the short-term than the continued reliance on fossil fuels.”
One reason the committee gave for this decision was that fossil fuel companies allegedly do not cause “social injury,” which CAMSR defines as a company’s “grave injurious impact” on “consumers, employees, other persons, or on the natural environment.” 
“There is not the degree or extent of injurious impact at this time that results from the activities of fossil fuel companies that would warrant a finding of grave injurious impact,” the CAMSR report continued. “Arguably, cutting off access to fossil fuels would be more likely to result in grave injurious impact in the short-term than the continued reliance on fossil fuels.”
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, decried the CAMSR report. He states that McGill “should have been divesting [from fossil fuels] a decade ago.” 
“Without question, we’re the canary in the mineshaft, because it’s impacting us the most since we’re more reliant on the land.”
He stressed that Indigenous people are the first to suffer the effects of climate change, adding that McGill’s refusal to divest is in a “contradiction” with the its launch of  an Indigenous Studies minor and its hosting of the Annual Indigenous Awareness Week.
“Our message has to be clear with respect to the urgency of climate change to Indigenous peoples,” he says. “Without question, we’re the canary in the mineshaft, because it’s impacting us the most since we’re more reliant on the land.”
“As an Indigenous leader, more importantly as a grandfather of 15 grandchildren, I applaud the efforts made to divest [McGill] from dirty oil money.”
The “inherent support [for fossil fuel companies] within major Canadian institutions, whether they be educational, economic, or media […is] disturbing,” Phillip says, and forms a network of support for neocolonialism. 
Phillip made it clear that he doesn’t disapprove of everything happening at McGill however, commending Divest McGill’s actions after the publishing of CAMSR’s report. “As an Indigenous leader, more importantly as a grandfather of 15 grandchildren, I applaud the efforts made to divest [McGill] from dirty oil money.” 
Jed Lenetsky, a U2 Environmental Sciences student and Divest McGill organizer, echoed Grand Chief Stewart Phillip’s remarks, adding that, “It’s definitely very hypocritical and falls into the larger pattern of McGill professing concern for societal issues on campus while ignoring the impacts of their policies off campus.” 
Lenetsky went on to note that “It’s indicative of McGill’s desire to address these issues in name only; if McGill truly and sincerely wants to do more to address these Indigenous and environmental crises, then more is required of them. Much more.”
“If McGill truly and sincerely wants to do more to address these Indigenous and environmental crises, then more is required of them.”
Although Jed admitted that he did not think that the Court of Appeal’s decision would significantly impact Divest McGill’s cause, he was optimistic, hoping that the decision might “create a domino effect for the denial of other fossil fuel projects in Canada” in the near future. 
Grand Chief Phillip also spoke of a possible fossil-free future. 
“As a grandfather, I want each and every one of them to think about their own children and grandchildren,” he stated. “We all have a duty and obligation to protect the interests of the future generations, and that work needs to start now. With respect to climate change, it should have started yesterday. And I want them to think very seriously about that.”
“With respect to climate change, it should have started yesterday. And I want them to think very seriously about that.”
A spokesperson from McGill could not be reached by the date of the article’s publication.

2016-09-26,McGill,India,"Week-long event series addresses oppression and reconciliation 
McGill’s sixth annual Indigenous Awareness Week, organized by the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office (SEDE), launched on September 19. It was immediately preceded by the 15th annual McGill Pow Wow, organized by the First Peoples’ House, on September 16. The week typically consists of a series of events featuring prominent members of Indigenous communities, and aims to raise awareness about the challenges that these communities have faced and continue to face, and to facilitate communication on and off campus. It also serves as a valuable platform for educating McGill students and staff about Indigenous cultures, practices, and ceremonies.
This year’s Indigenous Awareness Week featured 15 events, including the opening ceremony, a presentation by Dr. Taiaiake Alfred on the effects of environmental pollution on Indigenous peoples’ culture, a screening and discussion about the pass system, a discussion on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in relation to religious communities, a reconciliation ceremony, and the launch of the Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education.
Indigenous Awareness Week is particularly important for the McGill community, given that the University is located on unceded Kanien’kehá:ka (or “Mohawk”) land. McGill’s administration still refuses to officially acknowledge this, and has faced criticism from a variety of groups over its continued failure to adequately recognize and honour Indigeneity. Significantly, Indigenous groups and individuals from McGill and elsewhere have been at the forefront of organizing Indigenous Awareness Week since its inception.
On Monday, September 19, McGill’s sixth annual Indigenous Awareness Week officially began. Allan Vicaire, the Indigenous Education Advisor at SEDE and First Peoples’ House, welcomed attendees to the Opening Ceremony by acknowledging that the land on which McGill stands is unceded territory belonging to Indigenous peoples. “We are meeting together on land which has long served as a site of meaning, meaning and exchange amongst Indigenous peoples […] and we recognize them as the traditional custodians of the lands and waters on which we meet today,” Vicaire said.
Several notable figures participated in the ceremony, including Elder Delbert Sampson of the Shuswap First Nation in British Columbia, Elder Jean Stevenson from Cree of Peguis First Nation in Manitoba, and two members of the Indigenous band Odaya, who performed three songs for attendees. The Elders extended a blessing to the attendees and the land on which Montreal rests. They also emphasized the significance of learning about Indigenous culture and the necessity of incorporating it into society.
“When we talk about reconciliation, the important thing is that Indigenous peoples’ voices are being heard,” said Stevenson, “and it’s important to listen to those voices, to have some understanding about the history and what has happened, and what is going on today, and what the plans for the future are.”
“When we talk about reconciliation, the important thing is that Indigenous peoples’ voices are being heard.”
The ceremony celebrated the efforts of various organizations at McGill, such as the First Peoples’ House and SEDE, for raising awareness and building a stronger Indigenous community on campus. Kakwiranó:ron Cook, Aboriginal Outreach Administrator of First People’s House, concluded the ceremony, noting that the number of incoming Indigenous students at McGill has increased from twenty in 2010 to one hundred this year, which fulfills SEDE’s target for Fall 2018. “It’s exciting to see more awareness of McGill programs, making McGill more attractive and inclusive for Indigenous learners.”
“It’s exciting to see more awareness of McGill programs, making McGill more attractive and inclusive for Indigenous learners.”
The keynote speaker of the event, Dr. Taiaiake Alfred, was unable to make it to the ceremony. He delivered a powerful lecture on reconciliation and justice later that day, however, at the Moot Court in New Chancellor Day Hall.
The first day of Indigenous Awareness Week concluded with the screening of the film “The Pass System,” in partnership with the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.
The room was filled to capacity, with a strong turnout from McGill staff and students alike.
“The Pass System” centered on Canada’s systemic segregation of its Indigenous population through the historical pass system on reserves. Implemented in 1885, this system prohibited Indigenous people from leaving their reserves without a pass signed by a so-called “Indian agent,” a state-appointed official who wielded immense power over the Indigenous communities within his jurisdiction. Although it was never formally written into Canadian legislation, this was the grim reality for many Indigenous people.
Director Alex Williams interviewed Cree, Soto, Dene, Ojibwe, and Blackfoot Elders of the regions where the film took place in order to share their experiences living under a system that limited their basic right to mobility.The documentary also used historical documents to show the injustices inflicted under the pass system.
A panel discussion on “silenced Indigenous histories” followed the screening, with Allan Downey, an assistant professor in the McGill department of History and Classical Studies, whose specialization is Indigenous History, moderating the discussion.
The panelists, including director Alex Williams, Ellen Gabriel, Sandra-Lynn Kahsennano:ron Leclaire, and Orenda Boucher-Curotte, discussed their take on the pass system and the modern struggles Indigenous people face today.
Gabriel, an Indigenous human rights activist, emphasized the need to share these stories with Indigenous youth as the voices in the film have so far remained largely unheard.
“Not much has changed. We still feel like we only belong in reserves,” Gabriel told the crowd.
“Not much has changed. We still feel like we only belong in reserves.”
Boucher-Curotte, who is part of the McGill Institute of the Study of Canada, echoed that sentiment. “The Canadian government is still restricting us, just in different ways,” she said.
On Wednesday September 21, a group of around 50 McGill students and staff gathered on the front lawn outside of New Chancellor Day Hall for a reconciliation ceremony. The ceremony focused on Indigenous law, justice, and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
The ceremony was led by Algonquin Elder Dominique Rankin and his partner Marie-Josée Tardif. John Borrows, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Law at the University of Victoria Law School, along with fellow University of Victoria law professor Rebecca Johnson, also participated in the ceremony.
Generally speaking, ceremony forms an important part of Indigenous law, and the event was set up to reflect that. Elder Rankin began the ceremony by explaining the significance of the fire, the “sacred fire,” he said in French, that was in the center of the circle formed by attendees and speakers.
Borrows then performed a song which he said Justice Murray Sinclair used as guidance when asked to be the chair of the TRC.
“Law can actually be expressed not only through story and other fashions, but it can also be expressed through song. So this song is one way that law can be communicated in the Anishinaabe legal tradition,” Borrows said.
“Law can actually be expressed not only through story and other fashions, but it can also be expressed through song.”
Elder Rankin shared his experience in a residential school: “The first day in the residence school, they took my clothes, my hair, my moccasins, and my feathers. They burned everything,” he said in English. He described how he was taken away from his parents, how he was not allowed to speak the Anishinaabe language, and the effect this had on him physically and psychologically. “I judged a lot. I judged everyone,” he said in French.
“You can’t forget that,” he added in English.
“The first day in the residence school, they took my clothes, my hair, my moccasins, and my feathers. They burned everything.”
But for Rankin, “today is a difference. For my vision is a difference. Everything comes back to see me. The creator [….] I listen to him,” he said. He shared how his mother saved him, how she found him and told him to come back home.
“I am Anishinaabe today. Pas une victime. No more victim. Je ne suis plus une victime […] I am a winner. Je suis gagné et la vie est belle,” he concluded in both English and French.
Tardif expressed how the event gave her hope, saying, “We heard about […] what you’re trying to implement here slowly and surely, and that really is touching.”
Speaking to The Daily, Borrows concluded that “the ceremony is a representation of how people can gather in a way that’s patient and takes the time needed today to engage in conversation and understanding.”
On the afternoon of Thursday, September 22, a ceremony was held to mark the relocation of the Hochelaga Rock, a cultural landmark established by Parks Canada to commemorate the Iroquois settlement that once existed on the land currently occupied by McGill’s downtown campus. Voices on campus had been advocating for the relocation since 2012, on the grounds that such a crucial piece of the region’s history should be displayed in a more prominent location.
During the ceremony, the administration also officially launched the Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Issues, which Provost Christopher Manfredi described as “being animated by two core themes: recognition of Indigenous history, contemporary presence, and ways of knowing and learning; and reconciliation, by heeding the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, specifically through educational and institutional efforts, aimed at redressing historical legacies of injustice, and restoring relationships with Indigenous peoples.”
Manfredi explained that he had instructed the Task Force to address a number of things, including, but not limited to, increased physical and symbolic representation of Indigenous history, facilitation of Indigenous student access to McGill, more effective recruitment of Indigenous staff, and incorporation of Indigenous perspectives and issues “within McGill’s curricular and research mission.”
Indigenous rights activist Ellen Gabriel of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation and Turtle Clan, and a former employee of McGill’s First Peoples’ House, was one of many Indigenous leaders invited to speak at the ceremony.
“This [Task Force] isn’t something McGill did willingly,” said Gabriel to the crowd. “There was a lot of resistance at the beginning, so I’m glad to see the door open a bit, because there’s a lot of work [left] to do.”
“Education in Canada’s dark history, in its colonial past, was used as a weapon of assimilation and genocide against Indigenous peoples and their nations,” she continued. “If there is to be true reconciliation, and if McGill is to be part of that, there needs to be restitution, and there needs to be some help, understanding, and compassion, because as the former Auditor General of Canada [Sheila Fraser] said ‘It’s going to take 28 years for [Indigenous] community schools to catch up to the quality of education that you see in the rest of Canada.’ And that’s a lot of work.”
“If there is to be true reconciliation, and if McGill is to be part of that, there needs to be restitution, and there needs to be some help, understanding, and compassion […]”
“We are looking forward to the [Task Force’s] recommendations, so that we can take concrete actions to accomplish those goals,” said Principal Suzanne Fortier in her address to the crowd. “I am convinced that with such highly committed people […] who will be participating in the work of this Task Force, and our very engaged campus and community, we will be able to make great steps in acknowledging the presence of Indigeneity on our campus.”

2017-01-16,McGill,India,"First-year law students and faculty reflect on mandatory class
The first week of the Winter semester saw first-year students in McGill’s Faculty of Law participating in a mandatory week-long intensive course on Indigenous legal traditions.
The course is part of the Faculty’s response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) report, released in 2015. (The TRC was organized to investigate the abuse inflicted on Indigenous peoples through the Indian residential school system.) Professor Kirsten Anker told The Daily in a phone interview that the Commission recommended that all Canadian law students take a course on Indigenous issues.
Anker, who taught a session as part of the intensive course, lectures about property, and Aboriginal peoples and the law at McGill. In creating the course, the Faculty of Law built upon the elective courses on Indigenous issues she herself developed.
“The door was open to Indigenous traditions but nothing really robust had been done to build them into the transsystemic program,” Anker said. The transsystemic program is the Faculty of Law’s unique undergraduate law degree that integrates both common and civil law into a single program.
“Instead of just teaching what’s called Aboriginal law […] we started bringing Indigenous law and traditions into the picture and kind of trying to have a […] dialogue about law between traditions, which is kind of the gist of what transsystemic law or legal education means,” she continued. “So it’s kind of taken that model, that idea, and brought it into a week for the whole first year [class].”
In an email to The Daily, professor Hoi Kong, one of the creators of the course, explained that the course was also inspired by “discussions, students, faculty, and other stakeholders had over the past few years about how to renew the curriculum.”
“The door was open to Indigenous traditions but nothing really robust had been done to build them into the transsystemic program.”
“The specific content of the course emerged in part from conversations that Professor Napoleon (from the University of Victoria) and Professor Friedland (from the University of Alberta), and I have had over the years, during their visits here and mine at the University of Victoria, and from a course that Professor Napoleon and I co-taught, and another that Professor Friedland taught here,” he elaborated.
The content used specific examples from Cree law, and included the “historical context, theories, and sources of Indigenous laws, as well as modes of interpreting and applying those sources,” he added.
When asked about the response from faculty and students, Anker said her impression was that “students were really engaged and they found it really interesting.”
“It was working really well in the way that it’s been set up to kind of mirror the integration week they did in first semester: looking at common and civil law about […] the question of safe injection spaces for [Intravenous] drug users,” she continued. “I think that worked […] really well […] because one of the challenges of learning Indigenous law is that it’s often in the abstract; someone can talk about it, but you don’t really get a sense of how it works as law until you try to do something with it.”
Anker added that other faculty members are also excited about giving more space to Indigenous issues in the curriculum.
Kong shared Anker’s sentiments, adding that he has been “really moved by the sincerity of the expressions of support.”
“I think that worked […] really well […] because one of the challenges of learning Indigenous law is that it’s often in the abstract; someone can talk about it, but you don’t really get a sense of how it works as law until you try to do something with it.”
In a phone interview with The Daily, Allan Vicaire, First People’s House and Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) Office’s Indigenous Education Advisor, shared his excitement about the initiative.
“I think it’s about time that the University is pushing to include Indigenous perspectives in the classroom,” he said.
“I think sometimes we forget, especially at McGill, there are some great professors out there that are ready to push for Indigenous perspectives, and [ensure] that curriculum is inclusive,” he continued.
Vicaire noted that this initiative differs from others because the faculty is “ensuring that every student […] is being exposed to Indigenous issues.” He believes the next step is for other faculties to begin thinking of how they can implement that.
“I think it’s about time that the University is pushing to include Indigenous perspectives in the classroom.”
However, at least one first-year law student, Isabelle*, found that the course was problematic, particularly because of a lack of Indigenous voices.
“The instructors told us that was due to several reasons: that we should gain a background knowledge on Indigenous culture and legal systems before engaging with Indigenous peoples as a symbol of respect, and that there is a significant strain on Indigenous academics right now,” she said in an email to The Daily.
“I completely understand and respect these decisions, as well as the importance of putting in the work ourselves, however, it often felt as if we were learning from the wrong people,” she continued.
Isabelle further noted that the course content felt introductory, which is useful for students who had not previously been exposed to Indigenous issues, but left others wanting more.
She went on to say that “this week seemed to fit very well with a colonial legal education. It seemed to emphasize voices and analyses of academics who sought to engage with colonial legal systems and who took a reconciliationist approach. It often felt as if many more radical, or even separationist perspectives were missing, those that are often missing in internal legal conversations in law school.”
When asked what more needs to be done in teaching students about Indigenous issues, Anker highlighted the importance of transforming colonial power dynamics.
“This week seemed to fit very well with a colonial legal education.”
“It’s not just about giving people information, although that’s a really important part. It’s also about establishing that pedagogy and that learning environment has to come out of a relationship with communities,” she added.
She further highlighted the importance of developing “relationships in which we’re building a connection with communities and we’re implicated in them and they’re implicated in us.”
In terms of the course’s future development, Kong noted that a faculty committee is working to determine the next steps, such as the possibility of making this type of mandatory course longer.
Both Anker and Isabelle shared their belief that Indigenous law should be integrated into all of the courses offered by the Faculty of Law.
“It’s not just about giving people information, although that’s a really important part. It’s also about establishing that pedagogy and that learning environment has to come out of a relationship with communities.”
“Engaging with Indigeneity and colonialism means going beyond the classroom and working towards decolonization in every sense of the word,” Isabelle said. “It means challenging the culture of our classrooms and the Faculty in general; challenging its whiteness, its colonial history (and present), its heteropatriarchy. We need to think about and challenge what a legal education actually means within a settler-colonial context.”

2017-01-23,McGill,India,"Documentary screening and panel highlights Indigenous empowerment
In 2007, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (FNCFCS) and the Assembly of First Nations began a historic legal battle against the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada, arguing that the welfare services available to Indigenous children on reserves were vastly – indeed, dangerously – inferior to those offered to other Canadian children.
After nine grueling years, during which the federal government attempted to delay and obstruct the complainants, the latter won their case. In her film “We Can’t Make the Same Mistake Twice,” Alanis Obomsawin documents the case in detail, bearing witness to the tireless work of the children’s rights advocates involved.
On Thursday January 18, the documentary was screened at Cinema du Parc for the McGill community. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of the FNCFCS and a professor in McGill’s School of Social Work, was in attendance, along with Obomsawin.
Blackstock is a central figure in “We Can’t Make the Same Mistake Twice.” In her role at FNCFCS, she was heavily involved in bringing the initial discrimination complaint, and gave extensive testimony throughout the case.
Blackstock opened Thursday’s screening with an indictment of the apathy and systemic racism that has devastated the lives of many Indigenous children on Canadian reserves. In particular, she mentioned the case of two twelve-year-old girls from the Wapekeka First Nation in Ontario, who committed suicide earlier this month.
“Throughout history, Canada has always known about the inequalities, known about the harms, and relied on the public to stop watching and not demand change,” said Blackstock. “My one request of you is that you don’t look away.”
Obomsawin also spoke, thanking the attendees for their presence.
“You’re about to see a very important story,” she said, “one that is, of course, very dear to me and to thousands of people.”
Obomsawin told the audience that in the course of her career as a documentary filmmaker on Indigenous issues, she had been present in many courtrooms, watching many Indigenous people receiving discriminatory treatment at the hands of the Canadian justice system. After a lifetime spent witnessing and being subjected to racial and colonial oppression, this case had brought her hope.
“The feeling in the courtrooms was so horrifying,” she said, “mainly because of the disrespect. And when I say disrespect, I mean everybody, including the judges and the lawyers. […] The feeling was, ‘we know all about you, you’re guilty, shut up, go to jail.’ And what I want to say, when I sat in the courtroom this time, at the tribunal of human rights, I watched the 72 witnesses that came to speak, and I saw our people be respected.”
The documentary itself follows the nine-year legal battle in great detail, showing extensive courtroom footage, supplemented by interviews with those participating in the case. The audience at Cinema du Parc seemed engrossed, with many gasping audibly during particularly harrowing portions of the film.
After the screening, a panel discussion was held. The panel featured four McGill students and was moderated by Allan Downey, a McGill professor specializing in Indigenous history.
One of the panelists, Amal Elsana Alh’jooj, a PhD candidate in McGill’s School of Social Work, noted the parallels between the systemic discrimination documented in Obomsawin’s film and the discrimination faced by Palestinians like herself, living in territory controlled by Israel.
“Canada has a reputation as a place where human rights are protected,” said Alh’jooj, “and we look at Canada as really an idol for these kinds of things.”
“So all of a sudden to come here,” she continued, “and discover that in the backyard of Canada, there is this catastrophe of many, many years, it’s kind of really shocking. And I think the role of social workers, community organizing, and all of us here is how to bring this case to the forefront – in the front yard of Canada, and to […] be brave enough to put these things on the table.”
“As someone who came from an Indigenous community in the south part of Israel, living many years in situations of discrimination, house demolition, evacuating in the name of the law, and advocating for my own people’s human rights, what this [film] is telling us is that all systems are very similar.”
Israeli officials, said Alh’jooj, routinely make the same arguments that the Canadian government used to attack and delegitimize Blackstock and her fellow activists. For this reason, the documentary resonated deeply with her.
Another panelist, Carlee Loft, a Kanien’keha:ka student majoring in psychology at McGill, spoke “not as someone who has gone through child welfare myself, but who has cared very deeply about someone who has, and who has seen them struggle, trying to connect back to their community, trying to find ties to their family.”
“What’s even harder is watching them struggle against this label that’s given to them, of a ‘problem child’ […] and this troubled Indigenous youth,” continued Loft. “This isn’t the same generation that went through residential schools, but they’re going through something very similar.”
Christian Quequish, a Saulteaux student currently serving as the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Indigenous Affairs Commissioner, spoke about the challenges of effective allyship and the pitfalls of reconciliation.
“I guess what really struck me [about the film] was non-Indigenous children […] supporting Indigenous children,” he began. “It’s incredibly symbolic – it’s not something that I grew up with, but it’s good to see that that’s a trend that’s happening. […] I think for us older folks there needs to be a recognition that the relationships between Indigenous peoples has been historically imbalanced, and that discriminatory policies sustain this imbalance.”
“The way allies approach Indigenous peoples’ issues sometimes reinforces that balance to the point where it’s more about feeling good about themselves than actual empowerment of Indigenous people,” he continued. “So in approaching better relations between the two groups, it seems as if it’s time to start privileging Indigenous voices. […] Empowerment should come first, and symbolic acts should follow.”

2017-01-23,McGill,India,"Panel discusses successes and challenges of Akwesasne court
On Monday January 16, several dozen people gathered at New Chancellor Day Hall to hear a presentation by three administrators of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, Canada’s first independent Indigenous court, about the structure and nature of the court.
Panelists included Kyrie Ransom, justice coordinator at the court, Bonnie Cole, prosecutor and legal council, and Gilbert Terrence, a court administrator. The presentation was followed by a discussion period moderated by Kirsten Anker, a professor at McGill’s Faculty of Law who specializes in property and Aboriginal peoples and the law.
The Mohawk community of Akwesasne straddles the St. Lawrence River at the intersection of the Quebec-Ontario and Canada-United States borders. As such, its residents have had to contend with even greater challenges to their sovereignty than many other Indigenous nations in North America. Until the mid-1990s, judges at the Akwesasne Court were external officials appointed by the federal government under the Indian Act of 1876.
When this process was abandoned, it was expected that Indigenous communities would transfer to the jurisdiction of the provinces in which they were located. For Akwesasne, this would have meant adjusting to two different provincial systems. Instead, the community appointed its own justices, and set about the process of codifying their legal and cultural traditions into a body of law that would be faithful to the values of Akwesasne’s people, and make sense to external authorities.
This process was made all the more complicated by the difficulty of translating key concepts from the Mohawk language into English: Ransom explained to the audience that the original Mohawk term for “justice” literally meant the fall of a gavel.
“The connotation was very negative,” she said, so the lawmakers of Akwesasne consulted linguistic experts in order to develop a new, more positive term. In the end, they came up with a word better suited to the legislators’ project. Roughly translated, it means ‘those who uphold the law.’
This process was made all the more complicated by the difficulty of translating key concepts from the Mohawk language into English: Ransom explained to the audience that the original Mohawk term for “justice” literally meant the fall of a gavel.
While some carefully considered updates to traditional terminology were made, the overriding imperative of Akwesasne’s legislators was respecting the community’s cultural and legal practices, and grounding their work in collective history.
Finally, after roughly two decades of work, the project was complete: Akwesasne’s groundbreaking legal system was officially voted into law by local authorities last summer.
While many other Indigenous communities have their own courts, Akwesasne is the first in Canada to have constructed its own system without, as it were, permission from the government.
“Basically, our court has jurisdiction over all matters on Akwesasne lands,” explained Cole. While the court does not yet handle more serious infractions, such as murder and assault, the legislators hope to expand their jurisdiction in this regard.
“We structured the court to meet the needs of the community,” Cole said. “It’s a restorative justice approach, looking at restoration, rehabilitation, restitution – all of those concepts. […] We look at the person, and not necessarily just the offense. So when we’re dealing with people, we’ll be looking at who he or she is, what are their skills, what are their gifts, and how will that be used and incorporated into restoring balance, not only to that person, but to the community.”
While the court does not yet handle more serious infractions, such as murder and assault, the legislators hope to expand their jurisdiction in this regard.
This ethos, said Cole, has fostered an environment that is more flexible and less adversarial than the mainstream Canadian legal system.
Notably, she explained, “We don’t do jail, we don’t intend to do that. It’s not for us. We know that the system is failing, right?”
According to the Office of the Correctional Investigator, nearly a quarter of Canada’s imprisoned population is composed of Indigenous people, while this demographic only represents four per cent of the general population.
Disproportionate incarceration and police brutality is simply one facet of the systemic oppression faced by Indigenous Canadians. Rather than send more marginalized citizens to prison for relatively minor offenses, the Akwesasne court resorts to more constructive penalties.
“We don’t do jail, we don’t intend to do that. It’s not for us. We know that the system is failing, right?”
In accordance with the principle of restorative justice, those convicted are often required to perform community service – painting walls or coaching soccer, while perhaps attending therapy sessions, or undergoing treatment for substance abuse.
According to Terrence, the system is working: out of 63 cases in the restorative justice program so far, sixty have been successful.
However, in Cole’s words, the court is still very much “a work in progress.” It is in serious need of more legislators to continue refining the legal system and enable the understaffed establishment to work more efficiently.
The panelists at Monday’s event extended an invitation to the McGill law students at the panel to come work at Akwesasne, and judging by the enthusiasm of the audience, they may very well be in luck.

2017-04-02,McGill,India,"Lecture focuses on the language of white supremacy in Canada
On Monday, March 27, students and McGill community members gathered for a talk by acclaimed journalist Desmond Cole on the language and logic of white supremacy.
Kiana Saint-Macary, the President of the McGill Debating Union, opened the event by introducing Cole, describing him as “a Toronto-based journalist, activist, and author whose work […] focuses on issues of race in Canada and abroad – including his much celebrated piece, The Skin I’m In: I’ve been interrogated by police 150 times, all because I am Black.”
Cole began his talk with a ‘Be it resolved’ statement, a common format used in debates.
“Be it resolved that white supremacy informs all aspects of Canadian life, particularly our language,” he said. “The way that we use language informs pretty much everything that we do. It describes everything that we do. It influences and phrases our thoughts and our actions in this country.”
Cole explained that, in our society, individuals are conditioned to the language of white supremacy and often use it even when fighting to dismantle oppressive structures. This enforces the power of white supremacy by implicating its opponents in the very system they are trying to destroy. As Cole put it, “One of our big problems with white supremacy is that [its] power forces those of us who want to destroy it to engage in an endless debate with it.” Cole insisted that eliminating the harmful and insidious language of white supremacy is a necessary step in dismantling the system entirely.
“Be it resolved that white supremacy informs all aspects of Canadian life, particularly our language.”
He then discussed James McGill’s enslavement of Black and Indigenous people: “This institution, like so many institutions in Canada, was founded by somebody who […] actually owned, if you can say that, human beings.”
The way that people talk about influential figures such as James McGill, he explained, illustrates the power of the language of white supremacy; the word ‘slave’ itself is part of this language.
“Nobody is actually born [a slave],” said Cole. “A slave is not an occupation that you can aspire to, a job title that you can hold. The biggest problem with [the word] is that when we say ‘slave,’ […] we’re describing the condition of somebody who had something done to them rather than describing the condition of the person who’s doing it. […] That’s not really talking about the issue, that’s talking around it.”
Cole went on to point out that when people say “James McGill [and others like him] was a slaveowner,” they use the passive voice and fail to assign appropriate blame. In order to dismantle white supremacy, he argued, we need to be specific about these atrocities.
“As a reflex,” Cole explained, “people start saying, ‘Yeah, but that’s not all [insert slaveowner here] did […] how can you just limit their whole character and their identity?’”
He then provided a recent example of this phenomenon: Lynn Beyak of the Conservative Party and her recent remarks to the Canadian Senate about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
“The biggest problem with [the word] is that when we say ‘slave,’ […] we’re describing the condition of somebody who had something done to them rather than describing the condition of the person who’s doing it.”
“The Truth and Reconciliation Commission […] was an incredibly thorough investigation into the residential school system in Canada,” explained Cole, “that system which took untold thousands of Indigenous children away from their parents. About 6,000 children that we know of died in residential schools, but I would more accurately say they were killed. Those who were not killed […] were denied the ability to speak their own languages, denied the ability to practice their own spiritual and religious practices. They were denied the ability to have contact anymore with their communities […] The philosophy behind residential schools was to kill the ‘Indian’ in the child. That’s white supremacy.
Cole went on to quote Beyak’s speech to the Senate: “‘I speak […] mostly in memory of the kindly and well-intentioned men and women and their descendants, …] whose remarkable works good deeds and historical tales of the residential schools go unacknowledged for the most part,’ she said. And Bayak went on to say ‘Mistakes were made at residential schools, in many instances horrible mistakes that overshadowed some of the good things that also happened at those schools.’”
“This is how every politician is either taught to speak or learns how to speak” said Cole. “Its particularly effective as a tool in what I’m calling this language and logic of white supremacy. Who made the mistakes, Lynn? […] If she’s saying ‘I don’t want to erase that, I’m not trying to paper over that, I realize it’s horrible,’ why do you use this language of passive voice? Why do you hide the perpetrator if you’re not ashamed of it yourself? […] This use of language informs a whole way of thinking and dodging accountability and shifting blame and erasing genocide and huge atrocities that have happened around the world.”
Cole continued by outlining a series of defenses and concessions designed to maintain white supremacy.
“’Race has nothing to do with it.’ Now this is not a concession. This is actually the starting point for white supremacy,” he said. “This is white supremacy’s sweet spot. 95 per cent of the discussions that I see or am forced to engage in in this country about this issue start with this sentence. […] This is the denial that we always have to overcome with people, particularly people in power, who want to tell us that we somehow do not know what we’re talking about.”
“Why do you hide the perpetrator if you’re not ashamed of it yourself?”
Cole proceeded to share recent stories of police violence and brutality towards Black people. For example, he told the story of Andrew Loku, a Black man with a history of mental illness who was killed by Toronto police in his apartment building in July 2015. Loku had been carrying a hammer and having a conversation with his upstairs neighbours about a noise complaint when a police officer arrived at the scene and shot him.
Following the incident, the head of the Toronto police force’s most powerful lobbyist group wrote an op-ed in the Toronto Star.
Cole quoted the op-ed: “The fact that he was Black had no bearing on the officer’s decision. […] Those who are promoting baseless accusations of race being a factor in Mr. Loku’s death have no legitimate place in this debate. Collectively, we need to ensure that the mentally ill are provided treatment by continuing to work to improve mental health care accessibility and support.”
This is an example of this logic of white supremacy in action, said Cole. Instead of acknowledging race as an issue in the incident, the lobbyist focused on mental illness.
“‘[It’s] not race, look over here, it’s the other thing,’” he said. “And in this case it’s mental health. We’ve heard this time and time again.”
Even when people concede that racism may be a factor in a given act of violence, said Cole, another common argument is “don’t judge until you have all the facts.”
“’Race has nothing to do with it.’ Now this is not a concession. This is actually the starting point for white supremacy.”
“White supremacy loves this,” Cole explained. “It’s one of its favorites. You can’t know anything for sure as long as white supremacy’s getting fingers pointed at it […] ‘Let’s not jump to the conclusion that it was about race. Let’s wait till all the facts are in.’”
This is a problematic mechanism which aims to run out the clock on an important issue, he explained. In most cases, the public never gets all the information, and denial by those supporting white supremacists can continue indefinitely.
Another part of this logic, Cole continued, is the suggestion that racists are ignorant and can’t help themselves.
“Well, doesn’t somebody have to teach you how to call a Black person a n****r or are you just born that way?” he said. “You don’t accidentally pick this stuff up if you don’t have contact with Black people. […] It is never a mistake. If you enable racism you are part of the problem. If […] you say that somebody who wants to come on McGill campus and give a talk who is advancing white supremacy, ‘Well I defend their free speech’, [then] you defend their white supremacist speech. Period. You’re enabling this to happen.”
“What we’re up against is willful ignorance,” Cole continued. “What we’re up against is the passive voice, ‘mistakes were made.’ We’re up against obtuseness, we’re up against people [feigning ignorance] when they know full well what we’re talking about because that allows them to keep running out the shock clock.”
Cole finished his talk by arguing that white privilege is a construct, and those who have that privilege must exist in a space of discomfort where they are forced to recognize and dismantle white supremacy.
“‘[It’s] not race, look over here, it’s the other thing.’ […] We’ve heard this time and time again.”
“I’m not saying ‘white privilege’ […] anymore,” he told his audience. “Again, it’s not something you were just born with and inherited. It’s something that you have to work everyday to protect and keep away from people. So I don’t want to talk about privilege. I want to put you in that uncomfortable place that you’ll be forced […] to interrogate yourself to turn the mirror back on yourself instead of asking me all the questions.
At the end of the talk Cole opened the conversation up to audience members.
“People are often in media and social commentary these days talking about racism as a disease,” asked one attendee. “What do you think about that in terms of how it shifts or removes responsibility from people for their own racism?”
“We have to be careful with that language,” answered Cole, “because […] you’re not a victim of racism by perpetuating it. […] [Racist logics] are also things that we do and introduce into the world as human beings that were not here before us. I think that a good way to deal with that is again to say, who is suffering from this disease and who is benefitting from it? […] What do the people who benefit do when they realize they’re benefitting from somebody else’s illness?”

2017-09-02,McGill,India,"The NDP leadership race, flooding in South Asia, and Indigenous resistance from Peru to Palestine
The New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) is holding its leadership elections between October 1-15, 2017. The party is selecting a leader to replace Tom Mulcair, and challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party and Andrew Scheer of the Conservative Party. Over the summer, the race has narrowed down to four candidates: Niki Ashton, Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Churchill, Manitoba; Charlie Angus, MPP for Timmins, Ontario; Guy Caron, MPP for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques, Quebec; and Jagmeet Singh, MPP for Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Ontario.
The race has largely focused on how to win back the support that was won in the 2011 federal election, and subsequently lost to the Liberals in 2015. A huge portion of that loss was suffered in Quebec, where Tom Mulcair’s opposition to Liberal Bill 62 was perceived negatively. Bill 62 is a bill put forward by the Provincial Liberals of Quebec to ban the wearing of face coverings by governmental employees in the province. The bill has been widely described as Islamophobic, as it would target Muslim women who wear the burqa or the niqab.
As the race moves into Quebec the only Quebecois candidate, Caron, has announced his support of the bill. Ashton initially suggested that she too supports it, later tempering her statement after receiving substantial criticism from her base. Angus, meanwhile, has stated that the matter must go to the courts, and that the government cannot infringe upon religious freedoms. Singh, who is Sikh and wears a turban, has not yet commented on the issue.
Polls in Quebec show a massive loss of interest in the NDP, with 68 per cent of the population describing themselves as “not interested” in a poll conducted by Léger. However, debates over religious freedoms are often explosive in Quebec, and the candidate who impresses the most in the province could generate considerable support for the party nationally.

On August 23 in Jubbet al-Dhib, a village in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian children ready to attend their first day of school were shocked to find the building demolished. The six-classroom school had been razed to the ground by Israeli military forces the night before, leaving volunteers and teachers scrambling to construct makeshift classrooms for the 64 students. A temporary tent to accommodate the children was pitched to replace the caravan school, which was donated by European Union humanitarian organizations.
In defiance of the destruction, students peacefully protested by singing the national anthem before returning home with new school backpacks.
The building and all school materials had been confiscated and/or demolished by Israeli forces on the grounds that no permit had been issued for the construction of the school. Reports claim local residents threw rocks at the soldiers in protest, while the soldiers used tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets to clear the area.
The school itself had been a step forward for Palestinian children in Jubbet al-Dhib in terms of gaining easier access to education. Jubbet al-Dhib is located in Area C of the West Bank, and is under the complete control of Israeli forces, which makes obtaining a permit for opening a Palestinian school almost impossible. The next closest Palestinian school to the village in question is an hour’s walk away over dangerous mountain terrain.
This incident is not an anomaly, but rather one demolition among 92 others this year alone conducted by Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank, despite widespread international condemnation.

Indigenous leaders in Peru have issued an official statement condemning the government for not adhering to laws regarding issues that affect the Indigenous population. Peru’s government is currently negotiating with Frontera Energy, an oil-based Canadian energy firm, on renewing a 30-year contract.
The leaders, who represent more than 100 Indigenous communities, referenced a law passed in 2011 that requires the government to consult these communities before implementing decisions that might impact their territories. However, Ángela Acevedo, the Director of Indigenous Peoples Rights at Peru’s Vice Ministry of Intercultural Affairs argues that while the law is in effect, the state still “takes the final decision.”
The Indigenous leaders, meanwhile, consider the negotiations an unlawful violation of their rights. To protest the government’s action, the Indigenous communities are threatening to prevent the oil firms from accessing their land if a valid consultation with the communities does not take place.
Added to the tribal rights issue is the concern over oil spills in the region. The United Nations special rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes stressed the importance of dealing with the existing environmental hazards before issuing any new deals or contracts that may further exacerbate the issue. Additionally, the rapporteur emphasized that the Indigenous peoples’ concerns should be included when making decisions such as these, because oil spills have been proven to contaminate water to a point that can cause poisoning and death.

As of August 28th, an especially aggressive flood has hit South Asia, causing major infrastructural damage and the deaths of approximately 1200 Indian, Nepali, and Bangladeshi citizens. The storm is said to have affected around 40 million people in the region already, and the situation is quickly exacerbating to an unprecedented level. While some loss brought about by the monsoon season in South Asia is expected, scientists say this level of damage is unnatural—it is the direct result of climate change. The extreme weather has deprived some villages in India of basic resources such as food and water, destroyed more than half a million homes in Nepal, and submerged approximately a third of Bangladeshi land. The relief efforts will require upwards of 100 million USD. The government of India has already pledged 78 million USD for the heavily affected Bihar state alone.

2017-09-27,McGill,India,"Rohingya face “truly brutal” violence amidst delicate political situation
Content warning: descriptions of violence, sexual assault mention
On Wednesday September 20, a roundtable discussion was held by the Southeast Asia Lectures Series and the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) on the systematic ethnic cleansing currently underway in Myanmar. The violence has forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims out of the country, causing a refugee crisis in neighbouring nations like Bangladesh. Professors Megan Bradley, Erik M. Kuhonta, Kazue Takamura, and Alexandre Pelletier considered multiple aspects of the humanitarian crisis, the relationship between violence and democratization in authoritarian contexts, the implications of statelessness, and the role of international actors in the crisis.
The Rohingya people of Myanmar’s Rakhine state have been subject to harsh collective punishment measures in recent weeks. The violence, carried out by government forces, has ostensibly constituted reprisals for the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army’s (ARSA) attack on a military outpost on August 25, which killed 12 soldiers. These reprisals have been “truly brutal,” said Kuhonta, with “attacks by helicopters, rapes against women, killings with guns as well as machetes.”
“By any criteria, this is the worst humanitarian disaster in the past several decades,” Kuhonta continued. In total, it is estimated that over 210 villages have been destroyed by fire, resulting in over 1000 deaths in less than four weeks. The systematic persecution of the Rohingya in northern Rakhine has also triggered a forced exodus – over 421,000 people have crossed the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, both by land and sea; UNICEF estimates half of the refugees to be children.
The United Nations has declared the crisis “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” though certain academic communities were categorizing the situation as an ongoing genocide as early as 2015. However, Myanmar’s de facto ruler and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly denied the state’s involvement in the continued persecution of the Rohingya. In fact, her office has claimed the Rohingya have been setting fire to their own properties and blaming the security forces, though no evidence was provided to support the allegations.
“By any criteria, this is the worst humanitarian disaster in the past several decades.”
Aung San Suu Kyi’s 25-day-long silence on the crisis was sharply criticized by the international community. Many predicted the fall of an icon, and questioned her standing as a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Some considered revoking awards, including her honorary Canadian citizenship. Suu Kyi addressed the issue Tuesday in an address to the Myanmar parliament in Naypyidaw.
The panel’s speakers explained that although one cannot morally justify Aung San Suu Kyi’s relative silence, it is important to note the precariousness of the political context. The National League for Democracy (NLD) has been in power in Myanmar since 2015, with Aung San Suu Kyi as de facto leader. However, the military retains significant control over the country’s institutions with a fixed quarter of parliamentary seats, exclusive authority over crucial posts in the executive, and veto power for constitutional amendment.
From a political standpoint, to publicly denounce the army’s persecution of the Rohingya jeopardizes the stability of Suu Kyi’s government. Be that as it may, said Kuhonta, echoing Desmond Tutu’s words to Aung San Suu Kyi, “If the political price of the liberalization and potential democratization in Myanmar is the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, then the price is surely too steep.”
“If the political price of the liberalization and potential democratization in Myanmar is the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, then the price is surely too steep.”
According to Alexandre Pelletier, a political science Ph.D candidate at the University of Toronto, the marginalization of the Muslim-majority Rohingya in Buddhist-majority Myanmar is rooted in a variety of short- and long-term factors. These include ethnic grievances rooted in critical disagreement on and suspicions around whether the Rohingya truly belong in Rakhine state. The widespread and long-standing prejudices against Indians and South Asians in Myanmar is a consequence of British colonial rule.
Takamura, a professor of International Development Studies, highlighted the state’s strained majority-minority ethnic relations, referring to the government’s continued reliance on arbitrary racial classifications, which has worsened the tensions in Myanmar.
“The issue of the term ‘Rohingya’ is very contentious in Myanmar,” agreed Kuhonta, noting that the Rohingya are excluded from the government’s list of 135 officially recognized ethnicities.
Bradley, a Political Science professor at McGill, told the panel that the humanitarian crisis is a real-life illustration of power imbalances and pathologies in the international refugee regime. Bangladesh has accepted over 421,000 Rohingya refugees crossing over its borders in less than a month. This number is 70 times higher than the number of asylum-seekers who crossed the U.S.-Canada border in August. Bradley pointed to the discrepancy between the availability of resources in Canada and number of refugees this country has taken in.
In response to the crisis in Myanmar, the Bangladeshi government’s announcement of new refugee camp construction points to a future of protracted displacement and encampment for the Rohingya refugees.
“Encampment [in temporary accommodations]” as opposed to local integration is “the worst possible option […] for refugees in terms of their individual human rights, well-being, and livelihoods,” said Professor Bradley.
Myanmar currently has the largest stateless population in the region, well ahead of Brunei, Malaysia, and Thailand, with over 440,000 stateless individuals. Takamura reflected on the devastating implications of Rohingya statelessness, and the inherent “precariousness and vulnerability” it produces.

2017-09-27,McGill,India,"Professors discuss the limitations of UNDRIP
On Thursday September 21, the Indigenous Law Association and the Faculty of Law held a discussion concerning Canada’s implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The event featured guest speakers Dr. Hayden King, an Anishinaabe scholar from the Beausoleil First Nation of Gchi’mnissing, Huronia and Dr. John Burrows, the Research Chair in Indigenous Law at the University of Victoria Law School in British Columbia. The discussion began with a land acknowledgment, then a panel on Indigenous rights and self governance, followed by a question period.
The United Nations describes UNDRIP as “a universal framework of minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the Indigenous peoples of the world and it elaborates on existing human rights standards and fundamental freedoms as they apply to the specific situation of Indigenous peoples.”
The UN General Assembly passed UNDRIP in 2007. Though Canada initially voted against it, the federal government decided to remove Canada’s objector status in 2016. Borrows noted that the current Liberal government has made a promise to implement the UNDRIP while in power.
The implementation of UNDRIP concerns Section 35 of Canada’s Constitution, a framework which recognizes and affirms the legal rights of Aboriginal people in Canada, “I would like this to mean a repudiation of the way the Supreme Court of Canada approaches Aboriginal treaty rights under section 35.1 of the Constitution,” Borrows said. He explained the importance of a broader interpretation of Section 35, reminding the audience that the infringement of Section 35 constitutes a violation of Aboriginal rights.
Borrows mentioned that the understanding of the rights of Indigenous peoples needs to come from a dialogue between Indigenous communities that takes into consideration varying schools of thought. “We’d be looking at the treaties that we have with the plants, and the rocks, and the water. Understanding our relationships with the plants, and the animals, and the insects […] and really seeing UNDRIP in that light,” he said.
Borrows pointed to R. v. Van der Peet, a Supreme Court case which determined that any Aboriginal person claiming the right to participate in an activity protected by Section 35 of the Constitution must prove that the activity was practiced in pre-colonial Aboriginal society. This would greatly restrict the ability of Indigenous peoples to have their rights respected if their actions cannot be traced to cultural practices that took place before first contact with European colonists.
“What UNDRIP does is set [rights] in place without having to prove them. There’s a recognition that Indigenous peoples have a right to self-determination, have a right to land, languages, media, family relations without having to go through an expansive process of having to justify that to anyone else in the world,” Borrows said.
“There’s a recognition that Indigenous peoples have a right to self-determination, have a right to land, languages, media, family relations without having to go through an expansive process of having to justify that to anyone else in the world.”
King told the audience that UNDRIP’s strong language concerning the assertion and protection of Indigenous rights was significantly diluted with Article 46. Article 46 allows states subject to UNDRIP to place certain limitations on the “the exercise of the rights set forth in this Declaration.” The addition of Article 46 allow states to disregard their obligations to their Indigenous populations on the basis of territorial integrity and defense of sovereignty.
“[Article 46] is effectively a backdoor out of the declaration of the rights of Indigenous peoples […] The declaration allows states to evacuate the previous forty-five articles if they so choose,” said King. “From 2010 to present we’ve had minister after minister of Indian affairs, when asked for comment on the declaration, say that it is aspirational. [They say] we’ll work toward implementing [it], but in a Canadian version, through the Canadian constitutional framework.”
“[Article 46] is effectively a backdoor out of the declaration of the rights of Indigenous peoples […] The declaration allows states to evacuate the previous forty-five articles if they so choose.”
Several states objected to the vast majority of the articles that were contained within the draft resolution, resulting in their revision. The final resolution also included a rewritten version of article 46, which prohibits any action which, according to the declaration, would “dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States.”
This July, the federal government announced ten principles by which it will abide in the aim of working on a stronger nation-to-nations relationship with Indigenous communities. The federal government states that the principles are an attempt to move toward reconciliation with Indigenous communities, by respecting Indigenous rights and focusing on the importance of cooperation and partnership.
He told the audience that certain principles within the document allow for nothing more than a strict and narrow interpretation of the Canada’s obligation to Aboriginal rights under Section 35. Principle number seven states that any infringement of Section 35 must be justified with a consultation and accommodation of Aboriginal communities. King noted the loose requirements to justify the infringement. “Now, the community doesn’t have a right to say no. They’re just consulted. And Canada or Ontario or Quebec can infringe [on their rights] anyway,” King said. “If we say no to a development that affects us, that should mean no.”
King concluded that if the federal government is serious about respecting Indigenous rights and committing itself to the implementation of justice, it should move to open the Constitution in order to include all articles of UNDRIP, including article 46.
“The things that’s been missing from our conversation right now is that massive transfer of resources, of land,” King said. “If we have that transfer of lands and resources, then we’d see First Nations do a lot better, more substantive progress toward transforming Indigenous nations into what we want to see them become.”
“The things that’s been missing from our conversation right now is that massive transfer of resources, of land. […] If we have that transfer of lands and resources, then we’d see First Nations do a lot better, more substantive progress toward transforming Indigenous nations into what we want to see them become.”
King discussed how recognition of Indigenous rights need to move beyond symbolic gestures such as like territorial acknowledgement. “There’s a difference between symbolic recognition–which will get us positive recognition and a decline in racism, which is a good thing–and material recognition,” King told the audience.
“What is [the government] actually doing in a material sense? There’s all this great talk about [symbolic reconciliation]— an inukshuk here, a teepee there […] but what are we actually doing?”
Even with the symbolic implementation or commitment to UNDRIP, King says the material needs of Indigenous peoples must be met. He states that so long as Indigenous communities own such little land and face harsh socioeconomic realities, true progress will be a struggle.
For Aboriginal treaties to be respected, Borrows noted, the reciprocal relationship between communities, governments, and their environments must be honored. Borrows noted communities like the Ahousaht First Nation, are protesting the anchoring of an open-net salmon farm near Tofino, B.C. by using fishing boats to set up a blockade.
“As long as we keep damaging our rivers,” Borrows said, “as long as we keep preventing things from growing, as long as we’re blocking out or changing the sun in a way that then impacts our climate, then we are not living by our treaties.”
“There’s a difference between symbolic recognition–which will get us positive recognition and a decline in racism, which is a good thing–and material recognition. […] What is [the government] actually doing in a material sense?”

2017-11-19,McGill,India,"McGill students must educate themselves on racial discrimination
On November 9th, QPIRG McGill hosted an “Anti-Racism 101” workshop as part of their Culture Shock event series. The series ran from November 7th to November 12th and dealt with issues such as anti-racism, migrant justice, and Indigenous solidarity. The anti-racism workshop was moderated by Vincent Mousseau, a community organizer and activist for groups such as Montreal Noir, Pervers/Cité, and RÉZO. Mousseau is currently studying Social Work at McGill.
The workshop began with a discussion about the difference between racial discrimination and racism. Mousseau defined racial discrimination as “discrimination based on aspects such as race and skin colour, which is a manifestation of prejudice.” They noted that “prejudice is the idea, and discrimination is acting upon that idea.” They also stressed that “anyone can be discriminatory towards anyone of any other group; [however], racism is understood as the systemic institutionalization of these prejudices. This is present everywhere…I live in fear of my life and I think of these things consistently.”
Mousseau continued by discussing their own experiences with racism, citing one of their first experiences at McGill. “When I got to McGill the first thing I did was buy a McGill lanyard, a McGill hoodie, and I kept my student card in the front of my wallet.”
“The reason for this is I have not worn a hoodie since Trayvon Martin died. I am terrified of what any interaction with the Montreal police can look like for me in this way. And I know that, as unfortunate as it is…it is more unacceptable to kill a McGill student than it is to kill a Black person.”
“As unfortunate as it is…it is more unacceptable to kill a McGill student than it is to kill a Black person.”
Mousseau discussed Indigenous residential schools as an example of racialized violence. “As Sir John A. MacDonald…said, this was the attempt to ‘kill the Indian in the child.’” Mousseau also spoke of the Sixties Scoop, “where social workers actively targeted Indigenous communities, found the smallest reason to pull children from their homes, and adopted them into white families.”
“A person that I adore and respect, Nakuset, who is the Executive Director of the Native Women’s Shelter in Montreal, was taken from her community and adopted into a Jewish family in Montreal and was told that she was brown because she was from Israel. That’s the reality of her life. She had to go through trying to understand that and go through these aspects of racialization.”
“We are on stolen land…the reason why we are here as settlers, irrespective of our issues of racialization, is because of the inherent violence that was committed against Indigenous populations, this act of cultural genocide being one of them.”
“We are on stolen land…the reason why we are here as settlers, irrespective of our issues of racialization, is because of the inherent violence that was committed against Indigenous populations, this act of cultural genocide being one of them.”
When asked about systemic racism at McGill, Mousseau talked about the SSMU building closure and the effect that it is having on student groups. For example, the Muslim Students’ Association will no longer have a space to pray. “When SSMU tells folks, ‘Oh, oops, surprise! Your building is being shut down,’ [and] there is a prayer space so many students on our campus rely on [that is] being taken away from them, that’s an issue.”
Mousseau also talked about the importance of SSMU as a space for marginalized groups to organize. “[Soon] there [will] no longer [be a] specific hub [for] Black queer [people]. [Right now] you can walk between Queer McGill and the Black Student Network in order to try to organize something. That is a barrier to making sure that our services are represented. This is just an example of some of the violence that exists against racialized folks at McGill. It’s often times coming from a place like ‘we didn’t even think about it that way.’”
“I try to give this workshop in order to try to raise consciousness on these issues and try to force people trying to organizing on campus to think more about the [role] racism plays in their organizing.”
An anonymous participant added to the conversation, “You need to call out your white friends for their racism. Direct them to specific resources. Educate yourself. You can not surround yourself with people of colour for the sole purpose of having them educate you. Do your own educating.”

Ahed Tamimi’s trial began at the Ofer Military Court on February 13 behind closed doors, as an Israeli military judge banned media from entering the court. Tamimi’s trial has been deemed illegal by United Nations human rights investigators, who stated that it violates her rights under international law. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also condemned Tamimi’s detention. Tamimi garnered international media attention in December, after a video of her slapping and hitting Israeli soldiers went viral. Every year, the state of Israel detains and prosecutes 500 to 700 Palestinian children as it continues to illegally occupy the Palestinian West Bank.

According to a report published in December 2017, the economic, social, and economic crisis in Venezuela has caused more than one million people to leave the country between 2014 and 2017. Of the entire population of forced migrants, only 103,000 have requested refugee status, in the region and in Spain. In 2017, 17,130 demands for refugee status were registered by the Brazilian Federal Police. Brazil and other neighbouring countries are reinforcing police and military presence on their border with Venezuela, boxing in the country’s citizens to face famine and social unrest.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported that ethnic violence has pushed over 22,000 people to flee from the north-east of the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) to Uganda. In total, 34,000 people have fled the province of Ituri since the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of the month, thirty people have been killed following fighting between Hema herders and Lendu farmers of the province. In December 2016, President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his term coming to an end, leading 120,000 to flee the country in 2017. Domestic and international fear of a new civil war in the DRC increases as ethnic clashes continue in the central African country.

The establishment of “Modicare” was announced at the Indian union budget meeting for 2018-2019. The program will allow about half of the Indian population to gain access to health insurance. While the government has described the scheme as “the world’s largest government funded health care program,” the government has come under criticism. The programme is described as an initiative to court poor rural voters in next year’s general election, as many of them struggle with high healthcare costs. India currently is one of the world’s lowest spenders in public health, with only about one percent of its GDP being invested in the sector. The country is also plagued by a shortage of hospitals and doctors, but the government has taken steps towards making health services more accessible.

2018-02-19,McGill,India,"Trial verdict reflects failure of Canada’s criminal justice system 
On Tuesday February 13, a crowd of about 200 Indigenous and non-Indigenous people gathered at Norman Bethune Square in Montreal near Concordia University to commemorate the life of Colten Boushie and raise awareness about the injustice in the trial following his death. Boushie, a young Cree man from Red Pheasant First Nation, was killed by Gerald Stanley, a 56-year-old white man, in Saskatchewan in August 2016. Last week, on February 9, despite overwhelming evidence indicating Stanley’s guilt, an all-white jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder.
Across the country, the verdict served as a stark reminder of the failures of Canada’s criminal justice system for First Nations, Inuit, and Metis people. The decisions made during the process of this trial reflect Canada’s lasting colonial justice system. The vigil, co-hosted by the Native Women’s Shelter of Montreal , was planned before the release of the verdict.
During the vigil, a powwow singing group, The Buffalo Hat Singers, and the drum carrier, Norman Achneepineskum, a member of the Cree nation, began the ceremony. Many individuals in attendance brought candles and signs of protest, emphasizing the two pronged message behind the vigil. These signs depicted a picture of Colten in his graduation gown, captioned Justice for Colten. The event was accompanied by approximately twenty police officers. Near the centre of the crowd, people wore black armbands embroidered with “Justice for Colten” in white. Opening the vigil was co-chair of the Montreal Urban Aboriginal Community Strategy Network, Vicky Baldo. Baldo is a survivor of the Sixties Scoop; a practice of the Canadian government during the 1960s that placed Indigenous children in adoption centers and white foster homes.
Another speaker, Clifton Ariwakehte Nicholas, discussed Canada’s treatment of young Indigenous men, highlighting this with his personal experiences of loss. “Last year [my nephew] Clint killed himself. He could not live in the world for the modern Indian man […] since [Colten’s] verdict came down, it feels as if that was my child that was shot down.” He continued, “I don’t want [my] rage to translate into more violence, I want it to translate into change.”

2018-02-26,McGill,India,"Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev approved on a decree concerning an alphabet switchover without warning last Monday, likely in response to the unpopularity of the new apostrophe-heavy alphabet adopted last October. Nazarbayev signed off on a 32-letter version of the alphabet that almost nobody has seen before, and ordered officials to ensure that the alphabet be implemented within the next seven years. The new alphabet contains fewer apostrophes, which have been replaced in favour of accents. Prior to the decree, Kazakhstan used a 42-letter Cyrillic alphabet. The government has advocated for the new alphabet which they claim will be better suited for typing on computers, in order to boost to country’s modernization. Prior to the most recent alphabetical switch, one Kazakh newspaper, Arqalyq Habary, was already publishing with the new alphabet. In the Gabit Musirepov district of the North Kazakhstan region, authoritieshave already began issuing letters to residents in the new 32-letter script. They will now have to change their alphabet again.

At least 44 people are dead after a bus fell approximately 200 meters into a ravine in Ocoña District of the Arequipa region in southern Peru. The operator Rey Latino stated that the bus was carrying around 45 people, but police stated that there were probably more passengers on the bus because additional passengers boarded en route and did not appear in the initial register, suggesting the official death toll with increase. The bus also did not have permission to drive on the Panamericana Sur highway, its permit having expired in 2016 according to the Regional Management of Transportation of Arequipa. Road accidents are common in Peru, where roads are not considered to be safe, and bus drivers lack training. Nevertheless, Peruvian judicial authorities and police claim that these high crash rates are due to the speeding and imprudence of drivers. This is the second most deadly crash of the year, however: in early January, a bus collided with a truck careened off a cliff, killing 48.

A new marine protected area has been created in the Indian Ocean around the Seychelle islands. The zone is 210,000-square kilometres wide, an area equivalent to nearly half of the Black Sea. The government’s goal in creating this sanctuary is to protect the sea and the archipelago’s economy, which is heavily reliant on fishing and tourism. The new zone is the result of a financial deal brokered by American NGO The Nature Conservancy. The NGO levied $21 million to pay off an outstanding sovereign debt, in exchange for conservation funding to protect this ocean-dependent nation. Environment minister Didier Dogley said that by 2020, close to a third of Seychelles waters will be protected against deep-sea mining, dredging, oil and gas exploration, and unregulated and illegal fishing. Like many other oceanic nations, Seychelles is one of the nations most vulnerable to climate change, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification, as its economy is almost totally reliant on marine resources.

These conflicts remain, according to the politician, “the major challenges in the state.” On the same day, UN investigators said they had identified more than 40 South Sudanese officials and military officers alledgedly responsible of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The civil war started five years ago in 2013, following a split between President Kiir and his former Vice President, Riek Machar. Tens of thousands of people have died, and between 2.5 and 4 million people have been displaced.

2018-03-20,McGill,India,"McGill’s Indigenous Student Alliance holds demonstration and walkout
On March 14, the Indigenous Student Alliance (ISA) held a demonstration at the Y-intersection on the downtown campus to protest the ongoing injustices against Indigenous peoples in Canada. The demonstration was organized in the wake of the acquittals of Gerald Stanley and Raymond Cormier, who murdered Colten Boushie, 22, and Tina Fontaine, 15, respectively. Brady Francis, 22, was also recently killed in a hit-and-run. The event was inspired by similar walkouts which took place at the University of Victoria and the University of Toronto. Indigenous speakers were invited to share their perspectives on the Canadian government’s failures against Indigenous people. The speakers also encouraged Indigenous students and allies to take action. Speeches were followed by drum performances by the Buffalo Hat Singers, a group based in Montreal, and the Medicine Bear Singers, an Indigenous group from McGill.
Carlee Kawinehta Loft, the Indigenous Affairs Commissioner at SSMU, spoke first. She started off by reading the land acknowledgment, then pointed to the fact that recent cases are not unique, and that injustices against Indigenous people are a nationwide problem.
“The injustices they faced happened far from here, in territories you maybe haven’t even been to, but remember that injustices and colonial violence happen here too, in this territory, here on the unceded, stolen land of the Kanien’kehá:ka.”
Loft explained how Canadian institutions are responsible for perpetuating these injustices on a national and local scale. “These injustices occur due to the nation-wide implementation of various Canadian systems which systematically devalue Indigenous lives,” she explained. “These [systems] include the child welfare system, the so-called justice system, the educational system, and many others.”
At the end of her introductory speech, Loft expanded on the responsibility of university students to use their educational privilege to learn and care about Indigenous issues, in order to enact change. More than just a commemorative event, the demonstration aimed to encourage allies (i.e. non-Indigenous folks who wish to support) to take action.
“I’m happy you came today but remember that your action doesn’t stop here. It doesn’t stop today and there are many ways that you can reach out. You go and become involved with different activist organizations, you can look into where to to donate.”
This point was emphasized by the next speaker, Nakuset, who is the executive director of the Native Women’s Shelter in Montreal. “Look into the organizations that are doing the work, either join them, model them, use them as role models and help us, because when you all came to this land, we helped you, and we would like it if you returned the favor.”
She highlighted the resilience of Indigenous people, who, against all odds, are still alive today, and are pushing for their rights to be respected. “After all the things that the government has done to us we should all be dead, but we’re still here, and we are just trying to have a fighting chance.”
Nakuset is a survivor of the Sixties Scoop, a state-sanctioned assimilation process which took place during the 1960s, and which saw Indigenous children being taken from their families to be placed in foster homes or put up for adoption.
“Most of us were brought up to be ashamed of our cultures,” she explained. “I ended up getting my education right. By working at the Native Women’s Shelter, I create projects to help Indigenous women, because we see here in Montreal that there is a lack of services for Indigenous people, and there is injustice on so many levels.”
Referring to the Brady Francis’s case, for which no one has been arrested yet, and which further exemplifies injustices in the Canadian legal system, she stated: “Our people keep dying and […] no one is held accountable. And this is today so what is going to happen tomorrow? What are we going to do as a community to make sure that things change?”
Talia, a student at Concordia University, spoke next, sharing her lived experience and personal history. She recited a poem, which can be found in The Daily’s commentary section this week.
“I grew up exactly like Colten, Tina, and Brady, in poverty, in foster care with drunk, young parents who constantly fought in front of us. I have a lot of those memories, that I am not trying to forget, but that I’m trying to let go, as I try not to let them direct my path.”
Originally from Saskatchewan, she highlighted the importance of being aware that even if Indigenous racism and prejudice may not be as visible in Montreal, “they’re very fucking real out in the prairies. I remember being in grade [school] and realizing that no matter what I did with my life, they would see nothing more than my brown skin, and not even consider me human.”
Ben Geboe, the executive director of the American Indian Community House in New York City, put forth some numbers, and further highlighted the resilience of the Indigenous community and the necessity of taking action. “Right now there are 95 cases against the Canadian crown for the rivers, the mountains, the lakes. It’s not an ideological or passive battle, it is actually happening. We are languishing, but yet we are surviving with the help of great activism.”
Denzel, one of the drummers, expressed his thoughts on the event and on allyship. “I am happy with the turnout, happy to see how many people came out to support us. It’s important to have appeal from all and to have them join us because we all need to call for justice for Indigenous people, not just [from] Indigenous people.”
Similarly, Talia claimed that “non-Indigenous and every minority in Canada needs to learn the history, and fight with us.” She finished her speech by recounting a prophecy an elder told her.
“It’s a prophecy that we had seven generations ago that we were going to lose and suffer for seven generations. Then for another seven generations we are going to start to heal, and reclaim our language, our names, and our clans. I am that eighth generation that will help spark the fire. If I had known my culture when I was a weak kid, I’d probably be a lot further in life, and would probably love myself a lot more.”

2018-09-03,McGill,India,"SLAV at the Jazz Fest
This summer’s Montreal Jazz Fest faced intense international controversy for its support, and production, of SLAV, a musical described as a “theatrical odyssey based on slave songs”, featuring white creators and mainly white actors. Due to the violent history behind the show’s subject matter, the lack of Black representation in the performance caused outcry and sparked protests. In creating the show, Robert LePage and Betty Bonifassi, consulted artists of colour and were encouraged to include more artists of colour in the show, yet did not follow these recommendations. One reviewer for the Montreal Gazette commented, “[the performers] wearing scarves in their hair and flowing skirts, mimed picking cotton; and that’s where things began to fall apart. Accepting the image of white women picking cotton requires a significant degree of cognitive dissonance. It was but the first of many such instances.”
The following protests lead some showgoers to accuse protesters of threatening free speech, telling them to instead focus on the art. The same reviewer had comments on this matter as well: “This is not a comment on their talent but their skin colour, which pretty much disqualifies them from credibly portraying black slaves.”
SLAV’s remaining performances were cancelled at the Montreal Jazz Festival after the controversial show quickly gained widespread attention and even caused some performers to withdraw from the festival in protest.
The show is still scheduled to be performed early next year in other parts of Quebec.

Since August 8, the Indian state of Kerala has experienced a particularly horrendous spell of monsoon rain, wherein the state receivied one third more than usual precipitation, and subsequent flooding. Over 400 people have lost their lives in the flooding epidemic, with close to a million others displaced. Rescue operations have since ended but significant funds are needed to start rebuilding and rehabilitating the land. In line with Kerala and India’s past actions during natural disasters, the government is denying any and all offers of foreign aid, a move which local officials are condemning, considering the level of damage in the area. Instead, the government of Kerala has set up The Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund for civilian donations.
It is expected that Kerala will continue to suffer damages both physically and financially. Farming, construction, and tourism were all put on hold during the height of flooding, and the  state’s largest  airport in Kochi was shut down for a number of weeks, only recently resuming service. In comments made to Reuters, the State Financial Minister of Kerala T.M. Thomas Isaac said he expected GDP for the area to drop by 2%. It is estimated that the tourism industry, responsible for roughly 10% of the state’s economy and 25% of the state’s jobs, will suffer a $357 million loss as a result of the flood. The Chief Minister of Kerala now believes that the original estimate of $2.8 billion (USD) for damages and repairs across the province will not be enough to rectify the trauma. 
Student protests in Bangladesh
Two students died in a violent bus crash in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, on July 29. The tragedy has since caused outrage, prompting  other students to organize protests over the condition of the country’s roads. The accident in question occurred when a speeding bus from a privately owned company ran into a group of students, killing two, and injuring many others. Accidents like this are not uncommon in Bangladesh; the World Health Organization estimates that around 300,000 people die in road accidents in the nation each year. In protest of the bus crash and the general unsafety of the roads, students in Dhaka protested these conditions by taking over the streets, only letting emergency vehicles through and making sure that all drivers are in possession of a license. Despite the success of these students, reports say that during their takeover congestion in the city dramatically decreased, the Bangladeshi Government is outraged at their conduct, using violent measures to “control the problem”.
In early August, authorities resorted to beating protesters with batons, even using water cannons and tear gas on student demonstrators outside Dhaka University. A prominent journalist, Shahidul Alam, has also been arrested for his comments made in support of the protests and against the government. Alam is now coming forward with allegations that he was tortured by authorities while in custody. Activists are concerned that if authorities continue abusing students on the street, this abuse will continue while protesters are held in custody.
While the government of Bangladesh is not in support of the students and their actions, they recently  tabled a new piece of legislation including some of the demands put forward by the student protesters called The Road Transport Act 2018, which is now awaiting legislative approval.
The protests ended August 6, and while during the height of the action roads were deemed safer, since the dispersion of demonstrators, some say that the roads have reverted back to their original, dangerous condition. Bangladesh’s National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads, and Railways reports that between July 29 and August 27, 282 road accidents were recorded resulting in 315 deaths and 819 injuries.      
Canada-Saudi Arabia human rights dispute
On August 2, Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s Minister of foreign affairs tweeted her shock over Saudi Arabia’s arrest of women’s rights activist Samar Badawi. Badawi’s brother,  Raif Badawi, also an activist, has been detained since 2012. In her tweet she expressed her anger over the situation and called for the release of both the siblings. “Very alarmed to learn that Samar Badawi, Raif Badawi’s sister, has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. Canada stands together with the Badawi family in this difficult time, and we continue to strongly call for the release of both Raif and Samar Badawi,” wrote Freeland. The following day both The Canadian Foreign Ministry and the Canadian Embassy in Saudi Arabia also shared tweets with similar sentiments to Freeland’s. On August 5 the Kingdom’s Foreign Ministry responded, also via  Twitter, saying Canada had a “negative” attitude and was “interfering with the internal affairs of the Kingdom”. The ministry further declared  that no new trade or investments will be made with Canada and tweeting the exile of Canada’s ambassador to the country, demanding that he leave within the next 24 hours.  The Saudi government  has also suspended all flights to Toronto, withdrawn support for over 15,000 students studying in Canada with the exception of medical students who are allowed temporary stay in the country , and is moving all Saudi patients receiving treatment in Canada to other countries.
Canada has stood behind its claims and has recently gained international support through a letter signed by numerous international dignitaries. As Saudi Arabia plans to behead a female activist for the first time in the Kingdom’s history, Canada is standing by Freeland’s original comments, with Prime Minister Trudeau saying in a press conference: “Canadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly and politely about the need to respect human rights around the world. We will continue to stand up for Canadian values and human rights.”
There is no word yet on if Canada will make an attempt to withdraw from its existing arms deal with Saudi Arabia.              
Ontario elections
Doug Ford, leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives, became the new premier of Ontario following the  party’s majority election win on June 7 of this year. The election of Ford disrupted the consecutive 15 years of Liberal government in Ontario, ousting Kathleen Wynne as Premier. The Liberal party, for the first time in 161 years, did not win enough seats to maintain party status, winning only seven  seats across the province. The NDP, led by Andrea Horvath is now the official opposition party.
Ford, during the campaign did not provide a fiscal platform like the other candidates, instead offered  a list of promises with a focus on restoring “respect for the taxpayers”.
Since his election, Doug Ford and the Progressive Conservatives have followed through on a few of their promises. Highlights of the Ford Government’s actions include: the cancelling of municipal elections for the Regional Chair position across the province, the termination  of Ontario’s Basic Income Project, withdrawing from Ontario’s cap and trade program and related energy programs, and reverting back to the province’s 1998 sex-ed curriculum instead of using the controversial 2015 version. Most recently, Ford introduced the Buck-A-Beer program, one of the main policies of Ford’s campaign, which would mandate the lowest price for a can of beer to be $1, with incentives for breweries to  offer  beer at this price.

2018-09-10,McGill,India,"U.S. cuts funding for UN refugee agency
The United States discontinued funding to a United Nations agency that aids Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria on August 31 2018. The U.S. has been a major contributor to the The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for decades; in 2017, the United States donated $350 million to the agency, and was planning to make the same contribution this year. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, offers a multitude of health, educational, and social services to Palestinians. The UNRWA helps attain schooling for over 500,000 children in the area, and grant medical aide to 9 million. The Trump administration also recently cut $200 million in aid to other agencies helping Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. To explain this cut of funding, the U.S. government described the UNRWA as “irredeemably flawed,” and said their business strategy is “unsustainable.” In response to the United State’s decision, the UNRWA stated that “the international […] community, our donors and host countries have consistently praised UNRWA for its achievements and standards.” The U.S. used to supply 30% of its total budget, meaning that the elimination of funding from the U.S. could have disastrous results for millions of Palestinian refugees. In response to the actions of the US., Arab and European countries have promised to continue to defend the UNRWA, and Germany has pledged to increase its aid for the program. In May of this year, President Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to the much disputed city of Jerusalem, a decision critics believe is in line with the funding cut, and an overall shift towards a more pro-Israel stance.
Trans Migrant Sex Worker Vanessa Campos Murdered in France
content warning: death, anti-sex work sentiment, transphobia
Vanesa Campos, a trans Peruvian migrant sex worker, was murdered by seven to eight men while trying to protect a client from being robbed at the Bois de Boulogne (West of Paris, France), the night of August 16. A new protest in honour of Vanesa Campos is scheduled for September 22 2018. 5 men are currently being detained for “organised group murder” and “group thefts with hurt.” Associations, like Acceptess Transgenres (AcceptessT) and STRASS (a French sex worker union), have been protesting the government’s silence, especially that of Marlène Schiappa’s, France’s Secretary of Equality between women and men. They particularly criticize France’s laws on sex work, which penalize clients and push sex workers into precarity. Activists also decry the general treatment of trans people, sex workers, and migrants in French society. On the matter, a representative of STRASS wrote: “our [sex workers’] deaths are normalised. […] A trans woman who dies remains a ‘tranny’.”
Journalists arrested in Myanmar 
Two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, are being sentenced to prison for 7 years for the possession of official Myanmar documents. They were investigating the massacre of 10 Rohingya men in the Burmese village of Inn Din. The verdict is being considered a roadblock for the country’s free press and transition to democracy. Multiple governments and International Human Rights groups are calling for the reporters’ immediate release.
The reporters pleaded not guilty to violating Myanmar’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which is an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. They claim that they were framed by the police: the reporters told the court that two police officials handed them the papers at a restaurant in Yangon just prior to their arrest by other officers. Testimony presented by prosecution witnesses was contradictory. Another police witness testified the restaurant meeting was a set-up to block, or punish, the journalists for their reporting on the mass killings of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine by Burmese military officials.
UN investigators have called for senior Burmese military officials to be prosecuted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The State Counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has remained silent on the issue, and has been criticized for failing to stand up for the free press after having championed the rights of journalists during her own house arrest.
India overturns section 377
The Indian Supreme Court decriminalized the “carnal intercourse” clause under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code on September 6 2018, in what experts are calling a “landmark decision”. While Section 377 still exists, it can no longer be used to punish consensual gay sex. This law originated from the British colonization of India in the mid-1800s, and continued to be used for prosecution, despite Britain decriminalizing homosexuality in 1967. In a public statement, Chief Justice Dipak Misra described the law as being “irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary.”
In 2008, a High Court in New Delhi overturned the law and decriminalized homosexuality. However, in 2013 this order from the New Delhi High Court was brought to the Supreme Court and ruled unconstitutional, reinstating Section 377. The Supreme Court decided to revisit the legality of Section 377 through the lens of privacy; in 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that privacy was an essential human right and that “sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy.” Following this decision, the recent revision to Section 377 focused on protecting the privacy of consenting adults. Currently, gay marriage and the adoption of children by same-sex couples is still criminalized, but many LGBTQ+ activists have been invigorated by the recent developments and are hopeful for future change. Dhrubo Jyoti, a queer LGBTQ+ activist, told CNN in an interview that the decriminalization of Section 377 “not just affirms one’s faith in the Constitution, but it also means that the gloom and the despair in this atmosphere of abuse for many of us, hopefully, for a new generation of queer people, it won’t be there.”

2018-09-15,McGill,India,"Documentary brings together community for a discussion on women’s identity in modern India 
Last week’s documentary screening of Nisha Pahuja’s The World Before Her, co-hosted by Montreal’s South Asian Youth (SAY) Collective and the Bhoomi Project, brought together dozens of community members and university students to discuss the negotiation of women’s identities in twenty-first century India. 
The film contrasts the journeys of two groups of women in India – those competing in the 2011 Miss India pageant, and those serving in leadership roles in the Hindu nationalist Durga Vahini camps. It focuses on the experiences of two women: Prachi, a Durga Vahini leader who wishes to devote her life completely to the Hindu movement but whose parents want her to get married and have kids. The other is Ruhi, who is striving to win the title of Miss India and describes her stress about achieving her ambitions. The film explores how both of these women’s situations have shaped their dreams and ambitions, as well as their worldview.  
Emina Ghajizai, a U3 Arts student, organized the screening along with Mehar Gujral, a recent Arts graduate, and Harleen Bhogal, coordinator of youth programming at the South Asian Women’s Community Centre. The three are members of the SAY Collective, which frequently hosts film screenings on topics relevant to women and people of colour. 
Following the screening, Bhogal, Ghajizai, and Gujral led a discussion of the film. Bhogal emphasized that the debrief was intended to discuss the social issues addressed in the film or to share any reactions the viewers may have had, rather than to merely critique the film direction. 
The audience reflected on the contrast between the experiences of the women in the two settings of the film: the Durga Vahini camp and the Miss India pageant.  
“[The film] takes the perspective of the women and each of their dreams and aspirations – the worlds they are born into – to look at how they are being exploited and whether they realize what they have gotten themselves into,” Ghajizai said.  “We’re talking about how different the same woman would be if born into a different world. It shows how women are competing to succeed in these worlds and the dreams and aspirations they have as a result.”
The World Before Her also highlights the roles of the girls’ parents on the dreams and ambitions of their daughters. Both of them strive to live up to their families’ expectations while negotiating their own identities.
Gujral explained that “in the beginning you don’t understand why one of these girls wants to be Miss India or a Hindu nationalist, but you see that their parents’ aspirations for them are so important, which is a reflection of Indian society, and other societies in the world where what your parents want for you is so important.”
Shaista Asmi, a U3 Arts and Science student who participated in the discussion, echoed this view, saying that “both Ruhi and Prachi are reiterated as being creations or products of their parents. It is relatable, feeling so obligated to your parents and fulfilling their wishes.”
Although patriarchy manifests itself differently in the two settings, the audience agreed that the women in each setting are oppressed by a system that has demanded their adherence to a certain lifestyle or a standard of beauty, in exchange for parental approval and societal acceptance. 
“We talked about how each of these women are shaped by the environment that they’ve grown up in and how they’re just trying to achieve what they can with the resources they have,” Gujral said.
The film raised a multitude of questions for the attendees, specifically around the negotiation of women’s identities within a patriarchal context. 
“No matter what women want, it’s in this male dominated society,” Bhogal said. “So what would women want in a non-male dominated society?”
“It’s essential to ask these questions and talk about them,” Ghajizai said. “We wanted to bring together people and have them talk about it.”

2018-10-01,McGill,India,"Maldivian Presidential Elections: Opposition Claims Victory
The Maldives held their presidential election on September 23. The incumbent President Abdulla Yameen represented the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM). Ibrahim Mohamed Solih represented the opposition, Maldives Democratic Party (MDP). Solih won the election with 58 per cent of the votes, which was 17 points more than Yameen. Mariyam Shiuna, executive director of Transparency Maldives, said that “prior to Sunday’s elections, many feared about potential fraud [in Yameen’s favour] due to limited freedom of mass media.” According to BBC News, international monitors have been banned from observing the election, and most of the foreign media’s access was restricted on election day, which raised questions about the elections’ integrity. For Solih, his election is “the first successful step on the road to justice.”
Yameen recently signed a free trade agreement with China, and accepted Chinese investments in current and future construction projects in the Maldives. Solih supports an alliance with India and strongly opposes business with China. Solih believes China is allying itself with the Maldives to access the essential trade routes of the Indian Ocean. According to analysts, the Maldives’ association with China was an important issue for voters, and for China itself. Yameen’s loss could mean the loss of trade access for China. The Maldives’ future, and its new foreign policies, will be determined once the national electoral commission approves Solih’s claim on winning the election.
More Detentions of Nicaraguan Activists
Amaya Eva Coppens, a Nicaraguan-Belgian activist and medical student, was detained in León, Nicaragua on September 10, 2018. The police
accused her of “terrorism,” “assaults,” and the “illegal possession of firearms.” Together with the imprisonment of dozens of other
activists, the arrest of Coppens is part of the latest wave of Nicaraguan authorities detaining activists, many of which are student members of the April protests. In April 2018, Nicaragua’s Ortega administration announced a social security reform that would increase workers’ tax contributions, and ultimately lead to a decrease in pensions. Nicaraguan pensioners, students, merchants, members of feminist and Campesino (farmer) movements, and other citizens protested the proposal until it was revoked 22 April 2018 by President Ortega. 
Discontent with the Nicaraguan authorities’ violent handling of the demonstrations has resulted in ongoing protests since April 2018. The protestors demand the resignation of President Ortega and of Vice-President, Rosario Murillo, who is also Ortega’s spouse. Concerns of police violence, infringements on free speech, violations of Indigenous peoples’ land rights and violence against women in the country are among the reasons people believe the government should resign.
According to the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (Asociación Nicaragüense Pro Derechos Humanos), the Nicaraguan authorities’ violent response to the protests has resulted in the deaths of over 500, the injury of over 4,000 and the detention of over 1,400 individuals since April 2018. The Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights (Centro Nicaragüense por los Derechos Humanos), as well as the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, criticize the detention of Coppens and other activists.
Coppens was held in incommunicado detention for nine days. This means that she was denied access to a lawyer, family members, or an independent physician. She has now been transferred to the women’s prison “La Esperanza” in Tipitapa. According to a statement from her father, despite a visit from her parents being monitored and filmed by prison staff, Amaya managed to communicate that she was beaten up while in detention. She also revealed that she has not been tortured due to her diplomatic position as a Belgian citizen. However, her fellow Nicaraguan prisoners may not be immune to this treatment. A Nicaragua Today article described the conditions in the prison as “inhumane” and reported that prisoners are denied medical attention despite some of them enduring critical illnesses such as terminal cancer.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford Testifies at Kavanaugh Hearings 
Supreme Court nominee Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 27, following allegations of sexual assault. Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, Justice Kavanaugh previously worked as a top aide to President George W. Bush, and in the US Court of Appeals. He is considered to be a likely opponent of Roe v. Wade. 
The allegations against Kavanaugh by a then-anonymous woman first arose in July, Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had requested to delay Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote to the Supreme Court. Ford came public with her allegations against Kavanaugh on Sept. 16. In the past week, three other women, Deborah Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, and one other anonymous woman
have come forward with allegations against Kavanaugh. 
In Ford’s testimony, she described her experiences with Kavanaugh in detail, stating that her “motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr Kavanaugh’s actions have damaged [her] life, so that [the committee] can take that into serious consideration as [they] make [their] decision about how to proceed.” Remaining composed during her testimony, she recalled the alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge. When asked her most vivid memory of the night, she responded with “all of them having fun at my expense.” Kavanaugh adressed the allegations in a heated testimony, describing the current allegations as a political smear campaign by the left. He spoke of his good character as attested to by the women in his life, his relationship to alcohol, and his high school experience as he remembers it.
War, Famine, and Disease Plague Yemen
Content warning: death, war, terrorism
In 2017, 50,000 children lost their lives due to war in Yemen. Now, as the UN reports, Yemen faces a famine, which is expected to put 5 million children at risk of starvation. For almost three years Yemen has endured civil war between Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed forces who support Yemen’s former government. The Houthi rebels have been fighting for terms surrounding political and economic demands. By the end of this year, the country may be facing “the world’s worst humanitarian disaster for 50 years,” says Mark Lowcock, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Seventy-five per cent of the population is in need of assistance, but fighting near the main port Hodeidah is blocking the distribution of vital supplies.
In September 2014, the Houthi rebel group overtook the capital Sana’a and tried to seize Yemen’s second largest city, Aden, in order to overthrow the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. In response to the Houthi’s actions, a coalition backed by neighbouring country Saudi Arabia, launched airstrikes in an attempt to restore Yemen’s official government. These missiles, as well as other weapons and intelligence, came from the USA and the UK. Without this support, it would be difficult for Saudi Arabia to continue the war. The US has also claimed to have deployed a small number of troops on the ground, and France and the UK are also supplying the Saudi-led coalition with weapons and intelligence. Although Canada has provided upwards of $65 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen, it has also sold more than $284 million in weapons to the countries that are bombing Yemen. As a result of the war, both Al-Qaeda and ISIL have spread within the country; Al-Qaeda has taken over territory in the south of Yemen, while ISIL has launched an attack killing more than 140 people. The bombing operations have killed tens of thousands of people and caused the displacement of over 3 million. Many members of the US Congress, as well as humanitarian organizations, have called for the US and others to be charged with war crimes for the crisis in Yemen. Yemen’s people and economy are suffering greatly because of the war; the price of food has doubled, and the nation’s currency, the Yemeni riyal, has collapsed.
The war has taken a great toll on an already impoverished society. Airstrikes are killing civilians in hospitals and schools; most of the casualties are children. In August of this year, a US-backed Saudi missile hit a bus carrying children killing at least 29 children and wounding 30 more. Now, citizens of Yemen face famine and an outbreak of cholera. “We may now be approaching a tipping point, beyond which it will be impossible to prevent massive loss of life as a result of widespread famine across the country,” said Lowcock to the UN’s Security Council. “We are already seeing pockets of famine-like conditions, including cases where people are eating leaves.” Last year, the UN declared that Yemen had seen “the world’s worst cholera outbreak,” with a million suspected cases in December 2017 and 5,000 new cases being reported each day — over 2,300 lives have been lost. Even though Yemen has since reduced and recovered somewhat from the disease, the World Health Organization has reported that the country is about to face a third wave of cholera.
The fighting near the port of Hodeidah is making it nearly impossible to get any sort of aid to citizens. Understaffed and under-equipped health centres are noticing a spike in the amount of malnourished patients they come across. In August, Aslam’s health centre saw up to 99 cases of malnutrition, half of which were in the most severe stages. The UN is trying to raise more money and resources for the people of Yemen, but Lowcock claims that “humanitarian organizations simply cannot look after the needs of all 29 million Yemenis. That is untenable.”

2018-11-19,McGill,India,"King on Sporting Culture and the “Change the Name” Campaign
C. Richard King, Professor and Chair of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago, gave a keynote lecture on “Origins, Interpretations and Impacts” of Indigenous imagery in North American sporting culture on November 8. 
McGill’s First Peoples’ House, along with SSMU’s Indigenous Affairs Commissioner, Tomas Jirousek, brought Professor King to Montreal to present his research on the racialization and appropriation of Indigenous imagery in sports. Considering the success of the “Change the Name” Campaign in the Fall 2018 SSMU Referendum, Professor King directly addressed McGill’s history of racialized team names, mascots, and other appropriated images in sports. 
Professor King has dedicated 25 years to understanding the racial politics of culture and Indigeneity in sports and media. King has written several books dedicated to this subject, including Team Spirits: The Native American Mascot Controversy (2001), Native Athletes in Sport and Society (2005), and, most recently, Redskins: Insult and Brand (2015). 
The co-opting of Indigeneity by the West has resulted in images which misrepresent Indigenous people and cause them harm. Feelings of invisibility and fraudulent identity are some of the more widely-recognized harms that these dehumanizing images, appropriated symbols, names, and mascots have on Indigenous peoples. 
“Misrecognition” refers to the inability of broader society to understand Indigenous people as part of a present reality. King pointed out how phrases such as “you don’t look like an Indian” and stereotyped images contribute to the erasure and denial of Indigenous voices.
 During the Q&A period, McGill student Ella Martindale asked Professor King how one should respond to people who claim that the name does not refer to Indigenous people at all, but rather to James McGill’s Scottish heritage. Several other students spoke to the arguments they had heard against the name change, claiming that “R*dmen” has nothing to do with Indigenous people, and is part of McGill’s history and traditions. In response, King discussed how this rhetoric echoes a white-settler ownership over appropriated images while denying the structural violence that this name represents and contributes to. 
King also expressed the downfalls of thinking about race and power simply in terms of bad intentions, bad attitudes, and bad ideas. He believes that if something is done without any of the aforementioned in mind, then it is not bad or racist. This definition of racism directs attention and blame to the wrong place: individual action, rather than a system of racial violence. By focusing on who is to blame for the perpetuation of violence, the broader context of McGill’s “R*dmen” name becomes lost. 
Jirousek asked King what “is to be done after the vote to tackle the lingering generative qualities of these images?” In response, Professor King emphasized how McGill can incorporate practices of reconciliation in its institution. King suggested providing the tools for students, athletes, and faculty to inform themselves of Indigenous peoples’ histories. In fact, King said that “if McGill sees dehumanization as a bad thing, then it has an obligation to its students and most importantly its Indigenous students to address this issue directly.”

Arts Representative to SSMU 
Many candidates in this category did not have a great deal of experience to prepare them for this role, or provided misinformed or conflicting answers during debate period. Shreya Dandamudi won with the most votes (624), followed by Andrew Chase with 599 votes, and Adin Chan with 553 votes. All three will represent AUS on SSMU Legislative Council next year. Ariana Kaye came in fourth with 514 votes, then Gabriel Ahmad with 461 votes, and Ruofan Wang with 240 votes. Hopefully both Chase and Chan will provide more information on the projects proposed during their campaigns. Chase had conflicting proposals for student clubs: cutting staff needed to manage clubs while also suggesting the number of clubs be increased. Also, Chan’s proposition for computer science students to update the Minerva website for free must be addressed. 
Arts Senator 
The election for Arts Senator was very close. In first place was Henrique Mecabô with 557 votes, then Chloe Kemeni with 553 votes. The two of them will represent Arts students at the McGill Senate. Iyanu Soyege came in third place, just 12 votes behind Mecabô and eight behind Kemeni, followed by Lauren Jelinek with 317 votes, and Chlöe Shahinian with 175 votes. Kemeni brings a great deal of experience to the position, previously serving as AUS VP Academic, AUS Equity Commissioner, and SSMU Anti Violence Coordinator. Further, Kemeni has acted as voice for transparency and accountability during the AUS Executive’s undemocratic POLI 339 debacle. Kemeni also provided a comprehensive platform regarding plans to improve equity on campus and library renovations. During the debate, she noted which specific committees she aims to sit on to further advocate for students as a Senator. On the other hand, the election of Henrique Mecabô is concerning. During the debate, he admitted “[he does not] have […] specific work experience in student representation or government […] [he has not] done [any] work on the equity front specifically.” The only subject his platform discussed was the upcoming assessment policy review at Senate next year. The policy, while extremely important, will not be the only thing the Senate discusses next year, and Mecabô has not demonstrated any knowledge of equity issues and student advocacy, which are essential to this position as an official student advocate. It is concerning to see someone elected with an admitted a lack of experience and a lacking platform. 
Uncontested Positions: 
President 
Jamal Tarrabain won the election with 86.4 per cent of the vote. He currently serves on the AUS executive as VP Communications. His platform discussed the upcoming renegotiation of AUS’ Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with McGill University, stating he would focus on improving the AUS Lounge, Bar des Arts (BdA), and advocating for other student issues. Tarrabain committed to finding the issues students care about the most through online surveys. During the debate, he mentioned how he has gone through equity training as a Floor Fellow and stated that the burden of labour should not be on marginalized groups to educate others. His actions during the AUS POLI 339 scandal have not been completely equitable. During a Legislative Council meeting on February 14, he remained largely silent, letting others, especially women of colour, respond and take responsibility for the issues raised. While Tarrabain has since apologized for being silent, he justified his silence as an effort to “not take up space.” Giving space to marginalized voices does not mean making them do more work than you. As per the official release of the AUS Executive’s meeting minutes, Tarrabain voted to abstain during the undemocratic executive vote, choosing to not uphold the democratic decision of the council. 
VP Communications 
Yoana Pehlyova won the election with 85.2 per cent of the vote. Her platform focused on reanimating AUS’ Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook through frequent postings and networking opportunities. Previously, Pehlyova has worked with the McGill24 Ad Campaign and as VP External of Inter-Residence Council (IRC). While Pehlyova has adequate experience for the role, she did not express any clear ideas about making AUS communications more accessible. She stated that although she did not know much about accessible ways of communicating, she is willing to look into it. 
VP External 
Darshan Daryanani won the election with 87.7 per cent of the vote. He has experience working as the VP External of the Indian Students Association and VP Publications of the IDSSA. Daryanani’s platform focused on improving student opportunities, like Work Your BA. He also expressed a desire to have more Grad Fairs, Law Fairs, and Medicine Fairs, and to make them more engaging, inclusive, and accessible. He also wants to improve student engagement with these efforts as he believes the main issue with these events is getting students to attend. 
VP Finance 
Stefan Suvajac won the election with 91.7 per cent of the vote. His platform focused on improving consultations usage of the Arts Undergraduate Improvement Fund (AUIF). He suggests meeting with the leaders of departmental associations to get their input on its use and developing ways to encourage more applications. Suvajac also wants to make the AUIF fee non opt outable, because everyone benefits from it, but it is not required to pay into it. When asked a question about the equity implications of making the fund non opt outable, Suvajac stated “by people paying in we can help increase opportunities which could perhaps balance out the fact that someone might have a difficult time paying the $17 or so fee […] I think it’s a relatively small amount compared to what the collective benefits could be with respect to equity and student experience if it’s increased and used effectively.” However, Suvajac does not explain in his platform how this fund, that “supports improvements to the physical and capital resources that Arts students use,” would specifically improve equity on campus. 
VP Internal 
Maheen Akter won the election with 91.4 per cent of the vote. Previously, she has served as the AUS Equity Commissioner, sat on AUS Legislative Council, been a Residence Life Facilitator, and worked as VP Academic of FEARC, which she will now oversee as VP Internal of AUS. Her platform focused on greater support to academic associations, improving both room booking processes and equity in AUS hiring practices. 
VP Social 
Kim Yang, the current VP Social of AUS, won her re-election with 90.6 per cent of the vote. Yang hopes to improve the hiring system for Frosh leaders based on her experience this year. She also plans to do more events with the Event Planning and Implementation Committee (EPIC), such as a cafe crawl and frosh throwback. Additionally, she aims to aid the VP Internal in acquiring liquor permits, with Frosh and BdA. 
Looking towards the next academic year, we will continue to cover the actions of the AUS Executive, Representatives, and Senators to ensure the transparency and accountability of Arts student governance.

2019-09-24,McGill,India,"Librarian Creates Classroom Guides
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which officially began in 2008 as a result of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, aimed to document the erased history of the residential school system and in doing so, act as a step towards meaningful, lasting reconciliation.
Before the final TRC report was published, the commission released a document with 94 “calls to action.” Actions 62 through 65 call upon federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as the Council of Ministers of Education, to create a mandatory curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Indigenous peoples in Canadian history for students in K-12.
According to the government of Canada, their response to Action 62 on the TRC Calls to Action is to transform education on reserves, contribute financial resources to the First Nations University of Canada, and allocate $275 million within 2016’s budget for language and culture until 2020.
Aside from the dedication of funding, federal response to Action 62 centers itself upon structuring the education of Indigenous peoples. Indigenous-specific educational institutions are disadvantaged when compared to non-Indigenous educational systems, in terms of funding and follow-through on behalf of policy-makers. The government must take care when intervening in the systems of knowledge they once worked to systematically destroy, especially in the context of the settler-colonial project that continues to erase Indigenous ways of knowing and living.
As for Action 63, the responsibility for responding to this Action falls on the Council of Ministers of Education. In Ontario, Indigenous educators and elders were invited to partake in the curriculum revision project. These curriculum writing sessions, scheduled for July 2018, aimed to infuse Indigenous perspectives into the course content of each subject. The writing sessions were cancelled just three days before they were set to begin. It is unclear who is responsible for the cancellation, though it is likely that the Ministry of Education cancelled the sessions in response to budget cuts by the Doug Ford administration.
Frustrated with this cancellation and the government’s failure to act, citizens are taking matters into their own hands. One endeavor, led by the University of Toronto’s Outreach Librarian Desmond Wong, initially aimed to create a list of free resources in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Comission’s Calls to Action and the Ontario government’s cancellation of the curriculum rewriting sessions.
This list of resources eventually evolved into a research guide, entitled “Infusing Indigenous Perspectives in K-12 Teaching.” The material includes audio and visual material as well as games, lesson plans, Indigenous language materials, and other forms of course support for teachers and educators. The research guide that houses these materials was started in 2013 by current Acting Director of the University of Toronto’s library, Jenaya Webb, and a student, Rebekah Bedard, in collaboration with the Deepening Knowledge Project and Dr. Jean-Paul Restoule. The guide is made available to all online through the University of Toronto’s teaching and education research program.
Though not the first of its kind – the University of Alberta also offers a comprehensive education guide – it is set apart by being a living, breathing entity, inclusive of a wide range of media forms; Wong is continually looking for new resources to improve and add depth to the guide. Most recently, a section on Indigenous-created Virtual and Augmented Reality has just been added. In conversation with the Daily, Wong expressed that he hopes the next step will be to more fully incorporate resources on Indigenous languages, which he says are “essential to Indigenous knowledges and worldviews, into pedagogy and every day interactions in classrooms.”
However, in regards to Quebec’s Ministry of Education and school board system, progress towards fulfilling the TRC Calls to Action is similarly slow-moving. A March 2017 report from the Advisory Board on English Education entitled “Indigenous Education: Walking on Both Sides of the River” includes a section on involvement of [Indigenous] community members in developing the education system. This report uses the rhetoric of “preserving community traditions and heritage […] as elders die” contributing to the image of the disappearing Indigneous population. Much of this report is centered upon improving the education process for Indigenous students, yet fails to commit to concrete changes for the implementation of Indigenous knowledges and historical processes within the education of non-Indigenous students. Section 8 condemns the present instruction of Indigenous content for non-Indigenous students in Quebec; though it mentions the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report, it merely describes what school boards in other provinces have done rather than putting forward any concrete changes to address this gap in curriculums.
As of October 2018, Quebec’s school system further revised its curriculum to include mention of residential schools, though it did so without consulting with Indigenous peoples. Further, the revised curriculum fails to address Indigenous treaties and contributions of Indigenous peoples.
While citizen-led initiatives such as Wong’s guide serve as an excellent resource, he recognizes “this resource is fairly limited compared to the breadth of materials that are available.’’ As he describes, “there is an entire world of fantastic Indigenous resources.”

2019-11-25,McGill,India,"Tayka Raymond Calls on Participants to “Decolonize Your Mind”
Content warning: environmental racism
Continue or go back to the main page
A small group of around 15 people came to the living room of ECOLE, an urban sustainable living project for McGill students, on November 16 to learn about Indigenous political, cultural, and social realities and grassroots movements, as well as how to better work with and uplift Indigenous voices in the climate justice movement. The workshop, entitled Indigenous Realities and Solidarity, was hosted by Climate Justice Action McGill (C-JAM).
The speaker at the event was Tayka Raymond, a grassroots advocate and protector of the environment who has been directly involved in climate activism for the past 30 years. Her record of environmental activism is extensive and includes working at the Indigenous Environmental Network, which was established in 1990 and “formed by grassroots Indigenous peoples and individuals to address environmental and economic justice issues.” More recently, she joined protestors at Standing Rock during demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline.
The [two-row wampum belt] was created around 500 years ago, and it has two separate and parallel rows. They represent the “European boat” and the “Native canoe” […] They walk side by side, together.
The program began with an introduction of each person’s heritage, followed by a smudging of white sage. As Raymond completed the smudging ceremony, she explained how the ritual has been appropriated by non-Indigenous people and is leading to the endangerment of sage and abalone shells. She clarified that commercialization by colonizers is the cause of the depletion of these sacred resources.
Raymond started the talk by explaining her goal: to “decolonize your mind.” Recently, she stated that climate justice has gained traction worldwide, but it has been co-opted by white voices. Although Indigenous people have been vocal environmental advocates and protectors for centuries, they have been given very little space to be leaders in the increasingly popular environmental movement.
While sharing her experiences from the Montreal Climate March, Raymond said there was obvious disrespect to the Indigenous groups present, including being pushed out of the front, having their traditional regalia – for example, Raymond’s brother’s eagle stick and her daughter’s jingle dress – touched and played with, and experiencing harassment while chanting “take back the land,” being told by non- Indigenous protesters “it’s not just your land” and that the march is “not about you.”
Raymond wants Indigenous peoples and colonizers to learn to work together, and drew attention to the two-row wampum belt. The beaded belt was created around 500 years ago, and it has two separate and parallel rows. They represent the “European boat” and the “Native canoe.” They never intersect, interfere, or take up each other’s space. They walk side by side, together.
“How can we work together?” asked Raymond. She emphasized the importance of learning about each other without judging based on personal experience. “Ask, learn how. Stop seeing people as you are.”
Another way to decolonize your viewpoint, she continued, is to understand the irrelevance of colonial borders, and the entire concept of controlling separate land. This has been a common misinterpretation of the Land Back initiative.
“Possession, such as ‘my land’, does not exist in Indigenous languages. The only translations are [similar to] ‘the land upon which you stand.’ The earth is ‘the land that creator put us on to protect,’” said Raymond. She explained that borders disregard ancestral land, and do not acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who lived there before their land was carved up into separate lands to be bought by colonizers. By disregarding these borders that only function to keep people separated, Raymond explained, they lose their power. Climate change does not see borders – uniting forces around the world is what is necessary to stop the climate crisis.
Raymond moved on to teach about the differences between two Indigenous governing systems: the tribal council system and the ancestral grassroots system. Tribal councils were created by the government with the Indian Act to control and assimilate self-governing Indigenous communities. There is often corruption within them, Raymond stated, especially when it comes to funding being lost on its way from the government to the people. It also disregards the ancestral process of consensus-based decision making in exchange for a more structured majority vote, which marginalizes many in the community who feel unheard by voting.
“Possession, such as ‘my land,’ does not exist in Indigenous languages. The only translations are [similar to] ‘the land upon which you stand.’”
– Tayka Raymond
In a Guardian article about tribal reform, a tribal councilman at the Blackfeet Indian reservation, Joe McKay, said “There’s a single word that describes why we are sitting in this room today: power. The use and abuse of power. The council has absolute power. So if you muster the majority of the council, you control everything […] It doesn’t matter how unethical, illegal, unjust it might be. As long as you have the votes and the power, you control everything. In that setting, societies don’t flourish. They go backwards.”
In contrast, Raymond explains that the traditional decision making process includes all voices, requiring a unanimous decision: “We don’t make decisions fragmented […] as a whole nation, [we] must meet a consensus and act together.”
Learning about the corruption and colonial systems on reserves creates better Indigenous allies: a representative from Climate Justice Montreal shared that the organization has a policy to only work with traditional grassroots Indigenous leaders and organizations.
Raymond finished the seminar with a crash course in basic sacred teachings and practices to better engage with and respect Indigenous
peoples when working with them. She began by explaining when it is appropriate to give tobacco as a gift – it should always be given to elders, but not to others unless it is an offering to ask a question or for advice. Next, she explained the significance of the medicine wheel – for each direction, there is a particular value, traditional medicinal plant, animal, and stage of life. She also explained the uses for each of the four sacred medicines – tobacco, the first gift from the Creator, used to communicate with the spirit world; sweetgrass for purification and attracting positive energy; sage for cleansing and removing negative energy; and cedar as purifying and healing, hence its use as a tea and in baths.
The importance of removing preconceived notions from Indigenous and colonizer relations is vital to developing long-lasting partnerships, Raymond told the participants. Listen to the lived experiences of Indigenous peoples who are close to the land and their thoughts on what is needed in climate justice, she added. Raymond also mentioned a project by the Yellowhead Institute, “a First Nation-led research centre based in the Faculty of Arts at Ryerson University in Toronto.” The institute published a report titled “Land Back” in October 2019, detailing how land reclamation is central in fighting the climate crisis.
“The council has absolute power. […] It doesn’t matter how unethical, illegal, unjust it might be. As long as you have the votes and the power, you control everything.”
– Joe McKay
To conclude, Raymond told the participants: support Indigenous climate activists, volunteer with climate organizations that work with and make space for grassroots Indigenous activists, and prioritize Indigenous education and traditional knowledge within environmentalism.

2020-10-31,McGill,India,"Warehouse workers decry “deplorable” conditions
In June of this year, the Immigrant Workers’ Center (IWC-CTI) held one of its many press conferences. Community organizers and workers outlined their grievances about working conditions in Dollarama’s warehouses, which have only gotten worse since the outset of the pandemic. The IWC is, by their own definition, a “labour education and campaign centre” which has recently been focusing on the labour conditions of warehouse workers in Montreal.
According to Mostafa Henaway, an IWC organizer, “many people view Dollarama as a sort of ‘mom-and-pop’ operation, that it’s simply a dollar store.” Yet he pointed out that “it is actually one of the largest corporations in Quebec and Canada, [which] employs at least 20,000 workers and operates over 1200 stores from coast to coast”, and has also begun to expand into Central America. He added that its owners, the Rossy family, are worth $2.5 billion, making them one of the richest families in Quebec and in Canada.

“Unfortunately,” he added, “Dollarama is able to maintain low prices across the board because of the conditions workers face in its distribution centers and in its stores, only to ensure that Dollarama continues to reap in large profits.” Henaway insists that in the Canadian context, “Dollarama needs to be a focus for us, in the same way that Amazon is a focus for the labour movement around the world. We’re making the argument that Dollarama is our Amazon.” 
Joey Calugay, another member of the IWC, also spoke at the press conference. Calugay explained that many of the workers in Montreal’s warehouses are newly arrived immigrants or asylum seekers, older immigrants who are supplementing their income, or undocumented workers who’ve lost their status and are trying to re-establish their legal right to stay in Montreal. According to the Montreal Gazette, immigrants made up to eighty per cent of warehouse workers in the Montreal metropolitan area in 2019.
Mohammed Barry is a Guinean refugee who has been active in the campaign to prevent Canada’s deportation of exiled Guineans to a dangerous fate in their home country, in addition to his labour organizing. In the same press conference, he stated that he worked at Dollarama for two weeks, in “deplorable” conditions. “There is no respect [for the workers]” he said, “and the contamination of the air [with Covid-19 in the warehouses] is enough to traumatize employees.” In his time at Dollarama, he claims he experienced large numbers of workers that were packed together in such close proximity that it was impossible to maintain any kind of social distancing.
In addition to a lack of Covid-19 measures, Barry added that there was no adequate training provided to new employees in order for them to carry out their work safely. Instead, he said, workers are given rapid, minimal training, and are made to work as fast as possible. When Barry was injured at work, he recounts that his manager simply instructed him to wipe the wound and get back to work. Only when Barry threatened to call the police did the management treat his wound and allow him to go to the hospital himself. As for calling an ambulance, he noted that the unspoken rule was that “anyone who tries to call one to the warehouse would be fired.” 
Another former Dollarama employee, Gaurav Sharma, is an artist from Chandigarh, India, who came to Montreal in 2019 and is awaiting a decision on his refugee status claim. Hired by Di-Geo International, a temporary employment agency, he was assigned to Dollarama for almost a year as a palette builder. The long hours – at least 8 hours a day, including a half hour lunch break and a 15 minute bathroom break – and the quick pace of the physically strenuous work eventually resulted in severe back pain for Sharma. When the first instances of searing pain hit him, Sharma recalled, the warehouse had “no medical staff, no first aid kit and no painkillers available”, so he had to find a doctor himself, and was prescribed 2 weeks of bed-rest. When he asked to be reassigned to a less physically strenuous task due to his injury, Shamra said, the employment agency insisted that “no transfer was possible,” leading Sharma to quit in order to avoid aggravating his injury.
In 2019, the IWC published a report based on group interviews and surveys with 50 workers in Montreal warehouses and distribution centres, including Dollarama facilities. The report decried “a business model within the logistics sector that is based on the hyper-exploitation of a work force largely composed of migrants.” It found that nearly a quarter of warehouse workers throughout Montreal have suffered injuries at work. The majority of these workers are given zero sick days, and nearly 40 per cent received no health and safety training at work, according to the same report. It also states that “almost 60 per cent of workers said they were paid less than a permanent worker doing the same job. 10 per cent were paid under minimum wage, 16.5 per cent worked more than full time, and almost half said they did not have proper safety equipment or sufficient training.”

Former warehouse workers like Barry argue that temporary placement agencies aggravate many of the issues within this system – they act as the official employers of many warehouse workers, thus allowing Dollarama to avoid providing them with proper benefits or protection. According to Jon Milton writing for Ricochet, “such an arrangement makes for extremely high turnover, and makes organizing into unions nearly impossible from a legal standpoint.” Henaway emphasizes that “90 per cent of people [that] work through agencies, it’s their first job in Quebec, they’re refugee claimants or failed refugee claimants that could be deported, all of that stress makes it difficult to organize.” 
According to labour organizers like Henaway, this lack of labour protections has not only devastated Dollarama workers’ health and safety, but also their freedom to protest for better conditions. In the beginning of the summer, Henaway said that “workers were fired for speaking up against the conditions in the Dollarama warehouse,” or even for signalling that there were Covid-19 outbreaks inside the warehouse.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IWC and its allies have been holding press conferences and demonstrations, as well as flyering, to demand adequate health protections for warehouse workers, and the maintenance of bonuses for all workers who are considered “essential service providers” in the context of Covid-19 shutdowns. In May, 135 local Montreal artists signed an open letter in support of the IWC’s campaign. According to Stefan Christoff, an artist and activist speaking to the Daily, “DJs have made mixes to draw attention to the struggle, while some visual artists have created prints, that are now up in the city to draw attention to the issue.” Christoff and other activists have also supported the effort by attending the IWC’s weekly outreach sessions near Dollarama warehouses, in order to “distribute masks, water, juice and share flyers that detail labour rights” to warehouse workers on their way to work.
Through a combination of physical rallies, press conferences and media coverage, workers and labor organizers have so far succeeded in their efforts to pressure Dollarama into maintaining hazard pay for all its employees. In March, store workers were given 10 per cent wage increases, and warehouse workers had seen their wages increased by up to $3 per hour. With the second wave of COVID-19 looming in the fall, the company had announced it was cutting the bonus pay at the end of August. Workers swiftly reacted by organizing a rally on August 20 near Dollarama’s main warehouse, which included speakers from trade unions, community groups and elected politicians as well as Dollarama workers. A week later, the Immigrant Workers Center announced: “Multi-million dollar giant Dollarama has stepped back from its previous position to restore bonuses for workers providing essential services in its distribution centers and stores.” In their statement, they congratulated the efforts of Dollarama employees, praising the fact that they “were able to push back the company’s plan to end risk premiums”.
Although the now reinstated bonuses of $1.50 are lower than the $3 bonuses warehouse workers previously received in March, the IWC’s Facebook statement claimed that this modest increase “brings their hourly wages closer to the $15-per-hour minimum wage that workers in Quebec are fighting for.” What’s more, these bonuses are scheduled to remain effective until November.
This Saturday, October 31, the IWC, Howl Arts and the Association des travailleurs/euses temporaires d’agences de placement (ATTAP) will be hosting a protest in solidarity with the continued struggle of Montreal’s temporary workers. In addition to demanding the continuation of hazard pay after November 1 and permanent employment for Dollarama workers, the rally’s organizers say it will address “the limited regularization program” put forward by the federal and Quebec governments regarding immigrant workers, which “excludes the vast majority of people who continue to do essential work, and also deserve status.”
The protest, Manif de solidarité avec les travailleur.euse.s de l’entrepôt Dollarama, will be held this Saturday October 31, from 1:00p.m. to 3:00p.m. 
Location: Next to Dollarama store, 7017 St Hubert street-South of Jean-Talon (Jean-Talon metro)

2021-07-10,McGill,India,"“The federal government is complicit in ongoing genocide” 
CW: racism, child abuse, sexual assault
In the past weeks, preliminary searches at residential schools across Turtle Island have uncovered countless unmarked graves, revealing the thousands of Indigenous children across the country who were killed by the forced assimilation of the residential school system. Kamloops Indian Residential school was one of the most publicised discoveries, with the bodies of 215 Indigenous children being found on the grounds in late May. Today, its structure still stands on Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation ground. For years, survivors of Kamloops Residential School have spoken out about the abuse they faced there, including the group of day scholar students who recounted their traumatic experiences and continued pain in a class action lawsuit against the Canadian government, as well as survivors of the school who have since shared stories of burying their peers on the school grounds. While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referred to this abuse of Indigenous people in Canada as “a dark and shameful chapter of our country’s history,” Indigenous youth and adults continue to suffer across Turtle Island, including a recent emergency within Montreal at government-run Batshaw Youth and Family Centre, where reports emerged of an Indigenous child confined in a windowless basement. Nunavut MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq notes the similarities between the residential school system and the contemporary realities for Indigenous youth in social care systems: “Children are still being separated from their communities. Foster care is the new residential school system.” The Daily spoke with Indigenous student Jo Roy regarding the ongoing mistreatment of Indigenous children in social care systems, and how the effects of Kamloops and other residential schools are still ongoing. 
Kamloops Residential School was established in 1890 as part of a policy of cultural assimilation and ethnic cleansing by the Catholic Church and the Canadian government. Located on traditional territory of the Secwepeme, Kamloops Residential School was another site of abuse in a long list of institutions across Turtle Island responsible for the murder of Indigenous children. Survivors of Kamloops Residential School have since spoken out about their time at the institution. At a 2013 Truth and Reconciliation hearing, survivor Jeanette Jules shared her experiences with sexual assault at the school. In 1997, survivor Simon Moses described life at the school: “All the hugging I used to get stopped at the residential school. To this day I have a problem saying ‘I love you mom.’” At another Truth and Reconciliation hearing, survivor Sarah McLeod shared the story of a nun forcing her to throw out a carved totem pole she had received as a birthday present. Meals were eaten in silence, students were whipped for wetting the bed, and a number was written on every student’s arm, which is what they were referred to for the duration of their time at the school. 
With 500 students attending at a time during peak enrolment, thousands of children at Kamloops Residential School were subject to the brutality of the nuns and priests in charge of their care. While the only official government records show 51 children dying at the school between 1914 and 1963, the discovery of 215 children buried in unmarked graves at Kamloops school is evidence of the mass murder of Indigenous people in residential schools across the country. 
The Indigenous communities of Kamloops and more have not received justice or reparations, and as a result, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced criticism. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP, told the House of Commons: “We all mourn the loss of those children, but to honour their lives, we need to move beyond words to action,” in reference to Trudeau’s ongoing failure  to pay reparations to Indigenous communities. Roy characterized Trudeau’s statements as “a pure form of gaslighting.” They continued, “This man is fighting Indigenous children in court, he isn’t fulfilling the promises to First Nation children.” 
Roy refers to ongoing legal battles between Trudeau’s cabinet and First Nations families, which Singh motioned to cease on June 7th. Calling the matter a “belligerent and litigious approach to justice,” the motion was supported unanimously by those present – however, Trudeau failed to attend, thereby abstaining from voting. “Trudeau didn’t even have the courage to vote,” Singh said “He walked away from Indigenous people…The cabinet didn’t have the courage to stand up for Indigenous people…They can’t even defend their own actions.” 
The failings of the government extend further, with Roy sharing news of an Indigenous youth at Batshaw group home who was forced into isolation in a windowless basement. The youth was mistakenly instructed to attend school, and arrived back at Batshaw group home several hours later, after finding the school closed for the day. The staff at Batshaw stated that this meant the youth was a COVID-19 risk, and subsequently placed them in isolation in a windowless concrete basement for 14 days, in spite of an assessment from the Directeur de la santé publique (DRSP) which confirmed that “the Indigenous youth in question presented little to no risk […] the measures taken by Batshaw were drastic.” As of June 3, it is believed that the child is no longer confined at Batshaw. 
“The child protection system is not protecting children,” stated Roy, a student in the School of Social Work. “You don’t need to literally imprison a child for two weeks in a windowless room. You don’t need to do that…When the workers at Batshaw were confronted with what was happening, they didn’t at all see any problem. This is a continuous problem, where Batshaw and the general Western child welfare system just abuses not just children in care, first of all, but Indigenous children in care.” There are many examples of abuse within the foster care system – the deaths of 102 Indigenous children connected to the child welfare system were reported in Northern Ontario between 2013 and 2017 and the death of 17 year old Cree youth Traevon Chalifoux-Desjarlais in 2020, who wasn’t found until four days after his death in a group home in Abbotsford. Roy argues that these continued cases show that “the federal government is complicit in ongoing genocide.”
Six years ago, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission created 94 calls to action. According to First Nations led research centre, the Yellowhead Institute, only eight have been completed. In an interview with CTV News, lawyer and author Michelle Good noted that many of these calls to action included searches for missing children and burial sites: “That was 2015 for goodness sake, and to me it is deeply resonant and reminiscent of the resistance of the federal government to resolving residential school claims in the first place.” Despite lowering the Canadian flag for last Thursday’s Canada Day, Trudeau’s fights against First Nations families in courts, and the continued mistreatment of Indigenous peoples in social care systems are evidence that the government has not and will not protect Indigenous communities across Turtle Island.

2021-09-27,McGill,India,"Indigenous performers and speakers reflect on colonialism, sustainability
McGill celebrated its 10th annual Indigenous Awareness Weeks (IAWs) online from September 13 to 24. This year featured programming run by Indigenous knowledge keepers from across Turtle Island spanning a multitude of topics, including traditional medicines, wellness, environmental sustainability, reconciliation within post-secondary institutions, and the realities of Indigenous students in colonial institutions. Many of the events focused on food sustainability and sovereignty, as well as connections to the land and what it provides.
The opening ceremonies began on September 13 with the Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen (The Words Before All Else) by Kanien’kehá:ka elder Otsi’tsaken:ra Patton.In a later event, the meaning of the Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen was explored further, as well as other cultural practices and teachings, by Otsi’tsaken:ra and Niioie:ren Patton. “Humans, we need to take the fur of the deer to make clothing so we won’t get cold. We need to eat the meat of those animals so we can survive. And on and on and on it goes, those are the things that they give us,” said Otsi’tsaken:ra Patton. “So when we talk of the opening, we give thanks to life, and all the things that give us life. We came from the earth, and the earth is our mother.”
The ceremony closed with artistic performances from two Indigenous artists. Beatrice Deer, an award-winning Inuk singer, performed her song “Takugiursugit (The First Time I Saw You).” Craig Commanda, an Anishnaabe multi-disciplinary artist – he works in beadwork, poetry, music and sound, and filmmaking – from Kitigan Zibi First Nation, performed a musical composition, “For the Children,” “in dedication to the spirits of the children lost to residential schools.”
Kanien’kehá:ka Knowledge Keeper Elaine Delaronde and Kanien’kehá:ka student Brooke Rice hosted a medicinal plant walk on MacDonald campus. Delaronde and Rice provided recipes, medicinal uses, and personal anecdotes for each plant they found. Delaronde emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and the interconnected relationship between people and the environment: “We treat the earth like our mother. It grows everything. We have everything we need.”
Another medicinal plant walk was hosted by Abénaki lands manager Michel Durand Nolett on September 20. It took place in the McGill-owned Gault Nature Reserve, similarly teaching uses for native plants along with historical context about their use. Both these walks took place on land owned by McGill University – it is important to note that the Gault Nature Reserve was not open to cultural use by the Abénaki people until January 2021. This action was taken to recognize McGill’s 52 Calls to Action, created in 2017 in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada; so far, only seven have been completed, according to the university’s call to action webpage.
On the subject of sustainability and the environment, Kanien’kehá:ka Faith Keeper Ka’nahsohon Deer gave a talk about Indigenous worldviews and the Seventh Generation Principle – a land stewardship concept that focuses on living life and preserving the environment for the benefit and protection of the next seven generations. Deer noted how colonialism and Christian spirituality negatively impacted human connections with the land, and how returning to Indigenous traditional knowledge is imperative to protecting the environment.
On September 14, a roundtable discussed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The panelists consisted of five Indigenous researchers and representatives from what are currently known as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US on how UNDRIP has been considered, implemented, and ignored in their respective communities.
Another roundtable for Indigenous students was the Student Health and Wellness Kitchen Table Conversation held on September 16. Current and former Indigenous students at McGill shared the highs and lows of their experiences at the institution. Some shared that they struggled to adjust to university life, others that they felt isolated, especially as one of very few Indigenous students on campus. However, the panelists shared their positive experiences in rediscovering and embracing traditional knowledge, and reconsidering their perspectives and ideas on education.
For Wahéhshon Shiann Whitebean, a Kanien’kehá:ka PhD candidate in Educational Studies and a Vanier Scholar, researching the impacts of Indian Day Schools for her thesis required healing. “It was the first time I was working on every level – mentally, emotionally and spiritually – at the same time. I learned to value my family and community, in what we’ve been through and who we are, in a much different way.”
This year’s IAWs closed with a virtual powwow, celebrating the 20th anniversary of McGill’s “First Pow Wow.” Although unable to come together in person, dancers were invited to share videos of performances.
Kanien’kehá:ka activist and artist Ellen Gabriel reflected on the organization of McGill’s first powwow, as well as her experience working at First Peoples House, 20 years later.“When I worked at First Peoples House, I did my best to try and support the students who were attending McGill, and make them feel at home,” she said, adding that she wanted to create “a safe place [for students] to be who they were, and not as an object of curiosity which I think sometimes we [feel like] because we’ve been so researched to death.”
She also shared her thoughts on reconciliation in post-secondary institutions: “The way Indigenous people want to see change in these institutions, it has to come with education and dialogue and discussion and sometimes that change is not welcomed.”
Recordings of most of the events can be accessed on the IAW’s website (the National Building Reconciliation Forum Workshops were not recorded).

2022-03-21,McGill,India,"Divest McGill occupies Arts Building
On March 7, Divest McGill announced its occupation of the McCall MacBain Arts Building, commonly known as the Arts Building by students. The occupation was organized to express solidarity with Wet’suwet’en land defenders, advocate for democratization of the university, and pressure the university to divest from the fossil fuel industry and corporations complicit in human rights violations. In particular, the press release regarding the occupation demands divestment from TC Energy, noting that McGill has a $3,467,323 investment in the corporation; the booklet linked on the Divest McGill website also names Lockheed-Martin, Re/Max, the Oshkosh corporation, Puma, Foot Locker, Nordstrom, and Kohl’s as part of McGill’s imperialist investments.
Occupiers set up in the lobby of the Arts Building, crowded with tents, pamphlets, and posters. “Don’t mourn, organize,” a banner reminds passers-by; another one reads “Community Control, Not Oil, Not Coal.” Throughout the first week of the occupation, Divest McGill held a number of events centred around democratization and divestment. On March 14, the group announced their intention to continue the occupation for another week. As of March 18, the Arts Building is still occupied by Divest activists; the occupation expanded to the Y-intersection on March 17, where Divest organizers platformed Floor Fellows in their announcement of their strike.
The events which Divest hosted included a number of community discussions and educational initiatives. One such event was the March 9 discussion on anarchism – attendees spoke about what anarchism meant to them, then briefly went over early anarchist history. Additionally, attendees discussed how to get involved with mutual aid initiatives and direct action.
Democratize McGill mobilization and community building session
The Wednesday evening session began where the afternoon session concluded: by continuing to flesh out the group’s frustrations over McGill’s colonial past. Leading with an anecdote over how Canada is “not a country” (for it has “no culture,” “no language” – it is all stolen Indigenous land), the occupiers transitioned into discussing three instances where the university had historically wronged various Indigenous groups. 
First, the Divest occupiers discussed James McGill’s enslavement of two Indigenous people. McGill, who famously donated the land upon which the university that bears his name stands upon, continues to have a statue on the campus grounds – much to the occupiers’ frustration. Though a petition to remove McGill’s statue has amassed over 5,000 signatures and McGill University has said they’ll make an official decision by the end of the bicentennial year, there remains ambiguity over what such a timeline would look like. 
Second, the group spoke on McGill University’s historic misuse of Native Indigenous funds. Pointing to the university’s early financial difficulties “where instructors could not be compensated and resources… were scarce,” the group explained how the institution was forced to turn to the Canadian government in the 1860s to save itself from bankruptcy; receiving a lifeline, the Province of Canada withdrew $40,000 from the General Indian Trust Fund, loaning the money to McGill. Crucially, the deal was only secured following a $8,000 down payment from the university – a sum that was acquired via a fund allocated to the Six Nations of the Grand River. While McGill alleges to have settled their debt with the Quebec government in 1873, the original $8,000 used to secure the loan was never returned to the Indigenous groups from which it was taken. The occupiers went on to explain how the unpaid $8,000 loan – when accounting for interest – would be worth an estimated $1.7 billion today.   
The Divest occupiers concluded the first half of the session by discussing the controversy surrounding McGill’s New Vic project. The $700 million construction project, which plans to transform the old Royal Victoria Hospital site into new classrooms, sparked controversy when the Kahnistensera Mohawk Mothers sued McGill over the plans. The Kahnistensera Mohawk Mothers, who take issue with the building site, seek to stop the renovation plans until “a thorough investigation of the grounds is carried out for searching unmarked graves of individuals unlawfully experimented upon.” The injunction is, as of writing, still ongoing.
Switching to a more informal second half of the event, the conversation transitioned to discussing how the Divest occupiers could work to further democratize the university. Dividing into break out groups, the occupiers went on to discuss topics ranging from endowment justice, to democratizing classrooms, to the democratization of university resources. 
Perhaps the most constructive break out group discussion was that on how to further democratize the university classroom. The popcorn style discussion brought forth a variety of suggestions on how to improve McGill’s current academic policies. Beginning with grading, the group was in consensus that the exam-centric style of grading currently embraced by the western world needed an overhaul. The occupiers’ message was clear: exams did not often reflect the learning taking place by students in the classroom. In its place, the group’s solutions ranged from having a student’s best few grades from the semester being taken, to a system where grades were awarded in correlation to a student’s effort level. 
Finally, another popular topic of conversation was that on endowment justice. Beginning with discussions over McGill’s increasingly unaffordable international tuition fees (which reached $56,544 this academic year), the group shared concerns over how their tuition was being spent. The occupiers agreed that they wanted more student consultation in matters concerning university spending. One such instance discussed by the occupiers was McGill’s spending in the filming of the “Made by McGill” advertising campaign. Unsurprisingly, the campaign total spend – which cost the university $1,217,632 – raised student eyebrows. Not only did the occupiers allege that McGill spent far too much on the campaign, they questioned whether the university could have more effectively spent the money, citing a lack of university spending on OSD resources. The group agreed that a solution to this would be the establishment of community controlled resources. 
Running over the intended 9 p.m. end time, the session concluded with the handing out of pro-Divest pamphlets, before a movie was shown to the occupiers sleeping the night in the Arts building.   
Land back, McGill, the Royal Vic, and the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera
A Thursday afternoon event likewise explored the importance of decolonizing McGill, with one of the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk mothers) leading a discussion on the Land Back movement. As mentioned in the community-building session, McGill was spared from bankruptcy by drawing a loan from the General Indian Trust Fund – “McGill would not exist without our money. McGill has never repaid us,” the speaker said. She also highlighted McGill’s complicity in state-sponsored violence against Indigenous communities: McGill got its charter from Britain, making the school part of Britain’s colonial project. Furthermore, she pointed out that Canada should be considered a corporation or a colony as it is not a country. Although “Canada thinks it became a real country when it got a flag and its own anthem in 1967,” it was founded on stolen land.
The MK Ultra project – a series of twisted psychological experiments funded by the CIA and Canadian government, in part conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute – was also pointed to as an example of the school’s violent past. McGill’s sordid history is often hidden from the Indigenous communities of what is currently Montreal; for this reason, attendees were encouraged to aid in research about McGill’s past conducted by the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera. 
Attempting to decolonize McGill cannot undo the harm that the school and state have already inflicted – “the destruction of our land, our waters, our people, how do you fix that?” she asked. Nonetheless, decolonization goes hand-in-hand with divestment: in Mohawk culture, unborn children are considered owners of the land – mothers are thus tasked with taking care of the land for them. This idea is crucial to combating climate change: “True climate justice means solidarity means divestment & decolonization,” the organization tweeted about the event.
University Response
According to a March 11 Twitter thread on the Divest McGill account, a “loud siren noise” was played within the Arts Building lobby to drive out occupiers. “We are under the impression that this is the act of one, angry staff member [sic.],” the thread continued. However, a statement provided to the Daily by the Media Relations Office (MRO) claimed that the noise “was caused by an alarm that was accidently [sic.] triggered.” 
The MRO statement also said that the University has “shown leadership in sustainability and climate activities,” pointing to the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), and the University’s “investments in clean technologies, renewable energy, pollution prevention, and other low-carbon funds,” as proof of McGill’s commitment to sustainability. In December 2019, CAMSR recommended decarbonization rather than divestment – per the MRO statement, “McGill is well on its way to meeting the […] goal of a 33 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2025.” Additionally, the school has reduced the carbon emissions of its public equity endowment portfolio by 20 per cent – the statement claims that this reduction “is already more than could have been accomplished by divesting from fossil fuel industry holdings alone.” However, economists have pointed out that part of the benefit of divestment is the social and political stigmatization of the fossil fuel industry, expanding divestment’s impact beyond a university’s carbon footprint. The statement does not acknowledge McGill’s investment in companies complicit in human rights violations, from which Divest McGill also encourages divestment.
Additionally, the Daily reached out to Security Services to request the Operating Procedures for the Arts Building along with a copy of security logs for the week of March 7; Security Services declined to provide these documents, explaining that they are “confidential and for internal use only.” However, the Operating Procedures Regarding Demonstrations, Protests and Occupations on McGill University Campuses are available on the Secretariat’s website – these procedures clarify that “University representatives will […] issue a clear warning” that disciplinary action will be taken if occupiers and demonstrators have transgressed the parameters outlined in the Procedures.

2022-10-03,McGill,India,"The McGill community celebrates Indigenous peoples
On September 22, McGill hosted its 21st annual Pow Wow on campus – a resumption of the in-person gathering after it was held virtually for two years. A Pow Wow (sometimes written as powwow) is an Indigenous gathering where people can sing, play instruments, and dance. For Indigenous peoples, it is also an opportunity to honour their histories, reconnect with friends and family, and heal as a community. Many see this as a way of reasserting their identity; celebrations like Pow Wows were banned by the Indian Act in 1876, and they did not become officially legalized until 1951. McGill’s annual Pow Wow is the largest event organized by the First Peoples’ House. Since 2001, children, students, community members, and more have come together annually to celebrate Indigenous cultures. 
The event began with speeches from the organizers, dancers, and the two masters of ceremony. Their words honoured and thanked the Creator for all things given to us, ending with a message of love and understanding: “I wish you all a good day, and peace and love in your hearts.” 
After the speeches, the Grand Entry began, where all the dancers entered the circle while the host drum and singers performed a song. During the Grand Entry, the audience was asked to stand as a sign of respect and to refrain from taking any photos. Elders – along with veterans and retired police officers – were honoured throughout the day. Children were also supported throughout the dances and encouraged to participate in any way they could. 
A highlight for many attendees was the inter-tribal dance. During this dance, everyone was invited to enter the circle regardless of nation and whether or not they were adorned in regalia. Many young people happily participated in the dance and shared in Indigenous culture. The event concluded with a gift giveaway and the retiring of the flags. 
The Pow Wow was part of the Indigenous Awareness Weeks activities taking place at McGill from September 19 until Truth and Reconciliation Day on September 30. The goal of Indigenous Awareness Weeks is to “provide a space to amplify Indigenous voices and perspectives on campus.” Events included speeches, seminars, movie screenings, and more. 
Many McGill groups who work with Indigenous students were at the event, including the Indigenous Students Alliance. Leah Louttit-Bunker from the ISA explained that the club is necessary at McGill to show Indigenous students they are supported and welcomed. The Indigenous Students Alliance has the goal of bringing forward “a sense of community and to act as a home away from home.” It also offers “a welcoming and inclusive community for Indigenous students and allies.” Louttit-Bunker noted that Indigenous students and allies alike are always welcome to join the ISA or participate in any of their events. 
The McGill men’s lacrosse team attended the event to show support and honour the creators of lacrosse. The McGill radio station CKUT was also tabling at the Pow Wow, and its representatives highlighted their two radio shows specifically focused on Indigenous peoples. The All Kanien’kéha Show, rebroadcasted from Reviving Kanehsatà:ke Radio 101.7FM, is entirely in Kanien’kéha, the Mohawk language. The station also has a show broadcasted partially in Inuktitut and partially in English. Representatives of the station emphasized the importance of uplifting voices that have been historically underrepresented. 
McGill University has a long history of injustice towards Indigenous peoples. James McGill enslaved Indigenous and Black people, and his fortune was made through the colonial system, which inherently oppresses Indigenous peoples. This history continues to impact all aspects of education at McGill University. Members of the McGill community have called for McGill to take further action.  
After the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published its final report in 2015, McGill’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education created 52 calls to action. To date, only seven of the initiatives have been completed. The completed actions, among others, include changing the varsity sports team name, implementing a school-wide land acknowledgement, and creating an Indigenous Studies minor program.
Delbert Sampson, a member of Secwepemc First Nation, was one of the dancers at the Pow Wow. He spoke of his love for Pow Wows and dancing: “I come to all the Pow Wows I can.” However, he noted that it’s not all about enjoyment: “I dance for the residential school survivors and all the babies they have found.” The discovery of the remains of 215 children at Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia is particularly close to Sampson, as he attended that school for seven years. He now focuses on using his knowledge of his culture to help others, as, he says, “our people need to come back to our ceremonies.” Sampson also reflected on how nice it is to see younger people coming and sharing the culture. He said it makes him so happy to hear “grandpa, I want to dance.” 
Sampson explained that, while events like the Pow Wow are great for the community, they do not take the place of real systemic change. When asked if McGill was taking the right steps forward, Sampson answered “it is important to see action instead of just words.”

2022-10-17,McGill,India,"The goal is to turn it into a course
Last spring, Nathan Ince and Jenni Makahnouk met in a seminar class and discovered that they both shared an interest in learning the Anishinaabe language. Makahnouk is Anishinaabe, and  Ince, a Professor in the history department at McGill, was interested in learning it for his research. As a result, they’re now running an Anishinaabe Language Study Group this semester for any McGill students interested in the language. The Daily spoke to Ince, Makahnouk, and Nika Paul, another student involved, to learn more about this project and why they believe it’s needed at McGill. 
“We both kind of came together and said ‘hey, why don’t we learn this together,’” Makahnouk explains. “I want to try to learn it to keep my language alive, and also learn more about my culture.”
Paul also pointed out that programs like this are valuable because “not all of us have the opportunity [to learn Anishinaabe] in our communities and our families because of colonization.” For most of Canada’s history, the federal and provincial governments have advanced colonial policies designed to suppress Indigenous language use, notably through the Indian Act, residential schools, and the “Sixties Scoop.”
When asked how the study group works, Makahnouk said that “there’s a certain formal class component to it and there’s not necessarily homework, but it’s kind of like go at your own pace.” They welcome everybody interested in the language, with most attendees being beginners. However, the organizers hope that with enough interest, it can grow into something bigger.
In 2017, a task force appointed by Provost Christopher Manfredi laid out 52 Calls to Action related to Indigenous Studies and Indigenous education. So far, only five of these calls have been marked as “completed.” One call still in progress is number 34, which concerns “Language Revitalization and Documentation” and calls on McGill to create a plan to support language revitalization in Indigenous communities. However, McGill still doesn’t offer any Indigenous language courses, something that the group hopes their initiative can change. Ince said that the end goal is to turn their study group into a course.
“We would ideally […] have a fluent Anishinaabe instructor who would be able to run their course just as they run any other language course here,” explained Makahnouk. As McGill is situated on both unceded Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee lands, she would be happy to see courses in either language.
“These are the original languages of the land […] I think people are starting to come to realize that and I think there’s a lot of interest out there for people who want to learn [the language],” Makahnouk said. “We’re excited about the interest and there’s tons of people that have come in for their own reasons.” 
Ince estimated that there are around 20 people who are “circulating in and out”, with 13 people showing up to one session, indicating that there’s an interest in learning Anishinaabe within the McGill community.
McGill only offers an Indigenous Studies minor, which was established in 2014 as a result of student activism. In their 52 Calls to Action, McGill has designated number 31, which calls for a robust Indigenous Studies program, as “completed,” despite the lack of a major program. Paul stressed the need for more Indigenous professors to teach these classes, as a lot of Indigenous Studies classes at McGill are currently taught by non-Indigenous professors. 
“We’re a ‘world-class’ university, we’re at the top of the rankings all the time, and yet, we can’t learn about the peoples who were here first, the original peoples of the land,” said Makahnouk. 
“Indigenous knowledge is world-class, having a program that teaches Indigenous languages is world-class,” said Ince. “If you’re not teaching these languages […]you’re not training people to do work in archives, to understand oral histories, or to engage with knowledge at that level.” He said that the more people use and engage with these languages, the stronger they will become. While emphasizing that it’s important for settlers not to take ownership of Indigenous languages, he believes that “there’s a responsibility to contribute to reversing the linguistic genocide that’s taking place in Canada.”
Although there’s concern that there will be resistance from the administration, the group is hopeful that the significant interest in the project coupled with the 52 calls to action will convince the University to invest in this initiative and eventually turn it into a course.
“I think there’s always going to be a little bit of a pushback. It is an institution. Yes, you have to fight hard to get what you want,” said Paul. “But I feel like there are more and more people that are fighting for it.”
The group meets from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. every Wednesday in Ferrier 105.

2022-11-14,McGill,India,"Turpel-Lafond’s Indigenous identity under question
Mary Ellen Elizabeth Turpel-Lafond, a Canadian lawyer, former judge, and law professor at UBC, received an honorary degree from McGill in 2014. However, she has recently come under fire after a CBC investigation published in early October revealed that information found in publicly available documents was inconsistent with Turpel-Lafond’s claims to Cree ancestry and her treaty Indian status, as well as the community where she grew up and her academic accomplishments. McGill has assembled an ad hoc sub-committee to review the honorary degree awarded to Turpel-Lafond, according to Interim Principal Christopher Manfredi in an email addressed to the McGill community on November 8.
Turpel-Lafond’s career took off in the 1990s when she served as a constitutional adviser to the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations Ovide Mercredi. Since then, Turpel-Lafond has served in various prominent roles that aim for restorative justice. She was appointed British Columbia’s first Representative for Children and Youth in November 2006, and she also served as the founding director of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre (IRSHDC) at UBC. Turpel-Lafond retired from the position this past June but maintains her position as a law professor at UBC’s Peter A. Allard School of Law.
A prominent Indigenous scholar in Canada, Turpel-Lafond is highly decorated and has been awarded 11 honorary degrees from Canadian universities, including McGill. In 1994, she was named one of the “The Global 100” leaders of the new millennium by Time magazine, and in 1999, she was selected as one of the top “Canadian leaders for the 21st century.” The Indigenous Bar Association awarded her the distinction of “Indigenous Peoples’ Counsel” in 2007. She was also a recipient of the Order of Canada in 2021, one of the highest civilian awards in the country.
CBC reports that that “there is a growing problem in this country of non-Indigenous people taking away opportunities from First Nations, Métis and Inuit people by improperly claiming Indigenous ancestry.” Turpel-Lafond’s background and claims that she is a member of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation has been disputed since the mid-1990s. In 1995, a reporter for the Ottawa Citizen explained that in the interviewing process for a profile on Turpel-Lafond, “more than one person suggested checking into her Indian background.”
According to Turpel-Lafond, her father is Cree while her mother was English-Scottish. However, the CBC report found that genealogical records show that her paternal grandfather was of Irish, German, and American ancestry and that his wife was born in England to British parents. After a request from CBC, Turpel-Lafond declined to comment on her father’s biological parents’ identities, instead saying, “I respect my parents and all members of my family and I will never call anyone out. Growing up we did not question biological parentage.”
The same day as the findings of the CBC investigation about Turpel-Lafond’s Indigenous identity were published, UBC issued a statement to The Globe and Mail praising her accomplishments as the IRSHDC director and her connections to the Indigenous community. UBC Director of University Affairs Matthew Ramsey said: “[Prof. Turpel-Lafond’s] identity is her own and the university is not going to comment on it.” Others have also condemned the investigation into Turpel-Lafond’s claimed Indigenous identity; the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) said that Turpel-Lafond has been a groundbreaking advocate for Indigenous peoples for decades, adding that issues of First Nations identity should be personal for Indigenous peoples and not for media “digging into private matters.” Furthermore, UBCIC rejected using solely genealogy as the best indicator of Indigenous identity, deeming it a legacy of “assimilationist colonialism.”
The Muskeg Lake Cree Nation confirms that Turpel-Lafond is a member of their Nation and has been for the past 30 years, stating in a press release that “[k]inship determines who is a member of the Nation, and she is part of one of our kinship families.”
In recent years, Canadian universities have begun to address concerns surrounding the claims of Indigenous identities of faculty. Last year, an anonymous report published at Queen’s University claimed that six faculty members were falsely claiming Indigenous status. The university defended its faculty, saying it “respects and trusts the Indigenous protocols used to identify those it considers Indigenous.” This case came after the University of Saskatchewan was made aware of the alleged mendacity of professor Carrie Bourassa’s claim to Indigenous identity. Bourassa resigned from her position after the university promised to investigate her Indigenous heritage and implement a review of its policies surrounding claims to Indigenous identities.
Though policies to review claims to Indigenous identities are being updated, many Canadian universities prioritize the hiring of Indigenous faculty. In 2019, then-provost Manfredi said: “One of the keys to fulfilling this commitment is to actively increase the number of Indigenous scholars in our professoriate.” UBC says that “Indigenous identity was not a criterion” for Turpel-Lafond’s position at the school.
The Indigenous Women’s Collective is calling on universities to rescind honorary doctorate degrees awarded to Turpel-Lafond, saying that “[r]econciliation starts with truth.” York University, Brock University, Royal Roads University, and the University of Regina are among the universities that have begun to review the honorary degrees they awarded to Turpel-Lafond. 
McGill’s ad hoc sub-committee to review Turpel-Lafond’s honorary degree is composed of Manfredi and three to five Honorary Degrees and Convocations Committee members. Regarding the assembly of the committee, McGill claims that it “places the highest premium on respect and honesty.”
McGill did not elaborate further on the review process, per the Daily’s request.

2022-11-30,McGill,India,"Every Friday from 12:30-2:00 PM, a bright yellow door in the heart of Milton-Parc leads the way to affordable, vegan meals. On November 11, the Rabbit Hole Café officially reopened for the academic year. It operates out of the Yellow Door, a community organization that promotes intergenerational social inclusion, located at 3625 rue Aylmer. 
The Rabbit Hole Café  is a long-running vegan collective kitchen that provides inexpensive meals for community members during the academic year. The service is cash-only and they ask visitors to either bring their own container or eat in the coffeehouse downstairs.
 This year, it is run by four dedicated and kitchen-trained volunteers who oversee the entire food preparation and serving process. Nicky DiCaprio, Admin and Communications Coordinator for the Yellow Door, told the Daily that “they all have cooking experience […] and are trained in food safety and cleanliness, so they’re trustworthy, and it’s just seriously so good. Everything they make is with love.”  
In an interview with the Daily, Rabbit Hole volunteer, Viva Noronha explained that the café was “the perfect intersection of cooking as a passion as well as just spreading my love for food to the community.” Noronha described that the kitchen works very collaboratively, “I stir a pot, I wash some dishes, I drain the beans [..] if anybody needs help, we help them.” 
Noronha expressed that “everyone has been really receptive to the food.” So far, they have served a $3 Indian chickpea curry, $3 homemade squash ravioli, and $4 Cuban congrí, as well as $1-2 desserts. “The chickpea curry we did was my mom’s recipe, so that was very close to my heart,” Noronha said. “It was really empowering to see people just enjoying food that I grew up eating.”
Both Noronha and DiCaprio emphasized the need for services like this in the McGill community. “With inflation prices being crazy, like grocery prices are insane, I think this is a really good resource for students,” DiCaprio stated. “To eat healthy is super expensive these days. So this gives students and the whole community an affordable, vegan, delicious, warm meal.” 
McGill currently operates under an exclusivity agreement with the Compass Group. Some students claim that privatization has led to a decrease in diverse and affordable food options on campus. Noronha also pointed out the Compass Group’s role in the prison-industrial complex, as it provides food services to correctional facilities in Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. 
In contrast to most of McGill’s food services, Noronha explained that Rabbit Hole allows “community members to gather and really enjoy and respect the food they’re eating and know where it’s coming from, [which is] maybe the main reason why I wanted to do this.” McGill students can also take advantage of Midnight Kitchen’s free weekly vegan meal servings or register for the SSMU Pilot Grocery Program before November 30th. 
Community members interested in becoming involved with the Yellow Door are able to participate in their free intergenerational wellness initiatives, such as the Art Hive, their reading groups, or Friday Night «Hootenanny» Open Stage music events. They can also volunteer with the Generations program, which pairs them with a senior to provide support to.
The Rabbit Hole’s last lunch service of the year will be this Friday, December 2, but they will be back January 6 for the Winter semester.

2023-01-30,McGill,India,"A long-awaited end to “unfinished business”
On January 21, the federal government announced an agreement of $2.8 billion to settle the remaining part of a class-action lawsuit brought by two British Columbia First Nations more than a decade ago. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller said the government signed the agreement with plaintiffs representing 325 nations.
The B.C. day-scholar lawsuit was filed by former shíshálh chief Garry Feschuk and former Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc chief Shane Gottfriedson. The two chiefs sought justice for “day scholars” – individuals who attended church- or government-run schools during the day but did not sleep there overnight – as well as descendents of those individuals. The day-scholar distinction rendered thousands of day school survivors ineligible for the Canadian government’s 2006 settlement for residential school survivors. Day scholars were also excluded from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission active from 2008 to 2015.
The initial suit involved three classes of complainants: a Survivors class, a Descendants class, and a Band class. In 2021, all parties agreed to separate the Survivor and Descendant classes from the Band class to ensure that aging day school survivors could receive compensation in their lifetimes. The settlement between Survivors, Descendants, and the Canadian government included $10,000 for each eligible day scholar (or their family or estate) as well as $50 million for a Day Scholars Revitalization Fund. As of December 23, 2022, there have been 11,453 claims made and 3,735 payments issued.
This month’s resolution of the Band class’ claims brings a long-awaited end to the “unfinished business” of 2021, per Miller. As part of the Band class settlement, Canada has agreed to place $2.8 billion in a not-for-profit trust to “support healing, wellness, education, heritage, language, and commemoration activities.” The trust, which will be independent of the government, is to be managed by a permanent board of nine Indigenous directors. It will be guided by the Four Pillars developed by Band class plaintiffs: revival and protection of Indigenous languages, revival and protection of Indigenous cultures, protection and promotion of heritage, and wellness for Indigenous communities and their members.
Gottfriedson explained that the settlement “allows our Indigenous nations to control this process […] we will manage and distribute the funds, we will provide it to all 325 nations in a fair and objective manner.” Each nation will be able to decide which of the Four Pillars to focus on and to develop a ten-year implementation plan. After the first decade, new ten-year plans will be developed to ensure that all funds are dispersed within 20 years. 
The B.C. day-scholar settlement is only the latest in a series of billion-dollar settlements between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian government. In June 2022, the Siksika First Nation in southern Alberta voted to accept a $1.3-billion payment to “right past wrongs dating back over a century”: in 1910, Canada broke its Blackfoot Treaty (Treaty 7) and wrongfully seized more than 115,000 acres of Siksika Nation’s reserve land. In July 2022, moreover, the federal government signed a $20-billion agreement to compensate First Nations children and families harmed by chronic underfunding of the on-reserve child welfare system – “the largest such deal in Canadian history.” In addition to the $20 billion for compensation, another $20 billion was set aside to reform the on-reserve child welfare system over five years.
In 2009, Garry McLean of Lake Manitoba First Nation filed a $15-billion lawsuit against the federal government seeking compensation, like Feschuk and Gottfriedson, for thousands of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children who attended federally-run day schools. McLean’s class-action suit took ten years to resolve, and by the time the federal government agreed to award between $10,000 and $200,000 to each claimant, McLean – who himself suffered “emotional, mental, physical, and sexual abuse” at the Dog Creek Day School – had already passed away. As of January 3, 2023, some 178,161 people had filed claims with the Indian Day Schools Class Action and 70 per cent of them had received payment.
“Many Canadians are aware of the tragic legacy of Indian residential schools,” said former Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett in 2019, “[but] a lot did not know, and most Canadians still do not know, that beginning in the 1920s, 200,000 students attended federally operated Indian day schools,” Bennett said.
The B.C. day-scholar settlement is unique in that it marks the first time Canada will compensate bands and communities collectively for harms related to residential or day schools. “Reconciliation isn’t free. This is a lot of money,” Miller said. “Is it enough? I think only time will tell, but we know there’s a heck of a lot more to do.”
“This has never been done,” remarked Peter Grant, class counsel for the nations, at a news conference. “This is where the government is saying, ‘you take care and you’re in charge of how you wish to start to repair the damage.’”
Further information on the terms of the settlement will become publicly available over the next month. Before any funds can be transferred to the trust, a settlement approval hearing must be held between February 27 and March 1, followed by an appeal period.

2023-03-13,McGill,India,"“Stealing from Indigenous people should carry consequences,” says IWC
On February 24, Interim Principal and Vice-Chancellor Christopher P. Manfredi announced in an email to the McGill community that the McGill University Senate had voted to revoke the honorary degree granted to Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond in 2014. The decision to revoke Turpel-Lafond’s Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree, honoris causa, was based on a recommendation of the Honorary Degrees and Convocations Committee (HDCC). An ad hoc subcommittee had been reviewing Turpel-Lafond’s case since November of last year, after a CBC investigation revealed factual errors in some of Turpel-Lafond’s claims about her Cree ancestry, her Treaty Indian status, the community she grew up in, and her academic achievements.
The HDCC subcommittee was advised by Professor Celeste Pedri-Spade, McGill’s Associate Provost (Indigenous Initiatives). According to Manfredi’s email, it “carried out its work diligently” and “in accordance with procedural fairness.” In line with McGill’s role “as an institution of higher learning committed to academic integrity,” the subcommittee focused its review on questions concerning Turpel-Lafond’s curriculum vitae, but it did not ignore questions raised with respect to her Treaty Indian status. Subcommittee members communicated with Turpel-Lafond throughout the review process, and they examined documentation that Turpel-Lafond provided them. In the end, however, the subcommittee “found evidence calling into question the validity of information about academic credentials and accomplishments appearing on Ms. Turpel-Lafond’s curriculum vitae.” It noted also that her claims to Treaty Indian status were “the subject of important questions.”
Concluding his email, Manfredi reminded the McGill community that honorary degrees are the university’s “highest honours, reserved for individuals whose achievements and values inspire our community.” He also reminded recipients of the university’s “duty to ensure accountability in relation to claims of Indigenous citizenship,” promising that McGill – under the leadership of Indigenous students and faculty and “with guidance from Indigenous community-based advisors” – would develop a policy on Indigenous citizenship claims.
The Indigenous Women’s Collective (IWC) formed after the CBC investigation was published last year and has been calling on universities and other institutions to rescind honours bestowed upon Turpel-Lafond ever since. This includes 11 Canadian universities that have awarded Turpel-Lafond honorary degrees as well as the Order of Canada, which granted Turpel-Lafond the country’s second-highest civilian honour in 2021. The IWC was pleased by the same-day decisions of McGill and Carleton University to strip Turpel-Lafond of her honorary degrees. In a press release dated February 27, the collective wrote: “We applaud this action and we believe this helps to eradicate the devastating silence that surrounds the colonial theft of our Indigenous identities.” The IWC added that Turpel-Lafond “is well versed in the history and manifestations of colonial harm” and that she should “begin the healing process with Indigenous people by apologizing for her conduct.”
Turpel-Lafond has yet to make a public apology. On March 9, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association voted to revoke the Reg Robson Award it granted to her in 2020 because its board members believed she had falsified her claims to Indigenous identity. Responding to a request for comment, Turpel-Lafond told The Canadian Press that she was surprised by the association’s decision to rescind the award without “basic fairness” – they did not, she said, give her a chance to defend herself – but that she was satisfied with her “past work, identity and self-worth.” Turpel-Lafond went on to express that she has “no emotional attachment to titles, honours or accolades.” In fact, she said, it feels “liberating” to be freed of them because it permits her to “focus on what really matters” in her life.
McGill, Carleton, and the University of Regina are the only schools that have stripped Turpel-Lafond of honorary degrees thus far. In a February 13 press release, the University of Regina stated that Turpel-Lafond’s accomplishments “are outweighed by the harm inflicted upon Indigenous academics, peoples and communities when non-Indigenous people misrepresent their Indigenous ancestry.” 
Not everyone agrees. As reported in the Daily last fall, many individuals and groups have spoken out against the investigations into Turpel-Lafond’s Indigenous identity and academic record. The University of British Columbia, for one, issued a statement to The Globe and Mail in October praising Turpel-Lafond’s accomplishments as the founding director of the university’s Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre. UBC has since apologized for its handling of the Turpel-Lafond allegations, saying its response “harmed its Indigenous community and Indigenous partners outside the university.” Some Indigenous groups have come to Turpel-Lafond’s defence as well. In October 2022, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs said Turpel-Lafond has been a “fierce, ethical and groundbreaking advocate for Indigenous peoples for decades” and that genealogy is not always the best indicator of Indigenous identity. Chief Kelly Wolfe of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, meanwhile, has confirmed that Turpel-Lafond is a member of their community “and has been for 30 years.”
Earlier this year, Turpel-Lafond voluntarily relinquished degrees from Vancouver Island University and Royal Roads University upon learning that they planned to conduct reviews. On March 8, Brock University also accepted a return from Turpel-Lafond. The IWC has condemned the decisions of these universities to accept Turpel-Lafond’s returns, arguing that they “did not uphold academic integrity by making Ms. Turpel-Lafond accountable for her actions.” Tweeting on February 7, the IWC also wrote that Turpel-Lafond “must be investigated for Indigenous identity fraud and held accountable if her claims are unfounded. Stealing from Indigenous people should carry consequences.”

2009-01-12,McGill,Israel,"Concordia a shadow of larger weekend demonstrations
A  few dozen protesters decried Israel’s military offensive on Gaza amidst Wednesday’s lunchtime crowd in a Concordia cafeteria, a small version of larger rallies that have taken place across the city.
Wednesday’s event was organized by Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) Concordia and social justice collective Tadamon! focused on attacks aimed at Gaza schools.
“Our basic demands are that the University’s administration condemn the fact the Israeli military is bombing schools in Gaza,” explained QPIRG Concordia member Aaron Lakoff. “We also demand the University immediately cut its ties with all Israeli academic institutions.”
Lakoff explained that both groups felt Israeli universities were complicit in Isreael’s actions as none have spoken out against them.
QPIRG and Tandamon! also called for students to boycott companies that supported Israel: Starbucks, McDonald’s, Chapters, and Indigo Books.
Both groups also joined the ranks of community and civil society organizations at a protest downtown on Sunday that drew a crowd of between 5,000 and 10,000.
“There was a very palatable, visceral anger in the streets,” Lakoff said.
A six-month cease-fire between the two countries expired on December 19, as Hamas stated Israel had not lifted the blockade into Gaza except  for limited humanitarian aid. Israel, incensed at the 500 rocket and mortar attacks launched into Israel thus far during December, launched a military operation against Hamas in Gaza on December 27. At press time 13 Israelis and about 800 Gazans have been killed from air strikes and a ground offensive, while 137 Israelis and about 3,300 Gazans have been wounded, although exact numbers vary and are impossible to obtain.
Laith Marouf, another QPIRG member and Concordia chapter coordinator of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, a national student-run non-profit, explained that Sunday’s objectives varied slightly from the Concrodia protest: while student groups have called for academic boycotts, Sunday’s protest called on the Canadian government to use diplomatic means in pressuring Israel to end the offensive. Sunday’s protest also had one violent instance where an Israeli flag was burned whereas Wednesday’s was peaceful.
A second Montreal protest was organized for Saturday – but this time community and civil society organizations will be joined by labour unions, including the Montreal branch of the Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux (CSN-Montreal).
“Yesterday we adopted a proposition that says we will support the Palestinian people in Gaza, and we invited all our members to participate in the march,” said Dominique Daigneault, the second vice president of CSN-Montreal.
Montrealers are not alone in condemning the attacks, with protests being held around the world. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1860, which called for “an immediate, durable, and fully respected ceasefire,” among other things, but both Israel and Hamas rejected the resolution and the ceasefire.

2009-01-12,McGill,Israel,"Munroe-Blum takes positive attitude towards contentious campus issues
To start off the semester, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum sat down with The Daily, our sister publication Le Délit, and The McGill Tribune to talk about tuition, teaching assistants (TAs), and First Nations at McGill.
McGill Daily: The Charest Government has allowed Quebec universities to increase tuition, often by very large amounts in short periods of time, and you’ve largely welcomed this. Do you think a university should have the right to set tuition at whatever price the market can bear?
Heather Munroe-Blum: I don’t see any evidence of huge changes, they’ve been extremely modest on every account. From the time I’ve come to McGill, I’ve argued on every account for a different policy on tuition, which is one that would essentially be characterized as re-regulation, not deregulation.
I actually don’t believe in driving costs as high as they can go – I don’t think that funds [determine] either accessibility or quality in a university, but I do believe our tuition is too low, I believe our funding overall is too low – that’s empirically supportable. The policy that I asked the [Board of Governors] to approve in my first year, which they did, is that we be able to, within the legislative possibilities of Quebec, raise tuition within the normal range, so you could even use the Canadian average or Canadian plus the public American average.
MD: What about international student fees?
HMB: It’s hardly a dramatic step that [Premier Jean] Charest has made. Re-regulation would mean that we would have the flexibility of fees that would be approved by the [Board of Governors], but with a notion…that 30 cents of every dollar go to student aid…. What I hope to say while I’m Principal is that no qualified student will be refused, or be unable to come to McGill because they don’t have the financial means to come. We still don’t have enough financial aid through McGill or through Quebec…. If you compare us to the other research-intensive universities in Canada, we lack about $100-million a year that would normally come in from tuition. If you look at the universities outside Quebec, no government pays for international students, so they are completely cost-driven fees – and the same in the public universities in the U.S. with which we associate ourselves. We like international students as part of the richness of McGill, not as a moneymaker. Deregulation means you can charge whatever you want. Re-regulation means you have principles that would govern the way you raise fees.
McGill Tribune:* [There are] new travel restrictions that prevent students and professors from certain areas because of travel warnings that the Canadian government have…. Were you happy with the way that process was implemented, and do you feel that that might adversely affect students who work in areas that naturally deal with conflict or strife?
HMB: Of course we’re not happy when things don’t get communicated smoothly and effectively, and I don’t think anybody would say they were. I’m not going to pretend they were, and I don’t think Provost [Morton] Mendelson would say they were either. I think the process that has evolved subsequently is a good one…that is a small group working with the Deputy Provost that iterate on the regulations for international travel. So those will be coming back to Senate for discussion, and they’re well developed, and there’s been a wide consultation process.
Look, our goals are we’re a deeply internationalized university, we’re proud of it, it’s part of our essential character. The goals are to support student mobility in every way we can while being prudent on safety. We’ve lost three collegues as you know in the developing world in the last six months.
MD: McGill’s pow-wow tries to attract First Nations high school students to the University, but the First Nations House tells us little has changed in the number of First Nations students enrolled at the school. We wonder if the lack of a First Nations Studies program has anything to do with the low enrollment. Do you agree?
HMB: We don’t know how many aboriginal students we have because we don’t register students in that way. You have to identify as aboriginal in order to qualify for any special services or support. That being said, we have a number of initiatives to reach out to aboriginal communities and to support aboriginal students to participate in the academic programs of McGill. The Deputy Provost is leading an initiative looking at, for example, not only at Native Studies, but how to offer educational programs that will be accessible and of interest to aboriginal students. And then, how do we support aboriginal students when they come in to be able to succeed in their studies – and especially those who come from remote communities. It’s an area we have as a priority for fundraising as well, in [Campaign McGill], not just review and planning, but implentation as well.
MD: How should the University determine who owns the rights to content produced here. How much should the source of funding of research, the facilities used, and the amount of contribution between students and professors affect this determination?
HMB: The intellectual property  [IP] ownership should be determined through policy. We have policies that govern IP, and those policies are set in this case by Senate.
MD: There has been presence of corporate and military research on campus. We’re curious about the involvement McGill might have in their research.
HMB: Our normal policies pertain to grants of any kind, whether a foundation, a not-for-profit, a corporation, or government. A contract, whether it’s with [a] government, has different ways of looking at intellectual property and that’s determined again by our policy on a case-by-case basis. A lot of these questions then become philosophical: Who do you take money from? Well we don’t take illegal money. We then take a whole lot of money from a range of public sources – the majority of our money by far comes from public sources and the one example of so-called military research sponsored by the Department of Defense was for prosthetic research.
For better or worse, it’s unfortunate that the countries who have put the most into military research – the U.S., Singapore, Israel – have had more breakthroughs in science because so much basic science gets funded out of that. The fact is that governments spend an enormous amount of normal basic science research or applied science research – prosthetics would be an example – that has a broad human benefit or knowledge benefit. We look very much at what is the content of the research that’s being done here. Is it being used to benefit the quality of education here?
MD: Considering how much power TAs have on undergraduate marks, especially in large classes, do you think the amount of training they receive is sufficient? How would you change the way TAs are trained at McGill?
HMB: Dean Martin Kreiswirth – Dean of Graduate Students – works very closely with the faculties in giving full support to the orientation of graduate students and preparing them to teach. In any event [it] is a priority and progress is being made on that. This is an issue that could be expressed in a number of ways. Graduate students want preparation and high quality supervision and undergraduate students want TAs who are well prepared and do what they do. The close working relationship between professors and TAs is a key part of that. The Provost has overall responsibility for this, and has this as a high priority.

2009-01-12,McGill,Israel,"Munroe-Blum takes positive attitude towards contentious campus issues
To start off the semester, Principal Heather Munroe-Blum sat down with The Daily, our sister publication Le Délit, and The McGill Tribune to talk about tuition, teaching assistants (TAs), and First Nations at McGill.
McGill Daily: The Charest Government has allowed Quebec universities to increase tuition, often by very large amounts in short periods of time, and you’ve largely welcomed this. Do you think a university should have the right to set tuition at whatever price the market can bear?
Heather Munroe-Blum: I don’t see any evidence of huge changes, they’ve been extremely modest on every account. From the time I’ve come to McGill, I’ve argued on every account for a different policy on tuition, which is one that would essentially be characterized as re-regulation, not deregulation.
I actually don’t believe in driving costs as high as they can go – I don’t think that funds [determine] either accessibility or quality in a university, but I do believe our tuition is too low, I believe our funding overall is too low – that’s empirically supportable. The policy that I asked the [Board of Governors] to approve in my first year, which they did, is that we be able to, within the legislative possibilities of Quebec, raise tuition within the normal range, so you could even use the Canadian average or Canadian plus the public American average.
MD: What about international student fees?
HMB: It’s hardly a dramatic step that [Premier Jean] Charest has made. Re-regulation would mean that we would have the flexibility of fees that would be approved by the [Board of Governors], but with a notion…that 30 cents of every dollar go to student aid…. What I hope to say while I’m Principal is that no qualified student will be refused, or be unable to come to McGill because they don’t have the financial means to come. We still don’t have enough financial aid through McGill or through Quebec…. If you compare us to the other research-intensive universities in Canada, we lack about $100-million a year that would normally come in from tuition. If you look at the universities outside Quebec, no government pays for international students, so they are completely cost-driven fees – and the same in the public universities in the U.S. with which we associate ourselves. We like international students as part of the richness of McGill, not as a moneymaker. Deregulation means you can charge whatever you want. Re-regulation means you have principles that would govern the way you raise fees.
McGill Tribune:* [There are] new travel restrictions that prevent students and professors from certain areas because of travel warnings that the Canadian government have…. Were you happy with the way that process was implemented, and do you feel that that might adversely affect students who work in areas that naturally deal with conflict or strife?
HMB: Of course we’re not happy when things don’t get communicated smoothly and effectively, and I don’t think anybody would say they were. I’m not going to pretend they were, and I don’t think Provost [Morton] Mendelson would say they were either. I think the process that has evolved subsequently is a good one…that is a small group working with the Deputy Provost that iterate on the regulations for international travel. So those will be coming back to Senate for discussion, and they’re well developed, and there’s been a wide consultation process.
Look, our goals are we’re a deeply internationalized university, we’re proud of it, it’s part of our essential character. The goals are to support student mobility in every way we can while being prudent on safety. We’ve lost three collegues as you know in the developing world in the last six months.
MD: McGill’s pow-wow tries to attract First Nations high school students to the University, but the First Nations House tells us little has changed in the number of First Nations students enrolled at the school. We wonder if the lack of a First Nations Studies program has anything to do with the low enrollment. Do you agree?
HMB: We don’t know how many aboriginal students we have because we don’t register students in that way. You have to identify as aboriginal in order to qualify for any special services or support.

2009-01-15,McGill,Israel,"An estimated 10,000 people marched Saturday in protest against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, part of a worldwide movement denouncing recent violence.
The frustrations of the crowd were tangible. Participants walked down Ste. Catherine from Peel to St. Urbain, chanting “Viva! Viva! Intifada!” and “Israel—Assassin! Israel—Terrorist!”
“I feel a little helpless,” said McGill graduate student Kianoosh Hashemzadeh at the protest. “I feel like this is helping me feel as if I am a part of a movement that is against the activity taking place in Gaza.”
According to the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Tzipi Livni, the aim of Israel’s offensive is to stop the barrage of rockets and mortars being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, numbering about 500 since the start of the 20-day offensive. However, due to the low mortality rate of the Hamas rockets, the conflict has left 13 Israelis and over 900 Palestinians dead. In addition, 4,400 Gazans have been injured to date.
Protester and McGill law student Maha Hussain defended Israel’s right to protect its citizens, but felt the Israeli response to be disproportionate.
“It’s like shooting fish in a barrel; they have nowhere to evacuate to,” she said, referring to Gaza’s borders, which have been sealed for the past 18 months.
The campaign was organized by the Coalition for Justice and Peace in Palestine, Tadamon! Montreal, and Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR).
Many Jewish groups also took part in the rally, including the Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians (ACJC), Independent Jewish Voices, and Young Jews for Social Justice (YJSJ), a new Quebec Public Interest Research Group-McGill working group.
Elise Eisenkraft Klein, a member of the YJSJ, emphasized the diversity of voices within the Jewish community.
“I think it’s important that the Jewish community is not shown as being a monolithic voice, and that there are opinions that Jews have out there other than [those of] the big organizations and pro-Israel…lobbies,” said Klein.
Speaking at the demonstration, Independent Jewish Voices representative Abby Lippman called on Jewish history to justify Jewish opposition to Israeli policies in the Occupied Territories.
“Silence kills. Jews know this all too well,” said Lippman. “We cannot stay and watch others kill in our name.
“We will stand up in solidarity with all those who are demanding an end to Israel’s attacks in Gaza, to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, and to the continuation of violations of human rights and international law,” added Lippman.
Aaron Lakoff, a collective member of Tadamon! Montreal, maintained that Israeli treatment of the Palestinians contradicts Jewish values.
“A lot of people have interpreted Jewish values to be standing for liberation and for justice. And what Israel is doing is actually smack in the face of those traditions and a smack in the face of all of humanity,” said Lakoff.
No opposing groups organized against the protest. However, onlooker Yoni Khajehzadeh was displeased with the march. Identifying himself as an Iranian Jew, Khajehzadeh was concerned the demonstration threatened Israel’s legitimacy as nation-state.
“I’m not saying that everything that is going on in Gaza is right, but what I am saying is that Israel has a right to exist as a sovereign Jewish state,” said Khajehzadeh.
The Montreal demonstration coincided with several held across Canada in Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver over the weekend. Tens of thousands have also protested in Britain, France, Belgium, and Spain.
According to Nina Amrov, spokesperson for SPHR, the primary goal of the protest was to mobilize those outraged by the alleged war crimes committed by the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. The organization hopes the demonstration will incite the Conservative government to end its support of Israeli policies that flagrantly abuse international law, said Amrov.
In addition, both Amrov and Lakoff underscored the need to consider the context in which Hamas has been firing rockets, saying the targeted towns – Ashkelon, Sderot, and Ashdod – are where many Gazans lived before 1948 and 1967.
“We’re talking about the Gaza Strip: 75 per cent of the population there are refugees. It’s the world’s largest open-air prison,” said Lakoff.
“People have to go through the largest obstacles in the world just to get basic necessities of life.”

2009-01-22,McGill,Israel,"International apathy leaves Hamas alone to protect Palestinians: anthropologist
Julius Grey, civil rights lawyer and human rights activist and Israeli-American political activist and anthropologist Jeff Halper spoke about the barriers to peace in the Middle East at McGill last Wednesday. The event was hosted by Young Jews for Social Justice (YJSJ) and Independent Jewish Voices (IJV).
Applause and cheers rang as Halper stood to speak.
Halper blamed Israeli tribal nationalism and a belief in exclusive ownership of land as the reasons why peace remains so elusive, likening “this is our land, but you can live here too” attitude to nationalist periods seen in Germany, Poland, Russia.
“Think of ‘The Motherland, The Homeland!’ People say Israel is a Western democracy, but it isn’t,” Halper said. “Zionism comes out of Eastern Europe, not Western Europe.”
Halper also claimed that this “doctrine of the permanent enemy” guides Israelis to assume that Arabs want to kill them, and thus that there is no political solution.
“Israel is a military state. It is run by generals and Israel has set up a set of parameters that make peace impossible,” Halper said.
Halper then used his “doctrine” to argue Hamas is the only group capable of protecting Palestinians from Israel, concluding that as a result armed resistance is legitimate according to international law.
Halper stopped once during his presentation and allowed a question to be asked by an upset Israeli, which was met with a raucous response from the audience – including one student who tactfully turned around, shouted, and dramatically mimed “zip-it-up.”
Halper concluded his presentation by claiming that the world was forgetting Palestinians and turning them into “surplus humanity” by apathy.
He proposed the abandonment of the two-state concept and a focus on a single-state solution, an option on neither party’s radar. He noted Israel has historically come to the negotiating table expecting to walk away with everything.
“I hope my message wasn’t a ‘down’ message, but there cannot be a win/lose resolution.”
Grey’s discussion preceded Halper. He felt Canadians have been far too passive in human rights activism, explaining that “safe” human rights activists avoid controversy– such as language laws and labour issues in Canada, and the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
“Human rights are quite useless if not accompanied by courage,”Grey said.
Grey implied Israel’s recent action in Gaza has darker Machiavellian undertones.
“Condemning the invasion is in the interest of Israel,” added Grey.
He found any real resolution to be in the hands of Israel’s government, who he said needs to step away from policies of hate and war. He then outlined how Canadian action can speed up that process.
Representatives from QPIRG and IJV claimed McGill tried to censor the event when it demanded an additional $250 for security on the day of the talk. The audience was asked for further donations to cover the unexpected cost.

2009-01-25,McGill,Israel,"Some young diaspora Jews have strong cultural and spiritual ties to Israel, making carte blanche criticism challenging
In light of the recent escalation of violence in Gaza, many members of the Jewish community feel torn between their political views and their cultural identity.
Rabbi Leibish Hundert of the Ghetto Shul explained that certain young diaspora Jews feel disconnected from Israel because of the current political and military situation in the Middle East.
“There is a moral and ethical dilemma that is facing Israel. This has caused some alienation and some mixed feelings,” Hundert said, adding that few demonstrators at pro-Israel rallies are 100 per cent supportive of Israel’s actions.
“There would be a small percentage of people at a pro-Israel rally who would say they are happy with every single thing. People feel a deep unsettledness about the millions of Palestinians who are living a very difficult life.”
Dr. Eric Caplan, Chair of the Jewish Studies Department at McGill, explained that Israel is significant to Judaism for many reasons, one being a cultural connection.
“Jewish civilization formed in Israel…. It goes back…to the time of Abraham in 14th or 15th century B.C.E,” said Caplan. “In the two millennia where Jews were in exile, the security of the Jews was often called into question. Jewish life has often been precarious, predating the Holocaust.”
Caplan added that in the 60 years since its formation, Israel has accepted a large Jewish population fleeing from persecution.
Yael Smiley, Israel Affairs Chair for Hillel McGill, also explained the importance of the country.
“It is the one state that will always grant asylum to any Jew at any time,” said Smiley.
The spiritual connection to Israel that many Jews feel is very important, said Hundert.
“[Israel is] the manifestation of the collective soul of the Jewish people,” he said. “It is a tribal connection [sharing] the same symbols, families, [and] experiences.”
Caplan echoed the importance of Israel to Jews.
“A personal connection to Israel is very enriching for Jewish identity,” said Caplan, “and those who do not have it are missing an opportunity.”
Smiley pointed out that Israel’s controversial military actions can complicate diaspora connections to the country.
“I don’t think there is an inherent connection between a cultural bond and support of the military,” said Smiley. “There is room for criticism, but more important than criticism is education.”
With the recent mass of hate crimes against Jews around the world, it can be challenging for Jewish people to criticize a country that means so much to their identity.
“The thing is that the language of the opposition is so often so total, so completely rejecting, that it creates a survival instinct in people,” Hundert continued.
Caplan drew a distinction between criticizing Israel and attending a pro-Palestine rally, where some participants may question Israel’s right to exist.
“I do not think that [pro-Palestine rallies are] a great venue for someone who believes there should be a state but is merely unhappy with some of its actions.”
Caplan also said that non-Jewish critiques of Israel are not necessarily anti-Semitic.
“It is not anti-Semitic to criticize Israel’s military action as long as the criticism that you give is one that you would apply equally toward all conflicts,” said Caplan.
“People are angry at the U.S. for the Iraq war; people are angry at the Sudanese government for the genocide in Darfur, but no one questions the right for these countries to exist. Israel is unique in having its existence questioned when some people have trouble with what it does.”
Independent Jewish Voices, Young Jews for Social Justice, and Chabad McGill were unavailable for comment.

2009-02-05,McGill,Israel,"McGill professors support call for Israeli boycott
Prompted by recent events in the Gaza Strip, dozens of McGill professors and employees have signed a petition in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, and an academic boycott of Israeli institutions.
Professors from Concordia University, Université de Quebec À Montreal, Université de Montreal, and numerous other postsecondary institutions in Quebec have also signed the document.
The petition, published last Saturday in Le Devoir, was compiled in response to a January 22 call by the Palestinian Federation of Unions of University Professors and Employees urging academics world-wide to denounce the Israeli occupation and its repeated violations of international law.
Many of the petition’s signatories expressed exasperation with Israeli policies, including the continued blockade of Gaza. They felt boycotts could be a peaceful way of pressuring the Israeli government to comply with international law.
“What else is there?” asked McGill professor and signatory Abby Lippman. “The UN has provided resolutions; Israel hasn’t listened. The world has condemned what’s been done; Israel hasn’t listened. This is a peaceful way of saying ‘No.’”
Adrienne Hurley, another McGill professor, supported the petition because of Israeli air strikes on Palestinian- and United Nations-sponsored schools, and an Israeli ban on reporters, researchers, and aid workers to the Gaza Strip.
“To me, it’s very important to send the message that this is not acceptable, that knowledge is important,” she said.
The academic boycott, perhaps the most controversial aspect of the campaign, seeks to isolate Israeli universities on the international scene. According to the BDS website, such institutions help maintain the intellectual theories and justifications that underpin the occupation and Israeli policies of discrimination.
Lippman said the initiative is not directed at individual Israeli scholars. She noted, though, that the boycott would prevent McGill from partnering with Israeli universities, or collaborating on research projects.
McGill Professor Wael Hallaq felt that Israeli academics have a moral responsibility to speak out against the state’s treatment of the Palestinian population.
“Academics are a little more detached from the world of politics. Israeli scholars…are the only group of scholars in the world that I know that serve in the army systematically. And at the same time they are scholars. They can make a difference,” Hallaq explained. They can, for example, become refuseniks. They can criticize; they are in powerful positions. They are also judges…. They are in government committees…. They can work from the inside…. If they cannot do this much then all of us are in trouble.”
Launched in 2005, BDS is modelled after a campaign applied to apartheid-era South Africa, and is supported by more than 170 Palestinian organizations. It attempts to pressure the Israeli government to end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and to dismantle the Separation Barrier. The campaign also calls on Israel to recognize the rights of Palestinian-Israelis, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
Support for the BDS initiative has gained ground in Quebec. In June, L’Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante (ASSÉ), a student union representing over 42,000 students, voted to actively endorse the campaign. The Federation National des Enseignants et Enseignantes du Quebec (FNEEQ-CSN) has also voted to support the boycott.

2009-02-19,McGill,Israel,"Reporting independently from the frontlines of war is an increasingly rare engagement for journalists working for major international media outlets. From Iraq to Afghanistan, reporters are increasingly embedded in advancing western forces on the front lines, making it challenging to maintain an independent voice.
When Israeli military forces launched an invasion into the Gaza Strip, international journalists were barred entry into the territory by the Israeli government. Major international media outlets, including CNN and the BBC, reported on Gaza from hilltops in Israeli controlled territory, kilometres away from the actual conflict.
Reporting from the Middle East, British journalist Robert Fisk has offered decades of fiercely independent accounts of the region’s conflicts. Stationed in Beirut, Lebanon, Fisk reports for the U.K.-based Independent newspaper, which has a large global distribution. Fish spoke recently with local journalist Stefan Christoff, offering comments on the media response to the recent war in the Gaza Strip.
The McGill Daily: Historical context is often not included in daily reporting on the Middle East. Could you offer some historical perspectives to the recent war in Gaza?
Robert Fisk: In 1948, when the Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes – 750,000 is the figure widely accepted – those in the north, in the Galilee area of what became Israel, fled into Lebanon; those in the Jerusalem area fled east toward what we now call the West Bank; those in the south of what became Israel fled south into what we now call the Gaza Strip.
For example, in 2000, after the Israelis finished their final withdrawal after 22 years of occupation [in Lebanon] and went across the border back into Israel, many Palestinians in Lebanon went down to the border and looked across, not because they were looking at northern Israel but because they were looking at the northern part of Palestine as they had known it. Some could actually see the villages that their parents or grandparents had come from in 1948.
So there is this whole Diaspora around the state of Israel who can’t go home because our home is on the other side of the border, and this reality revolves around the whole issue of United Nations General Assembly resolution 194 on the right of return, [which stipulates that] these Palestinian refugees have the right to return to their homes.
Well over half of the people living in Gaza are families, either survivors or descendants of Palestinians, who lived only ten or 12 miles in what today is Israel. So when you hear the Israelis say “the terrorists are firing rockets into Israel,” the Palestinians in Gaza can in many cases say “well my grandson is firing a rocket at my town because before 1948, these areas would have been Palestinian property.”
MD: What were your perceptions on media coverage during the latest war in Gaza?
RF: The international press allowed for their own humiliation: Israel told the press that they couldn’t go into Gaza and they didn’t really try to, so the press sat outside Gaza and pontificated from two miles away. Israel wanted to keep the international press out of Gaza and they were kept out; that was that.
It is instructive to note that no major western media outlet had a reporter based inside Gaza who would have been there when it started. Clearly after the kidnapping of a BBC reporter, who was based in Gaza, it is not surprising that the international news agencies were hesitant to base reporters in Gaza. However, it is also instructive to note that it was the Hamas government that had the BBC reporter released, which is not often mentioned now.
Faced with the fact that the only journalists left inside Gaza were Palestinian reporters, the major networks were forced to hand over their reporting to Palestinian Arabs, who in many cases were refugees inside Gaza.
This meant that you had Palestinian reporters on the ground talking about their own people, unencumbered by western reporters cross-questioning them, or trying to put 50 per cent of the story on one side and 50 per cent of the story on the other side.
Al-Jazeera came out as the heroes of journalism because they had both their international service, their English service, and also their Arabic service fully operational from offices inside Gaza.
Individual Palestinians working for western news organizations showed that they could be competent journalists and the western journalists who sat outside Gaza looked as pathetic as their reporting on the Middle East is becoming.
Palestinian reporters were telling their own stories.  In the case [of the Independent], our Palestinian reporter inside Gaza had his father killed in an air strike – his father who was a pro-Palestinian Authority, English-speaking, well-educated judge, killed in his orchard. So the Independent had on our front page, this terrible and tragic story of this innocent man destroyed, atomized into pieces of flesh by an Israel air strike in his orchard, a story reported by his own son in our newspaper.
So this was the kind of journalism from Palestine that we hadn’t seen in the major [western] press, so there was an upside to the [international] press being banned from Gaza. However, the work of the international reporters was truly pathetic.

2009-03-05,McGill,Israel,"University threatens expulsion, citing violation of Ontario human rights code
Two protests and a letter campaign followed an early February decision by Carleton University’s Equity Services to ban a poster depicting an Israeli aircraft firing a missile at a Palestinian child holding a teddy bear.
The Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) Carleton chapter – who circulated their organization’s poster to promote Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) – were not informed of the ban until they realized all 100 copies had been taken down, according to Jessica Carpinone, a member of SAIA Carleton and the student who dealt with the administration on the issue.
SAIA quickly emailed Equity Services, demanding an explanation for the ban. Equity Services emailed an official statement, claiming that the poster infringed on Ontario’s Human Rights Code and Carleton’s Human Rights policies. The email also suggested that the posters could incite violence and fear on Carleton’s campus.
“Equity Services made their decision about the International IAW posters without giving SAIA any opportunity to discuss the event it was sponsoring or defend the graphic it depicted,” Carpinone said.
The SAIA later organised a protest, pressuring the administration to lift the ban and challenging their decision.
“We took it upon ourselves to tell students what the administration was up to,” Carpinone said.
About 80 Carleton students protested outside the administration offices, shouting, “Shame on you, lift the ban, stop campus repression.” About 40 others protested at Ottawa University, where the same poster was banned.
On February 12, Carleton’s Interim Provost and Vice-President  Feridun Hamdullahpur sent a letter to the university’s community stating that the poster was “received by many as hurtful and discriminatory to some students on campus.” He hoped campus would “remain an entirely respectful one.”
Carpinone felt the letter was threatening since it also stated that students who infringe on Carleton’s Human Rights Policy face expulsion.
“[SAIA isn’t] creating the climate of fear,” Carpinone stated, “If people are offended by the truth, they should be doing something to change the truth.”
Following SAIA’s call for “letters of support,” 200 statements from the Carleton community landed in the Equity Services Office. The university’s president, Roseann O’Reilly Runte, issued a response following the barrage of letters, reiterating that the poster “did not have the necessary approval for posting and could incite infringements of the Ontario Human Rights Code.”
Runte felt the posters did not contain specific enough information on events planned at Carleton – a statement contested by the SAIA – and stressed that they were not banning IAW events. She suggested the SAIA submit alternative posters for approval – as long as they met the Carleton Human Rights Code
The ban had both positive and negative effects on the SAIA Carleton chapter, according to Carpinone, who said that while the conflict drew attention to IAW, it also forced the organization to redirect its efforts away from planning the week’s events.

2009-03-05,McGill,Israel,"Robert Fisk challenged Canada’s involvement in Afghanistan and the Middle East
Acclaimed journalist Robert Fisk’s writing confronts the reality of war in the Middle East head-on. Now, as the situation in the region is becoming increasingly dangerous, Fisk practices what he calls “mouse journalism.” He often only has 20 safe seconds to observe the chaos and bodies between bombs.
At a sold-out lecture at Concordia University on February 19, Fisk argued that journalists must go beyond impartiality when reporting on conflict – a rule which he believes should apply only to football matches.
“Whether it is the slave trade or Nazi extermination camps, we must talk about the dead and the survivors. If you see any atrocity you should be revolted by it,” stated Fisk.
Fisk has built a reputation as one of the most honest and authoritative voices on the Middle East in media today, with 30 years of experience living and working in the region as a foreign correspondent for The Independent. Thursday’s lecture, “Canada and the Middle East Wars,” discussed the role of media in wartime and the deteriorating quality of Canadian coverage.
Fisk criticized the National Post’s coverage of the conflict, which called the Israeli offensive an “effective” and “surgical” maneuver and described the opposition as “crying” that Israel’s actions were an unequal response. He also questioned how news media could remain impartial when the death count was utterly disproportionate.
According to Fisk, the Globe and Mail’s coverage drew overly sensationalized parallels between the Middle East and Canada to drive the conflict home. The newspaper compared Israel’s situation with fictional scenarios of militants in Richmond, B.C launching rockets at Vancouver, and militants in Outremont firing rockets onto Montreal street corners.
While Fisk jokingly asked the audience whether there was something unusual about Outremont, something that he didn’t know about Montreal,  he used this example to question what is now considered acceptable reporting.
“When you have people making such statements, it is just childishness. These are simple arguments, and simple arguments are easy to repeat. And that this same wording appeared in newspapers across Canada, surely someone is pushing the button,” Fisk said in an interview with The Daily.
Fisk’s demand for critical and honest reporting resonated deeply with many audience members.
“If you want to have credibility on these issues you need to report the ugly truth,” commented Christina Xydous, a Montreal resident. “What Fisk brought home in this lecture is the idea that there are no sacred cows. We need to ask the tough questions. There can be no other loyalties beside a loyalty to the truth and to those who suffer.”
A representative from Echec a la Guerre Montreal who introduced Fisk placed the lecture in a Canadian context, “We’ve been at war for seven years. We have not seen images of war, who Canadians are aiming at, and there are no interviews with the victims. We don’t hear any true war stories in our country.”
Even stories of Canadian soldiers are no longer considered newsworthy. “We don’t even see photographs of Canadians being buried,” Fisk said. “I was on a plane to Ottawa when the first Canadian woman soldier was killed. When she was buried at the military cemetery the story was on page six when it should have been on page one.”
With Canada’s engagement in Afghanistan, however, set to continue until at least 2011, Fisk said Canadians and their journalists need to start asking the questions that count.
“Did you know that there was a famine in Afghanistan? Instead of 7,000 more troops we need 7,000 more doctors?,” he asked. “Why is the army in Afghanistan? My experience when there has been a war that has been going on for awhile is that people forget why they are fighting it. Nobody remembers why we invaded Iraq. Nobody remembers why we are in Afghanistan. How long can we keep doing this?
“You don’t see what I see. If you saw what I saw in Iraq and Afghanistan you would not support military engagement anywhere.”
In fact, Fisk asserts that Western military engagement must come to an end. “These countries do not belong to us. We should leave. People ask for justice that we do not intend to give them. No more soldiers. Enough.”

2009-03-09,McGill,Israel,"ANC minister Ronnie Kasrils examines Israel with South Africa in mind for McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week
The Daily caught up with former African National Congress (ANC) Minister Ronnie Kasrils  on his way to his keynote speech for McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week. to discuss what South African apartheid can teach the world about Gaza.
Of Jewish Lithuanian descent, Kasrils was born in Johannesburg and was a founding member of the ANC’s military wing. He worked as Chief of Military Intelligence for the ANC while exiled to neighbouring African countries and was later involved in South African politics as Deputy Minister of Defence.
McGill Daily: There was a recent petition that was signed by 500 prominent Israelis calling upon the international community to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) for Palestine campaign…. Could you comment on the state of anti-apartheid activism in Israel?
Ronnie Kasrils: I think that the fact that there are 500 courageous enough to come out in support of BDS is fantastic. It’s almost treasonable in Israel… and 500 is a very significant number.
There were times when there were far less than 500 South African whites who were prepared to stand up and side with the liberation movement. [But] it’s not just the number; it’s the symbolism.
It’s the fact that [Israelis who support BDS] are breaking with the orthodoxy of the state and the doctrine which basically says with an exclusivist state, that if you’re white or if you’re Jewish then the only way we can all survive is by standing together. So those whites who broke with that in South Africa really challenged the essence of racism and apartheid. The same thing is happening in Israel.
MD: How do you feel about comparisons between the ANC and Hamas? And in the face of the reality of the gross asymmetries when it comes to armed conflict in Israel-Palestine, do you think that the ramifications of Hamas’s militant policies need to affect the way in which its leaders are engaged in the international stage?
RK: I’ve met with Hamas leaders, and we’ve had very interesting, useful discussions. They’re very interested in our experience, our strategy of winning over whites in South Africa, They are very interested in [winning over Jews in Israel] and they began to see quite frankly that using indiscriminate violence against civilians is counter-productive. We might not endorse some of the methods they use but Hamas has stopped suicide bombings…
These are people who are patriots, who are serious, who are human beings and shouldn’t be demonized. If you want to solve a problem in the end, it’s not your friends that you negotiate with, it’s your enemies.
And Israel has not taken the opportunity of getting together to resolve these problems and why? Because of the Zionist doctrine, they are not interested in negotiation. They want the entire land of the British Mandate to themselves, that’s the reason.
MD: In the case of South Africa, the end of apartheid meant integration and liberation for blacks: living in the same country under the same rights. What tack do you take in the Palestinian solidarity struggle vis-à-vis the one-state versus the two-state solution?
RK: With South Africa, right from an early time of the struggle we made it very clear that we were talking about the liberation of the whole country and the unity state in which all our people would be equal citizens. In 1955, [the ANC] came up with this blueprint for a free South Africa and it starts in the preamble, “We South Africans, together we say that South Africa belongs to all the people who live in it, black and white, as equal citizens.”
But when you look at Palestine, it’s not for us to decide for the Palestinians, or for the Jews living in the former British Mandate Palestine, how to struggle, or what the objective should be. We want to support a whole movement which is for justice, which is for equality of people and so on.
Up until the late eighties the Palestine Liberation Organization talked about one state…. But when [Yasser] Arafat went into Oslo from the Madrid talks and stated that they would settle for a two-state solution along the lines of the pre-1967 borders, it wasn’t for us to argue with that. We supported that.
But of course what’s happened since Oslo in terms of the two states has greatly undermined it. Israel has moved against the idea of real contiguity and sovereignty.
[Palestinian] territory is shrinking because the illegal settlements have been expanding over time no matter which party is in power. So from that point of view, [the two-state solution] needs to be reconsidered.
MD: If we look at the BDS campaign, designed as it is as more or less a blanket boycott of Israeli goods, industry, academics, do you fear that the majority of the Israeli public will be alienated by it?
RK: I think you’ll find [Israeli support for the boycotts] narrow when they are appalled and they will react with anger. [Support] in turn [widen].
In South Africa, initially, [whites] were affronted by this and asked “how dare these people challenge us this way? They’re crazy, they don’t understand.” But in time it opens people’s eyes, as you sustain such pressure.
So in 1959 when the international boycott started, the support was very narrow, but by 1989 huge numbers of whites were actually joining these anti-apartheid protests. They were tired of finding themselves treated like lepers in the world, seeing their sports teams being jeered at internationally, the life lines cut off for their trade, for their cultural exchanges. For the academics it all came home to roost; for the business people, it was biting their pockets.

2009-03-23,McGill,Israel,"Some questions for the provoking profs
Re: “Boycotting profs have it all wrong” | Commentary | March 9
We initially hesitated to reply to the provocation issued by Professors Van den Berg, Waller, and Weinfeld because their reference to those who disagree with them as “the BDS gang” or “BDS crew” seems not only disingenuous and disrespectful, but also calculated to foreclose on genuine dialogue and honest intellectual exchange. In fact, it is difficult to understand why those of us who support non-violent resistance would be characterized as a “PR branch of Hamas, Hezbollah and their patron Iran.” Such a characterization of our position short-circuits a rational discussion and would appear to be an attempt to obfuscate the basic issues.
However, we do want briefly to clarify a few major points.
We support an academic boycott of Israeli universities because these institutions are integral to establishing and maintaining systemic and institutionalized violations of basic human rights as spelled out in international laws, protocols, and conventions. We support an academic boycott because it is a non-violent form of resistance to ongoing institutionalized violations of human rights and offers a powerful alternative to violent resistance.
To open a genuine dialogue, and because we would like a clearer understanding of the position of Professors Van den Berg, Waller, and Weinfeld – which can be seen as laying the blame for oppression on the oppressed – we would like to pose a series of questions for their response. Do they believe that an entire people forfeits its basic human rights if some of its members engage in violent resistance to military occupation and exploitation?  Do they argue that Palestinians cannot be treated as legally human until violence ceases?  Do they propose an unconditional surrender of Palestinians to Israel as a precondition for Palestinians to enjoy basic human rights?
We look forward to reading their answers.

Re: “Right our wrong over Iraq” | Commentary | February 16
I found your article well-researched and an excellent analysis of the current situation. I have often found myself deluged by the “hacks” you describe who offer their half-wit opinions on Iraq. Many of these so-called “experts” often state that the Iraq adventure was a foolhardy endeavour, where the chance for any sort of success has long since passed. Furthermore, the evidence  to back up their quackery and opinions are often only based on what they have seen on the ground (or endured while fighting, in the case of soldiers), and lack the insight and understanding that is available to you as a McGill U1 Arts student.
Now I am the first to admit that I was one of those who opposed the Iraq war on the grounds that there was no reason to invade a sovereign state that had not directly threatened the U.S. However, now I realize the error of my ways and must concede that you are correct: the war is well on its way to being a success.  I now realize that I failed to consider the following markers of success:
(1) Over 4,000 U.S. military deaths since the war began (the majority of which have come after President Bush declared an end to combat operations), and thousands more injured.
(2) Over 100,000 Iraqi citizens killed (according to The Lancet).
(3) An estimated cost of $100 million a day (money far better spent on a war than on alleviating the current financial crisis, fighting diseases, developing clean energy, or aiding the world’s poor).
So, with all this in mind I urge you to keep up the good work, and I wish you the same level success in journalism as those we are currently seeing in Iraq.

Sorry for using you
Re: “I understand why AUS needs French translation” | Letters | March 16
Maya Frieser:
For having mentioned you and Mr. Louis-Michel Gauthier without reflecting on how you would react, I apologize. I should have thought of the people I was using as a pretext.
In response to your three points:
The article was in fact directed not at you and Mr. Gauthier, but rather at the general public, in order to raise the profile of translation, for I believe that it is a widely misunderstood practice, especially in the anglophone community. You did indeed ask me for directions on where to obtain a good translator; for writing as though you had not, I apologize once again. I ought not to have used you and Mr. Gauthier as an excuse to write my little FAQ; you both clearly know the value of translation.
However, though it’s true that francophones generally have a more acute linguistic consciousness than anglophones, I must draw your attention to the very low profile of the French language and literature department, not only at McGill, but in the entire province. The department’s low visibility is a frequent topic of discussion at departmental meetings. An illustrative anecdote: some of my colleagues at the Commission des affaires francophones (CAF) did not know of the department, nor of its translation program, until I joined the CAF in January. (That was my impression, at least.) Merely speaking French as one’s mother tongue does not guarantee knowledge of a French department at a prestigious anglo institution.
As for your third point: touché. Well played, Ms Frieser, well played indeed. And merci à vous, for having called me to order.

Dead votes don’t count
Re: “I demand that you take a stand” | Letters | March 12
In a recent letter to the editor, Daily columnist Ricky Kreitner asked me to clarify whether or not I think the Iraqis and Kurds are worse off due to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
Kreitner may be aware of the results of a public opinion poll released by the British company ORB last March, which indicated that more than half of Iraqis (51 per cent) prefer their life today over life under Saddam Hussein (22 per cent).
But even if the following point is obvious, it deserves emphasis: dead people cannot respond to opinion polls. A callous observer may dismiss the astronomical civilian death tolls in Iraq by adapting the Cold War slogan “Better dead than red” to the 21st century under Saddam Hussein. However, I maintain that the human cost of this war has been unacceptable.
We should not ignore those who see a better life beyond the rubble. These survivors may be better off for the invasion. But neither should we ignore the chance that a better life could be achieved without following some “decider” headlong into carnage.

Ghetto kids are little shits
Posted on mcgilldaily.com
I lived in the McGill Ghetto for 12 years and endured ongoing disturbances and vandalism from McGill students every weekend and more. My old car was vandalized about seven times over the course of three to four years, to the point where this driver, with 30 years’ experience and no responsibility for any accident, is now uninsurable. I recently moved to the other side of the campus, at Sherbrooke and Drummond. I picked up my new car yesterday and am writing to thank the screaming McGill shits who ripped off my side-view mirror last night, less than 24 hours after I took possession of my new car. I studied at McGill and earned an MBA (I didn’t trash anyone’s things back then). I make enough money to make generous donations to the school, but you know what? I’ll fix my car instead and keep the rest for a worthy group. It is depressing to think that McGill is educating the leaders of tomorrow. McGill’s tolerance for the disturbances caused around its campus is incredibly hypocritical, as if nothing could be done to control the vandals. I can hear the counter argument now: how do you know it was McGill? Gna gna gna… Let’s not act too surprised when these self-entitled little people continue to cheat and steal once they reach the job market; we will have given them the license to do it all.

2009-03-26,McGill,Israel,"Bassem Eid is a Palestinian journalist and Executive Director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) – an independent organization founded in 1996 that provides impartial documentation of human rights violations by Palestinian political factions. PHRMG monitors Hamas, the militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, as well as its rival Fatah, which controls the West Bank and maintains a much closer relationship with Western governments. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both frequently draw information from PHRMG reports. Eid was awarded the Litvack Award by McGill in 1996, and has returned to Montreal to deliver a speech on human rights at the McGill Law Faculty tomorrow. The Daily caught up with Eid to get details on the Hamas-Fatah rivalry, the isolation of Gaza, and honour killings in Palestine.
McGill Daily: In your talk on Friday, the press release said you will discuss human rights violations by Fatah and Hamas. What have the recent trends been?
Bassem Eid:  The human rights record is very disturbing from both sides – Hamas or Fatah. When Hamas starts arresting Fatah people in Gaza, immediately Fatah in the West Bank starts arresting Hamas. When a Fatah prisoner in Gaza dies as a result of torture in Gaza, immediately the security forces in the West Bank start torturing someone to bring them to their death. The quality and quantity of human rights violations is equal on Fatah and Hamas sides. While Israel is bombing, shelling, and killing in Gaza, there are still armed gangsters from Hamas running after Fatah members, to kill them [as] so-called collaborators. Unfortunately the international community today [speaks much more] about Hamas human rights violations rather than Fatah.
MD: The PHRMG has many programs to monitor human rights – but what does the day-to-day fieldwork involve?
BE: For over a year and a half, Hamas has ruled Gaza. We really don’t have access to some information, especially when we are talking about honour killings, which is a very wide phenomenon in the Gaza Strip – even more than in the West Bank. We have another phenomenon: the killing of suspected collaborators in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas police. It becomes very difficult to investigate all these incidents. Sometimes besides the name and age of the person and date of death, we have no information.
MD: What about your experiences in the field? Have they been tedious or draining?
BE: To create human rights under this regime is not so easy…especially [because] the Arab government looks at human rights activists sometimes as spies, or [thinks] that they are in touch with the enemy…. The response is just to defame, to slander the organization rather than to give facts on what the report is talking about. We know about Syrian human rights activists who [have spent] almost over seven years in jail. In January 1996, I was arrested by Arafat’s order, but I was so lucky. I spent only 25 hours in jail.
MD: Why are there more honour killings in Gaza than in the West Bank?
BE: I think the West Bank is much more educated than the Gaza Strip. The West Bankers –  I consider them a multicultural people. A lot of foreigners are in touch with [them]. More West Bankers are travelling for education in Western countries. That’s [reflected] in their mentality, [and their] culture.  The most important thing is that in the West Bank people are less and less religious.
[For instance], a very courageous initiative began recently to put out a report on Palestinian gays and lesbians – which is not an easy step, because these things are completely prohibited by Islam. We started investigating this phenomenon mainly in the West Bank, but we couldn’t speak about it in the Gaza Strip. [Homosexuality] happens completely secretly within Palestinian society, so we are unable right now to [show] examples [of what] gay people or lesbians think about society, the laws.
MD: I read that the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to meet Israeli security demands has led them to illegally detain many of their own people. Can you comment on that?
BE:  The problem is that the international community tries to put more and more pressure on the PA [to increase] security – and security means that anything related to security must be coordinated with the Israelis. Now what does this mean? Sometimes they are much [better than Palestinians] at collecting secret information, that X is committing a suicide in Nablus. Now Israel doesn’t  want to invade Nablus, so they inform the PA, and they bring them to jail. As a human rights activist, I probably can live with that because I don’t want people to commit suicide, but on other side, what I am against is how they keep these people sometimes for months, years, without investigation, a fair trial, or without any judgement. Our problem is the lack of justice which is implemented by PA on the political detainees.
MD: You’ve written about a “one state” solution. Do you support it?
BE: I never supported it because I don’t think Israelis will agree on it. Israel is seeking a Jewish state, so with a one state solution, Israel [would] kill its dream. But Israel also refuses to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders, so what is the solution?…. I don’t believe in [the one state solution], but it looks like [over] the years it [has become] the only solution between Israel and Palestine.
MD: What will you discuss at your talk tomorrow?
BE: The Palestinian judicial system, and how it has to be reformed. Two years ago we received a fund for a proposal [to reform] the Palestinian judicial system from Japan. We conducted 12 different workshops in the West Bank, with law students from different universities, retired judges,  lawyers, and even some people from the security forces. People [are] very angry  [with] the Palestinian judicial system for one reason: this judicial system, which used to be an independent system, hasn’t really [been] independent under the PA. This is a problem, because rule of law will never be implemented without an independent judiciary system.
Bassem Eid will speak tomorrow from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Chancellor Day Hall, 3644 Rue Peel. A light lunch will be served.

2009-03-30,McGill,Israel,"Students booted by associate dean for silent protest
Peaceful pro-Israel protesters were expelled from the Law Building on March 17 by Associate Dean at McGill’s Faculty of Law David Lametti for silently campaigning against a photo exhibit meant to evoke sympathy for the violence faced by the Palestinians.
Following the demonstration, a distraught law student sent a letter to National Post commentator Jonathan Kay. The letter sparked claims of human rights violations at the University and a heated debate about the statements posted.
That a group of non-law students peacefully demonstrating in the atrium of the law building alongside a display hosted by the organizers of Palestinian Human Rights Week (PHRW) were kicked out of the building was troubling and a violation of freedom of expression, the letter stated.
“They did not attempt to obscure the visibility of these exhibits,” wrote the first letter writer. “Rather, by standing between them and holding their own posters, they were offering a visual rebuttal to the official faculty-approved message.”
Arieh Bloom, U3 Commerce, and President of Republicans Abroad at McGill, organized the counter demonstration, which was intended to present a balanced and alternative, yet peaceful perspective to the pro-Palestinian display.
“We were kicked out on [the] ground that the demonstration would prevent freedom of dialogue,” Bloom said. “That should have meant that we were doing something egregious and terribly unacceptable.”
Halfway through the planned two-hour demonstration Lametti requested that the 14 undergraduates leave on the basis that they were creating a hostile environment and were not law students, among other offences.
The first letter Kay posted describes one photo as depicting two dead Palestinian children killed in an Israeli Defense Forces operation, with excerpts from the Geneva Convention and short articles deploring the plight of Palestinians hung next to many of the photos.
The display was one of many campus events that contributed to an unbalanced treatment of Gaza, Bloom said. He said that there has been a failure in dialogue and that some groups – he cited those with both Arab and Jewish affiliations – were attacking Israel.
Bloom, who had consulted a lawyer before the counter demonstration, was certain that none of the signs he was showing were hateful. While he described the signs as teaching peace, love and toleration, some did portray violence.
One placard depicted a child dressed in green Hamas gear holding a machine gun. Beside the baby sat the slogan: “Teach love, peace, and toleration – not war.”
The idea, he stressed, was that passersby would see the pictures from both causes and be able to make an informed and balanced judgment.
“It would have taken away all legitimacy of our protest if we were trying to censor. We would have been hypocrites and it was totally against what we stand for,” Bloom said.
Bloom is now seeking amicable remedy with the dean on the account that their right to assemble was violated.
“I don’t think [Associate Dean Lametti] did what he did because of anti-Semitism. I think it was just poor judgment,” said Bloom. “What I most don’t understand is how does a law school – meant to be the paradigm of human rights – how do they not even respect the free rights of students who want to foster dialogue of human rights on campus?
“The contradiction of human rights is appalling.”
The associate dean and organizers of PHRW were unavailable for comment.

2009-04-06,McGill,Israel,"Government claims Galloway is a national threat
The government of Canada has banned the British Parliamentarian (MP) and anti-war activist George Galloway from entering Canada on the grounds that he poses a threat to national security.
The MP had been slated for a speaking tour, which included an appearance at Concordia on April 1.
However, Galloway was able to speak at Concordia’s Hall building  via videolink from New York. He began by sardonically thanking the Stephen Harper and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney for bringing more attention to his speeches in Canada than he would have received otherwise.
“Because of their efforts to stifle dissent, far more people have attended these lectures than they otherwise would have,” Galloway said.
Galloway also announced his intention to pursue legal action against Bernie Farber, the head of the Canadian Jewish Congress, as well as Canadian broadcaster CTV, for airing an interview with Farber in which he asserted that Galloway is a supporter of terrorism.
“There’s enough that I say for you to criticize me, but you cannot lie about me,” he said. “I am not a supporter of Hamas, but I am a supporter of the right of the Palestinian people to resist the occupation that has destroyed their country. That might make me controversial in Canada, but it does not make me a terrorist.”
Galloway recently visited Gaza in order to deliver medical supplies, as well as $45,000, to the Hamas-led government of Gaza. Alykhan Velshi, a spokesperson for Kenney, stated that Galloway has been banned for violating the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which stipulates that supporters of terrorist organizations may not be permitted into Canada.
Galloway contended that the attempt to criminalize those who support the Palestinian cause is at the heart of the anti-war struggle.He ended his speech by calling for a binational state in which both Israelis and Palestinians would be granted equal human and civil rights.
“There’s no place for white states or Jewish states or black states in the 21st century. There is only a place for democratic states in which every man and woman is treated as equal,” Galloway said.
Laith Marouf, a member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) who was involved in organizing Galloway’s visit, saw the Canadian government’s decision as a violation of free speech.
“This is part of a pattern that we’ve seen clearly for the past three months from the Conservative government,” Marouf said, pointing to the Canadian government’s criticism of Israeli Apartheid Week and its funding cuts to the Canadian Arab Federation. “This attack on Galloway’s freedom of speech is part of that. It’s an attempt to silence all those who criticize the Israeli government and the Canadian government’s policies in the Middle East.”
In response to the ban, SPHR filed an emergency injunction in federal court, claiming that the allegations that Galloway posed a threat to national security were entirely based on hearsay. Though SPHR’s concerns were recognized by the court, the presiding judge, Justice Luc Martineau, refused to overturn the Immigration Ministry’s decision.
“Because we were going to broadcast Mr. Galloway to the lecture halls, the judge found that there wasn’t enough harm done by the ban to overturn the government’s decision,” said Marouf.
Alykhan Velshi could not be reached for comment.

2009-08-17,McGill,Israel,"More than 50 Montrealers braved the chill last night at a downtown vigil in support of the people of the Gaza Strip, who are suffering under an Israeli blockade that has severely restricted their access to food, water, fuel, and electricity.
Held on Ste. Catherine Street across from the Bay, the candlelit vigil brought in supporters from a range of organizations calling for the end of the Gaza blockade, and for Canada to put pressure on the Israeli government.
“It’s very cold here, but it’s nothing compared to what the people in Gaza are going through right now,” said Mohamed Kamel, a member of the Canadian Muslim Forum, to the small crowd.
Last Wednesday, Israel launched military incursions into Gaza and on Thursday imposed an embargo, saying it was punishment for rockets fired over the border by Palestinian militants.
John Dugard, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian Territories, last week called the Israeli military operations war crimes that violated the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law. In September 2007, Israeli declared Gaza a “hostile entity” and has threatened a full-scale invasion.
Israel eased the blockade on Tuesday to allow some delivery of goods, but quickly strengthened it again. Yesterday, tens of thousands of Gaza residents flooded into Egypt to buy food and fuel after Palestinian militants breached the border walls.
“Gaza, it’s a prison… People cannot go out of it, they cannot fly in or out,” said Jean Gravend, a member of Palestinians and Jews United at the Montreal demonstration.
The European Union and many Arab countries have condemned the blockade, warning that it is hastening a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The European external relations commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said the Israeli actions constitute “collective punishment.”
At yesterday’s demonstration, Gravend and others called for Canada to also condemn Israel’s actions.
“We are an accomplice if we do not protest and try to change things,” Gravend said.
Feroz Mehdi, a member of Alternatives International, said grassroots actions such as the vigil were crucial for disseminating information, and for pushing the Canadian government to act.
“We have to impress upon the Canadian government that it’s got to get its act together, and call this a humanitarian crisis,” Mehdi said. “There are 1.4 million people in Gaza. These people are not terrorists; they’re ordinary people trying to live.”
Israeli military operations since last week have killed 40 Palestinians, at least 10 of them civilians. Palestinian militants killed an Ecuadorian kibbutz volunteer last week.
A coalition of various Palestinian groups organized the event, including the Coalition for Peace and Justice in Palestine, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, Palestinians and Jews United, and Alternatives.
Also at the vigil were members of the Confederation des syndicats nationaux (CSN), Quebec’s largest trade union, and CEGEP teachers.
Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and other groups are planning a larger demonstration for tomorrow, starting at 2 p.m. at Concordia’s Hall Building.

2009-10-01,McGill,Israel,"Superior Court Justice rules that Bil’in land dispute should be heard in Israel
On September 18, the Superior Court of Quebec dismissed a lawsuit brought against two Quebec-registered companies by the West Bank village of Bil’in. This lawsuit claimed that the two companies were complicit in Israeli war crimes.
In this first ever application of Canada’s War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Act to a civil case, Justice Louis-Paul Cullen’s judgment stated that it “would clearly be more practical to try the action in Israel rather than in Quebec.”
He also stated that the plaintiffs, the Bil’in Village Council, had not presented sufficient evidence to suggest that the case could not be heard in Israel in a fair and impartial manner.
The two Montreal-based companies, Green Park International Inc. and Green Mount International Inc., are both based in Montreal, and have been contracted to construct high-rise apartment buildings and houses in the Israeli settlement of Modi’in Illit, which is adjacent to the village of Bil’in.
The Bil’in Village Council disputes the companies’ claim to the land and insists that the construction of the settlement, as well as the surrounding security barrier, have cut them off from the bulk of their farmlands and olive groves.
Mark Arnold, the attorney who represented the Bil’in Village Council at the proceedings in mid-June, stated that Cullen’s ruling – a forum non conveniens in legal jargon – was “an error of law.”
“The Quebec Superior Court has jurisdiction over Quebec companies and directors who are residing in Quebec. To suggest that it goes to the Israeli High Court of Justice is simply an error,” said Arnold.
The plaintiffs moreover claimed that the two companies are complicit in Israel’s violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a signatory, and which states that in cases of military occupation, “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.”
“What that means in the Israel-Palestine context,” Arnold said, “is that Israel, the occupier of the West Bank, cannot be removing West Bank population and replacing it with Israeli population. To do so is a war crime.”
He added that Israeli courts have never heard a case based on the Fourth Geneva Convention, and that Cullen’s decision indicated a skewed perception of the Israeli legal system.
“The problem is that [Cullen] is fundamentally wrong. The Israeli High Court of Justice will not hear this case, so he has sent this case into oblivion.”
But despite the Judge’s dismissal of the suit, Arnold said that the Superior Court’s decision to hear a civil cause of action for the commission of a war crime has set an important precedent.
“[The Judge] said in theory you could have a civil claim brought in Quebec for the commission of a war crime. But in this case, he said, the Israeli court is better suited to hear the case,” said Arnold.
Ronald Levy, the attorney representing the two corporations, said that his clients had legitimately acquired the rights to develop the land when they purchased it from another company, which in turn, he said, bought it from its Palestinian proprietor.
Levy added that the two corporations had refused to register their title to the land for fear that the proprietor would be subject to violent attacks from other Palestinians.
“They stopped registration to save the lives of Arabs from whom they purchased land,” Levy said.
Levy refused to comment on the judgment due to the possibility of an appeal, but did state that any future land claims cases brought by the Village Council to the High Court of Justice of Israel “would be, as they have in the past, properly and impartially dealt with.”
Arnold, however, was skeptical of the judgment’s faith that the case would ever be fairly litigated in Israeli court, and added that the Quebec Superior Court was the appropriate venue for such a proceeding.
“The Green Park company has no presence in Israel, it’s not incorporated in Israel, it carries on no business in Israel. And the village of Bil’in has no presence in Israel; it’s located in the West Bank. And the director of the Green Park company, who lives in Quebec, has no connection to Israel,” Arnold said.
The Bil’in Village Council remains in discussion with Arnold on whether to pursue further legal action in Quebec’s Court of Appeals.
Bil’in has garnered increasing attention in the international media since its residents began staging weekly protests against the Israeli military occupation over four years ago. The demonstrations are regularly broken up when the Israeli military fires upon them with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Mohammed Khatib, a member of the Bil’in Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements, visited Canada during the summer to participate in a speaking tour with Arnold. Upon returning to his home in the West Bank, he was imprisoned by Israeli authorities for over a week.
“[The speaking tour] was aiming to mobilize support for the struggle of this village and also in general for the Palestinian popular resistance movement,” local activist and Tadamon! member Stefan Christoff said.
Christoff asserted that the Israeli army has stepped up its nighttime raids on the village in response to the Council’s legal actions.
“It was only after they visited Canada and spoke publicly in Canada across the country to major media – during [which] CBC and the Toronto Star published interviews with Mohammed [Khatib] – that Israeli military forces started [increased] nighttime raids on the village,” Christoff said.

2009-11-12,McGill,Israel,"SPHR-McGill discussion explores options for peace
Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR-McGill) held a panel discussion Tuesday called Israel & Palestine: The Next Step. The panelists included McGill political science professor Rex Brynen, Concordia political science professor Eric Abitbol, and Professor Jim Joyce of John Abbott College. The three professors discussed a variety of obstacles to peace – including ongoing settlement expansion, Israeli monopolization of West Bank water aquifers, and increasing religious fanaticism on both sides of the conflict. The Daily sat down with Abitbol, who specializes in peace studies and global governance, and Joyce, who is also Amnesty International Canada’s Coordinator for Israel and Palestine, to discuss the way forward for both nations.
—————————————-
Interview with Eric Abtibol, Concordia political science professor
McGill Daily: During yesterday’s panel discussion, you mentioned the idea of a conflict ethos existing in Israeli and Palestinian society. What exactly is a conflict ethos in this context?
Eric Abitbol: I would define it as an attachment to a particular interpretation of the conflict, and to a sense of victimization. It is a need for a strong sense of self-sufficiency, unity, and emancipation rooted in exclusivity and collective security, and a sense of delegitimization of the other.
MD: How can Israelis and Palestinians get past this mentality?
EA: By creating relational spaces with one another, in ideology and in practice, that reflect the desire to cultivate cross-boundary relationships, and by constructing, on the level of the imaginaire, a picture of future peace in the region.
MD: What are some of the organizations involved in this process, and what is their potential?
EA: I am particularly inspired by three of these organizations…. These three, specifically, are Friends of the Earth Middle East, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, and the Israel-Palestine Centre for Research and Information.
These organizations, and others like them, situate their efforts on a trans-boundary level. They contribute to constructing a trans-boundary base of knowledge. They work at a grassroots level, and deal with eco-political sustainability as well as peace education. They engage in a relationship of advocacy and lobbying, and do a great deal of intra-civil society work.
They reflect very much the discourse of cultivating a political agenda with the “other” instead of in opposition to the “other,” and as such it can be argued that they are in the process of contributing to the development of a trans-boundary community, incorporating Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians, and others in the region and worldwide. These organizations are doing some of the grassroots and multi-sectoral work that encompasses slowly building a security community.
MD: In what ways can this culture of dialogue enter the mainstream of Israeli and Palestinian civil society and government?
EA: There are many obstacles to making this an effective political movement. In a sense, we can begin by imagining how we may dismantle these obstacles…. There is a lack of inclusive regional civil space. Regional and international funders must attempt to build this.
Other obstacles include separatist visions of peace, militant terrorist attacks, and continued settlement activities.
The issue of leadership in civil society is very important. There are grassroots leaders who are taking risks and trying to facilitate dialogical encounters. We need this leadership to expand to encompass inter-generational work in the spirit of this culture. As well, these trans-boundary communities need to lobby the government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas in order to eliminate specific obstacles.
The transformation of the attitudes and imagination of a society takes place through risk-taking. Individuals need to recognize their participation in political culture, and take the risks of encountering the other, without simply accepting societal frameworks of how to relate to the other, and do this in places that are both comfortable and uncomfortable. People need to set the table for dialogue, and take place in encounters where the table is set by the other, as well. If we can begin to do this, we can begin to transgress some of the material and ideological objects that prevent a culture of dialogue. This culture has the capacity to influence and shape dominant political relationships.

Interview with Jim Joyce, John Abbott College professor and Amnesty International expert
McGill Daily: During the SPHR panel discussion you mentioned the possibility of a “shared Jerusalem” and a more dynamic version of a two-state solution. Can you elaborate?
Jim Joyce: While Amnesty International as a organization will not express views about what are desirable political outcomes, it will continue to comment about such outcomes inasmuch as they are consistent or not with the human rights agenda. The human rights of one individual cannot be founded on the loss of rights of another individual. In the conflict over the final status of Jerusalem, partisans on both sides make maximum claims to the city, exclusive of the other.  Within proposed two-state solutions, there is the assumption of a divided city, perhaps enshrining the green line between West and East Jerusalem.  A third – or fourth – proposal would return to the original conception within UN Resolution 181 of a “shared” city, an international city, open to the citizens of both Israel and Palestine.
MD: Do you think it is more important to be critical of the injustices committed by Hamas and the Israeli government, or to push forward with a purely “relational” approach, as recommended by Eric Abitol?
JJ: Amnesty International, basing its work on a commitment to international human rights standards, understands that Israelis and Palestinians themselves must define and develop the human rights principles that will provide a just and durable foundation for peace.  To account for past human rights violations should be part of the same process. The cycle of violence of the past decades has permitted both sides to justify their next act of violence as a legitimate response to the act of violence of the other side. The Goldstone Report, by calling for both the Government of Israel and the Hamas de facto administration in Gaza to undertake credible, impartial investigations of the possible war crimes committed in Gaza and southern Israel from December 2008 to January 2009, is an important step forward in ending the impunity which has so long fed the cycle of violence.  Peace based upon justice would be served, not hindered, by such a process.
MD: The panel discussions did not touch on the influence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the wider Middle East region. What impact do you think the currently stalled negotiations will have on other countries in the area?
JJ: The State of Israel is not currently recognized by most countries in the region.  Its borders with Lebanon and Syria are not mutually agreed upon.  The territorial integrity of a possible Palestinian state is not determined. In the Madrid Process of the early nineties, the rights of Palestinian refugees were part of the discussion as well as the bilateral relations between countries – Lebanon-Israel, Syria-Israel, as well as the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.  In all subsequent bilateral Palestinian-Israeli talks, the concerns about Palestinian refugees have been pushed to the side, and no agreement has been reached.  Canada undertook within the Madrid Process responsibility for guiding possible outcomes on the refugee issue – and made considerable progress on possible mechanisms.  This work was put on the back burner when the Oslo Process became the only game in town.  Oh yes, the Israelis and Jordanians did achieve mutual recognition after the Madrid Process.  The ongoing “peace process” between Israelis and Palestinians will continue to flounder until it is located in a truly and fully regional context.

2009-11-19,McGill,Israel,"A discussion of Abdelrazik’s six-year exile in Sudan, and Canada’s  complicity in his imprisonment and interrogation
Abousfian Abdelrazik is a Sudanese-born Canadian citizen who recently returned to Canada after being stranded in Sudan from 2003 to 2009.
Detained, interrogated, and tortured by Sudanese authorities in Khartoum after being profiled by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Abdelrazik was denied the right to return to Canada by successive governments – a clear violation of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which outlines that “every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada.”
Barred from returning to Canada, Abdelrazik’s six years in exile point to a wider context in which multiple Canadian citizens, including Maher Arar in Syria, faced torture and imprisonment abroad resulting from racial profiling by Canadian and U.S. security and intelligence agencies. In Sudan, Canadian CSIS agents interrogated Abdelrazik in the very same Sudanese prison where Sudanese military officials carried out violent torture against him.
In 2008, he took refuge in the Canadian embassy in Khartoum in coordination with an Ottawa-based legal support team, while a grassroots campaign for Abdelrazik’s return quickly spread to communities across Canada lead by the Montreal-based Project Fly Home.
A solidarity campaign with Abdelrazik quickly developed across Canada to apply pressure on the Conservative government to immediately return Abdelrazik to Canada, culminating in April 2009, when activists purchased a return ticket for Abdelrazik, a condition fixed by the Conservative government in order for emergency travel documents to be issued for Abdelrazik to travel home to Canada. Conservative foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon went back on the previously expressed conditions for Abdelrazik’s return – refusing to issue an emergency passport – a move that led a Federal Court judge to order the government to return Abdelrazik to Canada in a landmark decision in June 2009.
In the Federal Court decision that forced the Conservatives to issue emergency travel documents to Abdelrazik, Judge Russel Zinn described him as a “prisoner in a foreign land” and “as much a victim of international terrorism as the innocent persons whose lives have been taken by recent barbaric acts of terrorists.” Zinn also highlighted the direct involvement of CSIS in Abdelrazik’s arrest, detention, and torture in Sudan.
Today, Abdelrazik continues to struggle for justice, and is calling for his name to be removed from the 1267 UN terror watch list, a list basued not on law but on association and profiling administered by the UN Security Council, to which Abdelrazik was added at the request of the Bush administration without evidence or trial in 2006. Although Abdelrazik has returned to Canada, regular citizenship rights, including social services, education, and health care are not accessible to him due to Canada’s enforcement of the UN 1267 list.
Stefan Christoff:  It was a long struggle to force the Canadian government to respect your right to return to Canada and today your struggle is not over. Can you explain?
Abousfian Abdelrazik: Absolutely. It is not over because still I am on the UN 1267 list. Now it is a huge struggle to fight to be removed from that list as it prevents me from living as a normal person, a normal citizen.
SC: Being on the UN 1267 list means you face a complete asset freeze, barring you from receiving a salary for your work, accessing social assistance or medical care, things that many take for granted in Montreal. Can you explain how the UN 1267 list is impacting your life in Canada despite returning to Canada after exile in Sudan?
AA: Canada’s government should help me to be removed from this list. Actually it is the responsibility for the government in Ottawa to appeal for me to be removed from this list after everything that happened in Sudan.
Although I am back in Montreal, I am not free.  I can walk on the streets in Montreal but it is not possible for me to live a normal life. The 1267 list puts me in another prison. I can’t work and I can’t access health care. Today I continue to face injustice. Canada needs to appeal for me to be de-listed immediately from the UN 1267 list. I want my full human rights.
SC: For many, the fact that CSIS has a direct responsibility to your imprisonment and torture in Sudan is surprising. Throughout your recent speaking tour across Canada, you have spoken very openly on the direct role the CSIS and the government of Canada played in your imprisonment and torture in Sudan. Can you explain?
AA: After my lawyers received government documents on my case, it became totally clear that the Canadian government in Ottawa and CSIS were directly involved in my detention without trial or charge in Sudan. I was jailed in Sudan because of CSIS; my torture is directly tied to the Canadian government.
SC: Canadian officials visited you during the very same period that you were in prison and facing torture in Sudan. What did these Canadian officials do to assist you?
AA: I was actually interrogated by two CSIS agents in prison in Sudan, in the same prison where I was being tortured, hung from the door frame, beaten with a rubber hose, slapped, and punched. CSIS interrogated me, asking the very same questions as the Sudanese secret police. The CSIS officials knew about my torture and were directly linked to it.
SC: Do you feel that the Canadian government officials involved in your case need to be held accountable?
AA: All those people who played a role in this matter, in my exile in Sudan, in my torture and imprisonment, must face justice.
SC: It must be difficult for you to put into words what you experienced in Sudan. I remember right after you returned from Sudan, you explained that you wanted to make sure no one else experiences what you experienced, that your experience shouldn’t happen to anyone else ever again. Is this why you continue to campaign today?
AA: Really I want to end torture and prisons; I want to be the last victim that experienced such horrible things. I must struggle for this to be reality.
SC: Some who experience torture take years to gather the courage to speak out and campaign publicly, but you chose to speak out on the very same night that you returned to Canada and continue to campaign for justice; explain why.
AA: The experiences that I went though in Sudan were really awful. It is so hard to describe; I want to make sure that no one experiences the same thing ever again. I will continue with my tour across Canada this winter; I will continue to tell people across Canada my story.  I want torture to stop completely, for it to never happen to anyone else anywhere in the world.
SC: Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Convention against Torture, a very important piece of international legislation, but instead of defending your rights in the Sudanese prison where you were tortured, CSIS agents interrogated you in the very same prison in which you were being tortured. At one point in Khartoum, a Conservative MP, Deepak Obhrai, also interrogated you. What do you have to stay to the Conservative government in Ottawa after your experiences?
AA: Representatives from the Conservative government came to Sudan and interrogated me in the Canadian embassy – which is horrible. MP Deepak Obhrai interrogated me rather than helping a fellow Canadian citizen. This is horrible behaviour from the government and must be stopped.
SC: How did this experience make you feel while being stranded in Sudan?
AA: Actually I expected the government to come to help me after being released from prison in Sudan and living at the Canadian embassy struggling to go back to Canada. I expected the MPs who visited to help me, not to interrogate me.
I felt that all hope was gone at that time, because the people who were supposed to help me, the Canadian government, instead interrogated me, which actually made me lose all hope. Obhrai asked me my opinion on Palestine, on Israel, on bin Laden – not talking to me about my own situation as a Canadian stranded in Sudan.
SC: You lived many months in the Canadian embassy in Khartoum. Can you explain this period?
AA: It was very difficult to stay in the Canadian embassy – very, very difficult. Cameras watching you all day and all night, monitoring every movement. Having your life monitored at the embassy and not being able to go anywhere was so difficult, just staying night after night at the embassy compound without any support from the Canadian government to return. For me, staying at the embassy was like another prison because I had to stay 24 hours a day within the embassy compound.
Staying at the embassy was mental torture; embassy staff were always pressuring me to leave. Actually the embassy staff who tried to help me were fired, especially the local staff from Sudan. [They were] fired for just bringing some food for me to eat.
SC: When you made that choice to enter the Canadian embassy in Sudan, you were looking for protection?
AA: Yes, absolutely. After I entered the embassy in Khartoum, from the moment that I told the embassy staff that I was staying and gave them a letter from my lawyer in Canada, they treated me very badly, especially the consular official Eric O’Connor.
SC: In April 2009 many people across the country came together, buying you a plane ticket back to Canada, a condition issued by the government for you to return to Canada, for you to secure your own ticket. Although the ticket was secured by activists in Canada, your hopes were dashed – as the government didn’t issue you travel documents. Can you talk about how you felt following the pressure from the grassroots in Canada calling on the government to return you to Canada?
AA: [I spoke] with my lawyers and supporters quite often over the phone. I heard about the protests in Montreal and other cities in Canada. Actually it is hard for me to describe how much this meant to me.
SC: Back in Canada, you have had an opportunity to connect with the grassroots activists who worked to educate people about your forced exile in Sudan and held street protests while you were in Khartoum. How has it been for you to connect with the people in Canada who fought for your return?
AA: Actually I am very glad to meet the people who supported me across Canada. While living at the Canadian embassy in Khartoum, activists from Montreal called me, expressing their support. This gave me strength to continue to remain at the embassy and fight to return.
Officials at the Canadian embassy really pressured me to leave and treated me badly, but knowing that the people of Canada were supporting me gave me spirit to continue. I slept in the bathroom at the embassy for many months. This was so difficult and humiliating. The bathroom at the embassy was my room after years in prison and torture in Sudan.
After coming back to Montreal I have connected with the activists that supported me. I am so glad to see them and to know them today.

2010-02-07,McGill,Israel,"War doctor Mads Gilbert discusses the politics of health in the Occupied Territories
Mads Gilbert and Erik Fosse became the eyes of the world in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli invasion of December 2008. As the only two foreign doctors in Gaza when the fighting broke out, Gilbert and Fosse reported to CNN, Al-Jazeera, ABC, BBC, and CBS from outside al-Shifa hospital where they worked, allowing the world to see the conflict through the eyes of those affected.
Gilbert spoke to students Friday night at an event hosted by the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights. Gilbert described the interwoven nature of  politics and medicine, and his belief that health is the most important foreign policy issue of our time. Gilbert’s political opinions stand out in a profession where neutrality is often the expected norm. But in his view, to be neutral would be tantamount to complicity – putting his patients in further danger. He has argued that the wall separating Gaza from Israel is a dividing line between those who have the right to health care and those who do not, and that pushing for an end to violence and the blockade of Gaza is just “good preventative medicine.”
McGill Daily: Can you describe the scene at al-Shifa hospital once the first casualties started to arrive when the bombing began last year?
Mads Gilbert: We were coming at New Years Eve, and at that time the damage from the bombing had been going on for days already, and we knew the first day,  December 27, had been a complete nightmare with many injured going to the hospital…. The bombing of the al-Shifa mosque nearby had shattered all the windows in the surgical block. They were lacking everything and the patients kept pouring in, in waves, up to three, four, five hundred per day.
It was a huge trauma, very painful trauma for us. I really can’t fully understand what kind of trauma it was for our colleagues. They had all their own people coming in, so devastated, so torn apart. But they had their own family members too, friends, neighbours, working colleagues killed, paramedics. I had the deepest respect for their courage and persistence….I don’t think many Western hospitals – my hospital – would have prevailed [through] three weeks of this enormous flow of victims coming in, and lacking so much equipment and capacity.
MD: How were people getting to the hospital? Were ambulances and emergency vehicles able to move freely?
MG: No, ambulances were being shot at. They were not able to move freely. People were carrying children in arms, in private cars, any transport that was available. Often the injured could not [be brought in] because Israel was attacking the ambulances. It was complete chaos. It was mayhem, I would say, outside the entrance to al-Shifa. There were stretches of quiet…but we never knew if they would bomb or attack the hospital. They did bomb hospitals, the al-Quds hospital.
MD: Did you treat individuals who were victims of the use of unconventional weapons? What are their noticeable effects?
MG: We were treating people who we think were victims of new weapons. The first time they were used was in Lebanon in 2006 – DIME weapons – dense inert metal explosives. They are a new generation of bombs that are highly explosive, very short range of action. But if you are in the range of action you are torn apart. A fair amount of children sustained these injuries, and it completely ripped off their arms and legs. Some of the adults could survive it with amputations.
MD: There have been claims about Israel using white phosphorous gas, which results in severe chemical burns. Did you deal with any of these casualties?
MG: I didn’t see any myself, but there were casualties. But phosphorous grenades are not illegal and can be used as smokescreens under international law, although they should not be used against civilian targets. I think all the focus on phosphorous bombs is a little bit ill-informed, and not the main issue.
The most important weapon that Israel is using, and has used against the Palestinians, is the siege of Gaza – that is illegal, against international law, and needs to be lifted immediately. As we are speaking, Israelis are still sieging Gaza, and it is a huge blockade. No building material is coming in, no food, cement, schoolbooks, pencils – security for the people.
MD: What effect has the siege had on the medical infrastructure in Gaza, before and after the war?
MG: First of all, it has caused a very severe and worrisome decline in the health condition of Gaza, stunting amongst children, malnutrition, anemia, and a general exhaustion. People are exhausted, the lack of freedom to move around…. The fundamental condition of health has been weakened by the years of siege…. The hospital health care is deficient of important supplies, maintenance, spare parts, which makes it difficult to work as a doctor and nurse.
MD:  Do you believe that medicine and politics can be separated?
MG: As a medical doctor it is my duty to see the world from the angle of my patients and to try to safeguard their fundamental needs for health…. If the first provisions are not in place, then as a doctor I have to talk about their living conditions so that they can change. It goes without saying that if you have unsafe water in Montreal, the general surgeon has to talk to the government, and that is a political process.
All the patients who came in came in because of Israeli bombings. That was the main medical problem. It was not lack of materials, a lack of doctors. It was the ongoing destruction of human life, at the hands of the Israeli government and army…. Bear in mind that 13 Israelis were killed, whereas 1,400 Palestinians were killed. That is 13, and 1,400 too many.
[The] power distribution in society, the distribution of access to health care, human security, all these aspects of life are political aspects. I think the medical community has a responsibility to take part in the decisions that affect the power distribution, and the distribution of wealth, access to fundamental provisions needed for a good life.
So I think politics and medicine are interwoven and that health is currently the most important foreign policy issue of our time.
MD: Why did you feel it was important to report what you were witnessing as a medical professional?
MG: We had to tell the world what was going on in order to stop that, so as to safeguard the safety and living conditions of our patients, and we did what any doctor has the obligation to do: to be a spokesperson for the voiceless, to be a defender of the patients’ interests, and that is an outstanding tradition, and we did our best to inform the leaders of the world, so that they could see what was going on. Unfortunately they didn’t act, but we are convinced to this day that it was right of us to talk about this.
MD: You have been criticized by the Israeli government, among others, for providing one-sided criticism while concealing your political stance. Should people see you as an objective, third party observer?
MG: Yes, we are being criticized by the Israeli government and by the Zionist lobby for being liars and what not, and that is an interesting illustration that medicine is indeed political.
The doctor and the medical community should be concerned with prevention, with changing fundamentally the conditions for health that will only treat the patient. If we were to only stand there and patch up people and stop the bleeding, and not say anything about the causative factors, we would betray our patients. So it was our duty to speak, our duty to tell the world, why all these patients, why all these children were coming in and were dying, were so injured. It was not an earthquake, not a natural disaster; it was a deliberate man-made disaster, planned meticulously, and executed by the state of Israel.
Nobody is neutral, really. While we have chosen sides with the Palestinian people, that does not mean that we won’t treat an Israeli soldier coming to al-Shifa. At the individual level we will always be neutral. But at the system level we went to Gaza…because we think the Palestinian people have a just cause, that they are being occupied and that that is unjust, simple as that.
What is the difference between me and Erik, and the Israeli doctors working in the army? They have chosen sides in their government, and for the oppressor, and for the occupant, and well, that is their decision. But it is a political decision too. Why should only we be criticized of being one-sided? Where are the discussions about the duties and the responsibility of the Israeli medical associations, Israeli medical community, of all the Israeli doctors who joined the army? Where is that discussion; where is the discussion about their medical ethics?
All that happened in Gaza could have been prevented if the world had not kept silent, if the American administration did not keep silence, if the world had not keep silent, but told Israel to stop it, stop it, stop it. You have to come to the negotiation table, we have to find a solution, you can not kill all these civilians – period.

2010-02-11,McGill,Israel,"Motion to create corporate responsibility committee passes without Palestine reference
The Winter 2010 General Assembly (GA) approved five motions on Wednesday, mandating that SSMU divest from the tar sands, support a cap on ancillary fees at McGill, restore $5 ATMs, create a corporate social responsibility committee (CSR) to oversee McGill investments, and take an active policy against the self-funded tuition model. A motion originally banning pro-life groups from campus failed, in spite of numerous proposed amendments.
While several SSMU councillors said they were happy that all motions were discussed and that the GA maintained quorum, some were less pleased by the actual debate. SSMU VP (Clubs & Services) Sarah Olle said that she was “upset by the lack of constructive dialogue that was had and I think our community, as demonstrated today, is just incredibly divided about issues external to the University, and I wish that people could focus more on the university experience itself and bringing people together.”
Arts Senator Sarah Woolf described the GA’s proceedings as “messy,” and was “disgusted and depressed with how the beginning of the GA went,” but added that the structure is constantly being improved, and was pleased that students stayed to see every motion through. “I don’t think this is the death knell of the GA,” she said.
At its peak, the GA exceeded the capacity of the Shatner cafeteria, with over 600 students present. The CSR motion, which referred to the the occupied Palestinian territories in its preamble, contributed to the sizable turnout, but also prompted Speaker Zach Newburgh to issue warnings to students about adhering to decorum soon after the call to order.
Twenty minutes into procedure, the GA was bombarded with complaints about the inability to hear speakers, repeated calls for decorum, and motions to reconsider almost every decision made, leading to a record five-hour duration.
Before debate could begin, the agenda was amended to move the CSR motion to the top of the docket. After Khaled K, the motion’s author and an executive for Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights – McGill (SPHR), spoke in favour of the motion, an amendment was passed to strike two clauses in the motion’s introduction.
The clauses specified that McGill has ties to “organizations that engage in and profit from unethical practices including but not limited to profiting from the unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”
Debate quickly became heated during discussion of the amendment and the motion; one student was asked to put away their Israeli flag while another accused Newburgh of a conflict of interest as SSMU speaker, because he is president of Hillel Montreal and his roommate is president of Hillel McGill.
An inability to estimate majority decisions during discussions of the amendment led to an hour and a half of inaction as various votes were counted to strike clauses, and then to reconsider the decision to strike. Debate resumed, and after a failed attempt to adjourn the GA altogether, a simple majority vote passed the motion, without reference to occupied Palestine.
Prior to the GA, the Facebook account of a member of SPHR was hacked, and a message was sent to members of SPHR’s GA event claiming that voting had moved online, including a link to Elections McGill. SPHR coordinators and SSMU executives took immediate action to correct the misunderstanding.
The motion against McGill adopting a self-funded tuition model was moved by SSMU VP (External) Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan.
During his motivation speech, Ronderos-Morgan pointed to other Canadian universities’ substantial tuition increases, and saw McGill’s attempt toward a self-funded model as a sign that they were making a “serious statement about what it sees as means necessary to balance the budget.”
The motion passed, quickly followed by a motion to reinstitute $5 ATMs on campus, and a motion demanding SSMU’s refusal to accept mandatory ancillary fees. Both were debated for several minutes.
A motion calling for SSMU to investigate investments with ties to tar sands in Alberta was passed by a simple majority, despite debate about the economic feasibility of the motion and a failed amendment which would have eliminated references to the financial institutions with ties to the tar sands. SSMU currently owns over $230,000 in bonds with the Royal Bank of Canada, which finances tar sands projects. SSMU councillor Joël Pednault recommended SSMU move its investments to banks like Desjardins, which does not finance such projects.
The final motion, on banning discriminatory groups on campus, was led by statements from authors Maddie Ritts and Liam Olson-Mayes explaining their choice to single out pro-life groups, stating that they are necessarily discriminatory and that “by allowing pro-life groups, we condone and accept their position,” and targeting the Silent No More campaign. After extensive debate and votes on multiple amendments, including one to strike direct reference to pro-life groups in the resolution, the entire resolution failed to pass.

2010-02-11,McGill,Israel,"Muslim Students Association calls for apology
An email regarding security at club events has some students accusing administrators of prejudice, SSMU execs calling for a reformed policy on room bookings, and the administration insisting the whole thing was a misunderstanding.
In an email sent on February 2, McGill events administrator Debbie Yacoulis asked SSMU VP (Clubs and Services) Sarah Olle to provide advance warning of any events held by QPIRG, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), and the Muslim Students’ Association (MSA). Yacoulis claimed that advance time was needed to grant these groups security clearance for their events.
Olle forwarded the email to members of the three organizations mentioned. The message came as a surprise to the MSA. The group is currently drafting a request for a formal apology.
“Our events are never controversial and we never have problems. Most of our events are [attended by] Muslims coming for more knowledge,” said Anais Massot, VP (External) for the MSA.
Massot has been with the MSA for three years and could not recall any group events where extra security was needed.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson explained that the email did not reflect University policy, which mandates that security needs are to be determined on an event-by-event basis
“I don’t see it as being an issue; I see it as being a mistake,” Mendelson said.
Yacoulis emailed Olle after learning that the MSA planned to host a lecture entitled “The Essentials of Islamic Knowledge and Practice.”
Olle is familiar with the University’s event-by-event policy and said that the email from Yacoulis was confusing.
“It’s always been on a per event basis, which I think is a good system because you can’t assume that just because a group is a certain group, its events will be a certain way,” Olle said.
Jim Nicell, McGill’s Associate Vice-Principal (University Services), echoed Mendelson’s statement, reaffirming the University’s per event security policy.
“The message that was delivered was incorrect and did not represent in any way the position of this University in the way that we deal with events,” Nicell said.
Khaled Kteily, SPHR VP (Membership and Development) believed the three groups were singled out because of their pro-Palestinian stances on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
“The only commonality that I can see here is that these [three] organizations are supportive of what is happening in Palestine,” Kteily said.
Massot saw a similar trend. “SPHR is pro-Palestinian, QPIRG does a lot of events that are [pro-Palestinian]…and we’re Muslim, so I guess we fall into that category as well,” she said.
Anna Malla, QPIRG’s internal coordinator, was upset but not particularly surprised upon reading the email.
“I know that we do get profiled to a certain degree, but the degree to which this is a situation of actual racial profiling of speakers really shocked me. They specifically have been flagging events that have Palestinian speakers,” Malla said.
Rebecca Dooley, VP (University Affairs) indicated that other groups have been profiled by the administration. Dooley described a “human tunnel” of security guards at the Senate meeting where the university’s research policy was discussed. The issue attracted students opposed to military research on campus. Dooley said the increased security presence was likely brought in to restrain these students.
“They weren’t violent, but it was just assumed that students with that sort of opinion were going to be aggressive, and violent, and disruptive,” Dooley said.
When security is required at events, the club must cover the additional costs.
Kteily said this was an unfair burden to place on clubs.
“If they are going to mandate additional security guards, the very least that could be done is that McGill cover these costs. Realistically, we are dealing with a budget that is in the thousands of dollars at best,” Kteily said.
Nicell stood by the University’s policy.
“At a certain point, if there’s no subsidies available for carrying out those events, it’s going to have to be carried by the group itself,” Nicell said.
For Olle, the initial email points to problems with the University’s policy that extend beyond the cost of security. Olle explained that since policies are developed by high-ranking administrators, the actual regulations are not always communicated effectively to the people who help clubs book events.
For instance, Olle also mentioned an email she received from an administrative assistant who referred to Choose Life as “Abortion McGill.”
Olle said she sees this as indicative of inadequate knowledge of clubs among lower-level administrators.
“The knowledge trickle-down about what’s happening gets very convoluted when it gets to those lower levels,” Olle said. “I hope that this does continue to push the University to come up with a more comprehensive, clear policy about events on campus…because I just think this is just another example to show that what they’re doing right now doesn’t work.”

2010-02-18,McGill,Israel,"Event continues at Cinéma du Parc after 2,500 letters sent in protest
The company that owns the Galleries du Parc threatened to shut down a photo exhibit held at Cinéma du Parc this week called “Human Drama in Gaza,” before retracting its request.
On Monday, Cinéma du Parc received an email from its landlord, Gestion Redbourne PDP Inc., instructing the theatre to immediately remove all photos, documents, and bulletins related to the exhibit.
Lieba Shell, the legal representative for Redbourne, claimed in the email that the exhibition was in violation of the terms in their lease and threatened to take legal action against Cinéma du Parc if it did not comply with the request. She added that Redbourne would send security to the cinema in the evening to ensure the orders were obeyed.
Shell sent out another email Wednesday morning retracting their requests, stating that the exhibit is allowed to continue until February 28, as scheduled.
According to Jean-François Lamarche, program coordinator at Cinéma du Parc, between Tuesday morning and Wednesday afternoon, over 2,500 letters were sent out from community members asking Redbourne to let the exhibition continue.
“Human Drama in Gaza” is an exhibition featuring 44 photos that document the events in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead, the three-week assault launched by the Israeli military last winter. The assault resulted in approximately 1,400 Palestinian deaths, most of which were civilians.
The exhibition is organized by Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME) and will be travelling to various cities across Canada.
According to Lamarche, this was the first instance in which the mall’s owner has tried to interfere with Cinéma du Parc’s exhibitions and programs.  
“In the past, we’ve had other expositions of this kind. The Gaza Strip has not been the subject of these other expositions, but human rights was. So we’ve had other pictures of war like this one and we think that everybody has the right to express their point of view,” said Lamarche.  
Grace Batchoun, VP (public relations) at CJPME, felt that Redbourne’s legal threat was inappropriate and offensive.  
“This exhibition is costing us over $25,000…. People love it and we have had excellent feedback. [Redbourne’s action] is illegal. The move on their part is clearly political. The owner at Cinéma du Parc has held over 40 exhibitions in the past few years and has had no complaints or issues,” said Batchoun.
Batchoun stated that Redbourne wanted to shut down the exhibit to stifle discussion of Israeli-Palestinian politics.
“They’re just trying to intimidate Cinéma du Parc and CJPME,” said Batchoun. “They don’t want the truth of Gaza to be exposed, and they don’t want any discussion of Gaza. There are about 1.5 million people suffering in [the Gaza Strip], and it’s an important issue.”
CPJME’s lawyer, Mark Arnold, agreed.
“Everything is political in this society. There was a war in Gaza, but in this country – Quebec included – we certainly have the right to freedom and free speech,” said Arnold.
CPJME and Cinéma du Parc are content that Redbourne has retracted its request but remain wary of Redbourne’s threats.  
“We’re very happy, but at the same time….the intimidation hurts. We wasted so much time and effort,” said Batchoun. “We’re a sizeable well-structured NGO, and we were able to reach out to the lawyer, we were able to react….but what about smaller NGOs? This injustice should not go unnoticed – many other people are living through it, but they don’t often get to be heard.”
Shell declined The Daily’s request to comment on the incident.

2010-02-18,McGill,Israel,"Residents argue that the development promotes Israeli policies
The Quebec Court of Appeal announced Wednesday that on June 3 they will hear the appeal submitted by the West Bank village of Bil’in against a Superior court decision from last September.
The Bil’in Village Council brought the lawsuit in 2008 against two Quebec-registered companies based in Montreal: Green Park International Inc. and Green Mount International Inc. The plaintiffs claimed that the companies and their sole director, Annette Laroche, are involved in constructing settlements for Israelis on occupied land within the territory of Bil’in.
“Bil’in brought the lawsuit against [the Montreal-based companies]…under international humanitarian law. Specifically, under the fourth Geneva convention, which says that an occupying power cannot replace the indigenous population with its own population,” said Mark Arnold, the Canadian lawyer representing Bil’in. “The lawsuit alleges that Green Park is, by doing this, in a way aiding, abetting, and assisting the state of Israel in carrying out its settlement policies.”
Superior Court judge Louis-Paul Cullen dismissed the case on the grounds that the Quebec court is not the correct forum to have the case heard, and ruled that the case should go to the Israeli High Court of Justice. The plaintiffs filed an appeal after the decision was made in September.
“The Quebec Superior Court has jurisdiction over Quebec companies and directors who are residing in Quebec,” said Arnold. “The problem is that [Cullen] is fundamentally wrong. The Israeli High Court of Justice will not hear this case, so he has sent this case into oblivion.”
In Bil’in, Abdallah Abu Rahmah, a school teacher and the coordinator of the Bil’in Popular Committee Against the Wall and the Settlements, was arrested in his home by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank on December 10, 2009. Amnesty International criticized his arrest, claiming on its web site that Abu Rahmah is “being detained solely on account of legitimately exercising his right to freedom of expression in opposing the Israeli fence/wall.”
Abu Rahmah was in Montreal last summer for the court proceedings and spoke at Concordia University.
According to Stefan Christoff, local activist and Tadamon! member, those from Bil’in who came to Montreal for the proceedings last year were severely harassed upon returning to Bil’in.
“They only faced that after they spoke in Canada. Their case was highly covered in the media,” said Christoff.
Since June 2009, over 30 non-violent protesters from Bil’in have been arrested by the Israeli military. Amnesty International declared in January that Abu Rahmah can be considered as a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate and unconditional release.
Abu Rahmah displayed hope in a letter written behind bars at the Ofer Military Detention Camp in January. “The occupation is threatened by our growing movement and is therefore trying to shut us down. What Israel’s leaders do not understand is that popular struggle cannot be stopped by our imprisonment,” he wrote.

2010-03-04,McGill,Israel,"Signatories support boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israeli government
On February 25, Montreal-based Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! announced that 500 local artists had signed a declaration of support for the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against what they call Israel’s apartheid policies against Palestinians.
The statement argues that there are parallels between South Africa and Israel’s systems of segregation, and that support for the Palestinian struggle for human and civil rights should mirror the international anti-apartheid movement of the 1970s and eighties.
“A matrix of Israeli-only roads, electrified fences, and over 500 military checkpoints and roadblocks erase freedom of movement for Palestinians,” it states. “Israel’s apartheid wall, which was condemned by the International Court of Justice in 2004, cuts through Palestinian lands, further annexing Palestinian territory.”
The statement goes on to reference the Israeli military’s blockade of the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip, which has been ongoing since 2007. “Israel continues to impose collective punishment on the 1.5 million Palestinians of Gaza, who still face chronic shortages of electricity, fuel, food, and basic necessities.”
“These 500 artists signify a very critical shift in our society: a shift toward questioning in many ways the Israeli government and its policies and Canada’s support for Israel and Israel’s policy of occupation and apartheid,” said photographer and Tadamon! member Stefan Christoff.
He added that the artists are not calling for the boycott of Israel to be all-encompassing. “Is this a boycott of all Israeli artists? No. It should be on a case-by-case basis. It should target institutional structures,” he said.
The BDS movement began following a 2005 request by Palestinian civil society groups that Israel conform to international law by withdrawing from the Arab territories it annexed in 1967, and by permitting the return of Palestinian refugees to the homes they lost in 1948.
Several of the artists in attendance stated that support for the BDS movement has become necessary due in part to the Canadian government’s unwavering support for Israel.
“I think the BDS movement is something that will permit us to slowly take back the reins of control and help pull back the money that is flowing into the government that is propelling this occupation,” said Yassin Alsalman, a local hip-hop artist who goes by the anonym The Narcicyst.
Fortner Anderson, a poet who also signed the declaration, echoed Alsalman’s statement, and added that the letter should be seen as a first step in a broader, global movement.
“The 500 Montreal artists, who create the climate of ideas that we live in, have said enough is enough – something must be done,” he said. “This cannot be left to the governments because the governments are incapable of resolving the problem.”
Freda Guttman, an installation artist and Tadamon! member, said that the 500 signatures were a significant accomplishment given the pressures artists often face from their patrons.
“There are people who wanted to [sign the letter] but couldn’t to protect their jobs,” she said. “[Blacklisting] is happening more and more because Israel realizes it’s working.”
Anderson agreed that the political statements artists make can adversely affect their professional lives. “A lot of artists in Canada survive entirely off government largess, so for people to take positions like this can, for some, be of concern,” he said.
The list of signatories includes members of local bands Kalmunity Vibe Collective, Nomadic Massive, Silver Mt. Zion, and The United Steelworkers of Montreal.

2010-03-04,McGill,Israel,"Organizers defend term “apartheid,” cite South African support
The Legislative Assembly of Ontario unanimously passed a resolution condemning Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) last Thursday, taking particular issue with use of the term “apartheid” in conjunction with Israeli policy. The province’s actions have prompted Conservative MP Tim Uppal from Edmonton to announce that he will table a similar motion in the House of Commons next week.
IAW is an annual series of educational events that take place at over 40 universities and colleges around the world with an aim to “educate people about the nature of Israel as an apartheid system and to build Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns as part of a growing global BDS movement,” according to the IAW web site. Montreal’s sixth IAW begins today with events held at McGill and Concordia.
MPP Peter Shurman, who tabled the motion in Ontario, argued that the use of the term “apartheid” in relation to Israel bordered on hate speech and offended those who experienced apartheid in South Africa.
“It’s a provocatively charged word and it’s presumptive: if you say something is apartheid then, hey, it must be – there is certainly not consensus on that. If we’re talking about Israel let’s discuss it – let’s not have a one-sided diatribe about it, which is what IAW is about,” Shurman said.
According to Shurman, the resolution passed in the Ontario legislature is intended to have moral suasion, but does not prohibit the week from continuing. However,  it is likely that student organizers in Ontario will continue with the week as planned.
“It’s ironic how these politicians can find the time to condemn [IAW] and silence student activism and student voice, but they can’t find time to condemn Israeli’s crimes on and systematic oppression of the Palestinian people,” said Yafa Jarrar, member of the Students against Apartheid at Carelton University. “They are trying to systematically suppress our freedom of speech and our activism. But we will not be silenced.”
Organizers of the IAW in Montreal argued that the event is meant to be a week of open discussions and that the decision to use the term “apartheid” is based on the policies implemented in Israel that have segregated Palestinians living in the region.
“The reason we’re calling it Israeli apartheid is because it is what it is. The policies that Israel has been implementing against the Palestinian people show a systematic tendency of alienating and separating them. Apartheid means separateness, and the racially policies that Israel has passed have an unquestionable goal of segregating the Palestinians,” said Nina Amrov, a member of the IAW organizing committee and of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights– National.
Scott Weinstein from Independent Jewish Voices said there are many Jewish individuals who support IAW and are involved in organizing the week. He also explained that the term “apartheid” is intended to be provocative and spark debate – though it has not been as successful as hoped.
“[We] have begged, pleaded, and invited our counterparts in the Zionist movement to debate us…[but] they absolutely refuse. They don’t want there to be a public discussion about any profound criticism of Zionism and the nature of racism in the Jewish state,” said Weinstein. “If they would guarantee a public debate on the issue and they don’t want us to use the word apartheid, then sure, that’s not an issue – but they won’t debate with us, not yet.”
MPP Shurman warned that apartheid does not exist in Israel and that the association the term creates between Israel and the South African apartheid regime is inaccurate. “You cannot make something true just by saying it is. Just because there’s a week called Israeli Apartheid Week doesn’t support that there is apartheid in Israel – because there isn’t; apartheid has only taken place in one place, South Africa,” said Shurman.
However, supporters of IAW were quick to point out that “apartheid” is a term that has been used to describe Israel by many individuals involved in the fight against South African apartheid, and that Israeli policies fit the definition of apartheid as articulated by the UN International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of 1973.
Emanuel Lowi, a former editor at Haaretz in Israel who describes himself as an observant Canadian Jew, discussed the criticism of Israel by South African leaders. “The best people [to judge whether it is] apartheid are the people in South Africa who fought against apartheid. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has come out very strongly against Israel. [Tutu said that] what Israel has been doing to the Palestinian people in many ways is not only reminiscent of South Africa, but is worse than it. Nelson Mandela has come out against the Israeli’s treatment of Palestinians,” said Lowi.
Mookie Kideckel, president of Hillel McGill, pointed out that Jewish students on campus often feel singled out and targeted by talks of Israeli apartheid. “Israel is a democratic country; it’s made a lot of efforts for peace. It’s also something that’s emotionally tied to the majority of Jewish students,” Kideckel said. “By seeking to delegitimize Israel, [IAW] effectively makes a lot of Jewish students feel delegitimized. A lot of the agony and fear from the week comes from the idea that it really obsessively singles out Israel, and makes a lot of Jewish students connected to it feel singled out unfairly.”
Lowi tried to address the fears that Jewish students are experiencing. “The students who are scared, they have to think about what it is they should do to protect our people from being discredited by being associated to despicable acts committed in our names [by the Israeli government], and it is to speak out against it,” said Lowi.

2010-03-30,McGill,Israel,"Liberal leader talks to The Daily about prorogation, carbon taxes, the niqab ban
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff descended on Montreal for a three-day conference aimed at reimagining the character of the Liberal Party last weekend. The conference, called Canada at 150: Rising to the Challenge, was publicized as a non-partisan event, but from the beginning functioned as a forum for Liberals to establish a working platform for the next federal election. Former prime ministers, newspaper columnists, university professors, and bankers joined Ignatieff at the Hyatt Regency Hotel to discuss public policy ideas, both old and new.  The entrance fee for the conference stood at $695 a head, although banks of computers were also set up to receive Skype comments and instant blogging from across the country. Ignatieff talked to The Daily hours before delivering his final speech on Sunday evening, discussing prorogation and environmental policy, Israeli Apartheid Week, the niqab ban, and his plans for a future Liberal government.
  The McGill Daily: You’ve said that the new Liberal governance will mean “getting a network of deciders together to face common problems.”  That seems like the function of any government. In what way is your view of Liberal governance unique?
Michael Ignatieff: I think it is different from command-and-control, and top-down, and exclusive and obsessional focus on jurisdiction and the constitution. Don’t misunderstand what I’m saying: no federal government in its right mind wants to interfere in provincial jurisdictions, especially not Quebec. And it’s not fancy – but we can’t go to Copenhagen with provincial governments in open dispute. Getting networks of responsibility is no more complicated or fancy than calling the key stakeholders nine months out and saying, “We’ve got a conference here: why don’t we make sure Canada speaks not with one voice, but with a coherent voice.” I’m not so naïve to believe – or I’m not so naïve to forget – that provincial governments often take very different policies on key environmental and energy questions. But at least we can keep [ourselves] from exporting our quarrels, and get a few common positions that we can agree on. The point here is, then you can leverage each others’ influence instead of diminishing each others’ influence.
MD: Given the chance to form a government, would you impose a carbon tax – a position for which most policymakers have advocated?
MI: The straight answer is no. I’ve made another fiscal proposal, which is to push the pause button on corporate tax reductions, which we think will give us the fiscal room to incentivize green technology and clean technology and energy efficiency. We think that’s a better approach.
MD: You’ve made it a top priority to extend political participation to young Canadians at this conference. What have you done in this regard that distinguishes you from the Harper government?
MI: Well, no other political party has ever had such intense and widespread interest in political involvement as an issue in Canadian politics – I think that’s just a fact. We had participation from 25 countries outside of Canada and from 70 communities in Canada, from White Horse in the west of the country to Fredericton in the east of the country. So these are very active, lively discussions that went on for often days at a time, in often remote parts of the country. When you look at the Skype feed it was clear that this was being driven by mostly young Canadians. And I think we’ve made more successful use of the new technologies than any other party. I’d like to claim credit for that, but it’s basically the young people within the party itself who are driving this, and they’re doing a wonderful job. They’re changing the way citizens can connect in Canadian politics, and it’s good.
MD: If you were given the chance to form a government, would you introduce legislation making it more difficult to prorogue Parliament and what measure would be in the legislation to make it effective?
MI: Yes, we would introduce legislation to limit the power to prorogue. And we’ve put forward some specific suggestions a couple of months ago to limit prorogation power. Because I think that this is about maintaining the right balance between prime ministerial power and parliamentary power. And we think that the prime minister’s almost unlimited prerogative should be limited, in the sense that you can’t prorogue twice in a year, the way we’ve seen; you can’t prorogue to avoid a vote of non-confidence; you can’t interrupt the sitting of Parliamentary committees. Those are three areas where we felt limitations could be reasonably imposed.
MD: You’ve said that the Charest government’s introduction of a law banning the niqab for women using public services constitutes a “good Canadian balance.” It’s been suggested that this law would violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is as Canadian as it gets. Do you think the law would violate the Charter?
MI: If there is a Charter challenge, you know, the courts will have to rule. My sense is that these things involve a balance. Accomodement raisonable means reasonableness on both sides. That means the receiving society should reach out to people of different faiths and different customs. And on the other side, people of different faiths should recognize the equality of women, and the right of the state to say if you want access to certain services there are certain rules of the road you should follow. There’s a balance Quebec is trying to establish here that I think is appropriate. But I want to say what I’ve also said on this from the beginning, which is that Islam has many faces in Canada, and Islam has been part of this country for a very long time…at least a hundred years. And these are neighbours, our friends and our fellow citizens.
MD: You’ve criticized the Harper government and stood behind aboriginal groups that have had their funding axed recently, such as the Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the First Nations University of Canada. Would you reinstate funding to these groups? What is your overall vision for your government’s relationship with First Nations?
MI: Well, we have to close the gap in funding for aboriginal education, and specifically we have to lift the cap on growth in funding for aboriginal post-secondary [education]. Those are specific commitments that we’ve made, that we make. And I believe the federal government should restore funding to First Nations University and we feel the Aboriginal Healing Foundation is a good works institution that should continue to receive support. You know, I’m optimistic about the future of aboriginal people in this country, but so much of my optimism turns on getting them some of the best darn education in the world.
Foreign Policy
MD: In 2002 you wrote in the Guardian that Israeli settlement policy was creating Bantustans and resembled South Africa during apartheid, as well as the Crusades and French colonization in Algeria. Lately you’ve condemned Israeli Apartheid Week in no uncertain terms. What made you change your mind?
MI: With the greatest respect, a close reading of that Guardian piece would make it clear that I never compared, nor would I ever compare, Israel to South Africa. Israel has its problems, but it’s important as a matter of public record that I’ve never compared Israel to South Africa during apartheid. And I’ve always said that Israeli Apartheid Week is an inappropriate way, to say the least, to discuss the Middle East on campuses. What I said in the Guardian piece is that I believe Israel’s security depends, ultimately, on there being a viable Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza. The issue is viability. I’m a strong believer in a two-state solution, not only because I believe that Palestinians have rights that must be recognized, but I also believe that a viable Palestinian state is the best ultimate and long-term [solution for] the security of the state of Israel.
MD: Your party defeated its own motion regarding abortion in the Harper government’s maternal health initiative for the G8. Will you be able to create a united party line on the importance of abortion as a form of contraception, especially as it pertains to aid in the developing world?
MI: I think the Liberal party is united on the absolute importance of providing a full range of reproductive health services to women, which means contraception, family planning, birth spacing. And there are members of our caucus who do not want that comprehensive approach to reproductive health services to include termination of pregnancy. And I respect their view, but the position of the party, and it would be the position of the party in government, is that Canada should provide the same, full range of reproductive health services to women. And let me be very clear: the party believes, and I believe, that abortion should be rare as contraception, [a result of] good family planning. It should be available to women when it is medically necessary. These are controversial subjects and arouse very strong feelings, and I respect the moral feelings that are at play on this issue. But I think I have made the party’s position, which has been the Canadian position for 25 years, clear. And it seems to me that the Harper government is walking away from a position that has been our country’s position for a very long time.

2010-04-12,McGill,Israel,"SPHR accused of defamation of character
Incoming SSMU president Zach Newburgh threatened to take legal action against McGill’s chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) on April 3 if the group refused to drop their Judicial Board hearing within 48 hours, according to two sources.
SPHR allowed the deadline to expire, and the Judicial Board meeting went ahead as scheduled Friday night. As the Daily went to press, a lawsuit had not been filed.
SPHR called for a Judicial Board hearing on March 17, accusing Newburgh of bias while chairing the February 10 General Assembly (GA).
The Judicial Board heard the case on Friday evening, but has not made a ruling.
One of the motions voted on at the GA was submitted by SPHR, and called for SSMU to establish a committee that “will thoroughly investigate McGill University’s involvement with companies on the basis of negative ethnical practices.”
The preamble of the motion mentioned the Israel-Palestine conflict within the context of ethical investments and boycotts, drawing ire from pro-Israel campus groups.
SPHR holds that there was a conflict of interest, given that Newburgh is the president of Hillel Montreal, the umbrella organization that links the various anglophone Hillel student groups on Montreal campuses, including Hillel McGill.
When the motion was brought to the floor of the GA, the clauses  referencing Israel-Palestine were struck by popular vote.
SPHR cited a January 28 meeting between SPHR and Hillel McGill members, attended by Newburgh. According to Nafay Choudhury, lead counsel for SPHR, the two parties adjourned for five minutes, and Newburgh spent the break in private with the members of Hillel McGill.
“The conversation Hillel McGill [had in private] points to what we don’t know,” said Choudhury. “No equivalent meeting was held with SPHR.”
However, both Newburgh and Hillel McGill president Mookie Kideckel claimed that Newburgh refused to voice an opinion for the entire duration of the meeting, including the private meetings.
“Zach refused to say anything. We wanted him to say something, but he didn’t,” said Kideckel.
One key issue from the January meeting involved GA procedure, specifically whether a preamble clause could be amended. Newburgh confirmed that he told both parties at the meeting that such clauses could not be amended. The night before the GA, Newburgh received a call from Corey Omer, the clubs and services representative to SSMU and VP (External) of Hillel McGill, who directed him to a passage in Robert’s Rules – the legislative procedure for General Assemblies – stating that preamble clauses could be amended after certain motions had been passed. SPHR said they were not made aware of the change until Newburgh brought it up in the assembly.
“It took everyone somewhat aback,” said Choudhury.
Newburgh’s lead counsel, Max Reed, said that it was unrealistic to expect the speaker of council to know every rule in the 600-page Robert’s Rules book. SPHR countered that, as speaker, it was his job to know all of Robert’s Rules.
SPHR claimed they had begun to review Robert’s Rules before the GA, but that their meeting was disrupted when they discovered SPHR member Alexa Romanelli’s Facebook account had been hacked, cancelling the GA event she was administrating. McGill security was unable to trace the hack.
SPHR also contended that Newburgh’s bias was revealed during the GA when he threatened vocal members of the assembly with ejection, but failed to act on these claims.
Reed said that Newburgh followed all of Robert’s Rules to the letter, including the speaker’s ability to eject members of the GA.
“A motion must come from the floor [to eject members of the Assembly],” said Reed, implying that Newburgh was not legally allowed to follow up on his threats.
“If the motion passed without incident, if everyone was perfectly happy, Mr. Newburgh would still be biased – which in my opinion makes no sense,” concluded Reed.
Newburgh confirmed during the hearing that he made SSMU aware that there could be a perceived conflict of interest if he chaired the Winter GA. Newburgh said SSMU president Ivan Neilson told him he would chair the GA anyway. Newburgh said that these facts undermine the SPHR allegation of a conflict of interest.
“Their arguments don’t seem to hold,” said Newburgh. “I myself knew that there was potential conflict of interest. I had given full disclosure to the executive and they gave me full support. They told me that as an employee, I would be doing my job chairing the meeting.”
Max Silverman, former SSMU VP (External), thought Newburgh had performed well at the GA, given that it was a highly-charged, divisive event.
“I think Zach actually did a pretty good job, all things considered,” he said.
Silverman sent a Facebook message to Newburgh expressing a similar sentiment after the GA. Newburgh cited the message in his respondent factum before the hearing, but when Silverman learned of it, he issued Newburgh a cease and desist order, and the message was pulled from the factum.
Despite Newburgh’s performance at the GA, Silverman said that even the appearance of a conflict of interest undermines the process.
“Regardless of how highly one thinks of Zach, the optics of it make it appear as if there would be a conflict of interest and the mere appearance of a conflict of interest can delegitimize the process,” said Silverman.
Neilson said that Newburgh was in danger of having this rift with SPHR define his presidency, but was confident in Newburgh’s ability to reconcile with SPHR, as well as all other student groups.
“Regardless of the outcome, he’s just going to have to work a little bit harder to demonstrate not only to the members of SPHR, but really to everyone, that that’s not what defines his presidency, that he really brings something more to the table, that he won’t allow this to be a distraction, and really not to try to ignore the past, but just to try to move on and proactively engage student groups,” said Neilson
“I don’t think he’s trying to bring an overly aggressive attitude, despite whatever facts are floating around,” said Neilson. “I think that…he’s seeking mediation, that he’s trying to find a solution, and that next year he will bring that sort of attitude to any other conflict.”
SPHR’s factum calls for a public reprimand of Newburgh by the Judicial Board or an official apology from him.

2010-09-27,McGill,Israel,"Conservative McGill led opt-out campaign renewed a day later
An unidentified person or group hacked into the Quebec Public Interest Research Group’s (QPIRG) website last Tuesday, changing the group’s homepage, in what appears to be an escalation of the nearly two year old-campaign on the part of a range of student groups on campus to encourage student opt-outs from QPIRG’s $3.75 a semester student fee.
QPIRG could not confirm that last week’s hack was related to the opt-out campaign, saying they are still in the process of discovering what happened themselves.
Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan, a QPIRG board member, told The Daily, “The groups who have been organizing against QPIRG in the past are well known and have been pretty public about it. That is not to suggest that hacking came necessarily from those groups.”
Following the hack, the link on QPIRG’s website titled “Working Groups” sent users to a webpage for Tadamon!, a pro-Palestinian organization affiliated with QPIRG that labels Israel an apartheid state.
Clubs as diverse as Conservative McGill and the McGill Hellenic Students’ Association accuse QPIRG of supporting radical political positions that “mainstream” students would not naturally support.
Fliers encouraging students to opt-out of QPIRG’s student fee have also been left in buildings on campus, including Leacock and Redpath, throughout the past week.
Outgoing Conservative McGill President Jess Weiser did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment.
The opt-out campaign, officially luanched on September 15,  has developed a well organized web infrastructure; the Facebook group “QPIRG: Opt-Out!” features a 50-second video guide to opting out of student fees, including QPIRG and “Vegan” [Midnight] Kitchen, as well as a six-step guide to the opt-out process on Minerva, which the Facebook page says takes “less than three minutes.”
The QPIRG Opt-Out Campaign circulated an open letter addressed to QPIRG last night, signed by Conservative McGill, Free the Children McGill Chapter, and Swiss Club McGill, among others, decrying some of the research group’s political positions as “bigoted.” The letter’s coda reads, “We will no longer contribute to an organization that promotes hate, rejects student input, and neglects its stated aims.”
Ronderos-Morgan said the efforts of the individuals and groups involved in the opt-out campaign are “disingenuous.”
“I find it kind of hilarious [that these groups use the arguments they do] because they receive money from SSMU and faculty associations,” said Ronderos-Morgan.
“Conservative McGill, for example, received $750 of student money last year from SSMU, and students had no option of whether or not they wanted to opt-out of that. A lot of students on campus don’t find conservative politics very appealing and yet their money is going to fund Conservative McGill.  … Students don’t really have the option to opt-out of that because it makes sense for there to be funds available for groups to add to student life without having to do bake sales all the time.”
Echoing Ronderos-Morgan’s chagrin with the groups involved in the campaign, Anna Malla, Internal Coordinator at QPIRG, said “we are not opposed to students knowing how to opt-out, but we are opposed to the fact that there are fliers being distributed all over campus that don’t give any information about who we are.”
“Students are finding out about a way to save money as opposed to finding out about who we are and what we do,” she continued. “It is obviously not a campaign that is trying to inform students. It is a campaign that is trying to suck the money out of our organization.”

2010-10-07,McGill,Israel,"The Daily talks to the Jerusalem Post’s Yaakov Katz about Israel, Iran, and the political uses of warfare
Yaakov Katz, the military editor of Israel’s largest English-language daily, defended Israel’s right to pursue military action against Iran in a speech to around 30 guests at Hillel McGill on Tuesday. After his talk, The Daily had the chance to speak with Katz in Hillel House about Israel’s foreign policy, the possibility of peace, and the uses of warfare.
Born in Chicago, Katz moved to Israel in 1993, where he served in the Armored Corps of the Israeli Defense Force. He has since worked extensively as a journalist and editor, covering the 2006 war in Lebanon and Operation Cast Lead (Israel’s 2008 air campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip) for the Jerusalem Post and USA Today.
In his speech, Katz focused on Israel’s current standoff with Iran, arguing passionately for the use of military force against the Islamic republic. He also described Israel’s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah as proxy wars with Iran.
He later stated that if “Iran were to tomorrow begin to enrich uranium to higher levels, the levels required for nuclear weapons – go to what’s referred to as the “break out stage” – that would constitute the grounds for an Israeli strike against Iran, sooner rather than later.”
In his characterization of the threat of Iran developing nuclear weaponry, Katz also posited that the development of nuclear technology by Iran would “motivate other countries to test the NPT [Nuclear non-proliferation treaty] and to test the world’s willingness and readiness to take real and decisive action.”
When asked why Israel’s own officially-denied but widely-acknowledged nuclear arsenal hasn’t created a similar license in the international community, Katz paraphrased current Israeli president Shimon Peres’s response to a similar question.
“The nuclear program was to allow Israel to make peace not to make war and that’s part of the idea behind the program – to create a strong Israel so that enemies wouldn’t attack it,” said Katz.
Katz went on to underscore what he sees as the fundamentally cyclical nature of the conflict.
“What we’re looking at today are cycles. … All you can really hope for today [is] to postpone the next conflict for a significant period of time,” he explained.
According to Katz, war is essential in these cycles as a tool to reach settlements, a theorization he traces back to the early 19th-century.
“[Carl von] Clausewitz, who was a very famous Prussian military theorist…said that war is part of the process to create the conditions that will allow the diplomats, the political levels, to create some sort of just resolution,” he said.
Clausewitz’s most famous formulation – that war is politics by other means – has been thrown into question since the advent of world warfare and weapons of mass destruction in the course of the last hundred years. Nonetheless, Katz defended warfare as an essentially political tool.
“What war can do is create viable conditions in order to create new realities. And we’ve seen that, for example, in the second Lebanon war, in 2006. Israel was attacked. Two of its soldiers were kidnapped. Rockets were landing in Israel. And Israel decided to go to war. It could have decided to suck it up, to swallow hard and ignore what had happened. But it decided to go to war, and I think legitimately.”
Decisions like these, he argued, do not provide definitive solutions, but their short-term impact makes them worthwhile despite the human cost. Katz again used the 2006 war in Lebanon and the 2008 Operation Cast Lead as examples.
“The fact of the matter is that for the past four years there’s been quiet in Lebanon. So that war led to [UN Security Council Resolution] 1701, which led to this new quiet, which led  to this new understanding of the threat from Lebanon. … Operation Cast Lead in Gaza last year was very controversial, but also led to a new period of quiet which Israel has never had before, almost two years of quiet in the Gaza strip. Is it the end of the conflict? No. Did that war in Lebanon end Hamas or end Hezbollah? No, but it’s able to change the reality.”
Hearkening back to his cyclical view of conflict, Katz gave the example of the First World War as an effective, but temporary political tool.
“Think back to the end of the First World War,  when Germany was deterred until the beginning of the Second World War, when they were no longer deterred and decided to attack and invade Poland. So the concept is that these are all cycles and that’s what this warfare is all about. What Israel can hope for is that it can push off and stave off that future conflict for as long as possible.”
Katz did recognize the possibility of a paradigm shift in Israel’s situation with the arrival of new political actors.
“Hamas is part of the political process in the Palestinian arena, Hezbollah is part of the political process and part of the government in Lebanon,” he said. “Do we give them recognition? Do we talk to them? So that’s a whole separate issue in itself.”
In response, he asked, rhetorically, “What is there to talk about if they don’t recognize my right to exist?”
However, Katz did not entirely rule out the possibility that Israel would benefit from negotiating with Hamas and Hezbollah.
“So Israel refuses to talk to them. Is that the right or the wrong move? That’s a good question.”

2010-11-08,McGill,Israel,"Ala Jaradat discusses the military order in the Occupied Territories and Israel
The McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) hosted Ala Jaradat this past Wednesday in Chancellor Day Hall. Jaradat is involved with ADDAMEER Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a Palestinian NGO.
“The percentage of Palestinian adult males who have been to prison [is] between sixty per cent and eighty per cent,” said Jaradat during his talk. “My father was imprisoned, my uncle was imprisoned, I was imprisoned, and if I ever have children, they will be imprisoned until this occupation ends.” The Daily spoke with Jaradat after the talk.
The McGill Daily: What is ADDAMEER?
Ala Jaradat: I’m part of a human rights organization that works against political repression, for political prisoners, opposing the use of torture, arbitrary detention, or the fair trial using different mechanisms. One of them is providing free legal aid to political prisoners, free legal representation, intervening legally on their behalf against any of the violations, attempting to use the local legal systems, filing complaints and intervention on an international level, and trying to use UN protection mechanisms or universal jurisdiction. Additionally, what we do is advocacy work – in terms of monitoring and documentation and the use of that information to write legal analyses or reports on conditions of detention which are used internationally or trying individual cases and raising awareness on individual cases on local, domestic and international levels. Besides that, we provide training to Palestinian lawyers on international law and the possibility of being able to use international law in their work on the ground and we work with human rights youth activists trying to provide them with skills that they can use in terms of advocating for the rights of the people and protecting local communities rights, lobbying, advocacy, and media work.
MD: How does Palestinian imprisonment compare to imprisonment elsewhere in the world?
AJ:  The Palestinian prison issue cannot be understood in terms and concepts that currently in the world are accepted as talking about prisoners and about prison systems. We are here talking about a colonial project. We are talking about a form of military occupation. Palestinians are being arrested and detained for political reasons and for allegedly taking part in activities related to the conflict, or trying to live or defy the mechanisms and the measures and the policies of the military occupation that is about to appropriate their land, water and all of their natural resources: the defense of these measures is the reason behind the arrest and detention. So, the nature of the Palestinian prisoners’ population by far is not very similar to other prisoner populations. You can compare it only to smaller groups of prisoners in different parts of the world, political prisoners or in areas of conflict where there are people on different sides of conflict being imprisoned. You can compare it to other eras of colonialism and prisoners in those prisons in the past. Palestinians are not being imprisoned because they pose a threat to their own society or according to laws agreed upon by their own society. These are people being imprisoned because of violating laws that are determined by the occupier and the colonizer.
MD: How does the military order function in the Occupied Territories?
AJ: Basically, under international law, an occupying power has the right to establish a military court system and arrest and detain people under [this system of] military courts. But the way Israel has practiced the military court system was totally beyond their rights as an occupying power. Israel, with the military court system, gave itself the jurisdiction over many aspects of the Palestinians’ lives. The military order and military court system totally overrides any preexisting laws and Israel uses them selectively. The military courts chose and the military commander chose to give themselves jurisdiction over civilian lives, over any civil, economical, cultural, political aspect of the lives of Palestinians. And the military commander, who is assigned by the state of Israel, gave himself the sole powers to rule every aspect of the Palestinians’ lives.
MD: What is considered illegal according to the military order? On what grounds can somebody get arrested?
AJ: There are over 1,650 military orders by now, and these military orders govern almost every aspect of the lives of the Palestinians: from what they can read, to what they cannot read; what kind of activities they can do, to what they cannot do. Military orders limit freedom of expression, freedom of association, academic freedom and so on, just to name a few. Any kind of social organization is illegal. Any kind of community organization or mobilization is illegal. Any kind of political activity is illegal. Basically, these military orders almost illegalize your day-to-day life as a Palestinian. You can find yourself easily and simply at any moment, in violation of one or another of the military orders, just by trying to live and provide for life.
MD: What happens once somebody is detained initially? Do they have access to lawyers?
AJ: The military orders include provisions on how the whole process is regulated. Under this process, they can prohibit from the moment of arrest and detaining a person meeting legal counsel or a lawyer, for a period of about ninety days, continuously or uncontinuously. And uncontinuously means that it can be extended to even more than ninety days by giving orders to private meeting with a lawyer for three days at a time or five days at a time, making it stretch to 180 days without meeting a lawyer.
MD: What are the conditions like in the prisons?
AJ: The least we can say about the detention conditions is that they are totally inhumane detention conditions, under which Palestinians are subject to harsh treatments, continuous neglect of providing health care, overcrowded conditions, extremely difficult hygiene situations, lack of health conditions, in terms of ventilation, light and denial of communication with the outside world. No phone calls are allowed, family visits are very controlled and limited, with continuous denial of giving permits to families to visit – basically totally inhumane conditions of detention.
MD: What is “Administrative Detention”?
AJ: Administrative detention is an administrative as opposed to legal procedure, where a military commander can issue an order to detain a person for a period that varies from one month to six months under the pretext that this person forms a threat to the security of the region and the population, based on a secret file and secret information that neither the detainee nor any counsel or lawyer can have access to.  At the end or before the end of the detention order, it can be renewed and there are no limitations on how many times this detention order can be renewed. Palestinians can spend five years to eight years in prison under administrative detention. Their detention order is renewed every couple of months, without ever knowing when they are going to be released, or if they are going to be released, without ever knowing why they are being detained and for what reasons.

2010-11-11,McGill,Israel,"Activists deem it recruitment, others disagree
On November 4, the Jewish Studies Student Association (JSSA), along with the Bronfman Israel Experience Centre, commonly known as Birthright, hosted a pizza lunch and discussion with three IDF soldiers in the Jewish Studies building. During the event, protesters gathered outside to demonstrate against the presence of Israeli military personnel.
Joseph Shapell, a member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), explained that SPHR had seen the event advertised and individual members of SPHR had decided to protest the event. “[We were protesting] on the principle of having military personnel on campus…I think a campus has to be a safe, secure environment for students,” Shapell said.
JSSA President Peter Fusco was surprised by the event’s high attendance and by the ensuing protest and interest among students. “Our events usually draw seven to eight people, and usually for the free food,” Fusco said. “Way more people showed up than I thought would.”
Fusco explained that the JSSA did not organize the event and that an event with IDF soldiers was “unprecedented” for the JSSA. Fusco said he was contacted through Eric Kaplan, Chair of the Jewish Studies Department, who was himself approached by Birthright.
“In reality it was just me sending out an email. I didn’t organize it… I just promoted it…it wasn’t really our event. We shy away from those kind of…loaded political issues,” Fusco said.
Fusco explained that the JSSA tries to be aware of their role as an academic student association: “[The JSSA is] a student organization that represents an academic department at McGill which is obviously supposed to be neutral, apolitical, objective as best it can, because it’s Jewish studies not a Jewish organization. … It’s not for Jewish students, it’s for people who want to study Jewish culture, history, and religion,” Fusco said.
“I think [protesters] found it inappropriate that a non-academic event involving a Zionist organization, which is what Birthright is… was on campus and that it was sponsored by a student group that was supposed to be academically oriented,” Fusco said about the JSSA’s involvement in the event.
Shapell attended the event and listened to the soldiers’ talk. The soldiers spoke at intervals about their lives and then took time to answer questions. Shapell said that “things went downhill very quickly.”
Shapell described the reaction of others at the event, saying that people criticized those who vocally disagreed with the soldiers. According to Shapell, a student in the audience told him to “be respectful and keep quiet” after Shapell questioned a soldier on civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.
Fusco’s view of events was different: “It seemed to me from my perspective that it was a very honest, open type of dialogue with these guys… They were speaking honestly about their lives, how they grew up, and what position they put themselves into or [had] been presented with. They seemed to me down to earth” Fusco said.
“[The soldiers] have to be willing to take questions form all sides. If there isn’t room for that then it isn’t an academic space. It’s abusing academic space – using space simply to further an ideological aim, which is inappropriate. They came to talk about their experience as soldiers: I have a right to ask about aspects of their military service that I am curious about,” Shapell said.
“They weren’t propagandists, throwing this staunch Zionist line,” Fusco said. “I don’t think it was recruitment as much as it was positive PR for Birthright.”
 Josh Pepin, Director of the Bronfman Israel Experience Centre, said the soldiers were “there for educational reasons, not for political reasons.”
Pepin went on to say that Israeli soldiers are not allowed to discuss politics in public events.
Pepin emphasized that the soldiers are “normal 18 to 20-year -olds with different lives,” referring to Israel’s policy of conscripting all 18-year-old non-Arab citizens into the military.
Shapell disagreed: “There are students here [at McGill] who are from the West Bank,” he said. “I think for Palestinian students the presence of IDF soldiers is a scary thing.”
“I think the administration has responsibility if military personnel are going to be on campus to make it as academic as possible and as open and unintimidating as possible,” Shapell continued. “Administration should be cognizant of when military will be on campus.”
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson said in an email to The Daily that he was not aware that IDF soldiers were on campus. “I don’t know why they would need approval for what seems to have been a meeting of their group in space in their department,” Mendelson wrote. “McGill does not ban members of the military from campus.”
“The University staunchly upholds freedom of expression on campus within the bounds of the law,” he continued.
Fusco echoed Mendelson’s assessment of free speech on campus, saying, “It’s totally appropriate to have Israeli soldiers on campus to speak. … It’s important to talk to people like that from a different perspective regardless of how worked up people get about the political issue.”
He added, however, that the collaboration with Birthright was problematic.
“I wouldn’t co-sponsor with Birthright or an organization like that again,” he said. “I would want to do it myself, in that it’s a purely academic, objective debate.”

2010-11-11,McGill,Israel,"Ewa Jasiewicz is a British-Polish activist, a coordinator with the Free Gaza Movement, and a member of the editorial collective of Le Monde Diplomatique’s Polish edition. She was in the Gaza Strip throughout the conflict there in January of 2009. Last May, she rode on the Challenger 1, one of the six boats that attempted to break the siege of Gaza before they were apprehended in international waters by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Nine Turkish nationals were killed by the IDF soldiers aboard another of the boats, the Mavi Marmara. Gaza has been blockaded by Egyptian and Israeli forces since Hamas took control of the Strip in June 2007.
The Mcgill Daily: How did you get involved in Palestine solidarity activism?
Ewa Jasiewicz: I first got involved through the [International Solidarity Movement] in 2003, because of friends of mine who had been out to Palestine. … I didn’t know that much about Palestine when I went there. This was just about six months after [Operation] Defensive Shield, so there were still a lot of incursions and curfews and, you know, once you see what the Israel army and state is doing to the Palestinian people – you see people’s homes destroyed, blown up, people killed, people injured and just daily violence – you can’t really forget it, can you? You can’t not be active around it because it becomes personal.
MD: What were the objectives of the flotilla that was attacked in May?
EJ: The objective primarily was to break the siege. The carrying of humanitarian goods was for us symbolic. … It did physically ease the blockade because the Rafah crossing [between Egypt and Palestinian-controlled Rafah] is now open. Okay, still not far enough, and Egypt is still a co-oppressor in the siege, but thousands of people were able to cross who wouldn’t have been able to cross before. That’s one measure of success. But it was also the boost it gave to the [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)] movement because it shifted many people into supporting the BDS tactic who before had maybe been on the fence. So many artists, musical acts cancelled their acts afterwards – [like] the Gorillaz and the Pixies. And then of course the United Nations fact-finding mission report just shows you again how Israel has violated international law. But it is a success to have brought in effectively another country. The government of Turkey reacted strongly and demanded a NATO emergency meeting and got it and really diplomatically put the spotlight on condemning Israel. And that’s a really positive thing and the whole of Turkey was really behind that. And it has really changed the relationship between those two countries.
MD: Israel has claimed that some of the members of the flotilla are linked to Al-Qaeda and that IHH [The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Aid, a Turkish NGO] is also linked to Al-Qaeda.
EJ: This is just absolute bullshit. Because if Israel really believed that there’s no way they would have let everybody go and released everybody. … They didn’t do that because it’s not true.
MD: Can you describe the flotilla raid?
EJ: The flotilla raid began in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark. That was a political decision by the Israeli navy, because they wanted to use the darkness to terrorize us and also to hide the actions of their soldiers. … So they continued trailing us and we were outrunning them for a while, maybe half an hour. We did hear shooting [from the Marmara], that was really horrible, but we were carrying on and then our captain decided to stop because he was feeling like they were going to cut us off and ram us and he didn’t want that. So he cut the engine and then they came closer and closer and then they just opened fire on the boat with plastic projectiles, smoke bombs. And they hit my friend in the face and she had blood all over her face and they wouldn’t let me treat her, they wouldn’t let anyone get to her, they were beating [my friend] Huwaida, and smashed the glass door open on the inside of the boat, they tasered the Sydney Morning Herald journalist, they cuffed me, they cuffed Huwaida, they put a hood on Huwaida and [another friend] Anna, they threatened to taser us, they were really brutal, they stomped on my face and then they took us into custody. … When it came to us being deported we kept saying that we wanted to see our council or our lawyer, that we didn’t want to leave, that we didn’t agree to this deportation, and they were just physically very aggressive with us and forced us out. They were beating people with truncheons and throwing chairs, and it was really horrible.
MD: And that’s when you were in detention?
EJ: Yes, we were still in detention.
MD: Were any of your fellow activists carrying weapons?
EJ: No, there were no weapons. Every single boat was searched. there were absolutely no weapons aboard any of the boats. That’s why people on the Marmara had to blowtorch some of the railings to make primitive weapons, to make crowbars, because they didn’t have normal weapons. They did have the right to defend themselves. You even have the right to defend yourself using firearms if you’re attacked at sea [in international waters].
MD: Do you feel that Hamas needs to be engaged diplomatically?
EJ: Without a doubt.

2010-11-27,McGill,Israel,"Founder hopes Omeq will have a “moderating effect”
A new McGill group calling itself Omeq is aiming to change the dynamics of the Israel-Palestine discourse on campus.
The group takes its name from the Hebrew and Arabic letters OMQ, the root letters of the words “depth” and “profundity” in both languages.  According to Omeq VP External Michah Stettin, debates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are consistently hampered by an adversarial atmosphere.  He described the formation of Omeq in early 2010 as “a response to too much inflammatory rhetoric on campus, as opposed to substantive discussion and dialogue.  We felt that there was a need to have a group on campus that was hospitable to numerous viewpoints.”
Stettin cited last winter’s SSMU General Assembly as a particular source of strife, when the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) brought forward a motion calling for the creation of a financial ethics review committee. The motion made numerous references to the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
Another reason for the new group, according to Stettin, is the frustration expressed by Omeq’s mostly Jewish members that positions taken by Hillel McGill, a major Jewish student group, did not reflect their own perspective.  “I don’t think that there is such a thing as the Jewish political opinion.  Thus if an organization takes a political opinion, there will be Jews that disagree.  Hillel in the past has taken stances on issues on campus, and there were people on campus who were left outside of those positions,” he said. Stettin did, however, maintain that “Hillel is a great place for Jewish students and serves very important functions.”
Corey Omer, president of Hillel Montreal, said that he sees Omeq “as a positive thing, to have other groups. Any way Jewish students can represent themselves is good.  Hillel strives to represent everybody; however, it is hard for one organization to say everything to everyone.”
The effort to create what Omeq’s executives call “increased dialogue” on campus has not, however, been met with universal acclaim. Sam Bick, a McGill student and SPHR member who stressed that he did not speak for the group as a whole, said that dialogue may hurt more than it helps. “People don’t come to the table on the same footing. … When there are different degrees of power, when there’s military violence happening, dialogue becomes a much different thing,” he said, adding that dialogue may end up diverting attention “from dealing with real issues.”
Through a series of talks on subjects such as anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and the role of activism in Israel and Palestine, Stettin hopes that Omeq can act as a moderating force in conversations that have been tense on campus in recent years. A talk scheduled for last Wednesday,  “Debunking Myths about Islam,” would have been the fourth this year for Omeq, but was postponed in favour of a general meeting due to a scheduling miscommunication.
Rex Brynen, a McGill Political Science professor, sees a respectful environment as something that will come naturally to Omeq because of its structure. “If you set up contexts–whether it’s speakers on campus or internal dialogue sessions–in which the understood rules of the game are that you can say what you want but you have to be respectful with it, [dialogue] doesn’t become terribly hard,” he said.
Brynen feels that organizations like Omeq have an important role to play in decreasing the polarization of campus discourse. “People get upset at occupation of the settlements, people get upset by terrorism, and and it sort of drives them apart and leads them to a situation where they can’t recognize common interests, so I think [OMEQ] kind of re-centres the discussion in useful ways,” he said.

2011-01-05,McGill,Israel,"A Conversation with Professor Douglas Farrow
On Thursday November 25 Douglas Farrow, McGill professor of Christian Thought and director of Pluralism, Religion and Public Policy, held a public lecture on the ‘Lost Idea of the University.’ This comes in the wake of the creation of McGill’s highly publicized ‘Initiative in the World’s Religions and Globalization’ – a recent partnership between McGill’s Faculty of Religious Studies and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. 
After the lecture The McGill Daily sat down with Professor Farrow at a reception held in McGill’s Newman Center for an extended conversation about this ‘lost’ idea.
The McGill Daily: Could you comment on the relationship between higher education and democratic institutions, especially in light of current austerity budget policies, which threaten to make the university more exclusive to the general voting population?
Douglas Farrow: Well, austerity issues come and go. If the current financial lows get serious enough to cause major changes in the university, as opposed to the usual round of good times and not so good times, it will no doubt affect many sectors of society, perhaps even before it affects the university. So we may find that our concerns about the university are the least, or rather one of the less pressing, of our problems. Obviously people such as myself who make a living in the university may find that this is especially problematic but we’re all sort of waiting to see how serious or large-scale these economic problems are. We don’t really know yet but frankly there are some quite worrying signs. 
But to your question on the impact of austerity measures, real or imagined, on the question of access to the university: first of all, I did indicate in my paper that I think in a sense we already have a utilitarian approach to the university when we make it an institution to which there should be presumed access. Now taking that view may mark me out as dangerous or ‘elitist,’ which I don’t wish to be, but I do think that the university, even viewed as a utility for advancement in career opportunities, is not a very important institution because if everybody can get a university degree than a university degree isn’t very meaningful in selecting candidates for a job, right? If everybody’s special, nobody’s special. 
What resulted is the process wherein first you just needed high school or you needed grade eight; then you needed grade twelve; then you needed a B.A.; now you need a master’s degree. Some day you may need a doctoral degree to climb to the top of the ladder in terms of pools of labour and job prospects. So I don’t think that that’s a very good way to approach the university or what its relation to people should be. I also don’t like the utilitarian dimension of that – the university as simply a stepping stone to a more successful, affluent, orsecure kind of life. 
The university, I think, has a much more specialized purpose and that’s to prepare people for the kind of attentive listening and the kind of rigorous thought processes which make them useful to one another in ways that can’t be reduced to economy and marketplace…but that more centrally it has to do more with the enjoyment and appreciation of the good. 
MD: In your lecture you emphasized that the courage to confront the problems you outlined will have to emanate from a new understanding of the unity of knowledge. Could you explain this and comment what this means in regards to the ‘social constructivism’ that you describe as present at McGill?
DF: The idea that knowledge can cohere, so that one part informs another and the whole informs the parts, is something that we have less confidence in today than we used to… That is to say, ours is a more sceptical age. When people become skeptical of the coherence of knowledge they are also, of course, becoming skeptical of the very notion of truth. Truth requires a measure, it requires some objective reality that is accessible to us by which our opinions…must be judged. When people become skeptical of the possibility of truth they tend to embrace the idea…that truth is, as Richard Rorty once put it, somewhat jokingly, “Whatever my colleagues will let me [get] away with.” Our relations with one another, if determined seriously and not just jokingly by that approach, become competitions, become power games and contests between my groundless construct that I am proffering to you and to anybody who will listen and your groundless construct which you are proffering, which serve your purposes. … You mentioned… the sort of social constructivist outlook that is so common today. Thankfully, it’s not taken for granted at McGill in the way it might be at some other institutions, but it is part and parcel of that game. Take for example some proponents of gay rights who are not really social constructivists, who would try to argue their point of view both in terms of sex and in terms of public policies about sex on some common basis with people who take a different approach to sex and public policies on sex, and queer theorists, who are generally social constructivists, for whom gender is what you make of it. It’s not a matter of biology; it’s really a matter of how you construe yourself for whatever reasons at a given time and in a given context. There is no underlying reality to that. It is the reality you choose to generate for yourself. 
Now, if you try to make public policy on the basis of that approach, of that philosophy, you quickly find yourself in all sorts of binds – which we ought to be talking about, since we are exploring some policy changes along those lines, but we don’t talk about them very much because it’s not convenient for us to face up to those questions. We maybe have a specific goal in mind: changing a policy about marriage, or bill C-389 [legislation on gender identity and expression] right now, for example. And we might confine our discussion to the question of whether we should have a unisex washroom on every floor of the building. Which, as I pointed out to [the Administration], is also an economic question, of the economy of space and the money to put this in place – but that’s a very trivial level on which to discuss it. Behind that is a question of how would such a policy change be rooted in a common reality that we could all recognize, and on what basis could we recognize this as reality rather than just a whim. Those kinds of questions take us much deeper into the philosophical underpinnings of a movement for a right or a particular set of rights and into questions about what rights are. 
Rights are related to right, to truth, to goodness, to justice. And it’s that kind of question that I want us to ask and work at and that the university should be good at asking and working at. Where does our confidence come from? Well, that is a philosophical and ultimately a theological question. If we don’t explore it at those deeper levels, what is to prevent us from simply lapsing into the view that ultimately all this…is just a play of phenomena that doesn’t really have any depth and that we can switch around any way we like? 
MD: So to be clear: in your view this truth emanates from a monotheistic God and is revealed through divine illumination?
DF: It’s not an accident that science as we know it, and the university as we have known it, arose in a culture which is shaped on the one hand by Greek or Hellenistic philosophical developments that are reaching out for a monotheistic unity in the midst of this sort of chaos of not only household and city gods but the mythologies of the poets, which philosophers such as Plato tried to tame. And the Judeo-Christian heritage, which is monotheistic also but for other reasons…has engaged the philosophical reasons, embraced many of the philosophical reasons, but its origins, the roots of its monotheism are different. 
… Now I started there by saying that it’s not an accident that universities and science … emerged within the context where there was at least that much consensus: reality does at least cohere, somehow, and it’s appropriate for human beings to explore the way in which it coheres. It’s appropriate for them to think and talk about God, yes, and it’s also appropriate for them to examine the coherence of the world because – and this was a particularly Christian contribution – the world is not itself God and it would not be irreverent in probing the world, even to take it apart and look at it, and try to figure out how it works. It’s worth doing because it does cohere, you will find answers. And why does it cohere? Because God made it to cohere and it’s okay to do it because when you probe behind the surface of the world you are not poking God. You are discovering the ways of God in creating the world but you are not poking Him and you are not being sacrilegious. It’s good to peer into the actual workings of things. If they weren’t good God wouldn’t have made them, and if it wasn’t good to understand them He wouldn’t have given you the kind of mind that can do that. 
… [W]e have become skeptical in late modernity about that common ground the Hellenistic and Judeo-Christian heritages shared, and that has produced, as I said in my lecture, a certain kind of cynicism as we despair about truth, which is also affecting the university where people are to learn the art of conversation that makes them able participants in the search for truth. They don’t come to university to be told exactly what truth is, but they do come to be more able participants – not the only participants and not the only able participants – but more able participants in the search for truth. 
If you give up believing in truth, you give up believing in the university. Then what? Well, then you try to play power games and take as much advantage as you can of whatever resources the university has. If it’s appointments, if it’s money, if it’s equipment, if it’s influence over students – you just always edge to get the best advantage you can and it becomes a kind of jungle. 
MD: I want to get back to the University and bring the conversation back to McGill. In your lecture you warned of creeping bureaucratization and the decline in institutional autonomy – those are two of your criticisms of the “‘lost’ university.” Do you feel this is reflected specifically in the context of McGill? There are current policies described in Heather Munroe-Blum’s emails pointing to the new directions of the University and I was wondering if yours was a direct comment on those directions?
DF: No it was not, but do I see it affecting McGill as well as other universities, yes. I only used one, if I recollect, in the written text at any rate, specific example at McGill of a problem and it wasn’t [one of] those problems. It was an example of disciplinary inflation. And that’s when I referred to our new inter-faculty major [in Sustainability, Science and Society], which, by the way, I do think has some things to be commended for,.. In terms of bureaucratization, I remember when I first came to McGill a dozen or so years ago hearing a very senior professor holding forth in a meeting of the association of university teachers here against the dangers of this loss of collegiality in decision making and the bureaucratization that accompanied it. It’s a concern that others have had and held for some time. I know that it is shared by many. But I want to be somewhat sympathetic to the challenge faced by our administration, and that is that – in such a big institution with so many pressures on it, from the government, from the marketplace et cetera – it’s no simple thing, it’s no easy thing: you can’t call together the professoriate as a whole and say, “Well, how do we respond to the latest diktat from the Ministry of Education?” You just can’t do that. 
… [N]ow, I’m not a libertarian , but I do see very much a creeping, even a galloping, statism in the bureaucratization of our society as a whole. How do we keep our space, this interval in time and space that the university ought to create for its students? How do we preserve that quasi-monastic way of life that does its particular work for the good of society? How do we preserve that autonomy against all these other pressures? Well, if we only – inside the University – mirror the authoritarianism and the bureaucratization and the death-by-paperwork effect that is “out there,” then it seems to me we’ve already lost the battle. 
Is McGill worse than other places? No, it’s probably better, but is it in danger of going the same path? Yes it is. Can it be run without some centralization in the principal’s and the provost’s office? No, it probably can’t. But can it continue to be what historically it has wanted to be and has been if that centralization and its accompaniments, in terms of increasing bureaucracy – if we’re hiring more administrators then we are scholars – we’re not of course but the ratio is changing – if that trend continues will we become less of a real university? Yes, I think we will. It doesn’t mean we might not still produce spectacular advances in science, but it means we will be less of a university.
MD: I was interested by what you said about the apocalyptic premises of certain inter-disciplinary programs and disciplinary inflation you touched on in your talk. Could you elaborate on the use of these apocalyptic premises?
DF: I think a discipline assumes that the world has a certain stability; theologically, I would say a God-given stability, which makes the patient, ordered pursuit of knowledge appropriate. I don’t think we should be quick and hasty in inventing either new putative disciplines or creating inter-disciplinary programs that are premised on disaster scenarios and that promise to address these supposed disasters with academic equipment that will somehow rescue us from the disaster – I don’t think that is what the university is about. Governments may have to do it, military may have to do it, industry may have to do it, but I don’t see it as being what the university is about. 
And how does that link to disciplinary inflation? Well, it links in the sense that people who are in a panic, they tend to take [whatever’s handy] – “I’ll grab a little bit of that and a little bit of that, throw it in the car and get out of here!” – right, so [I’ll] take a bit of Religious Studies, take a bit of Environmental Studies, I’ll take a bit of Ethics, and take a bit of Geography or some dimension of physical sciences, even, and I’ll throw it all together and I’ll find a solution to this problem. But they don’t know what they are doing in any of these disciplines; they’re taking a smattering of subject matter and of courses. 
It’s a bit like the Israelites in the story of Exodus: taking off their earrings, their jewellery and throwing it into a big pot over a great fire and melting it and out comes the golden calf that Aaron tries to explain away when Moses comes down from the mountain – it seems to me that’s the kind of thing you do when you’ve lost sight of the goal and you’re in a panic and you need some god to lead you. You know: “You’d gone up the mountain and we weren’t sure you were coming back! We have to have something to lead us so I asked everyone to make contributions and we put it all in the pot, it melted, and when it hardened lo and behold there was a golden calf!”
People have a smattering of this and that but no clear, patient thinking that is tested by reality and is tested by counter-arguments. It’s utilitarian in the sense that it’s aimed at solving a problem – which may not be a real problem – we’re not frankly sure about some of the premises on which they are building this apocalyptic scenario. But even if we were sure of…the premises, making academic disciplines to correspond to perceived crises is not a sound procedure. To bring the resources that we discover from tried and tested academic disciplines to bear on a problem? Yes, that’s different. And I supposed that’s what they think or hope they are doing, but I am not convinced.

2011-01-27,McGill,Israel,"SSMU President holds town hall on his motion
Yesterday, SSMU President Zach Newburgh hosted a  town hall forum to discuss his proposal to abolish the General Assembly (GA), and replace it with an Annual General Meeting. The motion, which has prompted criticism over a lack of consultation – as well as the creation of numerous Facebook events – will be debated at the next SSMU Legislative Council on February 3. If Council passes the motion, it will become a referendum question in the online winter referendum period, open to all undergraduate students.
The meeting began with few participants, most of whom were members of the student media, but attendance increased as the meeting progressed, peaking at about forty students. The town hall was organized by Newburgh after articles in both The Daily and Tribune linked him with the motion to abolish the GA. For most of the town hall Newburgh limited the parameters of the town hall to the “strengths and weaknesses” of the current structure of the GA and the “merits of the referendum question” outlined on a blackboard in the room. When questioned about the positions of SSMU executives on the issue, Newburgh reiterated these guidelines, despite VP External Myriam Zaidi’s post on the Facebook event, which stated that “the current SSMU executive is divided on this question.”
Discussion opened with comments from Engineering Senator Andrew Doyle, who said that there are “far too few good resolutions that come forward at the GA.”
Councillor Zach Margolis noted that any reform will need to go “beyond tinkering and promoting it.”
The accessibility of GAs was another central point of discussion.  “I wouldn’t be comfortable writing legislation,” explained Arts student Lily Schwarzbaum. “Discussion is what makes the student body not so apathetic.”
Other students echoed this sentiment, and the process of writing and submitting referendum questions was repeatedly labeled “opaque.” Speakers targeted Robert’s Rules, the system that governs GAs and Council meetings, as a key problem.
Doyle pointed out that “too many people who know Robert’s Rules use them to hijack the process.” Numerous students suggested the idea of GAs serving as a forum for debate, with voting moved to an online system.
Advertisement initiatives were another popular topic. VP Finance and Operations Nick Drew asserted that previous executives had failed to spend the entirety of their advertisement budget, resulting in a smaller budget for this year. He also emphasized the increased use of free advertisement through social media.
Notably absent from the vocal audience were student groups who often submit motions, including the Engineering Undergraduate Society and Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR).
SPHR members authored the motion that created controversy at the Winter 2010 GA, which called for the creation of a social responsibility committee, and sparked debate about the inclusion of a phrase regarding the “unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”
SPHR filed a Judicial Board complaint against Newburgh in March 2010. The complaint accused Newburgh of a conflict of interest, as he chaired the GA in his role as Speaker of Council while serving as president of the city-wide Jewish organization Hillel Montreal. The Judicial Board is the mechanism by which students can challenge the conduct of SSMU officials or bodies, according to the SSMU constitution. Newburgh was eventually cleared of all wrongdoing.
Newburgh was also heavily involved in the Winter 2009 GA, which caused controversy with a motion requesting that SSMU condemn bombings of educational institutions in Gaza. At the time, Newburgh organized the Facebook event, “SSMU: Vote Against the Condemnation of Israel,” and wrote to students that “the GA is not an appropriate forum to express external political issues.”
At Wednesday’s town hall, Newburgh took notes and summarized arguments for speakers as discussion progressed. Drew, another mover of the original resolution, typed minutes, which will be available publicly. “I think a lot of the arguments that were made were rehashing old arguments,” Newburgh said after the event, “but there were at least one or two comments that were very helpful, so I hope to use those comments to strengthen a reform of the GA.”

2011-02-12,McGill,Israel,"A  throng of about one hundred Montrealers gathered in front of the Egyptian consulate Friday afternoon to celebrate the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak earlier that day.
Mass protests have taken place in Cairo and throughout the rest of Egypt since January 25 – ten days after a similarly widespread protest movement led to the resignation of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
“Today is an incredible day,” said Mostafa Henaway, a member of the local Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! “Nobody expected this so soon after yesterday’s speech by Mubarak. … The mood is euphoric. This was something that was considered impossible.”
Mubarak has sat in the president’s office since 1981. Discontent has been mounting in recent years as a result of rising food prices and unemployment rates among the under-thirty demographic. Approximately half of the country lives below the poverty line.
Ehab Latoyef, a member of the Canadian Arab Federation, was among those attending Friday’s rally.
“There was a lot of discontent in Egypt for many years whether financial, respect for human rights, dignity, employment, prices – all that was accumulating,” he said. “But for it all to come to closure in two weeks like that was unexpected for everybody.”
Latoyef added that in his opinion the recent release of U.S. diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, as well as the Palestine Papers, has galvanized the demonstrations. Documents revealing Egypt’s complicity with Israel’s 2009 attack on the Gaza Strip, killing 1,400 Palestinians, are now available to the public as result of these sources.
Mubarak’s executive powers were handed over to the military Friday morning. Despite the military’s close connection with the U.S., their handling of the uprising has thus far been sensible, Latoyef said.
“The army is acting in a respectable manner today, and it is not showing any signs of greed to power. Of course, on the other hand, when you taste power, you want to keep it. That’s human nature,” he said.
“What’s needed now is to put the army in check all the time – not to make it feel that it has the right to make decisions. It’s just a caretaker,” he added.
Latoyef noted, as many others have, that there is no obvious successor to the current provisional government, nor does Egypt have any well-organized political parties at the moment.
“It’s a problem, but I think it’s also a safeguard – meaning that the fact that there is no one dominant party in Egypt at this point is part of the road to a healthy growth in the Egyptian democratic process,” he said.
Henaway commented on the broader impact the Egyptian revolution will have on the Arab world.
“Tomorrow in Algeria there is a national day of action; we see ongoing demonstrations in Jordan, Yemen, and all over the Arab world. A movement is really, really burgeoning at this moment and I think is taking everybody by surprise.”
Dina, who grew up in Cairo, also attended the demonstration.
“Me and my husband left Egypt and came here because we [didn’t] find a good job, and there is no security there – a lot of problems in Egypt,” she said. “I’m so happy he’s gone, because a lot of people are suffering from poverty and a lot of people don’t have an opportunity to have work.”

2011-03-12,McGill,Israel,"Ali Abunimah speaks to the validity of Israeli apartheid
On Wednesday night Ali Abunimah, executive director of the website electronicintifada.net and author of One Country: A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, discussed why he believed Israel to be an apartheid state and how the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel would be an effective tool for changing the status quo for the Palestinian people.
Abunimah spoke in the Bronfman building as the keynote speaker for Montreal’s Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW), co-hosted by nine different organizations from the Montreal and McGill communities.
In making a comparison to the South African apartheid system, which rendered certain individuals second-class citizens, Abunimah outlined what he believed to be inequalities for Palestinians in terms of land rights and access to education.
“Palestinians living in Israel are able to vote and run for office but that’s where their rights end,” he said.
Abunimah described an incident in which state employees denied Arab-Israelis their land rights. “In Jerusalem we continue to see the systematic ethnic cleansing…where there is a house-by-house plan to expel Palestinians from their neighbourhoods and to put them in Jewish settlements.”
Abunimah also spoke to the treatment of people in the Gaza strip as creating an apartheid style inequality between Jews and Palestinians. In particular he focused on the December 2008 to January 2009 Operation Cast Lead attack on Gaza and the current restrictions on the movement of resources to the strip.
“Of the 640 schools in the Gaza Strip during Operation Cast Lead in 2008, 18 schools were completely destroyed  – eight of them being kindergartens – and more than 240 were damaged,” he said. “Not only was Israel content to bomb the schools in Gaza, but since then has not allowed construction materials to flow into Gaza to rebuild these schools.”
Abunimah went on to describe the BDS movement, and why he believes it is an important method of lobbying the Israeli government to change its policies towards Palestinians and Arab-Israelis.
“The three goals of the BDS movement are to end the occupation since 1967, end all forms of discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel, and end the racist exclusion of Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes,” he said.
He went on to state why he believes that other methods of resolving the conflict have been ineffective. He stated that BDS is the only possible option considering the failure of peace initiatives thus far.
“For the past twenty years we’ve had something called the peace process…it has been nothing but an alibi for inaction…when told about the Palestinian condition politicians in Canada and the United States do not do anything because they don’t want to disturb the peace process.”
Opposition to IAW includes the McGill Friends of Israel, who posted articles on their Facebook page criticizing the event, including a statement released by the Prince Arthur Herald’s editorial board entitled “We All Must Condemn Israeli Apartheid Week.”
The Daily spoke with Brendan Steven, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Herald regarding Abunimah’s comments.
“Palestinians living in Israel are given the right to vote and to run for office,” Steven said. “Israel is the only liberal democracy in the Middle East…anyone that claims that Israel is an apartheid state is anti-Semitic.”
An audience member questioned Abunimah about why he did not address the treatment of Jews in Arab countries during his talk.
“I support the full right of restitution to any property that was confiscated from Arab Jews who left the countries and went to live in Israel,” Abunimah responded. “I would like to see Arab-Jewish communities thriving again.”
Aaron Lakoff, an organizer of Montreal’s IAW, spoke after Abunimah’s talk about the goal of the events. Montreal’s IAW ends tomorrow.
“We are trying to open up spaces for dialogue in society and for debate on these issues. We are trying to do so in a pluralistic way,” he said. “I am Jewish and I am an organizer of Israeli Apartheid Week. There’s many Jews who were involved in organizing Israeli Apartheid week, not just in Montreal but across Canada.”

2011-03-26,McGill,Israel,"New partnership launched last November; concerns focus on human rights program
A group of students in McGill’s Faculty of Law met with administrators Friday to express their opposition and concerns regarding a new program launched in conjunction with Israel’s Hebrew University.
The faculties participating in  joint initiatives are Medicine, Management, Law, and Agriculture. Specific projects revolve around health and epigenetics, international business, human rights law, and food safety and water management.
Sam Bick, U4 History, spoke about the wider implications of McGill’s association with Hebrew University.
“McGill’s partnership with Hebrew University, as well as the Technion [Israel Institute of Technology], is clear support on the part of University for an apartheid government,” he said. “Beyond tangible effect of the research done at these universities, it’s important to acknowledge the apartheid in education, and Palestinians face multiple levels of unequal access to education.”
Fundraising for the partnership is ongoing, but according to Vice President (Research and International Relations) Rosie Goldstein, $1.5 million has already been raised to fund the partnership by “both McGill donors and CFHU[Canadian Friends of Hebrew University], with the proceeds shared by both universities.”
The initiative was announced in November when CFHU presented the 2010 Scopus Award to McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum. The Scopus Award is the “highest award that the Friends of Hebrew University gives out ” said Carolyn Steinman, director of the Montreal branch of CFHU.
Steinman described the previous relationship between McGill and Hebrew University as “friendly,” though this is the first formal relationship established between the two institutions. She added that Munroe-Blum encouraged the partnership after a visit to Hebrew University.
Goldstein pointed to shared research interests as a factor that lead to the collaboration.
“A trip to Israel in 2008 by a number of senior administrators, for example, led to a conversation between our Dean of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Chandra Madramootoo, and experts there. They realized they had similar research interests, especially around the subject of water, and this led to a joint project in Kenya,” wrote Goldstein in an email to The Daily.
Steinman explained that research in epigenetics “will look at disease in a fundamentally new way by providing novel tools for prediction, diagnosis, and prevention.” She added that the project on food security and water management “will initiate a two-university program to improve the lives of the world’s most disadvantaged people,” she added.
Part of the initiative includes a summer law program called The McGill/Hebrew University Summer Program in Human Rights, which is a collaboration between McGill’s Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism (CHRLP) and the Minerva Centre for Human Rights at Hebrew University. The topic for summer 2011 is “Regulating Internal Diversity.”
McGill Dean of Law Daniel Jutras described the objectives of the program’s human rights component.
“The program explores the human rights implications of the regulation of internal diversity given the very different models inspiring Canada, said to be a ‘multicultural mosaic,’ and Israel, said to be a ‘Jewish and Democratic State,’” wrote Jutras in an email to The Daily.
“This brings up issues of law and identities, discrimination and equality, the integration of immigrants and refugees, and the rights to autonomy and self-determination,” he added.
Jutras said that the concerned students and the CHRLP were engaged in a “fruitful dialogue,” and noted that the groups will continue to communicate over the next several weeks.
Safia Lakhani, a third-year law student, expressed reservations about the program. “I don’t know that the institution we’re partnering with shares the same ideals that McGill does, like democratic dissent, equality and a commitment to human rights,” she said.
Lakhani added that she felt it is “particularly perverse that this program would be called ‘Regulating Internal Diversity,’ when there’s been international criticism of the appropriation of Palestinian land and the demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem by the Israeli government.”
“This [program] is particularly worrying about what it says about our standards,” said Lakhani. She stressed the need to consider “what the implications are for the faculty of law, especially our centre for human rights, to endorse this program.”
Goldstein responded to the students’ concerns by stating, “It is likely students have divergent views about all sorts of research that is conducted at McGill and the research partnerships in which the University becomes engaged. McGill, as a leading research-intensive institution, engages with other top-level institutions all over the world.”
“I know that many, many of our students enjoy the incredible experiences international collaborations provide for them,” she added.
Douglas Smith, a member of the Montreal-based Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! called upon McGill to respect the movement for boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
“We support BDS, so we’re calling for academic boycott in the frame of the Palestinian call for BDS,” said Smith, a graduate student at Concordia and member of Tadamon! “The Hebrew Universtiy partnership obviously signals a complete ignorance as far as the role of Israeli institutions of higher learning in human rights abuses.”

SEPTEMBER
Frosh
Frosh season never goes by without some flak, and this year was no exception. Management Undergraduate Society Frosh planned a tribal frosh that drew accusations of racism and cultural insensitivity for its overt thematization of indigineous culture: MUS president Céline Junke apologized online, and the theme was subsequently toned down to “Superheroes.”
In the meantime, Nampande Londe Arts Undergraduate Society VP Events resigned after announcing that AUS frosh was severely in the red.
Architecture Café closed
Students returned to school to find that the historic cafe in the basement of the Macdonald-Harrington building – and the most popular meeting place relatively free of the homogenizing hand of McGill Food and Dining services – was permanently shut down. Morton Mendelson told the Reporter that “there was no such thing as a free lunch,” and revealed his stance on student-run enterprise outside of Shatner to the Daily: “I assume it was being run in good faith by students who were really dedicated to the enterprise… but the café was essentially run like a lemonade stand.”
SSMU endorsed a lively boycott of McGill Food and Dining Services and students retaliated with a hundreds-strong protest outside of two Senate meetings. Later in the semester, The Daily found that the cafe was running a minor deficit after MFDS took their cut (they partly managed the operations). Emails revealing back-and-forth between the ASA, the EUS, and the administration over the cafes future were obtained from an Access to Information request.
Bikes banned
Students complained about the lack of consultation when the administration began enforcing a campus ban on bike riding, coupled with the rhetoric of a greener, more pedestrian friendly space.
Abidor v. Napolitano
Pascal Abidor – a McGill Islamic Studies PhD student and American citizen – took on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security after being detained at the U.S. border and having his laptop held for 11 days in May 2010.
He was challenging American policy that allowed for border searches without reasonable suspicion.
Streetwalkers come indoors
Ontario Superior Justice Susan Himel struck down three provisions of the Criminal Code that placed sex workers at risk in the now historic case Bedford v. Canada. The three provisions – communicating to solicit sex, running or working in a brothel, and living off income procured by sex work – were ruled to be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms when they were challenged in court by Terri Jean Bedford, a dominatrix, and two former sex workers.
 
OCTOBER
Union drive
The Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM) began to organize a union for course lecturers – McGill’s are among the lowest-paid in the province – but faced obstacles from the administration. After an altercation involving the removal of AGSEM posters, more than twenty faculty members signed an open letter stating their support for AGSEM’s campaign and denouncing the administration’s behaviour.
Omar Khadr
Former child soldier and Canadian citizen Omar Khadr pleads guilty to a military commission on five charges – including the murder of American medic Sargeant Christopher Sheer – on a plea bargain deal that reduces his sentence to eight years, with permission to apply for transfer to Canada after one year.
Khadr was 15 when he was captured by American troops in 2002 in Afghanistan after throwing a fatal hand grenade and has spent over eight years at the detention centre at Guantamo; Prime Minister Stephen Harper repeatedly stonewalled court decisions to repatriate Khadr.
 
NOVEMBER
Construction Halted
Construction of the $1.34-billion McGill University Health Centre was halted after companies were issued a “stop-work order” for beginning construction on a temporary parking lot in the City of Westmount without a building permit.
State of emergency declared
On October 21, the remote First Nation community of Eabametoong is sent two OPP officers after Chief Lewis Nate declared a state of emergency. The declaration was made in response to a number of escalating issues the small community had recently faced, including the arson of a local school, two murders of local youth and the fire-bombing of a church minister’s house while five people were inside.
Pizza with the IDF
The Jewish Studies Student Assocation (JSSA), along with the Bronfman Israel Experience Centre – commonly known as Birthright – hosted a pizza lunch and discussion with three IDF soldiers in the Jewish Studies building on November 4. Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) organized a protest outside of the event to demonstrate against the presence of Israeli military on campus.
Bill C-300
Bill C-300 – a private member’s bill – would have held Canadian mining companies accountable for infractions against the environment and human rights, if enacted. The bill was first brought forward by Liberal MP John McKay with assistance from the University of Ottawa, McGill, and the University of Toronto. Stephen Harper, who normally does not vote on private members’ bills, was present and had his caucus vote against the bill. Canadian mining companies have close relationships with the economy and the federal Canada Pension Plan. The bill was defeated 140 votes to 134 votes.
Arch Cafe’s docs revealed
After two of the biggest campus rallies in recent memory, getting access to the Arch Café’s financial books, and continuous sleuthing, The Daily received a document dump that finally broke the story wide open. The documents included personal emails between administrators and student politicians, internal memoranda, and reports. The documents came after filing an Access to Information request; the new information shed light on the decision-making process surrounding the closure and detailed the coordinated media strategy on the part of the administration.
 
DECEMBER
Quebec City protest
On December 6 student and labour unions gathered in Quebec City to protest the second Rencontre des partenaires en éducation – a meeting of provincial government ministers and university administrators regarding austerity measures and tuition increases.  Over 60, 000 students were present; most were members of the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ). The strike was province-wide. Representatives from student, professor, and labour unions walked out of the meeting due to what they saw as the government’s unwillingness to negotiate on proposed tuition hikes.

2011-04-02,McGill,Israel,"Israeli blockade and fears of weapons trafficking hindering relief efforts
The Canadian Boat to Gaza initiative is in the midst of fundraising for its contingent in the Freedom Flotilla II, a multinational humanitarian fleet with boats from Greece, the U.S., and Denmark dedicated to breaking the blockade on the Gaza Strip.
Thus far, the Canadian Boat to Gaza has raised $240,000, with a goal of $300,000. The fleet is set to depart in mid-May.
Ehab Lotayeff, an organizer for Canadian Boat to Gaza, spoke of the necessity of such an endeavor.
“The blockade is unjustified; it’s a punishment towards the people and that’s why we see that sending a boat to Gaza is very important, and challenging the blockade is very important,” said Lotayeff.
“Our number one goal is to challenge the status quo here [in Canada] that the blockade in Gaza is legitimate…another goal is humanitarian aid and moral support. Even though we might not deliver enough aid, [the people in Gaza] need to know that the world is not leaving them alone,” he continued.
Operation Cast Lead, the December 2008 to January 2009 conflict in Gaza, left numerous hospitals, libraries, and schools destroyed. Since the war’s end, Israel has maintained a blockade in the region, only allowing a minimal amount of goods to enter. The blockade was ruled illegal under international law by the 2009 UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. According to the UN report, the blockade violates the Fourth Geneva Convention that governs the protection of civilians in a war zone.
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) has previously stopped or attacked Gaza-bound flotillas. One of the most violent incidents occurred in May 2010, when the IDF attacked and killed nine activists.
Glyn Secker, an executive member of the Jews for Justice for Palestinians, spoke on March 25 at an event organized by the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights. He described an incident in September 2010, when he was the captain of a boat to Gaza, where the IDF surrounded the boat, tasered one of the crewmembers, and forced the boat to dock in the Israeli port of Ashdod.
Some pro-Israel organizations, including campus groups, fear the security threat from Gaza and do not support ships coming to the strip without being inspected by the IDF.
“There’s a difference between delivering aid into the Gaza Strip and deliberately trying to break a military blockade and endanger Israeli security,” said Zach Paikin, VP External of the McGill Friends of Israel.
Rex Brynen, a McGill Political Science professor who travelled to Gaza in January 2010, said the Israeli restrictions on economic goods were in fact making it easier to get weapons into Gaza.
“I say that because there didn’t use to be so many tunnels,” said Brynen. “The reason there were so many tunnels from Egypt is because Israeli restrictions on imports meant that goods had to be smuggled from tunnels.”
Paikin defended the blockade, saying he believed aid can be sent to Gaza through Israel.
“If [humanitarian organizations] want to bring aid into the Gaza strip they are welcome to do so, yet they just only have to do so through the appropriate crossings…they should not go directly to the Gaza strip because that’s how weapons are transported,” Paikin said.
Brynen, however, described how non-military goods, such as construction materials, were being held up.
“There’s multiple cases where it’s clear that construction materials will be in the custody of the UN and Israel has not allowed it in…if it’s a UN reconstruction program, there’s no risk that those goods somehow leak into paramilitary use,” Brynen said.
“There’s no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” Paikin said. “If you go to the Gaza strip, there are nice beaches, five-star restaurants and hotels, and new shopping malls.”
Lotayeff has visited Gaza twice since Operation Cast Lead in 2009.
“Schools and farms are destroyed to no recognition, there’s lots of damage in Gaza city and more so in refugee camps,” said Lotayeff. “Because of the blockade, the people of Gaza cannot build anything.”

2011-04-08,McGill,Israel,"ERIN HUDSON – THE MCGILL DAILY
 
Tensions arose Tuesday at Queer McGill’s (QM) general assembly as the group attempted to pass a constitutional amendment mandating them to boycott international bodies and institutions they consider to be oppressive.
Many of those who opposed the amendment – which was voted down 26 to 24 – saw it as a veiled attack on Israel, although QM Treasurer Kevin Paul explained that the amendment had a wide scope.
“We did not want to single out any particular conflict, nation, state,” Paul said. He added that it was not an endorsement of the movement for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
SSMU speaker Cathal Rooney-Céspedes voiced his opposition to the amendment at the meeting, and explained that he viewed it as a politicization of a SSMU club on the “wholly decisive issue” of Israel-Palestine.
“I would really hate for someone – if QM were to take a stance against Israel – of Israeli descent and who is looking for a community of LGBT to not feel welcome in QM because of the stances they take external to queer politics,” he said.
The text of the motion read, “Queer McGill resolves to adopt financial practices that oppose international state oppression. … Queer McGill shall limit the definition of bodies that fund state oppression to corporations and institutions which directly, or through the redirection of their profits by primary stakeholders, contribute, financially or through sharing of resources, to the official practices of an oppressive regime or its agents.”
According to QM co-administrator Ryan Thom, the amendment was controversial among the QM community, and he had expected it to be “debated hotly.”
Thom asserted that the GA lost its traditional informality when Rooney-Céspedes demanded the meeting adhere to a strict version of Robert’s Rules.
“QM runs on a very informal basis,” he said, and only nominally adheres to Robert’s Rules.
“I think what was lost was our ability to communicate with each other in a non-hierarchical fashion,” said Thom. “To identify as queer and then walk into a queer general assembly – that is a powerful symbolic gesture and that was threatened. I think that’s why we saw people crying and reacting so strongly.”
“It angers and frustrates me to see constituents looking so upset, expressing such discontent, such disenfranchisement,” he added.
Rooney-Céspedes spoke to the outcome of the assembly and his view on QM’s proposed amendment.
“I truly do regret the way that I made people feel but I don’t regret fighting for something that I feel so strongly about,” said Rooney-Céspedes.
He said he felt that without rules to govern the meeting, it would have degenerated into a free-for-all.
“I think that when you’re debating contentious issues there needs to be an order to the way that things are done,” he said.
“If you don’t know or if you’re not as aware of the rules then it can come off as intimidating – and I do sympathize with that. Otherwise I think that it was a very well-run debate with all things considered,” said Rooney-Céspedes.
The issue was raised again at SSMU Council on Thursday night, which was the final council meeting of the school year. VP External Myriam Zaidi prepared a letter regarding the events at Tuesday’s assembly and her recommendations for the response of SSMU Council.
“In my letter I was urging the Speaker of Council to write an apology letter,” said Zaidi. “I feel like there was a lack of accountability.”
Zaidi did not finish reading her letter due to interruptions.
Thom then addressed Council on behalf of QM. After hearing his speech, the councillors ruled to issue a statement reaffirming their commitment to safe space on campus.
Thom said he would have liked to see a more supportive declaration.
“I had thought that SSMU was a powerful and strong space for promoting QM’s existence,” he said. “It’s just sad that the idea of protecting our space from people who should be protecting us.”
Zaidi noted her disappointment that some members of Council did not recognize the problematic nature of the events at the meeting.
“They apologized for people feeling uncomfortable but not for the events. If you’re going to go saying things that are patronizing, [it’s better] not to say anything,” she said.
Zaidi added that she was emotionally affected by Tuesday’s meeting.
“It’s extremely unacceptable,” she said.
Rooney-Céspedes said that his job as Speaker did not prevent him from participating in political debates outside of SSMU Council. After leaving Council Thursday night, however, he said he intended to write letters of apology.

2011-09-15,McGill,Israel,"Israeli Apartheid Week cited as major concern
On July 7, the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism (CPCCA) issued its report regarding the presence of anti-semitism in Canada. The coalition was formed in 2009 out of a conference organized by the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism (IPCCAS). The coalition’s website states that the July report aims to “confront and combat” anti-Semitism. 
Amongst some of the recommendations in the report is the call for politicians to condemn Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) events on Canadian university campuses. 
The report states that, “While this phenomenon [anti-Semitism] takes many forms, including traditional expressions of anti-Semitism, it is increasingly manifesting itself in terms of anti-Israel discourse that denies the Jewish people the right to self determination.”
Certain student groups, like Hillel McGill, believe that events like IAW do not seek to foster academic discourse. Arielle Segal, co-President of Hillel McGill, said, “events like that are a failure and only seek to divide campus community as well as delegitimize, through inflammatory rhetoric and bully tactics, the only democracy in the region [Israel].”
Concerns of the report’s implications for free speech on campus have been raised by some student organizations. Anna Malla, internal coordinator at QPIRG McGill said, “this is clearly an affront to freedom of speech on campus, and labels an event [IAW] – designed to investigate injustices perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the Israeli state – as ‘anti-Semitic,’ when, in fact, this event has nothing to do with hatred toward any religious or ethnic group.”
The Inquiry Panel in the CPCCA report states that, in the interest of free speech, they do not think it appropriate for university administrators to ban the event from taking place.
Tadamon!, a Montreal collective of social justice activists associated with the planning of Israeli Apartheid Week, sees the report as misleading in the ways it represents anti-Semitic behaviour.
“Anti-Semitism should not be confused as criticism of the Israeli state,” stated Claire Hurtig, a representative of Tadamon!
Malla questioned the intentions of the report. 
 “It would be amazing if our government had designed this committee to actually fight against anti-Semitism,” she added. 
Segal pointed to other reasons students may not want IAW events on campus. “For the most part students have simply tuned out. Students are simply tired of obsessive hate fests.”
In 2009, the Inquiry Panel invited the presidents of 25 Canadian universities to give testimony. Frederick Lowy, then-president emeritus of Concordia University, was one of the few who accepted.
In Lowy’s testimony, he stated that he believed that “by and large … most Canadian universities are safe.”

2011-10-27,McGill,Israel,"Protests and massacres in home country denied, blamed on foreign nations and media
A day before Tunisia’s first free national elections, members of the Syrian community in Montreal gathered in force to support the authoritarian president of their homeland, Bashar al-Assad, and to denounce protesters whom the Syrian army has killed by the thousands this year.
Beginning in the late afternoon, and continuing until nearly eight in the evening, around two hundred people met on the west side of Parc Jeanne-Mance, chanting “We support Bashar al-Assad” in Arabic and carrying placards sporting pro-Assad slogans, like “We trust our president.”
The Montreal rally came a few days after a government-organized rally, attended by tens of thousands of Assad loyalists, in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo.
Assad succeeded his father as Syrian president in 2000. Since March, Assad has been sending armed troops, tanks, and snipers into Syrian cities in response to largely peaceful protests calling for democratic reforms and, more recently, for Assad’s ouster. The UN estimates that over 3,000 people have been killed in the government crackdown, including nearly 200 children. Opposition groups maintain the number of dead is over 5,000.
Some of the protestors on Saturday denied the existence of large-scale unrest in Syria. “Thanks to God, everything is perfect,” said one man, who did not give his name. “Everything in Syria is positive. There is nothing negative. And all of Syria, they support Bashar [al-]Assad.”
Asked why there were protestors in the streets of Syrian cities – tens of thousands have participated in protests nationwide – the man replied, “The people of Syria are 23 million. If you see a few – five, ten, twenty – that doesn’t change.”
Those that did acknowledge the protests in Syria were quick to label them the product of foreign interference. The countries named by demonstrators ranged from Turkey and Saudi Arabia to France and the United States.
One man called for “the Americans and the French to leave Syria alone. We can fix our own problems. Our president is working on it.”
U.S. President Barack Obama called for Assad to “step aside” in August, the same day the U.S. imposed energy sanctions on Syria.
Several demonstrators suggested that Israel was bankrolling the protests as retribution for Assad’s hard-line stance towards the Jewish state.
Assad is “the only one right now in the whole world who’s standing up against the West and the Israelis,” said a man who gave his name as Reffat A.
Reffat went on to say that Turkey and Lebanon were assisting the Syrian opposition because “they want to give a good face to the Israeli lobby, the Jewish lobby.”
There was a widespread feeling amongst demonstrators that the international media is inflating the scope of the Syrian uprising, and distorting its true nature.
“I think all the media have no respect…for the reality and for the truth,” said one man, who asked not to be named.
“It’s a media war,” said Rami Kaplo, a Montreal lawyer.
“A lot of people just despise the Western media because of the lies,” he continued. “The Western media is not even admitting there are armed gangs” among protestors in Syria.
He pointed to the BBC, CNN, and France 24 as examples.
A number of demonstrators echoed the claim that the Syrian uprising is made up of criminals. The Syrian government frequently defends its use of force against protestors by saying that “armed gangs” have killed hundreds of soldiers and police. Despite recent reports of sporadic violence by members of the anti-Assad opposition, including the assassination of a pro-regime cleric, the vast majority of people killed since March have been unarmed protestors, according to embassies and human rights groups in Syria. Foreign journalists have largely been barred from the country.
Many of Saturday’s demonstrators were also alarmed by the presence of the Muslim Brotherhood in the uprising, saying Islamists threatened to shatter the Syria’s delicate balance of religious and sectarian groups currently held together by a rigidly secular state.
Rex Brynen, professor of political science at McGill, acknowledged that many Syrians who are not part of the majority Sunni sect of Islam are worried about encroaching Islamism.
But, he noted in an email to The Daily, “a great many of the protesters opposing the current regime in Syria are themselves avowed secularists.”
“In any case, the objection rather misses the point. Syrians should be free to decide on the nature of their political system, whether secular or non-secular, through free and fair elections. Rather than offering his people this most basic of human rights, however, Bashar al-Assad instead offers only bloody repression in an increasingly desperate attempt to cling to political power,” he continued.
One man, watching the rally with friends visiting from Syria, called those participating “kind of ignorant.”
“In Syria right now people are dying. So watching people supporting him, [playing] music while you have people dying, is kind of sad,” he said.
A march in protest of human rights abuses in Syria is scheduled for this Saturday, starting at noon in Norman Bethune Square.
Kaplo offered a cautious defence of the actions of the current regime. “Maybe they could have dealt with it differently,” he said of the crackdown. “If you’re talking about human rights, it might be wrong. But we’re talking about politics.”

2012-01-21,McGill,Israel,"Donors contribute millions to McGill’s budget every year
McGill runs on $1.04 billion a year.
It is the only Canadian university to place in the top 25 of the QS World University Rankings eight years in a row, competing against privately-funded universities in North America.
Like many other schools, McGill places considerable effort into obtaining donations to support its competitive status – between 2008 and 2011, McGill received $78.5 million from 32,051 donors.
Derek Cassoff, director of communications of Development and Alumni Relations, explained that “about 75 per cent of our gifts come from individuals, the majority of whom are alumni.”
“Every donation shows not only a big financial investment, but the personal engagement speaks volumes to the rest of the community both in Montreal and Canada,” he said.
Dean of Arts Christopher Manfredi pointed out that McGill “was founded as a result of a philanthropic gift – James McGill’s bequest – so our origins are in philanthropy, and like most universities, [McGill] has depended on philanthropy for a portion of its revenue.”
Ayesha Mayan, associate director of the Annual Fund – McGill’s yearly appeal to alumni, parents, faculty and staff, and friends to help support the University – pointed to a long history of alumni support. The Annual Fund has existed since 1948.
Lesley Preston, a U2 Chemistry and Political Science student, worked at the Phonathon, a program that solicits donations from alumni and parents. It hires 60 to 75 students a year, each of whom spend a minimum of eight hours a week calling potential donors.
Preston spoke to being subject to aggressive responses from some – one person she called “went on for many minutes about how he would never donate to McGill because they support Israeli apartheid.”
During the MUNACA strike, some alumni and parents expressed similar sentiments about their donations.
Still, Cassoff estimated that about 25 per cent of alumni donate.
According to Mayan, “45 per cent of our donations from the Annual Fund are under $100, which totals about half a million dollars.”
Service Point, which has existed for two years, was supported by the Annual Fund in order to create an “accessible way for students to get information they need,” said Mayan.
Alumni and parents can donate to any organization on campus. “You could donate to the Red Cross through McGill, so you’re not necessarily supporting McGill administration and stances, but the students that are trying to get involved even outside the University,” Preston said.
Mayan agreed: “The overwhelming majority of dollars we bring in go to specific programs, not the overall budget of the University.”
She explained that the Annual Fund has recently begun soliciting donations from parents of students.
“The culture of philanthropy in the States has been longer standing than in Canada,” said Mayan.
Cassoff agreed. “In Canada, there is a certain culture that education is considered as part of service that government provides,” he said.
“In the US there is a long history of private education, separate from government service,” Cassoff said. “Here, it’s equated with healthcare and other social service deliveries.”
Manfredi explained that “certainly, philanthropy is not our main revenue; McGill is largely a publically funded University.”
“I’d say philanthropy contributes in total maybe 10 to 15 per cent of the overall revenue available to the University,” he said.
“When you look at where McGill ranks internationally, we are operating with a much lower budget, and we are still having the same output on a research level,” said  Mayan.
“[Donations] can have a huge impact, and an impact right away,” Mayan said.

2012-01-26,McGill,Israel,"Justice discloses previous involvement with OPIRG
Since students Zach Newburgh and Brendan Steven announced the filing of a Judicial Board (J-Board) case against Elections SSMU’s Chief Electoral Officer Rebecca Tacoma, SSMU executives and J-Board justices have both released statements regarding their involvement in the case.
The case challenges the results of the fall 2011 referendum question regarding QPIRG’s existence and opt-out system.
SSMU President Maggie Knight released a statement explaining that VP University Affairs Emily Clare will spearhead SSMU decisions relating to the J-Board case.
Knight stated that she has “too many different roles in relation to the ongoing Judicial Board case” to make decisions regarding the case, including hiring J-Board justices, acting as supervisor to Tacoma, and a history of personal interactions with petitioners Newburgh and Steven.
Knight specified that she voted to censure Newburgh last year following his involvement with Jobbook.
Clare said that she plans to disclose any previous involvement with QPIRG, including professional interactions with the group in her capacity as Equity Commissioner last year.
“I’m not making the decision, just more facilitating the J-Board process,” said Clare.
SSMU’s Conflict of Interest Policy, which was redrafted following last year’s allegations against Newburgh, is also mentioned in the J-Board case itself. The case charges VP Clubs & Services, Carol Fraser, Clubs & Services representative Adam Winer, and former Arts representative Micha Stettin with conflicts of interest.
The three councillors played roles in bringing QPIRG and CKUT’s referendum questions to Council for approval. At the time, Fraser and Winer were members of the CKUT ‘yes’ committee, while Stettin sat on the QPIRG Board of Directors.
Discussion also arose around the history of J-Board Justice Raphael Szajnfarber, who was involved in a 2008 Hillel Ottawa dispute with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG).
On Tuesday, Szajnfarber released a statement detailing the situation. Then-President of Hillel Ottawa, Szajnfarber acted as spokesperson for the organization when Hillel complained that OPIRG had refused to provide funding for an event due to Hillel’s connection to Israel.
“I’m the one who liaised with [Szajnfarber] and asked him to put up that statement, because it’s just trying to get as much information out as possible,” Clare said.
Szajnfarber’s statement outlines the steps he took to inform SSMU of his involvement in the situation during his interview for the position of a J-Board Justice, as well as informing his fellow justices and filing an official disclosure form.
Chief Justice David Parry also filed an official disclosure form declaring his former position as staff writer with The Daily and Le Délit, though none of his work covered student politics.
Szajnfarber stated that he has “never met or been in contact with any of the parties to the dispute,” and that none have asked him to step down from the case. QPIRG McGill is not considered a party in the J-Board case; the named parties are Steven, Newburgh, and Tacoma.
SSMU Council will hold a public discussion about the case tonight.
According to a statement released by J-Board, there will not be a decision on the case at the hearing, but a judgment will be made “within a reasonable delay after the hearing.” The hearing is set for Monday, January 30.

2012-04-15,McGill,Israel,"Clarification of SSMU by-laws hopes to smooth group’s second referendum
From April 10-16, an online referendum is being held regarding Quebec Public Interest Research Group’s (QPIRG) status as a PIRG, as well as its lease of its building from McGill on University.
Hubie Yu, new Elections SSMU Chief Electoral Officer, has taken steps toward more clearly defining external student organizations, which was an issue during the referendum campaign QPIRG ran last fall.
“The definition of whether a certain organization or individual is ‘external to SSMU’ was a pretty grey zone in the fall…but it’s been cleared up since then,” said Yu.
Yu said she worked with SSMU President Maggie Knight to amend SSMU by-laws with a clearer definition, and on March 29 SSMU Council approved the amendment.
QPIRG is holding the special referendum as a result of the McGill administration’s request for a new vote before beginning negotiations regarding QPIRG’s Memorandum of Agreement (MoA).
 The administration voided the result of QPIRG’s fall referendum, citing that the referendum question had been confusing.
 This referendum period, the ‘no’ camp is using QPIRG’s support of the #6party occupation of the James Administration Building earlier in February as the focus of its campaign. The committee is banking on the perceived unpopularity of the occupation as a way to encourage students to vote ‘no.’ 
Elissa Brock, a member of the ‘no’ committee, elaborated via email: “QPIRG has lost the support of students. No one agrees with their divisive political causes and their support of 6party. They are asking for more than a fee: they are asking students to cough up $141,000, the total cost of cleaning up the mess 6party left behind.” 
The ‘no’ campaign also decried what Brock called QPIRG’s “divisive other dealings,” including its support of Tadamon!, a pro-Palestinian advocacy group that has raised controversy in the past through, according to the ‘yes’ committee, “supporting the removal of Hezbollah from Canada’s official list of terrorist organizations,” among other initiatives such as encouraging boycotts of Israeli products and organizing Israeli Apartheid Week. 
The QPIRG ‘yes’ committee sought to counter Brock’s argument that QPIRG does not represent the majority of students. 
Lena Weber, a press liaison for the ‘yes’ committee, described campus support for QPIRG as “overwhelming.”
“We’re just trying to build on that. So many people from all departments and faculties have been tirelessly getting the word out. We’re basically building upon the amazing momentum and love for everything QPIRG does that we saw last fall, when an overwhelming majority voted ‘yes.’”
The referendum held last fall – in which 65.6 per cent voted in favour of the question – included a clause changing the opt-out system to end online opt-outs. This result was challenged and eventually invalidated by McGill’s Judicial Board due to it “[dealing] with two issues, instead of one as required by the [SSMU] Constitution.”
As to the ‘no’ committee’s charge that QPIRG was an active participant in the #6party occupation of the James building, Weber denied this claim.
“We’re trying to continue to clarify that QPIRG was not involved in the #6party occupation at all. In fact, they found out about it at the same time as everyone else on campus. Contrary to some assertions, nobody who held a director position at the time of the #6party occupation was involved in its planning or execution,” Weber said.
“A vocal minority seems to take issue with QPIRG’s respect for students’ right to take political action, but we think it is important to stand in solidarity with people who are engaged in their own struggles. QPIRG tried to bring a speedy resolution to the occupation by asking McGill to set up a meeting between QPIRG, the occupiers, and a member of the administration, though the meeting was refused,” she added.
When the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ campaigns were asked about interactions between the two, they emphasized that, other than “correcting misinformation” on both sides, no dialogue has been attempted. Campaign violations have occurred on both sides, all of which have been publicized through Elections SSMU listserv emails.
The ‘yes’ committee has been sanctioned for receiving an endorsement from an external organization, and the ‘no’ committee has been sanctioned for engaging in slanderous campaigning.
The other issue that the referendum addresses is the addition of an online ratification system requiring a quorum of 15 per cent participation regarding motions that have been passed at General Assemblies.

2012-11-16,McGill,Israel,"At least 15 dead, 118 wounded in first day of operation
Over fifty people gathered in front of the Hall Building of Concordia University at 6 p.m. on Wednesday to protest the launch of Israel’s most recent Gaza military operation, “Operation Pillar of Defence”, which began earlier that day.
Sara Sheltony, one of the organizers of the demonstration and a member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights Concordia (SPHR Concordia) told The Daily that the purpose of the demonstration was to “give a place for Palestinians in Montreal and others to express their sadness, frustration, and anger at what is happening in Gaza and Palestine in general.”
She also mentioned that they wished to “raise awareness among the Canadian population and the population in Montreal about the occupation and the apartheid that is happening in Israel, and about the massacre that is about to happen in Gaza and the massacre that happened in 2008 and 2009.”
Sheltony attributed the speed with which they managed to organize the demonstration to “the power of Facebook.” According to Sheltony, the event was posted to Facebook at 12:30 p.m., and by 3 p.m. over 100 people had confirmed their attendance.
Operation Pillar of Defence came four years after Israel’s three-month “Operation Cast Lead” from December 2008 to January 2009 – also known as the Gaza War – in which over 1,400 Gazans were killed.
Escorted by police cars, the demonstrators marched down Ste. Catherine – which had been blocked off by police cars from Concordia to Phillips Square for the march – chanting “Solidarité avec des Palestiniens,” “Palestine will be free, from the river to the sea,” and “Israel terrorist, Harper complicit.”
Scarlet Harris, a McGill student who participated in the demonstration, told The Daily, “The international community cannot sit back and watch bombs fall on Gaza.  We are complicit in Israel’s war crimes, and therefore I’m here to show my solidarity.”
When the demonstration reached Phillips Square, speakers Doug Smith, Dan Freeman-Maloy, Mostafa Henaway, and Antoine Bustros gave speeches on the issue.
Henaway, a member of the Tadamon! collective, explained that Canada was the first country to cut off aid to Palestine when Hamas was elected.
Activist and writer Freeman-Maloy agreed, accusing Canada of “cheering whenever Israel attacks Palestinians.” According to Freeman-Maloy, it is critical to build international pressure to block Israel from being able to commit these kinds of crimes.
One demonstrator called the operation “an insult to the modern Western society.”
“I am a Palestinian, I was born in Lebanon, I am Canadian,” they said. “I do not believe in lands, borders, and citizenships.”
At the time of the demonstration, Palestinians reported 15 dead – including an 11-month old boy and 7-year-old girl – and 118 wounded. Among the dead was the top military commander of Hamas.
According to Sheltony, these “indiscriminate” killings were “done by a state that definitely has the military capability to target accurately,” and are “very hard to justify.”

2012-11-23,McGill,Israel,"More than 60,000 students with strike mandate
Last week was marked by student strikes and protests across the world, including more than 60,000 CEGEP and university students on strike in Quebec on November 22. Yesterday, the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante (ASSÉ) organized a demonstration in Montreal in solidarity with the ongoing student movement, drawing about 5,000 protesters into the streets, according to ASSÉ spokesperson Jérémie Bédard-Wien.
“We’re marching in solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of students who are fighting daily against the commodification of education in other countries as part of the global strike in education week,” Bédard-Wien told The Daily. “We’re proud to join this global movement today.”
This fall, the Parti Québécois cancelled the tuition hikes for Quebec students that had been implemented by Jean Charest’s Liberal government – but protesters gathered nonetheless, echoing the marches that occurred each 22nd day of the month during the student strike, which often saw up to 200,000 participants at a single demonstration.
Bédard-Wien called Thursday’s march “a natural continuation of the Maple Spring,” emphasizing the Quebec student movement’s significance in a global context.
“We must realize that commodification is an international problem posed by international institutions. The OECD [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development], the European Union – and that does not spare Quebec,” he said.
SSMU VP External Robin Reid-Fraser was among the McGill students who attended the protest. She attributed the lack of a McGill strike vote for November 22 to activism at McGill “taking a different turn” this year.
“I think there’s a different level of energy, it’s not quite the same as it was last semester,” Reid-Fraser told The Daily. “But I think there are still lots of people from McGill at the demonstration.”
Simon, a Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) student and member of its mobilization committee, attended yesterday’s march as one of several costumed participants. The mobilization committee organized a group of students to attend the protest in Christmas-themed costumes, dubbed the “Santa Bloc.”
Simon told The Daily in French that his Santa hat with knitted white braids wasn’t just a festive joke, but a political statement that reached beyond the traditional rhetoric of tuition hikes and education summits.
“[Our costumes] are a way of protesting Christmas as a holiday of widespread capitalist consuming, and at the same time of protesting the new law, which criminalizes wearing masks during protests,” he said. “Now you get not only a fine but can also go to prison if you get caught wearing a mask during an ‘illegal’ demonstration.”
Bédard-Wien claimed that the scope of the protest reached beyond Quebec and struggles over tuition.
“We’re not only marching in solidarity with the student movement, but also with the Palestinian struggle as it faces, once again, attacks from Israeli imperialists. We’re not a movement that’s content with fighting for only our rights, but also to improve society and link up with other progressive parts of society,” he explained.
Despite a significant anti-capitalist contingent at Thursday’s demonstration, Bédard-Wien declined to comment on whether he considered the Quebec student movement to be inherently anti-capitalist.
“Imposing normalized education systems on the American model is imperialism. As for capitalism – some people would love that I address this, but I will not,” he told The Daily.
An hour into the march, the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal tweeted that the protest had been declared illegal but that it would be “tolerated if no criminal acts occur.” There were no reported arrests.

2013-01-28,McGill,Israel,"Carter’s National Security Advisor discusses foreign policy
Zbigniew Brzezinski (McGill BA ‘49, MA ‘50) served as National Security Advisor for U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Brzezinski oversaw the normalization of U.S. relations with China, for which Carter awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Equally notable, Brzezinski’s tenure in the White House also included the Camp David Accords of 1978, which established peace between Israel and Egypt, and the Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis of 1979. Presently, Brzezinski serves as a counsellor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., and as a senior research professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. 
McGill Daily (MD): How would you evaluate the current [U.S.] administration’s handling of the Arab Spring and the war in Syria?
Zbigniew Brzezinski (ZB): I think it has been prudent and cautious, but under the circumstances, that  is justified. The Arab Spring, widely proclaimed by journalists as a great democratic phenomenon, is still uncertain of its historical trajectory. It could easily end up as the “Arab Winter.”
MD: How would you evaluate the relationship between the current administration and Israel? Do you think the administration should be tougher with Netanyahu?
ZB: I think the administration should be guided by its best judgment of the American national interest. What is good for America is almost inevitably good for Israel, given its dependence on America. 
MD: Do you think that the opposite is true, that what is good for Israel is inevitably good for America?
ZB: No, I think that what is good for America is inevitably good for Israel, given its dependence on [our] military and financial support. Now obviously, America is not dependent on Israel for support. 
MD: Do you think that, considering the backlash against the announcement of new settler homes to be built in the West Bank, that the administration should reign in Israel?
ZB: The United States reacted critically and publicly to these decisions. There were statements to that effect both from the White House and from the State Department.
MD: On a different topic, how do you feel about the funding of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan during the Carter administration?
ZB: I think it was a desirable and necessary step, supported by the overwhelming majority of the international community. The Soviet [invasion of Afghanistan] was an outright aggression and it was potentially destabilizing for the entire region. 
MD: Is there a way that America could have prevented the growth of the Taliban out of that funding?
ZB: You know, the Taliban arose about ten years after the Soviet invasion. I don’t think you are very familiar with the facts, judging by that question. The Taliban didn’t appear on the scene until about ten years later. 
MD: But many journalists and commentators have inferred that the funding of the Mujahideen in the late 1970s was somehow responsible for the rise of the Taliban. Do you contend that?
ZB: The rise of the Taliban was the consequence of the destruction of the Afghan society by ten years of war, which was waged by the Soviets against the Afghan resistance.
MD: Okay, on the subject of Iran: do you think that the United States should bear moral responsibility for the replacement of [the democratically elected president] Mossadegh by the Shah, and the backlash against the Shah by the Islamist regime?
ZB: I think the United States was unwise in the way it handled the Mossadegh challenge. I understand the Iranian resentment about what happened in the early 1950s, in other words, almost sixty years ago.
MD: What would you identify as the greatest success and the greatest failure of your time as National Security Advisor?
ZB: I think the greatest successes were several. I think the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt was a major success; I think the opening, both political and strategic, to China, was a very major breakthrough, which continues to shape international affairs to this time. I think the peaceful resolution of the Panama Canal problem created stability in America’s relations with Central America. I think the greatest setback was, of course, the failure of the rescue mission.
MD: On the topic of Iran today, how do you evaluate the nuclear threat?
ZB: I think it potentially could be serious, but in my judgment, it can be handled effectively without a war.
MD: Do you think the regime is sufficiently irrational to launch, or even threaten to launch, a nuclear weapon?
ZB: I don’t think there is one item of evidence to support that proposition. It is a self-serving regime; it is a very scheming regime; but it is not a suicidal regime. And neither is the country suicidal. The Iranians are very intelligent people.
MD: On the topic of Chinese-American relations, how do you think they should evolve? And what is the biggest challenge to the Chinese-American relationship?
ZB: I think the biggest challenge to the relationship is the rising nationalistic fervor in Asia, and the resulting regional instability. The way to cope with it is to have a close, consultative relationship with the Chinese, so that each side has a better understanding of the other side’s point of view and interests. Okay, one more question, okay?
MD: On the subject of the U.S. economy: do you think that the U.S. economy is doomed to be uncompetitive, and how does the U.S. absorb the non-service economy?
ZB: Let’s look at the economic projections for [2013]. Already indications are rising that the recovery is beginning. I think that in the advanced world, that the American economy is the engine of change. Of course, China, in the longer run, may surpass America. But that is several decades away. 
MD: How do you think the U.S. should get used to not being the hegemon; that is, how should the U.S. get used to being in a multi-polar world?
ZB: Well, I wrote a book about it, which appeared earlier this year, called Strategic Vision. It is very exactly on that subject. So let me end on a very self-serving plug for my book. If the readers find this interview of interest, perhaps they should look at that book. Could you do me the favour of sending me a copy of the McGill – it’s still called the McGill Daily? I’d love to have it. I very much valued my days at McGill.

2013-02-28,McGill,Israel,"Refugees detained unconstitutionally, say panelists
Students and law experts convened at Chancellor Day Hall yesterday to discuss Bill C-31, otherwise known as the Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act, and its impacts on the asylum-seeking process.
Hosted by the Human Rights Working Group’s Immigration and Refugee Rights Portfolio at the Faculty of Law and the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre (MHMC), the discussion focused on the detention of refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in Canada.
Bill C-31 was passed on June 30 and impacts how refugees are treated in Canada in a variety of ways, including by limiting access to healthcare following changes to the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP).
According to Idil Atak, a postdoctoral researcher at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), while systemic detention of refugees is considered to be the norm in Europe, Canada is still a long way from the international exemplar it sets for itself.
According to Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers vice-president Mitchell Goldberg, someone can be detained only if that person is a danger to the public, has a flight risk, or the authenticity of their identity is suspected.
The main issue of clarity of identity is nebulous, says Goldberg.  According to current legislation, if an immigration officer of the Canadian Border Services Agency is not satisfied with the person is who they say they are, the person will be detained.
Another issue with  Bill C-31 is that it allows for the federal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to deem some countries “safe.”  Refugee-status claimants from those countries are given a shorter time period to prepare their claims and are not entitled to an appeals process.
One such country is Mexico, which was designated safe a week ago.  “Most people are safe there,” said Goldberg, “but there are also people being killed there by drug cartels and corrupt police officers.”
“It is quite complicated to understand the law, even for people with backgrounds in law,” said Jenny Jeanes, program coordinator at Action Réfugiés Montréal, underlining the need for helping refugees understand their legal rights.
Once detained, the refugees are subject to a review after 48 hours.  If that review fails, another one is conducted seven days later, and then repeated every other thirty days, until the detainee is released.  But in the end it is up to the immigration officer, and not to the board member who does the review, to release the detainee.
When asked about the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs’ (CIJA) support of Bill C-31 by an anonymous speaker from the crowd, Goldberg said that he found it very disappointing as a Jewish person. He added that many other organizations, including the MHMC, had been critical of it.
Louis-Philippe Jannard of the MHMC told The Daily that he had asked the government to participate in the panel.
According to Jannard,  the officials responded, “we cannot be here, we are only applying the law so we cannot discuss the policy aspect of it.”

2013-03-14,McGill,Israel,"Professor’s door defaced with Zionist slogans
A panel entitled “Zionism in Academia” discussed on Tuesday that academia in North America is complicit in privileging Zionist discourses, rendering the study, analysis, and discussion of Palestine invisible. Facilitated by Michelle Hartman, professor of Arabic Literature at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill, the panel – held as part of Israeli Apartheid Week – drew a crowd of fifty people.
The panel was composed of Mohsen al Attar, a visiting professor and human rights lawyer, and Douglas Smith, a PhD student who was a member of Tadamon!, a Montreal-based collective working in solidarity with struggles for self-determination, equality, and justice in the Middle East.
“I’m not interested in the question of if Zionism holds a privileged place within the environment of North American universities, because I think that it does. I don’t think that it is a question whether or not Palestine is colonized, because I think that it is,” Hartman said in her introduction to the panel.
“In many university spaces, to say this is not accepted,” she added. Instead, Hartman continued, the panel would focus on the way in which this privilege manifests itself.
Hartman told the audience that it had been hard to find people to talk at the event, as many people that she had approached didn’t want to talk about these issues in public.
Hartman herself was on the receiving end of political smearing at McGill in February, when her office door was defaced with Zionist slogans.
In 2009, Hartman, along with 81 other Montreal CEGEP and university professors, signed an open letter published in Le Devoir in the wake of the Israeli bombing of the Islamic University of Gaza.
The letter, which was in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, called for academics around the world to support a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, and an ending of all economic relations between Canada and Israel.
“We call on the Harper government to re-evaluate its policies and to unequivocally condemn the Israeli siege and assault on Gaza, which constitute serious violations of international and humanitarian law,” the letter read. “We further demand that the Israeli government immediately cease its violence,” it said.
Hartman previously had a copy of this letter posted on her door. Sometime between the evening of February 4 and the early morning of February 5, slogans stating that Hartman was a “lover of terrorists,” and that “Israel has been a state for 1,200 years,” were scrawled across her door.
“I don’t feel personally threatened. I see this rather as a way to silence the issue. My understanding of that defacing is in the context, not necessarily particularly here, but in a broader context of silencing of people on university campuses who talk about the issue of Palestine and Palestinians,” Hartman told The Daily shortly after the incident.
The incident was downplayed by her department, and her colleagues came to a consensus not to say anything publicly about it. Hartman, however, felt that it would have been better to issue a public statement about it.
Hartman said during the panel that many of her colleagues, but particularly students, often do not feel that they are able to speak about the question of Palestine in many places within the university, especially in classrooms.
A member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR), a group that advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people, and organizer of the conference, told The Daily that at McGill, “Zionist discourse has so ingrained itself in the university, you aren’t free to use the ‘anti’ [Zionism] discourse.”
Another SPHR member told The Daily that they actively try to hide their political ideas in their classes in fear of the consequences of voicing them. “People are afraid of talking about it more than any other issue,” they said.
Adrienne Hurley, a professor in East Asian studies who also signed the open letter, asserted to The Daily that McGill had taken a particularly aggressive stance against BDS.
“You have a university that has taken a side, and this is a really clear side. You have these slogans written that echo the political sentiment of the administration, and that specificity is important, ” she said.
Hurley speculated that had a similar political action been carried out in another department, the response would have been much different.
Al Attar, however, said during the panel discussion that the issue of Zionism, which as an idea contains many contradictions, is often oversimplified, and that academics self-censor as a direct consequence of irrational fears that stem from such oversimplification.
“Zionism is not overrepresented in academia, but oversimplification gives rise to the illusion of an overrepresentation of Zionism, and this gives rise to allegations of anti-semitism,” he said.
Smith outlined various cases across Canada and the U.S. where anti-Zionist voices had been silenced.
For instance, in February, around the same time that Hartman’s door was vandalized, New York City officials threatened to cut funding to Brooklyn College because the school’s political science department sponsored an event featuring Omar Barghouti and Judith Butler, both of whom are advocates of BDS. Glenn Greenwald wrote in the Guardian that this type of action was a threat to academic freedom.
Some professors believe that what is allowed to be said on campus has changed as McGill moves toward funding more programs through donors. Abby Lippman, a professor in Epidemiology, told The Daily by phone that “the way you have to go for funding has changed a lot over the years. That has changed the sort of research people can do.”

2013-07-24,McGill,Israel,"Marxists and McGill students discuss recent developments in Egypt
As the Egyptian upheaval largely fades from the front pages of the press, its reverberations are continually felt in Egypt, where clashes continue and security has not yet found a home. The upheaval, however, has brought up a subject of lively debate: was the military ouster of former Egyptian President Mohammad Morsi a coup, or was it part of a long-standing revolution?
Many would argue the latter. Originally, the Egyptian grassroots movement Tamarod, formed in April of this year, created a petition calling for Morsi to resign from his position and for new elections to be held. This petition reportedly amassed 22 million signatures before June 30; by contrast, Morsi was originally voted into power with 13 million votes.
On June 30, Tamarod called for protests across Egypt to demand Morsi’s resignation. Some estimates of this protest allege that 14 million Egyptians took part. As protests continued, Morsi refused to cede power, despite demands from protesters and, later, the Egyptian army. On July 3, when he had not stepped down from power, the Egyptian military announced the end of Morsi’s presidency, suspended the constitution, and declared that a new election would be held.
Many have labelled these events as a coup d’etat. In an article for the Independent, Robert Fisk claimed, “The army t[ook] over, depose[d] and imprison[ed] the democratically elected president, suspend[ed] the constitution, arrest[ed] the usual suspects, close[d] down television stations and mass[ed] their armour in the streets of the capital.” Fisk furthered his point by adding, “Morsi was indeed elected in a real, Western-approved election.”
This view has been channeled by much of the Western press, though notably not directly by the American government nor the European Union. Fisk claims this is because if they – specifically the American government – labelled the events in Egypt as a coup, it “would force the US to impose sanctions on the most important Arab nation at peace with Israel.”
As clashes continue in Egypt, and pro-Morsi protesters are continually targeted, the answer to the question – was Morsi’s ouster a revolution or a coup? – remains murky.
* * *
On July 10, bringing the debate closer to home, the International Marxist Tendency (IMT), a Marxist group with a local chapter in Montreal, held an event at Café Gitana to discuss the recent upheaval in Egypt. The discussion presented a view far different than Fisk’s. The event description asked such questions as, “Is this a coup d’état as is said in the capitalist media? Or is this the second stage of the Egyptian revolution which began two years ago? Did the army truly act on behalf of the revolution, or perhaps it is trying to protect its own privileges by throwing the Muslim Brotherhood under the bus?”
The event centered around a speech, given in English by IMT member Fehr Marouf and subsequently translated into French, began with a brief history of recent developments in Egypt from the time of former President Hosni Mubarak’s ousting onwards. Throughout his account of recent Egyptian history, Marouf highlighted his assertion that the Muslim Brotherhood did not actually have that much popular support.
Marouf explained that the 2012 elections consisted of two rounds. The first, from May 23 to 24, saw the vote split almost evenly between Mohammad Morsi for the Freedom and Justice party, an Islamist party with strong links to the Muslim Brotherhood, Ahmed Shafiq, an Independent whom Marouf described as “the candidate of the old regime,” and Hamdin Sabbahi, of the leftist al-Karamah party.
Morsi and Shafiq advanced to the run-off election in June, despite allegations of massive voter fraud on the part of the old regime party. Marouf claimed that “Sabbahi was robbed of his spot in the second round of elections” due to this alleged fraud.
Marouf went on to address the final election – which saw Morsi elected with 51.7 per cent of the vote, according to official tallies – with suspicion. “If we want to actually think about Morsi’s support in the country or legitimacy, we have to look at the first round,” said Marouf. “The second round, of course everyone is going to try to vote against the old regime.”
From this point onwards, the speech focused on explaining why the recent upheaval, which saw millions of protesters across the country take to the streets, was not a coup. Marouf essentially argued that power was given to the Muslim Brotherhood by the Egyptian people on the condition that they would do what the people demanded. A year later when, according to Marouf, it was clear the Brotherhood hadn’t, the people rose up to call for new leadership. Marouf indicated that the army only took charge of the direction of the mass protests when it was clear they would dispose of Morsi.
However, Marouf did make it clear that the army, which he claimed is still heavily populated by old generals from the Mubarak era, should be regarded with suspicion. He indicated that the way forward for the Egyptian people must lie in their own hands through a genuine democratic uprising that takes into account the will of the people.
Connecting the crises of the Egyptian people to a supposed global capitalist crisis, Marouf insisted that “under the capitalist system there is no solution for the Egyptian people. We cannot eat democracy, and a democracy that does not allow you to provide food for your people is not democracy.”
* * *
Marouf’s perception of recent events in Egypt offers a different perspective when compared to Fisk’s more widely popularized characterization of these events as a coup. Some local Montreal and McGill students shared an interpretation more similar to Marouf’s than to Fisk’s.
In an interview with The Daily, U2 McGill Political Science student Rana Badawi offered an explanation for these differing perceptions. “The first [reason for the divide between the perceptions may be] because the situation in Egypt is odd and unusual to Western standards. We are talking about countries [that] have known and lived democracy for quite some time now; therefore, the idea of overthrowing a democratically elected president is unacceptable. But they should know better, they should know that democracy does not end at the ballot boxes, it is much more than that.”
“When the president himself crosses the boundaries of democracy, there is no longer space for his so-called legitimacy,” Badawi added.
Mostafa Momtaz, a McGill student and VP Internal of McGill’s Egyptian Students Association, has been participating in the recent protests in Egypt since they began. In an interview with The Daily, he also stressed that these protests, and Morsi’s downfall, should not be referred to as a coup, due to the widespread support he alleges that the actions maintain in Egypt.
“A number of young activists started the Tamarod campaign. These people went to almost every city, village, and town in Egypt to collect signatures from people to withdraw their trust in Mohamed Morsi as their president. Most of the people I know, including my whole family have signed. According to the group they collected 22 million signatures, almost a quarter of the population,” Momtaz said, adding, “Only 13 million people voted for Morsi in the final round [of elections].”
Another element emphasized in the interview with Badawi, and throughout the IMT event, was the Muslim Brotherhood’s alleged misappropriation of Islam.
“Throughout my answers I referred to Morsi’s organization as the Brotherhood, not the Muslim Brotherhood, because in my honest opinion they have absolutely nothing to do with Islam,” said Badawi.
In a question and answer period at the IMT event following Marouf’s speech, activist Ted Sprague reaffirmed this opinion, highlighting the role of class within the politics of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sprague noted that, in his view, there exists an “Islam of the workers, the poor, and an Islam of the rich” which “don’t meet eye to eye.” Sprague alleged that the Muslim Brotherhood espouses the latter type of Islam.
The IMT event concluded with Marouf highlighting the ongoing nature of the upheaval in Egypt, and the need for proletariat around the world to look out for Egyptians.
“Our revolution here is tied with the revolution of the Egyptian masses,” he said. “We have a duty to prevent imperialism from oppressing the Egyptian people. We’re going to keep watching the Egyptian revolution, and this is not over yet.”
Marouf’s message rings true for many, as the events that have been continuously unfolded in Egypt did not stop with Morsi’s ouster. In recent days, violent clashes between supporters and opponents of Morsi have continued, with over 100 dead since Morsi was deposed.
So far, a new president has not yet been elected, the Muslim Brotherhood and the army have not engaged in dialogue, the upper house of Egyptian Parliament remains dissolved, and doubts linger about what role the army will play in the future. Yet according to Badawi, “after the past two and a half years, we are entering another transitional period having absolutely nothing to lose. We’ve already lost everything.”

2013-09-24,McGill,Israel,"Doctor and filmmaker on hunger strike during “arbitrary” imprisonment
On September 24, cries of “Free John and Tarek!” rang out from a group of around 120 supporters gathered outside the Egyptian consulate in Montreal. The solidarity protest marked the 39th day of the arbitrary detainment of Canadians Tarek Loubani and John Greyson in Cairo, Egypt.
Both Greyson, a filmmaker, and Loubani, an emergency room medical doctor, were arrested by Cairo police on August 16 as they were en route to the Gaza Strip through Egypt. According to family and friends, Loubani and Greyson were travelling to Gaza to work together on an academic and medical collaboration between the University of Western Ontario and Al-Shifa hospital, the main hospital in the Gaza Strip.
As the pair stopped at a local Egyptian police station to ask for directions, according to a website set up by friends and family in support of Loubani and Greyson, they were promptly arrested with no solid charges and put in the Tora Prison, just outside of Cairo.
More than 140,000 people have signed an online petition calling for their release, while high-profile stars took up the cause at the Toronto International Film Festival. Despite the surge of support, including rallies elsewhere in Canada, and media attention, the two remain imprisoned.
Two attendees at the rally, Debbie Margetson and Martha Newbigging, are both friends of Greyson and Loubani, and voiced their disbelief that either of the men would do anything to be arrested.
“We know them personally,” Margetson said, adding that she believed that they were doing nothing but travelling to Gaza to work on the collaboration. “So it’s all the more frustrating and infuriating to know that we know for sure they’re being held without just cause. They weren’t going to do any harm to Egypt, it was a cross-over to get to Gaza.”
According to Justin Podur, the duo’s close friend and emergency contact for the trip, who spoke at the rally, the response from the Egyptian government has been disappointing.
“I think what’s going on in Egypt right now […] there’s an emergency law. They’ve arrested dozens of people. It’s a climate where they’re in a very aggressive kind of mentality and they are not seeing any cost to them for imprisoning people for any period of time. It is not a concern for them,” Podur told the press in an interview.
As of September 16, both Loubani and Greyson have been on a hunger strike in order to pressure both Egyptian and Canadian authorities for their release – but have had little success so far.
According to speakers at the rally, Egypt’s deputy Prime Minister will be in Toronto on a private visit this week to discuss Canada and Egypt’s economic relationship. Supporters of Loubani and Greyson questioned why the government was not making the arbitrary detainment of the two Canadians a major issue.
At the rally, Michael Dworkind, a doctor and colleague of Loubani, asserted that the lack of action was political. “Because they were going to Gaza in an attempt to publicize against injustice in the occupied territory, they are seen as anti-Israel and our government is pro-Israel, so they are turning their backs on [John and Tarek],” Dworkind said at the rally.
At the rally, speakers such as Cecilia Greyson, John Greyson’s sister, colleagues of Greyson and Loubani, and Manon Massé, a member of Québec solidaire (QS), called for increased action from both the Canadian and Egyptian governments.
Among the speakers was the award-winning filmmaker Michel Marc Bouchard, a colleague of Greyson. Bouchard’s eloquent speech in French summed up the general feelings of the crowd: “What kind of nation allows one of its most significant artists to be left in such a situation? What kind of nation lets a doctor, who has dedicated his life to helping people, rot away in one of the worst prisons in the world?”
Massé also announced that QS would be presenting a motion to the National Assembly later in the week to support Loubani and Greyson, and to further pressure the federal government to continue pushing Egyptian authorities to release the two men.
Friends and family vowed that if the two were not released, there would be further protests in solidarity.
“We will not stop fighting for their human rights,” said Andrew Jones, a friend and colleague of Loubani. “We will not stop demanding for their immediate release. We will not forget them. We will only get louder.”

2013-10-21,McGill,Israel,"Since 2006, Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill and SSMU have teamed up to offer Culture Shock – eight days of panels, workshops, art, and film screenings, dedicated to breaking down myths about communities of colour, Indigenous peoples, immigrants, and refugees. The annual event series openly addresses issues such as race, white supremacy, colonialism, xenophobia, and anti-migrant sentiments.
Series like Culture Shock, said Kira Page, External Coordinator at QPIRG, are important in a “broader context of neoliberalism that is telling people that racism is not an issue – that colonialism is not an issue.”
“At McGill specifically, I think there’s a comforting discourse [about] multiculturalism – that this is a diverse school, it’s all good, there’s a lot of diversity,” Page said. “Representation is certainly a barometer we can use […] but just the fact that it isn’t just white people who go to this school doesn’t mean that people don’t experience institutionalized racism in a McGill context.”
Another motivation for Culture Shock is McGill’s position on unceded Mohawk territory, Page said. “The fact that McGill is on stolen land is not just a historical issue. It’s a current issue.”

“Canada Behind Bars: On the Incarceration of Indigenous Communities”
Written by Hannah Reardon.
Statistics Canada findings show that 30 per cent of female offenders in federal prisons are Indigenous, and this figure is steadily climbing, according to Patricia Eshkibok, one of the speakers at the Canada Behind Bars panel on October 10.
Panelists Eshkibok, Jessica Danforth, and Kawate Tawe, focused mainly on the incarceration of Indigenous women in Canada, while also highlighting the crisis facing Indigenous youth. The “pipeline from school to prison,” as Danforth referred to it, is an intergenerational effect of the residential school system. Many of its effects, such as alcohol and drug abuse, identity loss, and high suicide rates, are all serious and pervasive problems, the panelists stressed, which push Indigenous youth disproportionately out of the education system and into the prison system.
Dismal health conditions, extreme homophobia, racism, and violence are all issues that face Indigenous people within the prison system. However, some efforts are being made to improve the rights of Indigenous people in the prison system. Danforth is the founder and executive director of the Native Youth Sexual Health Network, an organization that works to protect the health rights of incarcerated individuals. “You don’t lose your right to health as soon as you enter prison. Just because you’re incarcerated doesn’t mean you lose your rights as a human being,” she said.
“Colonization is happening,” said Danforth, adding that racism and loss of identity are day-to-day realities for Indigenous people. There is a pressing need, according to the panelists, to spread the truth [about] the present-day effects of colonization. Raising awareness and fighting for justice for marginalized Indigenous people is the only way to move forward, the panelists stressed. “We are here to speak truth to power,” said Danforth.

“Roundtable Discussion on Solidarity City”
Written by Olivia Larson.
QPIRG McGill and SSMU co-hosted a roundtable discussion on Montreal’s Solidarity City declaration, presented by migrant justice network Solidarity Across Borders. Dozens of public service organizations across Montreal have signed the declaration in an effort to make basic resources such as education, food, and housing accessible to non-status migrants. At the roundtable discussion, representatives from various public service organizations were present to share their successes and to discuss the challenges they have faced in implementing the declaration.
Quebec’s residency clause bars thousands of undocumented children from free schooling every year, pointed out Anne, a CEGEP teacher. She works with the committee on education, which has successfully “made this problem exist” for the government through persistent lobbying in the hopes that the word ‘resident’ will be omitted from the law.
The Food For All committee, a part of the Solidarity campaign, reaches out to food aid organizations and banks, asking them to adopt the declaration and implement a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy in regards to immigration status. So far, the committee has had relative success in signing organizations on, and thereby increasing “food justice,” as one representative put it, for non-status migrants.
Several organizations are working with Solidarity City to increase the number of subsidized housing projects across Montreal, and to make shelters for those who identify as trans* or as women safe spaces for those who are undocumented.
The shortage of available social housing for Quebec residents has made the government reluctant to expand the list of people who qualify for public housing, leaving many who are non-status homeless. Shelters have had issues with the Canadian Border Services Agency raiding and subsequently deporting paperless immigrants. The declaration, for both social housing agencies and shelters, has been extraordinarily difficult to implement, as the struggle for increased accessible living is being waged at all levels of government.
Despite myriad obstacles, Solidarity City’s powerful declaration to “fight back with solidarity, mutual aid, and direct action” is making headway in achieving equal status for all those living in Montreal.

“Race at McGill”
Written by Dana Wray.
Racial microaggressions, systemic and institutional racism, and the specific experiences of racialized people at McGill were all topics of discussion at a workshop co-facilitated by Shaina Agbayani and Annie Chen on October 16. The first half of the workshop, presented by Chen, focused on the basics of racial microaggressions, in addition to systemic and individual racism.
Microaggressions are small, everyday actions – whether verbal, behavioural, or environmental – that are hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights. Although not always done intentionally, the slow accumulation of these microaggressions over a lifetime adds up to a marginalized experience.
Agbayani gave an example of the McGill-centric website McGill Microaggressions, where people at McGill send in their experiences with racism on an interpersonal, often casual and everyday level.
Chen’s part of the workshop also debunked the myth of reverse racism. A term thrown around to describe discrimination against white people, reverse racism is often used in arguments against programs such as affirmative action.
Agbayani focused more specifically on race at McGill, and how racism manifests itself on an institutional, day-to-day, and curricular level. She highlighted that there is an underrepresentation of people of colour within McGill’s faculty, as well as a lack of financial support for initiatives addressing racism, such as the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office.
Agbayani attributed the underrepresentation of faculty and staff of colour at McGill to a “feedback loop” between a lack of diversity in the student body and in staff. “Some [people of colour] who were offered jobs at Counselling Services rejected the offers because they noted that they wanted to serve student populations that [was] more diverse, and they wanted to be a mirror of identity in a position of authority for students of colour, which they didn’t see a lot of at McGill.”
In interviews with a former McGill dean and his daughter, a current staff member, Agbayani said the lack of diversity appeared to be a systemic problem that wasn’t getting any better. “[The former dean and his daughter] haven’t seen much progress [over the past few decades]. They’ve seen a decrease in diversity visibly – not of students, they noted more students of diverse backgrounds – but in terms of faculty and staff.”
According to Agbayani, diversity is used as a superficial buzzword for McGill. “Diversity for McGill [as stated online] would reflect a pursuit of diversity as a pursuit of cosmopolitanism, as opposed to diversity as a pursuit of social justice and [a process of] redressing historical injustices.”

“Ongoing colonization: Addressing systemic violence against Indigenous women”
Written by Dana Wray and Anqi Zhang.
At the trial of two men for the brutal murder of an Indigenous woman named Pamela George, the judge presiding over the case lamented that it would be “dangerous” to convict the “bright, promising young men” that were her murderers, and that George was “just a prostitute.”
According to Candice Cascanette, a member of Missing Justice, a Montreal-based organization and the leader of the workshop, this racist and sexist language is common in the media and the broader Canadian society when talking about Indigenous women. In Canada, there are 600 missing or murdered Indigenous women, although some activists argue that the number is closer to 3000. In addition, Indigenous women are five times as likely to face violence, a fact Cascanette called proof of “ongoing colonization.”
“Talking about the colonial present requires us to go to the colonial past,” asserted Cascanette, before giving a brief historical account of the theft of Turtle Island and subsequent colonization. As Indigenous women had power connected directly to this land within their communities, Cascanette explained, they were a threat to the patriarchal European forces, and therefore a target.
More recent practices like the residential school system continued the process of colonization by separating families, forcing Christianity upon Indigenous children, and attempting to destroy Indigenous culture. According to Cascanette, the “cultural genocide” extended past the schools, into the forces – such as the Indian Act – that imposed patriarchy, capitalism, and other oppressive European structures on Indigenous communities.
However, Cascanette also dispelled the notion that Indigenous people were victims without any agency. “There have been over 500 years of colonization and over 500 years of resistance – I just want to make that clear.”

“Teach-In Against the Charter of Values”
Written by Cem Ertekin.
In preparation for the October 20 demonstration organized by the Ensemble Contre la Charte Xénophobe Coalition, Aishah Nofal, Bochra Manaï, and Vincent Tao facilitated a teach-in on resisting the proposed Quebec Charter of Values. The event focused on what the Charter is presently, and what social ramifications it could have.
Tao, one of the lead organizers of the upcoming demonstration on October 20, outlined the Parti Québecois’s proposed content of the Charter. The Charter aims to ban the wearing of religious symbols, a goal which Tao critiques as discriminatory. “This is state sanctioned social exclusion of women of faith who need government services,” said Tao.
Manaï, a PhD candidate in Urban Studies at Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, said that the Charter has a clear electoral agenda. After conducting research looking at inter-ethnic relationships in middle class neighbourhoods, Manaï has concluded that people see diversity mostly when there is political discussion surrounding it.
Nofal, a second-year Law student at McGill, called the Charter blatantly discriminatory. “The PQ claims that the ban of religious symbols will neutralize [the] public sector. It deprives minorities of choice. They can’t simply discard their beliefs. What this Charter is saying is that some beliefs are suitable while others are not. […] This is really frightening. As a person wearing the hijab, I feel I’m subject to public scrutiny.”

“Political Prisoners’ Struggles in Palestine”
Written by Ralph Haddad.
Tadamon!’s workshop on October 16 discussed the harsh reality that Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip face when arrested by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Tadamon! – an Arabic word for solidarity – is a Montreal-based collective that works in solidarity with struggles for self-determination, equality, and justice in the Middle East as well as diaspora communities in Montreal and beyond.
As of 2013, there are an estimated 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel. These prisoners are illegally held in poorly-maintained facilities, tortured in interrogations, and are subject to immediate maltreatment upon arrest. Israel was condemned by the UN earlier this year for its “abusive” treatment of prisoners, who are also denied family visits, Palestinian-based education, and basic healthcare.
What is important to note is that Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to separate legal systems – Jewish settlers are seen by an Israeli civilian judge, while Palestinians are seen by an Israeli military judge. Furthermore, rates of incarceration for Palestinian children are almost ninefold compared to those for Jewish children in the occupied territories, according to the workshop. Some Palestinians are arrested using administrative detention, supposedly used in times of emergency for strict security reasons (though Israel has an almost perpetual state of emergency). This form of detention allows for prisoners to be prosecuted without trial and charge, and are kept in prison for a period for up to six months, subject to renewal.
Today, there are around 178 Palestinians under administrative detention. The number has decreased “due to international grassroots pressure,” claimed Paul Di Stefano, a member of Tadamon!, “but the number is still extraordinarily high.” He continued that this form of detention allows the state to “circumvent” people’s rights.
According to Tadamon!, Israel also outsources its human rights violations by employing a private security company, G4S, to run its prisons. This privately-owned British security company also provides the IDF with equipment for checkpoints. Pressure in the form of hunger strikes on behalf of prisoners, or from movements such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) are still used today in order to pressure Israel to stop its maltreatment of prisoners and give them better care and humane services.
“Palestinians can be tried as adults as young as 16, and are interrogated by Israeli soldiers,” said Amy Darwish, an organizer for Tadamon!

“Unsettling and Decolonizing: An Introductory Workshop”
Written by Joelle Dahm.
Heidi Pridy and Philippe – who preferred not to give his last name – of the Anti-Colonial Solidarity Collective led an introductory workshop on unsettling and decolonizing, urging settlers to be respectful and effective allies to Indigenous populations on Turtle Island – also known as North America.
After an introduction to the vocabulary of decolonization and the history of colonialism in Canada, and specifically in the Montreal area, participants engaged in an interactive discussion on works by Cree artist Kent Monkman and documentaries dealing with decolonization.
Later in the workshop, Pridy explained that people often react to negative stereotypes, but feel comfortable about positive stereotypes that might glorify the group in question and give it a preconceived identity. “It does not matter if a stereotype is negative or positive. The problem is that it’s is a fixed representation and an abstraction of a complex dynamic.”
“When one group is marginalized, another one is benefitting. We need to understand ourselves as complicit in and beneficiaries of the illegal settlement of Indigenous people’s land,” said Pridy. “This appropriation often leads people to experience feelings of guilt. Guilt is a state of self-absorption that upholds privilege in a lot of ways and can really immobilize people from doing anything. We would encourage people to embrace that discomfort as a sign of a much-needed shift in self-consciousness.”
In special regard of upcoming Halloween festivities, Pridy urged people to be conscious about their self-representation, especially considering “sexy Native women costumes” sold in stores.
“Given the grade of sexual violence against Native women, that is really problematic,” Pridy stated. “Using someone else’s cultural symbols to exercise a personal need in self-expression is an exercise in privilege. That does not mean that cultural exchange never does happen and that we never partake in someone else’s culture, but there needs to be some element of mutual understanding for it to be a true exchange.”

“Indigenous feminisms and historical and contemporary two-spirit identities in North America”
Written by Hannah Besseau.
On October 10, Molly Swain and Lindsay Nixon facilitated a workshop on contemporary Indigenous feminisms, anti-capitalism, and two-spirit identities. The workshop tackled what Swain described as ‘the sexist and racist colonial values” of Canada’s ongoing violence against Indigenous people.
“We hear a lot about the victimization of Indigenous women, but not a lot about the resistance,” Swain told The Daily. “I wanted to introduce people to the topic of Indigenous feminisms and get them thinking of it not just in terms of within [academic settings], but in their daily lives.”
Swain emphasized environmental degradation and the role of capitalism in the oppression of Indigenous peoples. “Canada was […] founded very much on the principles of resource extraction, pushing further and further inland. […] John A Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada, and his project of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was very much an extension of that need to keep pushing and [to] quell Native dissent and any Natives’ resistance to bring these dissenters under the fold.”
According to Swain, “colonialism, misogyny, and capitalism are deeply intertwined.” Decolonization – a continuous process whereby settlers, or non-Indigenous people, attempt to help heal the consequences of colonialism – is a crucial step in the struggle.
“It’s one thing to talk about decolonization and to acknowledge the land that we’re on, but it’s another thing to go out there and actually get involved in the struggles that are taking place, and to learn from those communities to figure out how to engage in a real responsible relationship with these folks. I think that’s a really important aspect of decolonization.”
Swain and Nixon are both co-founders of QPIRG McGill’s new working group, the Indigenous Women and Two-Spirit Harm Reduction Coalition. The group aims to provide resources and materials to Indigenous women and two-spirit people.
“We’re hoping to provide people with free materials such as needles, condoms, as well as resource guides to things like consent, safe sex, good drug-use practice, navigating the prison system, and guides to Montreal services,” said Swain. “Our group is open to Indigenous-identified folks only because we wanted this to be very much work we’re doing for our community.”

2014-03-24,McGill,Israel,"Event series seeks to bring awareness of Israeli human rights abuses 
From March 10 to March 17, McGill and Concordia hosted the Montreal events for the tenth annual Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW), an international series of events that seeks to raise awareness about Israel’s apartheid policies toward Palestinians, and build support for the growing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.
The BDS campaign was initiated in 2005, and demands “full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, an end to the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands – including the Golan Heights, the Occupied West Bank with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip – and dismantling the Wall, and the protection of Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in U.N. resolution 194,” according to the website for Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) USA.
On March 11, Noura Erakat, a human rights attorney and writer, came to McGill to talk about the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli apartheid regime that she referred to as “an Indigenous struggle against settler colonialism.”
Through the examination of Israeli law, Erakat works to denounce the institutionalized discrimination established against the Palestinian Christian and Arab population. She highlighted the fact that without an established constitution, the Basic Laws of Israel, which form an important part of the Israeli constitution, hold no guaranteed right to equality.
“What separates these two populations has not necessarily been a physical separation but even more so, it is the privilege that is afforded to the Jewish-Israeli population,” Erakat explained.
“We describe this situation as ‘the Palestinian-Israeli conflicts,’” she continued, “which distorts what is actually going on [because] it equates the Palestinian people and the Israeli people in the form of a conflict, when in fact what would be more accurate would be to say, ‘The Palestinian and Israeli conflict is a conflict because Israel has been a state since 1948, and Palestinians have been a stateless people since 1948.’”
Rana Salah, an organizer of IAW Montreal, told The Daily, “I hope that IAW will bring about understanding and empowerment to the McGill community. The unfortunate reality is that IAW continues to be a taboo topic for many. This taboo nature only continues to entrench racist attitudes towards Palestinians. A clearer understanding of the Palestine-Israel topic will foster a greater sense of understanding and respect amongst the McGill community.
 “It also empowers McGill students by encouraging them to voice their concerns on the ongoing apartheid treatment of Palestinians, and to resist via the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. The BDS movement aims to pressure Israel to respect human rights and to cease with its apartheid policies,” Salah continued.
Salah mentioned that she is very happy with the results of IAW so far. She explained, “Israeli Apartheid Week once started as a very fringe, ‘radical’ movement. It has now moved to the centre of the Israeli-Palestinian debate. It has not yet penetrated mainstream societal views, but support continues to grow.”

2014-07-14,McGill,Israel,"Protesters demand end to occupation, condemn Canadian complicity
Stretching a 66-metre-long Palestinian flag along Ste. Catherine, over 1,000 Montrealers gathered on Friday afternoon to show solidarity with the Palestinian people in the context of Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza, and to call on the Canadian government to condemn violations of international law by the state of Israel. The demonstration, organized by the Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU), began at the Guy-Concordia metro station at 5:30 p.m., and ended in front of the Quebec premier’s office on McGill College about an hour later.
“We come here today as human beings [who] cannot […] watch what is going [on] in Gaza and just be silent, and just say, ‘It’s business as usual,’” said Ehab Lotayef, a spokesperson for the Gaza’s Ark campaign, in an address to the crowd.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza started on July 8, following a chain of events that began with the abduction and murder of three Israeli settler teenagers in the West Bank last month. The operation marks the worst outbreak of violence in the region since 2012.
“The state of Israel is […] killing people by the dozens for its own expansionist and control reasons, citing false security claims that are unjustified, and the world is standing silent,” added Lotayef. “The world is watching as Gaza is being [attacked], and when a rocket comes out of Gaza, they say, ‘Both sides should constrain themselves’? We are here to say to the world, to say to the Canadian government: enough hypocrisy.”
In an interview with The Daily, PAJU organizer Hala Marley noted that the Canadian government is complicit in Israel’s war crimes through its failure to condemn them, a sentiment shared by many demonstrators.
“When they say that Israel has the right to defend itself, […] to condemn one side and not to condemn the other, it’s hypocritical,” said Marley in French. “We’d like the Canadian and Quebec governments to stop doing business with the Israeli government as long as [it] doesn’t change its attitude toward the Palestinians, because the Palestinians don’t have the right to access to water, don’t have the right of return. We ask […] for the end of this ‘wall of shame’ [the Israeli West Bank barrier], the end of the blockade of Gaza, the return of the refugees.”
Jean Lacharité – vice-president of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), Quebec’s second largest trade union federation – found the Harper government’s professed unwavering support for the state of Israel particularly disheartening.
“I’m saying it loud and clear: the Harper government, a right-wing government like we’ve never seen in Canada, wholeheartedly supports Israel’s government, and lets [it] commit war crimes without denouncing them,” Lacharité told the crowd in French. “Harper must change course, must acknowledge that there is no democracy in Palestine, […] and say it. Otherwise, it’s a show of support for war crimes that [the Israeli government] commits.”
An anti-Zionist Orthodox Jewish contingent was also present at the protest. “The entire occupation of Palestine going on already for 60-odd years is a total crime,” a rabbi from this contingent told the crowd. “We declare that the acts of terror committed by the state of Israel against the people of Palestine [are] not supported by all Jews, neither does the state of Israel represent all Jews.”
“Israel a criminal, Harper an accomplice,” demonstrators chanted in French as they carried what is, according to organizers, the largest Palestinian flag in the world down Ste. Catherine. The flag, which attendees had the opportunity to sign, is destined to be shipped to a Palestinian refugee camp.
As the demonstration reached Premier Philippe Couillard’s office on McGill College, organizers highlighted the role of the Quebec industry in Israel’s military operations, and spoke in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for boycott of Israeli companies and academic institutions, divestment from Israeli corporations complicit in the occupation, and sanctions against the state of Israel.
“We’re standing here in front of the office of the premier of Quebec, because […] a lot of the drones that are used against the Palestinian people by Israel are manufactured here in Quebec,” said Lotayef. “We are responsible to speak against it all the time, […] until injustice ends, until the Palestinian rights are restored.”
“Israel and Quebec have bilateral [trade] agreements. We also have universities which do business with Israel. We ask for a boycott,” Marley told The Daily. “Today, we really wanted to put pressure on the Quebec government – the Israeli drones which are used right now [are] manufactured in Quebec.”
“We demand the right of return for the refugees, the end of the occupation, the end of the colonization which continues to intensify, the end of the blockade of Gaza, the dismantling of the ‘wall of shame,’ and above all, the end of apartheid practices and policies for a lasting peace in Palestine,” she told the crowd.

2014-09-29,McGill,Israel,"Student group hosts panel on BDS, solidarity with Palestine
On September 25, the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) hosted an informal panel discussion with three academics from the Institute of Islamic Studies – Associate Professor Michelle Hartman, Assistant Professor Ahmed Fekry Ibrahim, and Associate Professor Rula Abisaab – and the head librarian of the Islamic Studies Library, Anaïs Salamon. The event – the group’s first after being inactive for a few years – was centred on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and also served to introduce students to SPHR and its activities on campus.
Representatives of the group opened the discussion with a brief explanation of BDS and its objectives. “It’s basically an anti-colonialist call for solidarity with the human rights of Palestinian people in the OPT [occupied Palestinian territories], and with the diaspora as well,” said Nazim Elnur, an SPHR executive. “BDS espouses the tenets of non-violent political action in response to Israeli encroachment and transgressions against the life of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Similarly, BDS raises the call for solidarity with those Palestinians abroad [who were] expelled in the numerous periods of violent campaigns in the region and forced to migrate without the right to return.”
While the origins of the tactic can be traced as far back as 1945, when the Arab League called for a general boycott of the Zionist community in Palestine under the British Mandate, the BDS movement itself was initiated by Palestinians in 2005. Since then, the movement has achieved substantial international attention and support.
Elnur acknowledged, however, that BDS also has many detractors. “Some say the BDS movement works to delegitimize Israel and its status as a nation. […] Others say that, although BDS is a non-violent organization, many of its protests have turned violent.”
“These [accusations of violence] are all deflecting the question,” said Abisaab, stressing the importance of contextualizing isolated incidents of violence, rather than using them as a basis to judge BDS as a whole. “We cannot generalize that the movement itself carries the seeds of violence,” she said. “This is a non-violent cause, it is a just cause, and it is the only way to go.”
BDS initiatives fall into three broad categories, according to the movement’s website: boycotts, which target “Israeli and international companies and institutions that profit from the violation of Palestinian rights”; divestment, which involves selling off business interests or investments linked to Israel; and sanctions, which aim to “mobilize government officials and bodies to denounce trade with Israel, and especially with firms located on settlement ground,” according to Elnur.
Elnur made a point of highlighting the relevance of BDS to McGill, noting the existence of “University investment portfolios profiting from corporations directly involved in the Israeli occupation, more commonly [known as] the building of settlements internationally recognized as illegal.”
“I myself am torn over some of the issues,” said Ibrahim, discussing the moral complexity of the academic boycott. “I mean, how do you deal with Palestinians working at Israeli institutions? […] Those kinds of issues are difficult to resolve, but I think institutionally […] there is some collateral damage that will be done.”
Highlights from the SPHR McGill Panel 
The discussion was well-attended, exceeding the capacity of the room where it was held. “The mood was just fantastic,” said SPHR executive Anas Shakra. “It exceeded all our expectations.”
Hartman was also pleased that the event had attracted so much interest. “It’s so wonderful to see this many students […] from McGill at a meeting for Palestine solidarity. For me, that’s so exciting.”
Addressing the frustrations toward the often slow progress of BDS and the struggle for Palestinian human rights, Hartman shared grounds for optimism. “There is a momentum, which someone like me has seen over time, of a building of solidarity around the world,” said Hartman, who argued that there was a similarity between BDS and struggles against apartheid in South Africa. “It’s not nothing to say, well, we’re working on this little by little in places around the world.”
Hartman told participants that she is interested in the idea of normalization, which, in this context, is linked to a certain perception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to Hartman, it implies a certain equity between the two sides, and depicts the struggle as inevitable and age-old. “To me, that isn’t really the right analysis for this situation of colonialism.”
Salamon elaborated on the issue, sharing her experience of life in the OPT. “I lived in Palestine for two years in the early 2000s and this was really the moment when I realized that something needed to be done,” explained Salamon.
“I actually lived the daily effects of the occupation,” Salamon continued. “It made me realize how genuinely pro-Israeli we were in France. When you don’t know much about the conflict, you tend to oppose two equal sides without realizing that by doing that, you actually justify the Israeli occupation.”
One recurring theme was the actions McGill students should take in order to express their solidarity with Palestine and further the cause of BDS. According to Shakra and fellow SPHR executive Sara Ismail, one simple step would be to participate in the consumer boycott by avoiding Israeli products.
Another important demonstration of solidarity, said Hartman, is to seek information about the boycott. She stressed the value of challenging people’s misconceptions about BDS and spreading the word about the movement’s non-violent stance in day-to-day life. This, said SPHR executive Arezu Riahi, is one of the key objectives of SPHR at McGill. “Part of what we are trying to do is dispel this idea that resistance has to be necessarily violent. Awareness is a form of resistance.”

2014-09-29,McGill,Israel,"Critics say march prioritized numbers over politics
Correction appended October 6, 2014.
On September 21, a group of about fifty people from McGill and Concordia joined more than 400,000 people who congregated in New York City for the People’s Climate March.
The march in New York was the main event in a global day of action, which saw nearly 2,700 solidarity marches all over the world, including in Montreal. This occurred in the days before the United Nations Climate Summit to send a message to world leaders about the importance of fighting climate change.
While many participants had positive experiences at the event, the march and the organization behind it has faced criticism from various social organizers.
“I think the march as a whole was really a way to show that something is wrong, and we need to do something about it,” Ella Belfer, a Divest McGill member who was involved in organizing McGill’s presence in the march, told The Daily.
She added that the organizers of the march had attempted to prioritize “voices that aren’t very often heard in the environmental movement.”
“I think that [finding ways to organize in solidarity] has been an ongoing struggle for us, and that’s something that’s obviously quite difficult when you’re organizing within a university context,” she said.
Anna Egerton, a second-year Arts and Science student who went to the march in New York, said that while it was at times hectic due to the sheer number of people, one thing she really appreciated was the wide variety of those who attended.
“Walking around the crowds, I was struck by the diversity of agendas that people had brought to the march and the huge number of organized groups that had come to the march,” she told The Daily.
She noted, however, that the distance the march covered, 3.2 kilometres, seemed a bit too long, as by the time it ended much of the crowd had dispersed and many seemed to have lost the energy they had at the beginning.
Several community organizers have criticized the climate march.
Amanda Lickers, an Indigenous organizer and member of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, said that the focus of the march organizers was too broad and too centred on ‘getting numbers.’ She cited the fact that 15 partners of the march are companies with strong ties to Israel, such as the Green Zionist Alliance, as an example of how blind inclusion can end up being inhibitory for marginalized groups.
“For me, that’s prohibitive for Palestinian participation,” she said. These sentiments have also been voiced by a number of local organizers, including Harsha Walia, a journalist and activist who founded the Vancouver chapter of No One is Illegal.
Similarly, Belfer said that the march didn’t have a set political focus.
“Because they were trying to be so inclusive, to make it very ‘a march for the people’ as I mentioned, it wasn’t necessarily a march with a mandate or a march with a concrete purpose; it wasn’t necessarily an ask for the UN to do something specific, it wasn’t a common set of goals around which everyone’s marching, which would have been nice to see,” she said.
“Traditionally, the environmental movement has been pretty divided,” added Belfer. “I think one of the biggest challenges of the movement is everyone has a different vision to a different problem.”
Lickers pointed out that the march had been organized for the exact same time as the African American Heritage Parade, the largest black parade in the U.S. according to their website, which takes place in Harlem every year to celebrate achievements in the black community and call for an end to racism.
“This just goes to show that they’re not looking at where they are – like if there’s this annual march in Harlem that has been done and their event is on the same exact day, it just shows right there what relationships are being made with the local community members, which is like, not very strong,” she told The Daily.
Montreal activist Jaggi Singh published a Storify piece in the days following the march that rounded up tweets from Bill McKibben, organizer at 350.org and one of the more visible faces of the climate justice movement, that claimed the march was “the biggest protest about anything in America in a very very long time.”
Singh called the tweets an act of “social erasure,” claiming that in saying this, McKibben was ignoring the activism and struggle of other social justice groups, such as the 500,000 who mobilized in 2006 in Los Angeles as part of migrant justice protests in the U.S..
Lickers also pointed to the fact that organizers of the march were promoting ‘green capitalism,’ or the idea that it is possible to solve environmental problems using market-based incentives within a capitalist framework. This could include the replacement of environmentally harmful practices, like fracking and the use of fossil fuels, with green technology such as solar panels and wind turbines.
“Oh look, the Rockefellers have divested from fossil fuels, all we need is green capitalism and we’re good to go, we can sustain colonial occupation, we can sustain capitalism, we can sustain colonialism,” said Lickers. “That’s not the kind of sustainability I’m interested in.”
“We have to try to look for contradictions within our own movements and within our own struggles, by ensuring that we’re building relationships with people who are directly impacted,” said Lickers.
One way to do this, Lickers suggested, might be for organizers to advocate for decreased consumption, and the destruction of systems that exploit natural resources.
“The issue should be about consumption, the issue should be about land occupation, the issue should be about how diasporic migrant communities are disproportionately impacted by environment violence, as well as Indigenous communities – about how Indigenous women’s bodies are seen as dispensable in a settler-colonial society that requires the extraction of lands for resources,” she said.
Lickers said that more should be done to meet the needs of Indigenous people, instead of merely making sure they are present in the march. She also suggested that organizers at the march could have acknowledged the fact that the demonstration occurred on colonized Indigenous land.
Finally, Lickers noted that movements like the People’s Climate March might do better to put their resources into supporting the many direct action resistance projects currently taking place in local communities.
“Our people are resisting. Our people are shutting down mining companies, this is happening and people can be part of this movement,” she said, in reference to Indigenous resistance projects, such as the Algonquin blockades of logging activities.
“My question to the divestment movement is, where [is] your support of those efforts […] that are taking that sense of urgency of the climate crisis and doing something about it?”
These issues were also noted by Belfer, who said that participating in the march had given her time to reflect on the possibility of collaborating more with the community. “I’m interested in different ways of doing solidarity organizing within the context of divestment, which is something I had the opportunity to think a lot about this weekend,” she said.

2014-10-26,McGill,Israel,"Journalist chastises Canada on foreign policy in forceful speech at McGill
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald denounced Ottawa’s plans for military action in the Middle East last Thursday at McGill, warning Canadians that continued involvement in the region could provoke more attacks against the West. 
Delivering this year’s Beaverbrook Annual Lecture in a packed Pollack Hall, Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize this year for his coverage of Edward Snowden’s leak of government surveillance documents, said Canadians shouldn’t be surprised by Wednesday’s shooting in Ottawa. 
“There is a huge gap between how a citizenry perceives of its own country and the reality of what its government is doing in the world,” he said. “The [citizenry] has been led to believe some pleasant version of the truth about itself that is actually completely at odds with the reality of what its government is engaged in.”
“When you don’t hear anything about who your government is killing […] then it is very easy to believe that most of the violence is directed at you, and that you are the victim of that violence and not the perpetrator.”
Greenwald said Wednesday’s reaction to the shooting echoed the U.S.’s response in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Canadians, like Americans, he said, should question their government’s policy in the Middle East rather than speculate about the motives of the perpetrators. 
“If you go to the Arab and Muslim world and ask people which country poses the greatest threat to peace […] they say overwhelmingly, two countries that are among the staunchest allies of Canada: the U.S. and Israel,” he said, referring to a worldwide opinion poll conducted last year by WIN/Gallup International. 
Greenwald sparked controversy this week when he wrote about the October 20 hit-and-run attack on two Canadian soldiers for The Intercept – an online publication founded by Greenwald, filmmaker Laura Poitras, and journalist Jeremy Scahill, and funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar – arguing that Canadian military action was to blame for the attack. He acknowledged at Thursday’s talk that his comments might have been seen as offensive, but said that his role as a journalist wasn’t to “comfort people.” 
“I wrote what I wrote as a corrective to this very distorted discourse,” he said. “When you don’t hear anything about who your government is killing […] then it is very easy to believe that most of the violence is directed at you, and that you are the victim of that violence and not the perpetrator.”
Greenwald also spoke at length about the importance of privacy and described the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)’s mission as storing and “collecting all human communication.” A series of investigative articles has revealed the massive scope of the NSA’s surveillance program, with the information coming from documents leaked to Greenwald by Snowden over 15 months ago.
More documents would be published soon, Greenwald said.

2014-11-11,McGill,Israel,"Nahla Abdo’s new book examines treatment of Palestinian women in the Israeli prison system
Last Friday, author and Arab feminist activist Nahla Abdo launched her latest book, Captive Revolution: Palestinian Women’s Anti-Colonial Struggle Within the Israeli Prison System, at McGill’s Institute of Islamic Studies.
Co-sponsored by the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill, the Centre for Gender Advocacy, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights Concordia, and Concordia’s Simone de Beauvoir Institute, the event was a part of Culture Shock, an annual series of events which, according to its website, is “dedicated to exploring the myths surrounding immigrants, refugees, Indigenous people, and communities of colour.”
Abdo, a professor of sociology at Carleton University, has published a number of other
works related to race, nationalism, and Middle Eastern societies. In Captive Revolution, interviews make up part of the primary research Abdo draws on to examine Israel’s treatment of Palestinian women imprisoned on political grounds.
The role of Palestinian women in the movement against Israel’s settler-colonialist policies, while of considerable significance, has been largely overlooked, Abdo explained. “To pay tribute to these women, to their struggle, to restore them in their proper place in the history of the Palestinian struggle – that was the aim [of this book].”
Abdo focused her presentation on the period from the 1960s to the 1980s, prior to the First Intifada uprising of Palestinians against Israeli occupation, noting that this time period was characterized by a proliferation of anti-colonial movements around the world. “There was a culture of resistance,” Abdo explained, “which was […] very much appreciated and learned by the [Palestinian] women who were part of the anti-colonial struggle.”
But what factors motivated – and continue to motivate – these women to join the struggle at the risk of their freedom and their lives? Too often, Abdo said, the true answer is misunderstood, and academics who do choose to examine the activism of Palestinian women misconstrue its causes.
“According to most of the literature – including feminist literature – in academia, Palestinian women did whatever they did because they were terrorists, or lacked implication, or had troubles with their religion, with their families, with their men, with their own patriarchy. And there is no mention whatsoever of colonialism.”
In fact, Abdo’s research has contradicted these claims. “The composition of the twenty women that I worked with was overwhelmingly secular,” she explained. “They all had great relationships with their families, especially with their fathers, and they all enjoyed growing up, and loved people in their own homes.”
One recurring theme among those interviewed was the collective memory of the Nakba, or the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes before and during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. “Most of these women […] remember stories from their parents, from their families, who were kicked out of their homes and of their land and became refugees.”
A number of them, said Abdo, cited a famous line by former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser: “That which has been taken by force can only be restored by force.”
Abdo explained that many interviewees had witnessed acts of Israeli brutality at a young age, and that these experiences had later spurred them to resist. “When you live under colonialism, it is almost impossible not to become involved in freeing yourself.”
One issue central to Abdo’s book was the treatment of Palestinian women within Israeli prisons. Those interviewed described undergoing physical, psychological and, in some cases, sexual torture. Some women described being forced to listen for hours to the screams of other detainees before undergoing their own interrogation, while others watched their own mothers being tortured to encourage them to confess to terrorist activity. Abdo explained that in every case, detainees’ families had been targeted by Israel, and their homes destroyed.
Abdo stressed, however, that the women she interviewed did manage to resist their imprisonment. Educational lectures were given by prisoners on various topics, plays were put on, and detainees worked together to organize group activities and whatever small demonstrations of defiance they could get away with.
“These women struggled for every single right,” she said, adding that they achieved some notable victories. At one point, detainees coordinated a massive hunger strike to protest being forced to make uniforms for the Israel Defense Forces, eventually succeeding.
Speaking to The Daily after the event, Rula Abisaab, Associate Professor of Islamic History at McGill, highlighted the significance of Abdo’s work in calling attention to a relatively little-known issue. “To throw light on the women is crucial. There have been lots of studies, and even memoirs by Palestinian male prisoners, but not women.”
Abisaab also underlined the necessity of challenging the ‘colonial approach’ of certain feminist academics in the West. “We need more studies like this,” she said.
Scott Weinstein, who also attended the event and is a member of Montreal’s Independent Jewish Voices organisation, also praised Abdo’s work. He stressed the importance of holding events such as this one at a time when, all over North America, voices speaking out in support of Palestinians have been silenced, or falsely labelled anti-semitic.
Concerning the brutality described in Abdo’s book, Weinstein said, “This has been done in our name as Jews, and not only is it an affront especially to the Palestinian people, but it’s a sabotage of the Jewish experience. We, who for centuries have been struggling against oppression, are now becoming the oppressors.”

2015-02-16,McGill,Israel,"Social Justice Days event examines Israeli policies
Updated February 17, 2014.
On February 12, attendees convened at “The Face of State Violence and Police Brutality in Palestine,” the latest workshop in the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill and the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)’s Social Justice Days 2015 series.
Facilitating the workshop were Maggie Gilligan and Zahra Habib, members of McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), a student organization that advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people.
The workshop offered an overview and discussion of the ways in which state violence and police brutality are used by Israel against Palestinians as part of a larger apartheid project.
The event began with a discussion of the ways in which state violence manifests visually in the lives of Palestinians, illustrating how these effects originate from institutions, such as the Israeli government and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), as well as ideologies like racism, Zionism, and settler-colonialism.
“What’s important to understand is that these are not isolated incidents,” said Habib, referencing the Israeli government’s disproportionate use of force. Habib cited the Dahiya doctrine, which calls for the use of asymmetrical warfare as a means of deterrence. Habib said that, although this doctrine violates the principle of proportionality in international law, it manifests itself on a daily basis for Palestinians through large-scale aerial raids (such as in Gaza last summer), home raids and demolitions, and arbitrary arrests, even of children.
Gilligan told The Daily that this kind of workshop is an important counterbalance to the dehumanizing effects of the Israeli and Western media. “The state violence perpetuated by the Israeli government is a very important part of the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is a part that is missed at best and silenced at worst,” she said. “So we think it is important to put forth the voices of civilians and children who have been harmed by state-sanctioned policies, and make sure everyone’s story is being told.”
One topic discussed was how to unpack the way Israeli and Western media tends to dehumanize Palestinians, and portray instances of state violence as responses to Palestinian dissidence.
In the discussion, workshop attendee Nadir Khan asserted that the world knows Israelis are using disproportionate force against Palestinians, but the magnitude of the violence and damage does not seem to resonate enough for the international community to demand change. Khan went on to question what students could do to bring about concrete change.
“The state violence perpetuated by the Israeli government is a very important part of the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is a part that is missed at best and silenced at worst.”
Ralph Haddad, a U2 Middle Eastern Studies and Women’s Studies stdent and former Daily editor, suggested countering the Israeli public relations machine as a method. “We should employ emerging media that exist outside of that sphere to further our own cause […] because Israel is known to employ students and employees in giant operations, using Facebook and Twitter and social media to spread propaganda to gain sympathy for the IDF. There is no way to counter that without stopping [the perpetration of] our own rhetoric.”
Haddad also stressed the need to recognize the connections between Palestinian struggles and other struggles. Intersectionality “makes us stronger,” he said.
During the workshop, Gilligan highlighted increasing awareness of the intersectionality between black struggles in the U.S. and those in Palestine, as both governments respond to dissent with similar repression. “It’s important to make this connection because they stem from the same place and I think a lot of similar strategies can be used to combat them. And again another direct link is that one of the police forces that was used in
Ferguson to calm protesters was trained by the IDF. So we have the policy links, the theoretical links, we also have a lot of direct links that are a lot closer than we think.”

2015-03-09,McGill,Israel,"Panelists draw similarities between South Africa and Israel in SSMU-hosted event
On February 23, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) hosted a panel entitled “Boycotting Apartheid States.” Organized in collaboration with McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), the event was moderated by SSMU VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette.
The panelists – Michelle Hartman, associate professor of Arabic literature; Jon Soske, assistant professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies; and Samia Botmeh, a professor at Birzeit University in the West Bank – drew links between the apartheid regime in South Africa and Israeli apartheid practices in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They connected campaigns against the South African apartheid regime from the late 1950s until the 1990s to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement initiated by Palestinian civil society in 2005 to pressure the Israeli government into ending its occupation of the West Bank and its ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip.
Soske, who specializes in modern African history, opened the panel by asserting that the apartheid analogy between Israel and South Africa is uncontroversial in South Africa, and drew similarities between the conditions that Israel enforces on Palestinians and the conditions enforced by white South Africans on the black community under the apartheid regime.
Soske noted that sanctions came in the form of economic pressure on the apartheid South African government, which greatly affected the livelihoods of white South Africans, and emphasized the integral role of universities in kickstarting the movement through boycotts and divestment.
“For universities as institutions to take an early stance and say, ‘We will no longer be complicit with apartheid,’ was key to starting to push broader sections of society in [Canada and the U.S.] against apartheid,” said Soske.
“One of the most important things said here is that there’s no neutrality on an issue like this.”
Botmeh, a member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel, stated that the BDS movement was a response to the asymmetric nature of the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the 1980s and 1990s, notably in negotiating the 1995 Oslo Accords.
“You cannot make peace […] assuming symmetry of power, because there is no symmetry of power between the oppressor and the oppressed,” said Botmeh.
Botmeh also took issue with the international community’s response to the situation in Palestine, claiming that it is treated like a humanitarian issue rather than a political one. “Dealing with Palestinians as if the creation of the state of Israel led to a natural catastrophe has meant that the intervention was very charity-like,” said Botmeh. “So [they] feed the Palestinians, [they] provide them with all forms of charity, and that neutralized the political factor. What the BDS movement tries to do is hold the international community responsible.” 
Hartman maintained that it is the duty of professionals, academics, and students alike to respond to the call for BDS, which comes from their colleagues who live under occupation in Palestine. She called on the audience to reflect on why, for example, some might choose to boycott Israeli academic institutions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
“[The] Hebrew University [of Jerusalem] is built on confiscated land, it is built over a Palestinian village,” said Hartman. “As Canadians, and people studying at Canadian educational institutions [built in Indigenous land], I think we need to take that very seriously, and take that into account, and look [at] where the calls [for solidarity] are coming from. When we have a call like [BDS], it is our duty to respond to it.”
“It is very empowering to know that people stand in solidarity with us, and that enables us to resist and move forward on the path of liberation,” Botmeh declared. 
The fact that the panel was organized by SSMU drew opposition from some students. An online petition expressing concern with the event began circulating a few days before the panel, and gathered 220 signatures.
“SSMU should ensure that there is open and balanced dialogue on such contentious topics,” the petition reads. “We are upset that SSMU, which we expect to represent the entire student body of McGill, has chosen to host an event that offers only one perspective on such a divisive issue.” 
Moustaqim-Barrette explained to The Daily that the panel was a result of students’ calls for forums for such debates, made during the discussion of a Palestine solidarity motion at the Fall SSMU General Assembly (GA). SSMU was also mandated to “support campaigns that mobilize in solidarity with the people affected by the use of military technology” at the GA.
An anonymous U2 Science student, who attended the event, found the petition expressing concern about the event “hypocritical.”
“Facilitating those debates is what they were asking for at the GA to begin with, so in that sense I think it does fall under SSMU’s mandate and it is SSMU’s responsibility to facilitate,” they told The Daily.
U0 Arts student Jonah Winer told The Daily that the panel had brought about personal reflection. “In general I’m not a huge fan of the BDS movement, but I also realize that I’ve only heard really negative portrayals of it,” he said. “I think to hear people who [participate] in forming [the movement], and also people who are really [in] favour of it, gives it a lot of nuance and gives me a lot to think about.”
U3 Arts student Ameya Pendse expressed concern about the selection of panelists. “I was, to be honest, disgusted that SSMU was hosting an event on such a divisive issue on campus,” he said. “I think that it was very sad that there wasn’t a single person or academic to counter what these three panelists were saying. […] I think SSMU should focus on issues that are actually affecting students. […] They should not be taking foreign affairs decisions, that is not why we elected them.” 
Asked whether SSMU should remain neutral on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Moustaqim-Barrette said that this was impossible. “There is no way to be neutral in these kinds of affairs, I think that’s just a way of silencing dissent and just another form of censorship,” she said. “I think it’s important that SSMU talks about these things and has events like these where people can come talk about these things.” 
“I think one of the most important things said here is that there’s no neutrality on an issue like this,” noted Winer. “You’re either for or against, and to try to remain neutral is disingenuous.”

2015-03-16,McGill,Israel,"Quorum lost for motion on accessible education policy
On March 15, students gathered in Leacock 132 for the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter 2015 General Assembly (GA). Motions on the table concerned unpaid internships, an accessible education policy, and divestment from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories. The event was scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m., but due to the high number of attendees, proceedings did not begin until noon.
The first motion discussed concerned the nomination of RSM Richter as the auditor for SSMU. VP Finance and Operations Kathleen Bradley explained that the auditor’s contract is renewed every three years, at which point a vote is necessary. The motion passed with 259 votes for, 6 against, and 4 abstentions.
The motion concerning divestment from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories sparked intense debate. The motion called upon SSMU to “divest and refrain from investing in companies that pose social injury by contributing to the continuation and profitability of the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories.”
Moved by petition, this proposal was endorsed by several campus groups, including the Black Students’ Network (BSN), Divest McGill, Midnight Kitchen, QPIRG-McGill, the Union for Gender Empowerment (UGE), and the Pakistani, Jordanian, Syrian, African, Egyptian, and Arab student associations.
The motion proved contentious, with students speaking strongly both in favour and against.
A U2 Management student asked those in attendance to “[move] away from rhetoric and [look] at the actual words in the motion,” and said that “voting yes will institutionalize this deep divide.”
Several others opposed the motion on the grounds that it was affiliated with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, an international campaign that aims to put economic pressure on the state of Israel in protest against its occupation of the Palestinian territories in violation of international law.
U3 Arts student McKenzie Kibler said that to argue that the motion was unrelated to BDS was “insulting the intelligence of students.”
U3 Management student Dina El-baradie responded that the motion did not include an academic or cutural boycott of Israel, and added that the motion in no way questioned Israel’s right to exist, instead merely seeking McGill’s financial disassociation.
“We’ve picked a side – we’re invested in these companies,” she said. “Divesting means disassociating [ourselves from the occupation], and we’re going to be neutral afterward.”
“As McGill students, we are not neutral,” agreed Science student Zain Ali Syed. He cited SSMU’s constitution, which states, “SSMU commits to demonstrating leadership in matters of human rights [and] social justice.”
An anonymous U2 Science student said that as a Palestinian, he is directly affected by the issue. “As a Palestinian at McGill, I am complicit in oppressing my own people.”
Zahra Habib, a U1 student in Middle Eastern Studies and Urban Planning, called on students to question their reason for attending the GA. “I want people to do a lot of self-reflection on why [you are] here,” she said. “If you’re against violence against innocents, you’re for this motion – I have no doubt everyone here is.”
After roughly 45 minutes of debate on the motion, a motion to end debate passed. Syed motioned for a secret ballot, voicing concerns that students might face hostility from their peers based on their choices. This also passed.
After an hour-long voting procedure, the main motion was defeated, with 212 votes for, 276 against, and 9 abstentions. After the results were announced, the vast majority of students present left the GA.
Laura Khoury, member of the “yes” campaign for the motion, spoke to The Daily after the vote.
“Nobody was able to dismiss the fact that the occupation and expansion of settlements was illegal, and nobody could refute the fact that we are complicit in aiding illegal actions. I call on everyone to reflect on their vote to stay complicit, because while you do have a home to go back to every day, many Palestinians don’t as a result of our complicity.”
Jordan Devon, a member of the “no” campaign, also reacted to the outcome of the vote.
“After two failed motions regarding this particular topic this year alone, I hope that students who stand on the other side of this debate understand that two pages of ‘whereas’ clauses accompanied by 18 citations do not summarize the complex realities of geopolitical conflict, and that passing motions like these will change nothing in the Middle East.”
The assembly continued by addressing the issue of illegal unpaid internships with a motion calling on SSMU to stop promoting such positions and lobby McGill to do the same. The motion was brought forward by NDP-McGill and several SSMU councillors.
The final ‘resolved’ clause, which mandated SSMU clubs and services not to “promote, recruit for, or facilitate any internships that contravene applicable employment laws,” sparked considerable debate. Some expressed concern that this would provoke further frustration on the part of club members, some of whom already resent the breadth of SSMU regulations.
SSMU Engineering Representative Scott Conrad brought forward a motion to strike this clause, still expressing concern over the potential negative impact of such a proposal on SSMU’s relationship with its affiliates. He later changed his amendment to only strike clubs, not services, from the clause. This amendment failed.
Attendees eventually decided to divide the question, voting on the section pertaining specifically to clubs separately. Both parts of the motion passed with the first segment garnering 75 votes for, 8 against, and 19 abstentions, and the second also taking a clear majority.
The final motion on the table concerned the financial accessibility of education, calling on SSMU to adopt a policy in support of accessible education.
VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette spoke to the motion, noting that SSMU’s current accessible education policy is about to expire, rendering this proposal particularly urgent.
Several of those who opposed the motion mentioned the recent decision to raise tuition for students from France to the level of those from out of province. They argued that, given the provincial government’s current deficit, this measure had not been unreasonable.
Moustaqim-Barrette responded to these concerns, reminding those present that the decision to raise French students’ tuition had already been made, and that the current motion addressed the imminent prospect of tuition deregulation for all faculties and for out-of-province students.
Speaking against the motion, Kibler accused Moustaqim-Barrette of “fear-mongering.” Out-of-province tuition was unlikely to be raised significantly, he said, as competitive fees were useful for attracting students. He also argued that the clause mandating SSMU to mobilize against austerity was dangerous, as it would enable SSMU to create a mobilization committee, join the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) student federation, and eventually call a strike GA.
Moustaqim-Barrette dismissed Kibler’s allegations. The administration has already announced its intention raise tuition to the highest levels allowed by the market, she said. She also noted that an anti-austerity mobilization committee has already been formed within SSMU, and that SSMU is not eligible for ASSÉ membership because it lacks a “sovereign GA.”
SSMU Medicine Representative Joshua Chin also expressed concern, wondering if the motion would specifically mandate SSMU to organize a strike GA.
One Law student argued in favour of the motion. He noted that many other Quebec universities have taken action against austerity, and called the motion a “really benign” way for McGill students to participate in the collective struggle.
A motion by Chin to divide the question on the grounds that the resolved clauses were fairly unrelated failed. The main motion passed, but as there were only 97 voters present, the 100-person quorum requirement was not met. The motion will thus be brought to SSMU Council for debate and approval.
A motion to “stand in solidarity with students and protesters demanding democratic government worldwide, in particular, Hong Kong,” tabled at the Fall GA, was expected to be moved from the floor. However, some of the movers withdrew their support and the motion was not brought forward.
Most remaining students dispersed at this point, and the assembly adjourned at 5:00 p.m. after hearing the executive reports.

2015-03-16,McGill,Israel,"Panelists note similarities in police behaviour, resistance tactics 
A panel titled “Racial Profiling & Police Brutality from Ferguson to Palestine” kicked off this year’s Israeli Apartheid Week.
Held on March 10 and organized by the Centre for Gender Advocacy as part of its Thick Skin event series on race, gender, and political resistance, the panel discussed the connections between police violence in Palestine and in Canada and the U.S..
This was done by inviting the unique perspectives of three activists – Nargess Mustapha, activist from the Montréal-Nord Républik collective; Ahmad Abuznaid, a co-founder of the Miami-based Dream Defenders; and Cherrell Brown, from the juvenile and criminal justice advocacy organization Justice League NYC.
Two of the event’s organizers, Talia Joundi, a law student at McGill, and Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, from the Centre for Gender Advocacy, introduced the event and explained the importance of drawing parallels between these different experiences.
Joundi noted that “making the connection to people in North America is important to make the lived reality of Palestinians more understandable.”
Rolbin-Ghanie added, “We are by no means saying the struggle is the same – the differences need to be respected. But there are definitely parallels between who the police is profiling and what kinds of colonial mentality are produced by the police in general.”
As the audience filled the Moot Court room in Chancellor Day Hall, some were excited to learn practical skills.
“I came to increase my knowledge of racial profiling and get some tactics to apply to my own life,” explained U1 Biology student Alice Salim.
Others came out of curiosity. “I was in Ferguson in the fall, and saw the early solidarity with Palestinians,” explained Julie Norman, professor in the Department of Political Science, whose research focuses in part on prisoner resistance and prison and detention policies in Palestine.
“Though they are different contexts, there are definitely similar situations in terms of mass arrests, mass incarceration, profiling certain populations, difficult interrogation tactics, and the pressure to confess for a lighter sentence. All these things are very similar,” commented Norman.
Mustapha, speaking in French with live translation, began by discussing the difficult realities faced by Montreal North residents, saying that “police harassment and racial profiling [are] a part of everyday life.”
Mustapha next discussed how the murder of Freddy Villanueva in 2008 – who was shot by Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) officer Jean-Loup Lapointe, who confronted Villenueva and his friends as they were playing dice in Parc Henri-Bourassa – was an example of the worst of the SPVM’s practice of profiling in minority communities.
“In 2010, the internal SPVM report by criminologist Mathieu Charest, which La Presse acquired, showed how common [racial profiling] is,” said Mustapha. “Since 2001, identity checks in Montreal North had gone up by 126 per cent. In 2006 and 2007, 30 to 40 per cent of young black men were being stopped and frisked, while non-racialized Montrealers were stopped and frisked at a rate of 5 per cent.”
Brown spoke next, discussing state violence by sharing stories from a recent trip to Palestine with members of Black Lives Matter – a movement dedicated to combatting racist police violence against black people – and emphasizing the power of social media in sharing tactics.
“That’s the beauty of social media, we have people in another country [who] some folks in Ferguson [have] never heard of, but these are the people tweeting us and telling us how to survive this occupation right now, [with advice like] ‘walk with the wind and not against it,’ or ‘use milk of magnesia and not water when tear-gassed,’” Brown explained.
Having witnessed police brutality and profiling in Palestine firsthand, Brown stressed, “We have to imagine safety and security for ourselves. […] We must imagine something entirely different for ourselves and our children. It will probably be our greatest art project – to imagine a truly liberated world, outside of the scope, definitions, and parameters given to us by our oppressors.”
Next, Abuznaid shared his personal story of returning to Palestine, his birthplace, and rediscovering his roots after a childhood in the U.S..
“At Ben Gurion airport, I was seven years old, and we were taken to a back room where myself and my mother were strip-searched,” Abuznaid recalled. “There were guns and military soldiers everywhere. Immediately, alarms went off in my head that something was not right.”
A lively question and answer period followed, covering the problem of charismatic male leaders in movements, attitudes toward violent resistance, and the on-campus mobilization for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which aims to increase pressures on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territory.
After a standing ovation at the event’s conclusion, one student, beaming, told The Daily, “It was absolutely amazing. I loved it.”

The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) saw its fair share of the short-lived SSMU President Tariq Khan this year. Elections SSMU invalidated Khan’s election as SSMU President on April 1, 2014 – a week after he was elected president by a margin of only 78 votes – due to SSMU bylaw infractions committed during his campaign. The violations included the participation of individuals external to SSMU in his campaign, the sending of unsolicited text messages to the public – for which he had been censured on March 21, the last day of the campaign period –  inconsistencies in campaign expenditures, and the impingement of the spirit of a fair campaign and of the voting process.
Following his invalidation, Khan filed an appeal with the SSMU Judicial Board (J-Board), which upheld his invalidation on April 29. Khan later took this issue to the Superior Court of Quebec and filed a request on May 29 for a preliminary injunction to reinstate him as SSMU President until the full hearing for a permanent injunction. The Court dismissed his application on June 3, reasoning that his reinstatement would have incurred additional costs and caused undue inconvenience on the part of SSMU. Khan later withdrew his court case in October before its full hearing due to financial motivations and the decreasing timeliness of the case.
Khan resurfaced on the first day of the 2015-16 SSMU elections when screenshots of a Facebook conversation were released on reddit, revealing recently-elected SSMU President Kareem Ibrahim’s suggestion to hack Khan’s Facebook account last year. Upon news of the screenshots, he revealed his intentions to update the police report that he filed after his account was allegedly hacked on March 27, 2014.

Compared with 2011’s McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strike, the past few years have been fairly quiet on the union front. This year, however, has seen a flurry of activity at McGill unions.
Floor fellows began a union drive over a year ago in November 2013, driven by the University’s earlier push for a change in residence models. Since then, floor fellows have succeeded at forming a union, and joined the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) last May. The process, however, has not been without hiccups: this January,collective agreement negotiations between the University and the floor fellows bargaining unit stalled over the exclusion of the “core values” of floor fellows (namely their anti-oppressive mandate and harm reduction approach) from the proposed agreement. The negotiations have started again and are currently ongoing.
McGill’s Teaching Union, AGSEM, has also been working to unionize undergraduate teaching support staff, which include course graders, note-takers, and teaching assistants (TAs). Despite receiving support from post-grads and undergrads, the process has not been without tensions: McGill challenged AGSEM’s promotion of its own union campaign due to disputing interpretations of the Quebec Labour Code. At the date of publication, the union drive is still ongoing.
This year also saw a merger between AMUSE and MUNACA, despite some internal trepidation over their differing sizes. Joint bylaws are on the way.

The mental health landscape at McGill for the 2014-15 academic year has been a disappointing one. Though a working group was struck under the purview of Senate in October 2013, most of the recommendations issued by the group in June 2014 have yet to be implemented. Of the 36 initiatives on the roster, only two have been completed, the first being the development of a student services app, and the second publicly presented only as “further [development] of a robust early alert program.”
While both the administration and student government have been pursuing mental health services reform, they do not appear to be working closely. SSMU VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan told The Daily in October, around the time the University announced its intention to create a ‘wellness portal,’ that the relationship between the two was “a consultative arrangement, not a partnership. Given that SSMU is named as a partner on the website, consultation is not enough.”
There have been no updates on the ‘wellness portal,’ projected to be launched in Winter 2015.
Most of the visible events that have taken place this year – in particular, the second annual Students In Mind conference on mental health in October and the Mental Health Awareness Week in November – were largely student-driven and student-led initiatives. Additionally, the most vocal advocates for mental health reform have been students.
In addition to managing the planning and execution of the Mental Health Awareness Week, Stewart-Kanigan oversaw the successful launch of SSMU’s new mental health department, which involved the hire of a coordinator and the development of a mental health listserv to promote peer and professional support services for students and forward student-led anti-stigma initiatives.

After years of SSMU General Assemblies (GAs) that have failed to reach quorum or present particularly political motions, portions of this year’s GAs saw huge turnout – with over 700 students attending the Fall 2014 GA and over 500 students at the Winter 2015 GA – as well as plenty of controversy.
Most notably, both GAs saw motions that poked at the long-dormant Israel-Palestine divide on campus. At the Fall 2014 GA, a motion to stand in solidarity with the people of the occupied Palestinian territories and condemn Israel’s violence toward Palestine over the summer was postponed indefinitely, with 402 in favour and 337 against, after hours of debate. At the Winter 2015 GA, a motion to divest from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories garnered the endorsement of many campus groups (including The Daily), but failed by only 64 votes.
Despite the intense attention given to these two motions, a number of other political motions passed, mandating SSMU to take action on diverse issues such as unpaid internships, military research, climate change, and austerity. SSMU also saw a J-Board challenge after the contentious postponement of the Fall 2014 Palestine motion, where the judicial body ruled that simplified standing rules should be adopted and publicized at GAs to better facilitate debate.
More broadly, this year’s GAs have prompted a campus-wide (and still ongoing) dialogue on the political role of the student union – which most notably played itself out in the recent 2015-16 SSMU executive elections – with some students questioning whether SSMU should take stances on ‘divisive’ political issues.

This year has seen a whirlwind of opposition against austerity measures and budget cuts set in place by the Liberal provincial government, which have reduced funding to social services, including welfare, healthcare, and education. In the fall, as part of an ongoing push that began even before this academic year, students at UQAM organized a group to allow students and community members to work together to protest these cuts: the Comité Printemps 2015, which helped mobilize around 80,000 students to go on strike on Halloween, and over 80,000 students planned to strike against austerity during March and April. This mobilization has not evaded McGill, as French language and literature students recently voted to go on strike for a week, and other departments have planned strike votes.
These student initiatives contrast with the stance taken by the McGill administration, which has been accommodating of austerity measures. McGill has been making cuts of its own, after undergoing $45 million in cuts from the provincial government over the last four years. The results of these cuts have been felt by workers at McGill, as the administration has set up a hiring freeze, decreasing the number of jobs available, and increasing the workloads of many employees. To combat the administration’s decrease in the number of full-time jobs at McGill, as well as the fact that many positions with benefits have been replaced with lower-paid, part-time jobs that do not receive benefits, AMURE recently voted to start a fund for counselling services for its members.

In response to the austerity measures taken by both McGill and the Quebec government SSMU and the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) have taken stances against the government’s measures and asked McGill to oppose these huge cuts. At the SSMU Fall 2014 GA, students voted to add advocating against austerity to the portfolio of the VP External, and SSMU has since hosted an anti-austerity activities night to show students just how wide-reaching the damaging effects of austerity can be.

Many important initiatives that began in previous years were continued and strengthened over the course of this one. Divest McGill helped organize a bus to take McGill and Concordia students to the People’s Climate March in New York City, where over 400,000 people marched in the streets of Manhattan to protest the United Nations Climate Summit and raise awareness about global warming. Divest also submitted a new petition for McGill to divest from fossil fuel companies to the Board of Governors (BoG), making a comeback two years after its first petition was presented to, and rejected by, the BoG. In addition, over 100 faculty members signed on to an open letter submitted to the BoG in support of divestment.
SSMU also continued its efforts to promote sustainability on campus, starting a composting program in the Shatner building, and joining Étudiant(e)s contre les oléoducs (ÉCO), after the a motion passed at the Fall 2014 GA that mandated SSMU to stand alongside groups combatting climate change.
Finally, the McGill Office of Sustainability launched its Vision 2020 program, an initiative aiming to create a more sustainable McGill by the year 2020.

2015-11-02,McGill,Israel,"McGill student solidarity group focuses conversation on human rights
On October 28, Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill presented a workshop entitled “Palestine 101: Intro to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.” The event was organized as part of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Week at Concordia, and was the only event held by SPHR McGill.
The speakers were Melis Çagan, Ralph Haddad (former Daily editor and current director on the Board of the Daily Publications Society), and Michael McCauley, three members of SPHR McGill.
The workshop began with a brief overview of the occupation and the plight of Palestinians living in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and the diaspora, respectively. The overview, presented by McCauley and Haddad, described the blockade and military assaults on the Gaza Strip, instances of police brutality against Palestinians, and the Israeli West Bank Barrier, also known as the Wall.
“This blockade of the Strip has prevented the reconstruction of homes that have been demolished in previous military assaults against the region, and have also virtually destroyed the Gaza economy,” McCauley said. “There is […] a 43 per cent unemployment rate in the Strip – that is the result of both the blockade and these repeated military assaults.”
“There is […] a 43 per cent unemployment rate in the Strip – that is the result of both the blockade and these repeated military assaults.”
The presentation included footage showing Palestinian refugee camps being demolished by the Israeli state, as well as analysis of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, with a focus on the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords, and the 2000 Camp David negotiations.
“The problem with these peace talks [is] that they’re very asymmetrical. They lean more toward Israel’s side than the Palestinian side,” said Haddad. “They also assume that both parties are equal and they have the same to bring to the negotiation table, which is inherently wrong. You can’t sit down at a table with your oppressor and talk about an equal exchange that will happen between you.”
The visual presentation displayed the three demands of the BDS call: “Ending [the Israeli state’s] occupation and colonization of all Arab lands [occupied in June 1967] and dismantling the Wall; recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties, as stipulated in [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194].”
“Because there is no constant stance in Palestine about a one-state or two-state solution, by focusing BDS on having [human] rights, [since] there’s a general consensus on what rights people should have […] it’s easier for people from different political views to take part in it,” noted Çagan.
“Neutrality in this case means complicity with the oppressor, and I think this attitude needs to change if we are ever to make any strides in standing in solidarity with the liberation struggles of [the Palestinian] people.”
Çagan concluded the presentation by discussing the relative success of international calls for BDS, which began in 2004 with a Palestinian campaign for academic boycott. Recent successes of the BDS movement worldwide include the French multinational infrastructure company Veolia selling its shares in the consortium that runs Jerusalem Light Rail as well as the global mobilization to divest from G4S, a British multinational security company that provides security equipment and supplies to Israeli prisons in the West Bank.
Following the presentation, participants brought up questions comparing boycott and divestment tactics used to end South African apartheid in the 1980s and 1990s and BDS against Israeli apartheid today. Discussion also centered on McGill’s role in the BDS movement. McGill has investments in G4S as well as Re/Max, a real estate company that sells properties in Israeli settlements.
Liza Riitters, a U1 Political Science student who attended the workshop, noted that while many students she knew were in support of the Palestinian cause, many others at McGill did not support divestment. “I was here last year when they were trying to [divest from the occupation of Palestinian territory], and so many people were saying ‘Oh, the university shouldn’t have an opinion,’” said Riitters.
Ayesha Talreja, a U3 International Development student and member of SPHR McGill said, “Neutrality in this case means complicity with the oppressor, and I think this attitude needs to change if we are ever to make any strides in standing in solidarity with the liberation struggles of [the Palestinian] people.”

2015-11-02,McGill,Israel,"A look at the boycott, divestment and
sanctions movement at Concordia and McGill
Between October 26 and 30, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) Concordia organized a week-long campaign dedicated to raising awareness about the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
BDS Week was the first of its kind at Concordia, and featured speakers such as Kanien’kehá:ka activist Clifton Nicholas, human rights attorney and activist Noura Erakat, and Palestine-based independent journalist Dan Cohen. The week also featured musical performances by Saeed Kamjoo, Julien Ottavi, and JKPickett as part of the Howl! fall event series.
Last year, between November 25 and 27, Concordia students passed a referendum that asked students, “Do you approve of the [Concordia Students’ Union (CSU)] endorsing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel?”
The initial draft of the question included “until Israel complies with International Law and Universal Principle[s] of Human Rights,” but this section was removed by the CSU Judicial Board prior to the referendum.
According to Rami Yahia, a member of SPHR Concordia, the availability of funding from the CSU for Concordia’s BDS Week is a direct result of last year’s ‘yes’ vote.
“We had a referendum vote where all the students could participate, whereas at McGill, [the GA included just] whatever students decided to show up to that [GA], on that particular time on that particular day, [when there] was a snowstorm.”
The week also coincided with the one year anniversary of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Fall General Assembly (GA), where students voted to indefinitely postpone a motion calling on SSMU to stand in solidarity with the people of the occupied Palestinian territories. The motion was brought up in response to Operation Protective Edge, launched by the Israeli military in Summer 2014.
Later in March, another motion proposed by SPHR concerning divestment from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories was defeated. Some students opposed the motion on the grounds that it was allegedly affiliated with the BDS movement.
Abdulla Daoud, another member of SPHR Concordia, explained that the SSMU motion was not concerned with standing in solidarity with the BDS movement, but rather with specifically divesting from companies.
“We know [SPHR McGill], we work closely with them. They’re very strong and passionate people. We believe that there is really no difference as far as what happened at McGill and what happened at Concordia – only as far as how the structure is,” Daoud told The Daily.
“We had a referendum vote where all the students could participate, whereas at McGill, [the GA included just] whatever students decided to show up to that [GA], on that particular time on that particular day, [when there] was a snowstorm.”
Michael McCauley, a member of SPHR McGill, said, “We had, I think, more difficulty with motivating people to come out and walk through the snow to get there. Whereas, there was more motivation from the people who were mobilizing against us, despite the fact that I really do think that there is a lot more sympathy toward [the] Palestinian cause than was reflected at that particular GA.”
In an email to The Daily, Hillel McGill president Rayna Lew argued that the BDS movement is reductive.
“BDS simply does not create an academic space for discussion on the conflict, peace, or resolution. […] The movement polarizes the issue and does not invite nuanced discussion from either side,” Lew said.
Jordan Devon, a U2 Political Science student, agreed with Lew, stating that BDS supporters fail to understand the complexities of Israeli society. Although Devon is co-president of Israel on Campus (IOC), his statement was not made on behalf of the organization. “For this fundamental reason, the BDS movement is failing to achieve its goal, particularly to inflict enough pressure on Israeli society so that its government will abolish certain policies pertaining to the Palestinians,” said Devon.
Devon expressed that it is possible to be critical of the BDS movement and the Israeli state at the same time. “Being pro-Israel or Zionist is not a monolithic identity; it is not confined to supporting the current Israeli government or the settlement program; it is not manifested through blindly defending every action undertaken by Israel,” he said.
But according to Daoud, “[BDS is] the most non-violent and peaceful way a person in North America can aid in resisting the occupation that occurs right now in the West Bank and Gaza. It’s very diplomatic, very concise, very strong, and very easy to do.”
McCauley explained that the BDS movement adopts a human rights – based approach. “There is generally a pretty broad consensus [that] BDS in Palestine […] doesn’t exist for support for political parties or support for a one- versus two-state solution.”
“So, as I see it, despite any sort of criticism that you may have of the ultimate goals of BDS, […] it’s something that you nevertheless have a responsibility to support because it’s a direct call that was made by the Palestinians themselves,” McCauley stated.

2015-11-09,McGill,Israel,"Alexei Simakov
Following the resignation of Lola Baraldi as VP Internal of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), a by-election was called to fill the position for the rest of the year. Campaigning began on November 5, and will run until November 15, with the voting period occurring from November 11 to 15. The debate will take place at 6:30 p.m. on November 11. The McGill Daily interviewed the two candidates running for election, Céleste Pagniello and Alexei Simakov.
The McGill Daily (MD): Why are you running for VP Internal?
Alexei Simakov (AS): I’ve been very passionate about McGill and being involved in McGill in various functions. Since my first year, [I’ve been involved in actions] against strike manifestations, and every year since then, I’ve tried to contribute in some small way.
I can, I think, make a meaningful contribution. When I first ran [for SSMU president] last year, that was obviously much more chaotic. […] During that experience and afterward, I’ve learned a lot about McGill, a lot about the student body. I’ve learned a lot about what people are thinking about SSMU [and] how they’re thinking about SSMU. I want to apply that experience to McGill in an executive capacity.
MD: What kind of experience will you bring to this role?
AS: I’ve worked, for example, in [the Moderate Political Action Committee (ModPAC)] in first year, that was during the strike manifestation. I’ve worked on various referendum questions; a lot of them were anti-BDS [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel].
[…] I’ve filed a couple of [Judicial Board cases] against SSMU. I’ve been involved with, for example, the ongoing internal [regulations] review process. That’s something I’m excited to contribute, whether or not I’m successful in the election.
“I’ve been involved with, for example, the ongoing internal [regulations] review process. That’s something I’m excited to contribute, whether or not I’m successful in the election.”
MD: What do you think is the most important thing about the position?
AS: One of the things I’m talking [about] on my platform […] is the yearbook, [which] is definitely financially unsustainable right now. We need to [ask] a lot of difficult questions as to whether we want to continue that tradition – which I think is important. It’s going to probably include a student fee. […] If we don’t do that, will the student body be comfortable with cancelling the project? […] I’m usually enthusiastic about saying we should do this, I’m not reserved about that, but I think it’s definitely one of those situations where the student body needs to be able to decide that kind of question.
Beyond that, SSMU’s going through a period of reform right now. […] I think people from across all political opinions at McGill can agree that SSMU’s facing a lot of structural challenges that go [beyond simply] political divisions. […] I think the VP Internal would be able to contribute […]  by communicating what those challenges are and how we can solve them.
MD: What do you hope to improve on in your position compared to last year, or what Lola Baraldi did?
AS: I think [last year’s VP Internal] Daniel Chaim has done a fairly good job in doing his role. I think that the position has inherently been more like functional and administrative than something like the president’s portfolio. [Given that I’d have only one third of a term] it would be inherently difficult for anyone to be able to complete a full portfolio project, which would take me usually more than a year.
I think more important for me would be to lay the foundation for what the next year’s incoming executive would do. I don’t think this is necessarily selling myself short.
I think more important for me would be to lay the foundation for what the next year’s incoming executive would do. I don’t think this is necessarily selling myself short. […] This is realistic within the timeframe and the exceptional circumstances.
MD: How will you promote some of the bilingualism initiatives started by the previous VPs Internal?
AS: I think bilingualism [is something] that we have to maintain a focus on – make sure we don’t slide back, make sure we don’t forget our focus on bilingualism. […] In my experience, and I’m very open to seeing otherwise [… the McGill community] hasn’t been very vocal about [a lack of bilingualism]. […] It would be a matter of engaging with students who are bilingual and who are involved with making sure that their French is well-promoted on campus – listening to their voices.
MD: SSMU is undergoing a lot of trouble. Considering that, how would you help mitigate these problems?
AS: We have to be conscious of the fact that […] a lot of these [financial] challenges are [… due to] broader shifts in the national [and] provincial administrative relationships. […] The fact that McGill’s getting less money means that Student Services are getting less money, which means SSMU is taking on more responsibilities for itself.
I think I speak enthusiastically for being financially responsible, to make sure we use [the] limited resources we have to do more important projects. One of my strengths would be that I can more comfortably make the cuts that need to be made, if that’s the situation we’re forced into.
“The reality for SSMU is that any student government is inherently going to be overrepresented by students who are politically engaged.”
MD: Do you see SSMU as a political actor and how will your view impact your role as VP Internal?
AS: I mean they’re already very political. I don’t think it’s so much an opinion, I think they’re consciously, openly, institutionally oriented a lot toward political activism. And this is something I kind of learned last year. […] One of the pitches I made was that we need to stop this political radicalism, we need to stop this far-left kind of anarchy. […] What I’ve learned since then [is that] it’s not a matter of stopping those kinds of political spirits, it’s a matter of balancing them out.
MD: Given the wide variety of views in the student body, how should SSMU mitigate the tension between leadership and representation?
AS: The reality for SSMU is that any student government is inherently going to be overrepresented by students who are politically engaged. And those in [campus politics] are naturally those who are more on the left. That’s not necessarily a problem, that’s the reality of politics.
It’s like saying that Montreal’s cold. We’re not complaining about that. We shouldn’t try making it warmer, we should try to adapt.
You just have to ask the question, how can we amplify the voices of students that are affected by SSMU’s ideas but aren’t engaged in SSMU’s ideas. One of the things I didn’t like about the opposition last year was that they kept talking about consultation and listening to student voices. And the processes they were suggesting would simply be coming to SSMU and contributing your voice. But that’s, again, the same people over and over.
One of the things I’m suggesting is actually having formal engagements with Faculty associations, including Engineering and Science. There [are] obviously Science and Engineering [representatives] that come to SSMU, but they’re still very underrepresented and their voice can’t be as heard. […] We’ve seen [this] with the climate change motion.

2016-02-04,McGill,Israel,"Campaigners to bring BDS motion to upcoming SSMU General Assembly
Updated on February 5.
On February 4, a group of McGill students and student organizations, called McGill BDS Action Network, brought the global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to campus by launching a BDS campaign at McGill.
In an interview with The Daily, Laura Khoury, one of the organizers of the campaign, explained that the campaign “particularly calls on university campuses to divest from companies that profit off of the occupation of Palestine.”
“That includes any business activites that allow these companies to profit off of anything that the State of Israel uses to continue to expand its occupation and its settlements on occupied territories, which is against international law,” Khoury said.
For its first action, the campaign held a demonstration at the Y-intersection on February 4, handing out flyers to passers-by with information regarding the campaign. In addition, the demonstrators held a sign stating, “Stand against oppression, stand for justice in Palestine.”
The demonstration was also accompanied by the launch of a website, detailing the goals of the campaign.
Currently, McGill has investments in four companies which, the campaign organizers claim, directly profit from the occupation. These companies are the British private security systems corporation G4S, surveillance and reconnaissance systems provider L-3 Communications, Israel’s fourth largest commercial bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, and the real estate company RE/MAX.
“That includes any businesses that allow these companies to profit off of anything that the State of Israel uses to continue to expand its occupation and its settlements on occupied territories, which is against international law.”
According to Khoury, the campaign is also attempting to bring these investments to the attention of the McGill Board of Governors’ Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), which could consider recommending divestment if the McGill community proves that the companies’ business activities constitute “social injury.”
Members of the campus environmental justice group Divest McGill have been attempting to appeal to CAMSR in a similar fashion since 2013, asking that McGill divest its holdings in tar sands and fossil fuel companies.
At this point, the BDS campaign is officially endorsed by many groups, including the McGill Syrian Students’ Association, McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights, Cinema Politica McGill, Midnight Kitchen, the Black Students’ Network of McGill, Divest McGill, the Union for Gender Empowerment, and McGill Students for Feminisms.
Apart from appealing to CAMSR, however, the campaigners are also planning on bringing up a BDS motion at the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter General Assembly (GA) on February 22. Two motions regarding Palestine were brought up at the two GAs in the previous academic year. The motion brought up at the Fall 2014 GA was tabled indefinitely, while the one brought up at the Winter 2015 GA was voted down.
Another organizer with the campaign differentiated the upcoming motion from last year’s motions regarding Palestine. The upcoming motion will explicitly call on SSMU to support BDS campaigns on campus, and to lobby the McGill Board of Governors to divest from corporations deemed complicit in the occupation of the Palestinian territories.
Zahra Habib, another organizer with the campaign, explained that while the motion is one of the campaign’s concerns, it is not the only concern. Habib explained that the main purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness regarding Palestine on campus.
“We created this campaign to […] raise awareness on campus about the motion, for students to both get a background and to mobilize, and to come to the SSMU GA and vote – regardless of whatever side they’re on,” Habib told The Daily.
Between now and the Winter GA, the campaign will be holding various events, including a talk on BDS and anti-Semitism by Rabbi Cantor Michael Davis on February 18, a screening of Palestinian short films by Cinema Politica on February 17, and a “Concert for Justice” on February 20.
Fuad Quaddoura, a U0 Science student and a Palestinian himself, expressed that he was glad to see students mobilizing around this issue.
“I was headed to my math class, and seeing this was an eye-opener. I was really happy, pleased. The fact that so many people – Palestinian, non-Palestinian, white, all races – are signing up for the cause is just really heartwarming,” Quaddoura told The Daily.

2016-02-15,McGill,Israel,"1968 chairperson of political science association talks to The Daily
On November 26, 1968, the McGill Political Science Association (PSA) went on strike to protest lack of student input in curriculum and hiring, as well as a lack of diverse political opinions in syllabi. Political Science students occupied the fourth floor of the Leacock building for ten days, with the strike ending in a student victory. Arnold August was one of the leaders of the strike and chairperson of the PSA at the time, and is now an author, journalist, and lecturer. Following a panel discussion organized by the Political Science Students’ Association (PSSA) on February 8, August spoke to The Daily about parallels between the 1968 strike and the 2012 Maple Spring strike, as well as the challenges of student mobilization.
The McGill Daily (MD): Could you speak to the parallels between the 1968 student strike and that of the 2012 student strikes?
Arnold August (AA): I think the important thing was – and this is similar to the student [movement] in 2012 – that it was a grassroots movement. And there was leadership, of course, but it was a collective leadership. It wasn’t based on individual personalities.
Now, in 2012 […] you had a very small group of students who were encouraged by the Liberal Party, by the Quebec judicial system – the courts – to get injunctions against the picket lines. The only argument that these students had was “I have a right to my education.”
As they were breaking through the picket lines with the help of the police, the students who were in favour of the strike were taunting them, “je, me, moi.” In French that means, basically, “me, myself, and I.” In other words, they were only concerned with their own well-being and completely oblivious of the collective well-being of students.
“In other words, they were only concerned with their own well-being and completely oblivious of the collective well-being of students.”
Students then, in 2012 as in 1968, were not just demanding, in our case, a more pluralistic series of subjects, but we also wanted the University to be not oblivious to what’s happening in society. And that was also one of the main demands put forward by the student movement in 2012. It was not just for the students, but for the future of Quebec society. In this case students had the right […] not to be indebted for years to come because of an education.
MD: In 1968, you said students voted “overwhelmingly” for the strike, whereas in 2012, only 3 per cent of McGill students were on strike. What was it about the political climate or the demographic of students in 1968 that allowed for that kind of mass mobilization?
AA: In McGill in 1968, there were other activities taking place for the CEGEP strike at virtually the same time. You also had the struggle against the war in Vietnam […] in the U.S. as well as in Canada and Europe. So at McGill, even if we may have been a bit detached from the rest of Quebec, this student movement […] was so engulfing that it overrode any difference that might exist between McGill and the rest of Quebec society. It was more of a global situation.
“So at McGill, even if we may have been a bit detached from the rest of Quebec, this student movement […] was so engulfing that it overrode any difference that might exist between McGill and the rest of Quebec society.”
I was very influenced in terms of the U.S. attempt to smother the revolution in Cuba – [I was] against U.S. interference in that country. And, of course, what struck me the most in 1967, 1968, which formed my thinking, was the war in Vietnam. Not too long after that, you had four students who were killed at Kent State University for protesting against the war in Vietnam.
Also in ‘67 and ‘68, there were draft-dodgers from the United States who came to Montreal, some of whom became students at McGill University. So, you see, it was a worldwide movement at the time.
MD: There’s a lot of student apathy, elitism, and privilege insulating McGill students from societal issues, and universities are inherently hierarchical institutions. How does this hinder student mobilization?
AA: I think that’s true – inherent in McGill. It’s very oligarchical, very elitist, it’s a wealthy university. […] But this also creates a contradiction within itself. Even though it’s an “elite” university, and that the students who attend here are perhaps a bit better off than students in other universities, they’re still youth. And youth necessarily are looking to their future, for a better future. […]
Generally, youth are looking at how to change things, they more easily identify injustices. Whereas the older generation is more prone to accepting that this is the way it is, they don’t get shocked by what’s happening in wars, and people being killed, or, for example, the Israeli occupation.
“Generally, youth are looking at how to change things, they more easily identify injustices.”
MD: What advice would you give to students trying to mobilize at McGill, and beyond their university careers?
AA: I’m talking to you about that experience [of the 1968 student strike] almost five decades later – you don’t forget it. I still have the same ideas now that I had in 1968. They called me a Marxist revolutionary – yeah, I’m proud to be.
I’ve been able to expand my objectives to go way beyond the two- or three-year experience at McGill. […] I think the most important thing is to not give up on your principles. I had my principles in the 1960s, and I have the same ideas now.
“They called me a Marxist revolutionary – yeah, I’m proud to be.”
The university administration is very aware that people are only here for three or four years, and they try to weather the storm […] but then other young people are coming to university as well, with the same ideas, the same aspirations.
Students come and go, but the principles of youth – against the status quo, in favour of justice, against aggression – that’s permanent.

2016-02-22,McGill,Israel,"McGill BDS event series sets the stage for SSMU General Assembly
Last week, the McGill BDS Action Network hosted an event series as part of its campaign leading up to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA), which takes place today. The group’s motion at the GA asks SSMU to support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns and to recommend to McGill’s Board of Governors to divest from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
The event series, which ran from February 16 to February 20, included a panel discussion with Montreal-based activists, a talk by Rabbi Cantor Michael Davis called “The Moral Case for BDS,” and the screening of three Palestinian short films. The event series ended on Saturday with a concert and open mic event.
Laura Khoury, an organizer with McGill BDS, told The Daily that the event series was organized “to engage [students] in a discussion about the Palestinian cause and to further discuss the call from Palestinian civil society to carry out boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel until it complies with international law.”
The Montreal-based activists on the panel held on February 16 were Palestinian activist Zahia El-Masri and writer and community organizer Mostafa Henaway. The panelists spoke about the BDS movement as “a critical tool” for showing international solidarity, highlighting its importance to the Palestinian struggle.
El-Masri highlighted the significance of raising awareness, especially given the lack of mainstream knowledge about the Palestinian struggle. “What it means to be Palestinian today is to be negated the right of your identity, it’s to be negated the right of return, it’s to even be negated the right to have the collective imaginary of a Palestinianhood,” El-Masri said.
Henaway also argued that the BDS movement is imperative because “it’s coming from Palestinians themselves, and they’re demanding our solidarity in this way.”
Speaking about supporting BDS at McGill specifically, El-Masri said, “Every move that you make, every action, every time you spread the word about what’s going on, don’t underestimate it. It makes a difference.” Henaway pointed to student campaigns for McGill to divest from South African apartheid as an example, and explained that the call for BDS was initiated in Durban, South Africa at the 2001 World Conference against Racism.
“The South African delegation wanted to highlight Zionism as a form of apartheid, as a form [of] discrimination and racial inequality that the international community has to uphold as a priority in terms of Israel’s acceptance of international law,” Henaway said.
The call for BDS, he explained, was founded on “fundamental principles of universal justice – that Palestinians should have the same rights that Israeli citizens are able to have.”
“What it means to be Palestinian today is to be negated the right of your identity, it’s to be negated the right of return, it’s to even be negated the right to have the collective imaginary of a Palestinianhood.”
McGill did not divest from South African apartheid until 1985, and Henaway said that while “we look back now on history and lots of people think, ‘How could anybody support South African apartheid, one of the ugliest forms of a racist, colonial state.’ […] There was complete mainstream support for it. It was ‘a liberal democracy in a sea of barbarism in Africa,’ and it’s the same logic that many people who support Israeli apartheid use today.”
During the discussion period, a student in the audience asked the panelists to respond to an argument commonly made against BDS, which is that it negatively affects citizens of Israel.
Henaway responded, “It’s the status quo that actually hurts Israeli citizens at the moment. It’s the fact that they’re seen as supporting an occupation, it’s the fact that […] it’s mandatory for all Israelis to serve [in]the military, the fact that their state is imploding, all of this as a result of an ongoing colonial project impacts them negatively.”
“By supporting BDS, you’re only basically supporting international law,” El-Masri concluded.
Yusuf, a U1 Economics student who attended the panel discussion, told The Daily, “I found the panel very informative, and they gave me new insight into real situations […] that happen in Palestine on a daily basis. […] It was very easy [to] relate to the points they were making, especially in the context of North America.”

2016-02-23,McGill,Israel,"Motion to support Indigenous women titleholders tabled due to insufficient consultation
Click here to access the live-coverage minisite for the Winter 2016 SSMU General Assembly.
On February 22, almost 900 students gathered in the Shatner building to participate in the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA).
A motion in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement passed with 58 per cent of the vote. A motion for an increase in Indigenous content at McGill and a motion regarding the procurement of products containing conflict minerals by SSMU also passed.
A motion regarding support for the kahtihon’tia:kwenio (women title holders of the land) who delivered a notice of seizure and a list of demands to McGill University in September was added to the agenda at the GA. The motion was postponed until the Fall 2016 GA.
The doors for the 3:00 p.m. event opened at 2:12 p.m., with the SSMU ballroom filling to capacity by 2:40 p.m.. Other rooms in the Shatner building were then filled, including Gerts, Lev Bukhman, the cafeteria, room 108, and the Club Lounge. The entire GA lasted five hours and twenty minutes.
To come into force, all motions passed at the GA must be ratified online in a referendum of SSMU members. This will take place within the week, according to SSMU President Kareem Ibrahim.
The BDS motion, brought forth by the McGill BDS Action Network, sought that SSMU support BDS campaigns through the office of the VP External, and that the President lobby the McGill Board of Governors for “divestment from companies profiting from violations of Palestinian human rights” by bringing the issue up at every meeting. Last year, two similar motions were brought up at the Fall 2014 and Winter 2015 GAs, where they were, respectively, postponed indefinitely and voted down.
The global BDS movement was launched in 2005, after a call from 171 Palestinian civil society organizations to impose boycotts and implement divestment initiatives against the State of Israel “until [it] meets its obligation to recognize the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination and fully complies with the precepts of international law.”
McGill holds investments in at least three companies that, according to the motion, profit from Israel’s activities in the occupied territories: L-3 Communications, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank, and RE/MAX.
Dozens of students lined up in the SSMU ballroom to speak on the BDS motion, which sparked a debate that lasted over two hours.
“The lands in the West Bank are being appropriated, resources are being appropriated for Israeli settlers,” said an anonymous U2 Science student. “By investing in the companies McGill is invested in, we are complicit, and as a Palestinian student, I refuse this. […] If you are pro-Palestinian, vote yes. […] If you don’t want Israel to be involved in fucked-up human rights violations, vote yes.”
“The lands in the West Bank are being appropriated, resources are being appropriated for Israeli settlers.”
Students who spoke against the motion mentioned that this motion was too closely tied to some students’ identities and as such risked alienating certain groups of students.
“Real allies would not ignore the call being made by the overwhelming majority of Jews, who, of any religious group, are the number one victims of hate crimes in the U.S. and Canada, and are saying that they have seen [a rise] in anti-Semitism wherever BDS has been adopted,” said Arts student Noam Blauer.
Arts student Sami Fuller responded, “I would like to ask, where exactly in the language of this motion do you see any targeting of students? We are boycotting policy, not students.”
Some students argued that the BDS movement would undermine the Palestinian cause by alienating potential allies. U2 Arts student and the president of Israel on Campus Jordan Devon said, “Cultural boycotts only serve to place the Israeli left in a precarious situation while reinforcing the right’s hold on the government. Netanyahu keeps winning elections because he’s telling Israelis the world is against them.”
A Management student said, “If BDS was truly a movement about helping Palestinians, it’d advocate even investing in Israel thus providing necessary capital for the building of industry and infrastructure, were Jews and Arabs alike can work together toward the common language of peace and prosperity.”
“Real allies would not ignore the call being made by the overwhelming majority of Jews, who, of any religious group, are the number one victims of hate crimes in the U.S. and Canada, and are saying that they have seen [a rise] in anti-Semitism wherever BDS has been adopted.”
However, others emphasized that BDS has been called for by Palestinian organizations.
“First of all, as a Palestinian, can you not speak on my behalf?” said Laura Khoury, a McGill BDS organizer responding to the management student. “We have called for this. It is your moral obligation as people of social conscience to answer this call. It is not your obligation to tell what Israel has done to us. Every single Jewish student in this room can fly to Israel tomorrow, while I have never been able to step foot on that land.”
The vote was taken by secret ballot, following a motion to that effect. The main motion carried, with 512 votes for, 357 opposed, and 14 abstentions.
“It’s an amazing feeling, finally, to see justice win. When you’re on the right side of history, it’s empowering. When something like this happens, it validates what you’re feeling,” one student attendee, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily.
“I’ve talked to so many people who have said that issues like this only divide the campus, and [that] the GA isn’t very representative of everyone’s voices. So now we finally get the chance, through the online ratification, to see how well it correlates with the rest of the university,” they continued.
A vote in favour of the BDS motion.
On September 12, McGill was delivered a notice of seizure by the kahtihon’tia:kwenio, women titleholders of Kahnawake, which claimed that the University violates the Great Law of Peace “by staying on our land without our permission.”
The notice also asked that McGill repay a loan taken from the Six Nations’ Trust Fund in the mid-1800s, which would amount to approximately $1.7 billion with compound interest, and that it cease “developing technologies for surveillance, death, and destruction” on the occupied land. According to McGill Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet, this debt has been paid back to the federal government.
The motion, which was submitted after the motion submission deadline and was not available online before the GA, called on SSMU to support the kahtihon’tia:kwenio and lobby McGill to meet with them to discuss their grievances.
Cadence O’Neal, U3 Arts student and one of the movers of the motion, said that the motion was written after several months of consultation with the kahtihon’tia:kwenio. According to the movers, this extensive consultation was the reason that the motion was submitted late, and had to be added to the agenda at the GA.
“I feel that this lack of consultation is just a perpetuation of colonial problems that have been happening at this university.”
Ashley Bach, Coordinator of the Indigenous Student Alliance of McGill, raised concerns with the motion.
“There was no consultation with the Indigenous student life at McGill University in the making of this motion,” Bach said. “I feel that this lack of consultation is just a perpetuation of colonial problems that have been happening at this university.”
Bach added that one of the women titleholders consulted for the motion is a controversial figure in Kahnawake, whose ideas and writings have resulted in some backlash against her community. “The Indigenous Student Alliance cannot back what this woman is saying, because of a lack of support in her own community.”
O’Neil apologized for the lack of consultation. “[From] my perspective as a settler student at McGill, when we were approached by the kahtion’tia:kwenio, who asked us to bring forth the motion, it was with the understanding that it was not our role to engage in a consultative process within the community, that would not be our place.”
Students voted to postpone the motion until the next GA, with three votes against.
The GA also passed a motion to change SSMU’s auditor from Richter LLP to Fuller Landau LLP, which, according to VP Finance and Operations Zacheriah Houston, will save the Society approximately 15 per cent on audit fees annually.
“Contrary to what many of you may think, this is one of the most important motions on the agenda today,” Houston said at the GA about the motion.
Another motion, regarding the procurement of products containing conflict minerals by SSMU, called for SSMU’s Financial Ethics Research Committee (FERC) to “update its purchasing guidelines to include consideration of the extent to which electronics suppliers are making efforts to source conflict-free minerals from Congo for their products,” among other requests.
The motion passed without debate.
A motion for an increase in Indigenous content at McGill also carried with no debate.
“The motion accepts the idea that we should be a part of the truth and reconciliation process, and asks SSMU to be a champion of this,” said Jacob Schweda, third-year Law student and co-president of NDP McGill. “It’s a relatively modest step forward, but it’s one that we think is important for the community.”
The GA concluded with a brief discussion on the Senate caucus smoking working group’s Smoking Policy Proposal, as well as reports from the SSMU executives.

2016-02-27,McGill,Israel,"Organizations campaigning for “no” vote alleged to have violated SSMU regulations
This is a developing story. The article will be updated to reflect any changes that may occur.
The motion regarding support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, passed at the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA), has failed the online ratification process, amid allegations of illegal campaigning against the motion during the ratification period.
The results of the online ratification process were announced on February 27. The BDS motion was nullified with 2,819 students (57 per cent) votes against the ratification, 2,119 (43 per cent) votes in favour, and 6.6 per cent out of a total of 5,286 students abstaining. Motions that pass at the GA need to be ratified online before they can be put in effect.
Other motions passed at the GA were ratified, with the motion regarding the procurement of products containing conflict minerals by SSMU and the motion for an increase in Indigenous content at McGill gathering 75.5 per cent and 70.3 per cent of votes in favour respectively.
In a statement published on its Facebook page, the McGill BDS Action Network, also known as McGill BDS, thanked it supporters and declared that “the fight is not over.”
“Though we are disappointed with the outcome of the online ratification process, we are proud of the 2,119 students who stood for the rights of Palestinians.”
Speaking to The Daily, Melis Çağan, an organizer with McGill BDS, said, “Though we are disappointed with the outcome of the online ratification process, we are proud of the 2,119 students who stood for the rights of Palestinians.”
“We take pride in the extensive work that the McGill BDS Action Network has put into this campaign; we have still made history. We passed the BDS motion on the same day as the [House of Commons of the Canadian] Parliament voted to condemn BDS. As history has shown, real change comes from the people and not from governments,” Çağan continued.
In another statement published on February 26, McGill BDS had condemned “active campaigning efforts and tactics used by various students, professors, and student groups in opposition” to the motion. In addition, McGill BDS alleges that “fraudulent Reddit and Instagram accounts have been created with our name and logo.”
According to article 6.4 of the SSMU Internal Regulations of the Presidential Portfolio, “Campaigning is not permitted during the period for online ratification.”
McGill BDS alleges that campus groups opposing the BDS motion have used “exterior organizations, rather than their campus affiliates, to disseminate misinformation regarding the motion’s intent, form, and impact.”
According to evidence shared on McGill BDS’s Facebook page and sent to The Daily, Federation CJA, a Montreal-based Jewish organization, sent an email to its membership during the online ratification period, asking members to “encourage your children, your grandchildren, your friends, indeed any McGill students you may know to make their voices heard by voting ‘NO’ in [the] online ratification against the BDS motion.”
“For the online ratification process to be truly meaningful, we need students to be aware and informed of the issues. It is in that spirit [that] we released our statement.”
The Quebec branch of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) also created a sponsored Facebook post on February 26, with the statement urging students to vote against the BDS motion, in both French and English.
At McGill, the Conservative Association at McGill University released a statement on February 24, asking students to “join us by standing with Israel, and voting no to the BDS motion,” on their Facebook page. The statement was edited roughly two hours after it was published.
When asked to explain why his group published that statement, Conservative Association at McGill University President Alexei Simakov told The Daily, “For the online ratification process to be truly meaningful, we need students to be aware and informed of the issues. It is in that spirit [that] we released our statement.”
The “Vote No McGill” Facebook page has also campaigned for a “no” vote during the voting period for the online ratification, saying, “It takes a few seconds and will help us stop this motion in its tracks.”
McGill BDS stated that it “will be pursuing recourse for the fact that there was illegal campaigning to vote no on the motion.”
“We are proud of our accomplishment despite this uneven playing field.”
Çağan said, “We got 43 per cent of the votes in a race where the opposition was campaigning at full force despite it being illegal to campaign during online ratification, evidence of which we have collected throughout voting period. We are proud of our accomplishment despite this uneven playing field.”
Speaking to The Daily, SSMU President Kareem Ibrahim explained that a petition could be brought to the SSMU Judicial Board (J-Board) regarding these alleged violations of the internal regulations. If the J-Board is convinced that these actions do constitute violations, it could recommend a revote. Ibrahim noted that the J-Board’s recommendations must be ratified by the SSMU Board of Directors, adding however that only in extreme and rare circumstances would recommendations made by the J-Board not be ratified.

2016-03-21,McGill,Israel,"Panelists emphasize solidarity between marginalized groups 
As part of the Montreal Israeli Apartheid Week event series, activists Kezia Curtis, a member of Black Lives Matter Detroit, and Brittany King, a member of the Dream Defenders, a social justice group, spoke at a panel discussion called “Black Perspectives on the Question of Palestine” held on March 17.
The panel was organized by the Black Students’ Network (BSN) and McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), and explored “transnational solidarity between the movements for justice for Black people in North America and movements for justice for Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Territories.”
“If [activists] are going to be successful in doing the work that we aim to do, then it is so important for us to engage in solidarity with other oppressed and marginalized groups.”
Curtis and King highlighted their experiences as activists working within the Black and Palestinian struggles, and emphasized the need to decolonize the mind in order for solidarity networks to thrive.
Ryan, one of the organizers of the event, told The Daily that he believes that “if [activists] are going to be successful in doing the work that we aim to do, then it is so important for us to engage in solidarity with other oppressed and marginalized groups.”
The panelists noted the historical parallels between the Palestinian and Black social justice movements, with both populations still facing state-sanctioned racism and violence.
Curtis spoke about her experiences as a Black woman travelling within Palestine. It was like “looking at Detroit in a different part of the world,” Curtis said with regards to her trip to Palestine. Curtis also spoke about how violence was experienced on a very real, day-to-day basis, particularly at the university she visited.
Curtis and King also spoke about other related issues faced by both Black people in the U.S. and Palestinians, such as gentrification, limited access to land and farming, and militarization of settler-colonial states.
Curtis further noted a crucial difference between the U.S. and Palestine which she witnessed on her trip – the outright and explicit violence, guns, weaponry, and tear gas constantly being used against Palestinians in Hebron, in contrast to the significantly less militarized nature of the violence in the U.S..
The panel also highlighted the importance of challenging anti-Black racism within solidarity movements.
“Part of […] solidarity includes critical self-reflection in order to avoid being complicit in the oppression of other groups, especially in the case of anti-Blackness.”
Ryan pointed out that “part of […] solidarity includes critical self-reflection in order to avoid being complicit in the oppression of other groups, especially in the case of anti-Blackness.”
King also stressed the need for self-reflection and critical thinking to challenge instances of global anti-Blackness. King argued that social media and mainstream media act as ways that uphold anti-Blackness. For example, King explained, the stigma that Black Muslims face in Muslim communities – a phenomenon perpetuated through social media – is evidence to this.
As a Black woman, she added, it is important for her to stand in solidarity with other oppressed people. “Anti-Blackness won’t stop unless we challenge ourselves,” King explained.
“Anti-Blackness won’t stop unless we challenge ourselves.”
In an interview with The Daily, a student who attended the panel noted, “I thought it was encouraging that [the panelists] were working on the ground in their own communities to educate people on anti-Blackness and how to decolonize a mindset that’s been so largely ingrained in society.”
King added that a critical understanding of how colonization affects all people should unite seemingly disparate justice movements. “For me, it’s just all about education,” she said. “If you see that my struggle and your struggle are the same […] that will make that solidarity more attainable.”
“If you see that my struggle and your struggle are the same […] that will make that solidarity more attainable.”
Michelle Blassou, a member of the BSN, told The Daily that the talk raised important parallels, and that “uniting around the idea that the colonial state will always be against both of us leaves a lot of work to do.”
A previous version of this article erroneously stated that Aja Monet also attended the panel. The Daily regrets the error.

2016-03-30,McGill,Israel,"Politicide of Palestine discussed as part of Israeli Apartheid Week
As part of this year’s Montreal Israeli Apartheid Week, Nahla Abdo, a Palestinian professor of sociology at Carleton University, spoke about the need for anti-colonial, anti-imperialist feminism at a talk titled “Imperialist Feminism and Arab Women’s Struggle: The Palestinian Case,” held on March 23 at Concordia University.
Abdo’s talk focused on the Western feminist rhetoric on Palestinian women’s struggle and the push-back to this discourse by Palestinian women. Abdo also discussed the importance of using oral history as a research method to highlight the struggle of Palestinian women who are political prisoners.
Abdo introduced the concept of “politicide” as important to understanding Palestinian women’s anti-colonial struggle. She explained that politicide is a form of genocide committed against Palestinians by the state of Israel through the erasing of Palestine as a political entity and through erasing Palestinian geography – for example, Israel’s renaming of many Palestinian towns and villages with Hebrew names.
“At the heart of the [struggle against] settler colonialism is the loss of land and struggle to regain the land,” Abdo said.
She linked the politicide of Palestine with the lack of criticism of Israel in the Western world. “Such politics have gone hand in hand with an Amero-European politics of a deafening silence toward Israel’s policies,” Abdo said. “We all have, as academics, in one way or another felt the pressure on our freedom of expression when it comes to [when we] critically think and publicly speak about the Israeli state.”
“At the heart of the [struggle against] settler colonialism is the loss of land and struggle to regain the land.”
Abdo also mentioned that a result of such a a lack of an anti-colonial analysis in discussing settler-colonial states like Israel and Canada leads to the conflation of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.
“You criticize Canada left and right, but you are not to touch Israel,” she said, referring to some activists’ propensity to speak out against Canada’s policies, but their silence on Israel’s occupation of Palestine.
More specific to the topic of women’s anti-colonial struggle, Abdo spoke about “orientalist feminism,” which she defined as the essentialization of Arab and Muslim women. Orientalist feminism, said Abdo, imagines Arab and Muslim women to be under patriarchal and cultural oppression. In addition to problematizing this type of feminism, Abdo also spoke about imperialist feminism. While orientalist feminism focuses on culture, Abdo argued, imperialist feminism is a result of a political ideology.
“Imperialist feminism is a 21st-century feminism developed in response to the so-called War on Terror. [It is] the linking of resistance to colonialism [to] acts of terror; everyone who resists colonialism becomes a terrorist,” Abdo said. “[Imperialist feminism] uses women’s bodies and sexuality for ideology, for racializing and dehumanizing Palestinian freedom fighters.”
Abdo concluded her talk by saying, “While the state can erase the physical marker [of Palestinian land], they can’t erase [the Palestinian] vision and memory. Memory of the land, the home, the olive and the cypress trees, of the hills and mountains from the collective conscience of Palestinians.”
“I sometimes find that Western interpretations of people’s experience can be a colonial one, whether intended or not.”
Amal, a Concordia student present at the talk, told The Daily in an email that she disagreed with Abdo’s point that one doesn’t have to have lived an experience or be from a community to write about it.
“Very often the voices of those concerned are drowned out by Western academics because they have more opportunities to publish and discuss their work,” said Amal. “Basically, there are enough academics and writers who can give a more complete representation and analysis of an experience, and I sometimes find that Western interpretations of people’s experience can be a colonial one, whether intended or not,” she continued.

2016-05-27,McGill,Israel,"Demonstrators express support for BDS movement 
On Saturday May 14, the Montreal-based human rights group Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU) organized a midnight demonstration to mark the 68th anniversary of the ‘Nakba’, which translates to “the catastrophe” in Arabic. The demonstration aimed to commemorate the expulsion and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland following the 1948 Palestine War and Israel’s subsequent Declaration of Independence.
According to PAJU’s Facebook event page for the demonstration, “Palestine has been subjected to a systemic ethnic cleansing operation at the hands of the Zionist movement for the past 68 years. In a blink of an eye, Palestine was wiped off the map.”
“The Zionist movement has announced the creation of the Israeli state on Palestinian territory through the destruction and expropriation of over 500 villages and towns and the expulsion of over 750,000 Palestinians to refugee camps all over the world,” the page continued.
“Israel’s military supremacy is the spearhead of its occupation of Palestine.”
Hala Yassin, a member of PAJU, addressed the crowd in French prior to the march, condemning the federal government’s turning a blind eye to Israeli military actions against Palestinians.
“Israel’s military supremacy is the spearhead of its occupation of Palestine,” said Yassin. “It allows Israel to act with impunity. The Israeli army is proud to collaborate with arms manufacturers that brag to clients about testing its products in the field [the Gaza Strip].”
“Can you believe that? Products tested on humans, on Palestinians!” she repeated.
Around 150 people gathered outside the Mont-Royal metro station for the demonstration. Notwithstanding a heavy police presence, the demonstrators chanted “Israel terroriste, Trudeau complice!” in French, (“Terrorist Israel, Trudeau an accomplice!” in English) as they marched from Rue Saint-Denis to Rue Sainte-Catherine and looped back through Boulevard Saint-Laurent.
“Can you believe that? Products tested on humans, on Palestinians!”
“We have to remember that this movement of Zionism, the State of Israel, was not created by the Jewish people that followed the traditions of their forefathers,” said Neturei Karta rabbi David Feldman to the crowd before the march. “These were people who attempted to transform Judaism from a religion into a nationalism.”
“As Jewish people who do practice our religion, we say that that the state of Israel does not represent world Jewry,” Feldman continued. “These people do not speak in the name of our people, they’re not supported by all Jewish people, and certainly the crimes that they are committing are not condoned by Jewish religion.”
The police initially blocked the march at the intersection of Rue Sherbrooke and Rue Saint-Denis, instructing the demonstrators follow their route west of Rue Sherbrooke. After a brief confrontation, the police succumbed and demonstrators continued marching down Saint-Denis, shouting “A nous la rue!”
“As Jewish people who do practice our religion, we say that that the state of Israel does not represent world Jewry.”
The demonstrators stopped in the middle of the intersection at St. Laurent and Mont Royal, blocking off the street to hear a spokesperson for Women of Diverse Origins, Dolores Chew, speak about the importance of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement.
“BDS is what we need to struggle for,” said Chew. “For our communities and all organizations and all our institutions in our church groups, in our political parties – we must push for BDS to be adopted.”
“Israel is really afraid; this is the only thing that is going to make a difference,” Chew continued. “Women of Diverse Origins stands in support of Palestinian women, and their families ask us to take a stand and struggle and not to give up.”
“Israel is really afraid; this is the only thing that is going to make a difference.”
Montreal municipal bylaw P6 (section 2.1), requires march organizers to disclose their route prior to their event. However, Anna, a demonstration organizer, told The Daily in a Facebook message that P6 is “political repression, plain and simple.”
“They want to scare, discourage, and punish people for protesting, so [we] refuse to acknowledge and give power to such a law,” Anna said.
She went on to discuss the connection between refusing to abide by such laws and protesting the Israeli occupation. “All of our adversity is connected to the same systems of oppression and repressive audacity of authority,” she explained.
“They want to scare, discourage, and punish people for protesting, so [we] refuse to acknowledge and give power to such a law.”
Members of the Young Communist League of Canada were also present at the demonstration. Speaking to The Daily, Adrien Welsh, a representative of the League, asserted “To us it is important to denounce [the occupation], first to show our solidarity with the Palestinian people, but also to show that we are active, that we are able to do things although we are geographically far away.”
“It is important to support the resistance through such actions like this demonstration and BDS, and to demand for at least the creation of a Palestinian state, at least within the borders of ’67,” Welsh added.

2016-10-03,McGill,Israel,"IJV will be first anti-Zionist Jewish group on campus since 2009
A McGill chapter of Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV) is launching this year, founded by two students, Anna and Sonja. IJV describes itself on its website as a “national human rights organization whose mandate is to promote a just resolution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine through the application of international law and respect for the human rights of all parties.”
In an email to The Daily, Anna explained that IJV McGill’s main goals are to “motivate critical Jewish students to gain awareness of the Israeli occupation and to bring this awareness to the broader campus community.” The group also aims to work with and support the McGill Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) and McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) movements through political campaigns and education.
The organization will further these goals through “speaker events, film screenings, and popular education on differences between Judaism and political Zionism,” Anna added.
McGill BDS expressed their support for IJV in an email to The Daily, saying that IJV’s message is “especially important in terms of increasing the visibility of anti-Zionist Jewish voices and alternative perspectives in the debate surrounding BDS.”
However, the pro-Palestine movement on campus may be hampered by the recent Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) justice board ruling concerning BDS.
In June, the justice board ruled that the BDS motion brought before SSMU’s Winter 2016 general assembly was unconstitutional, as it would require SSMU to adopt a platform against a specific country. This would allegedly violate SSMU’s equity policy.
When asked about the impact this ruling might have on IJV McGill, Anna cited the fact that the decision has not been ratified by SSMU, which makes it non-binding. She added the group will play a unique role at McGill as the first “anti-Zionist Jewish group” on campus since 2009. It will provide space for Jewish students to encounter a set of perspectives which are often marginalized in Jewish communities.
Anna explained that she believes IJV is important at McGill because “it remains a taboo for Jewish students to engage openly in pro-Palestinian solidarity work, [and] IJV seeks to challenge this. […] Many [non/anti-Zionist Jews in North America] find themselves unable to be open about their views with parents, communities or even their best friends.”
Anna hopes to “demystify,” in her words, the conflation between Jewishness and support for Israel. “IJV McGill will strive to celebrate diasporic Judaism and Jewish culture separately from Zionism.”
“It remains a taboo for Jewish students to engage openly in pro-Palestinian solidarity work, [and] IJV seeks to challenge this. […] Many [non/anti-Zionist Jews in North America] find themselves unable to be open about their views with parents, communities or even their best friends.”
This message is fully supported by the McGill-based Jewish political discussion podcast TREYF.
TREYF’s hosts, Sam Bick and David Zinman, advocate for the celebration of the rich Jewish culture that exists beyond Israel. They believe that many young Jewish people in North America are searching for a voice as they articulate their views on Zionism, and that McGill’s IJV chapter will provide them with a crucial space to discuss anti-colonial ideas.
A spokesperson for the Jewish student centre Chabad for McGill said that they were “glad that McGill affords students the opportunity to form clubs and have a voice,” especially if that view reflects the pluralism of a free society. The spokesperson declined to comment directly on IJV, since they were unfamiliar with the organization, but stated that Chabad had no issue with any student club, “as long as it respectfully follows [McGill’s] rules for clubs.”
A spokesperson for Israel on Campus echoed Chabad’s views on student diversity but voiced concerns over another club pushing for BDS. Israel on Campus feels BDS has “ostracized and led to the harassment of Jewish, Israeli, and pro-Israel students.”
“IJV McGill will strive to celebrate diasporic Judaism and Jewish culture separately from Zionism.”
Scott Weinstein, a member of IJV’s Montreal chapter, told The Daily in an email that “we are excited about working with the IJV chapter at McGill, which will serve an important role in educating McGill students about the realities on the ground in Israel-Palestine.”
“Jewish groups on campus have typically offered blind support for Israel’s behaviour,” he continued. “It will be refreshing to have a Jewish group on campus that promotes an honest and ethical discussion about what’s occurring in Israel-Palestine.”

2016-11-14,McGill,Israel,"Wide variety of views and ideologies expressed at Anonymous protest
On the evening of Saturday, November 5, roughly two hundred people gathered in Victoria Square for Montreal’s Million Mask March. Ostensibly organized by the decentralized global hacktivist group Anonymous, the annual march has taken place in cities around the world since 2013.
Its date coincides with Guy Fawkes Day, and protesters typically wear the stylized Guy Fawkes mask, which has become an emblem of Anonymous since the 2006 film V for Vendetta associated the mask with political protest in the public consciousness.
Gathered around a statue of Queen Victoria, the base of which had been covered in banners and placards for the occasion, those attending the protest chatted and chanted the occasional slogan. Half a dozen police officers watched from across a street, but did not intervene.
A wide array of political ideologies and causes were represented, with placards denouncing rape culture, the Dakota Access Pipeline, state surveillance, colonialism in Palestine, censorship, and capitalism, to name a few.
Many of the protestors who spoke to The Daily did not express affiliation with any specific political ideology, but rather expressed generalized frustration with aspects of society which they perceived as unjust or corrupt. Most protesters seemed to fall on the left of the political spectrum, though with varying degrees of radicalism and detailed analysis.
One demonstrator, however, declared support for the right-wing nationalist regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and expressed profoundly anti-Semitic views in a brief interview with The Daily.
A wide array of political ideologies and causes were represented, with placards denouncing rape culture, the Dakota Access Pipeline, state surveillance, colonialism in Palestine, censorship, and capitalism, to name a few.
This disparity of beliefs and political orientations is seemingly a function of Anonymous’s decentralized structure – the hacktivist collective has no hierarchy of leadership and no well-defined ideology, beyond a broad opposition to censorship.
Individuals identifying with the group have launched cyberattacks against a slew of targets, from the governments of the United States and Israel, to Daesh (also known as ISIS), to video game companies, to financial corporations like Visa and MasterCard, to Quebec nationalism, to the Westboro Baptist Church.
Speaking to The Daily, a protester who identified himself only as Francis addressed the drawbacks of such a broad and decentralized movement.
“Some groups, probably on the right, could try and get a piece of the cake,” he admitted in French. “Obviously everyone knows who those people are, everyone knows they’re not legitimate, and they’re not the real ones – if I can say that. The real ones are always for rights, […] but it’s true that there are right-wing groups that often do really serious things under the mask of Anonymous. And obviously people who are in the know understand that it’s not us, the comrades, who do that.”
When asked what issues Anonymous addresses that are the most important to him personally, Francis, replied “human rights, […] the media that lies to us, […] the police services of many cities – especially Montreal – but especially poverty, in my opinion.”
What could Anonymous do to effect change on these issues, as opposed to legal action through mainstream political channels? According to Francis, the value of their work lies largely in raising awareness among the general population.
“The real ones are always for rights, […] but it’s true that there are right-wing groups that often do really serious things under the mask of Anonymous. And obviously people who are in the know understand that it’s not us, the comrades, who do that.”
“Raising awareness, and if ever there’s no visibility, doing concrete actions […] but it’s mostly informing people,” he said. “For example, if there was an organisation known for causing poverty, […] Anonymous might attack their servers, and crash their site, which […] would make people aware of the subject.”
The message of the Million Mask March, he said, was to tell the world “we’re here, we’ll always be here, and we don’t forget.”
The crowd gathered in Square Victoria, in addition to its diversity of political opinions and causes, comprised a variety of ages, ethnicities, and genders.
Speaking to The Daily, Flavie and Charlotte said they were frustrated by the prevailing climate of conservatism at their private high school, and had decided to attend the march out of a strong sense that Canadian society is profoundly flawed, and that “it’s not by doing nothing that these things will change.”
After some brief speeches, the protesters watched a video tribute to the late Jean Leger, a local anti-pipeline activist who recently committed suicide. Following this, they took to the streets, chanting various slogans from the classic – “Whose streets? Our streets!” – to the eclectic – “Killuminati!” and “Fuck the New World Order!”
The protest wound through the streets of the financial district, the lower Plateau, and Old Port, stopping at sites deemed emblematic of state violence and corruption: the Palais de Justice, the United States consulate, and the headquarters of the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
“Whose streets? Our streets!” – to the eclectic – “Killuminati!” and “Fuck the New World Order!”
Police officers on bicycles remained just ahead of the crowd, with several police vehicles following it, but no substantive confrontation occurred between protesters and law enforcement. The event ended peacefully outside the Palais de Justice, with organizers urging people to meet on November 5, 2017, for the next Million Mask March.

2016-11-14,McGill,Israel,"Protesters take issue with resemblance of art installation to Apartheid Wall
On Wednesday, November 9, an Artists 4 Israel event on Lower Field of campus organized by Chabad McGill attracted protesters who denounced what they perceived to be the event’s insensitive concept and erasure of Palestinian voices.
In an event which has subsequently been removed from Facebook, members of the organization Artists 4 Israel erected a temporary wall on Lower Field, decorated it with Canadian and Israeli flags, and the word ‘peace’ in Hebrew and English, and invited passers-by to add their own graffiti to the installation.
They also displayed banners listing statements about Israel, and distributed free refreshments and t-shirts. Initially, Palestinian people, along with any Palestinian flags or symbols, were entirely absent from the event.
Soon however, the installation began to attract opposition. A small crowd of protesters gathered on Lower Field, carrying banners and placards which denounced Israel’s ongoing violence against Palestinian people, and appropriation of Palestinian land. The demonstrators spread out in a line, standing in front of the Artists 4 Israel installation.
Speaking to The Daily at the protest, George Ghabrial, a member of McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), explained what prompted him and other students to protest the event.
“Me and a couple friends were [at] the Y [intersection], we were all going to class, and we saw this structure […] and then we saw an Israeli flag. […] We went up to some of these student organizers, asked them what was going on, they said it was an event called ‘Artists 4 Israel,’” he explained.
“So SPHR […] said that we should do something – there’s no representation of Palestine, there’s no mention of Palestine, there’s no […] mention of the occupation,” he continued. “It’s an implicitly political event that does not make explicit the occupation of Palestine. […] So we went and got our banners […] and came down to Lower Field.”
“On the surface, it’s supposed to be apolitical,” Ghabrial explained. “I don’t know very much about Chabad as an organization, but I’d say that the event is very normalizing about the occupation. […] And there’s a very strong connotation about who the antagonizers to peace are.”
A member of Artists 4 Israel spoke with The Daily about the intended purpose of the event.
“Artists 4 Israel was brought here by Chabad, Stand With Us, Size Doesn’t Matter and AEπ and […] Hasbara Fellowships, in order to paint a mural about peace and coexistence, and try to bridge all the […] diverse cultures that are here together, and of course express their pride in their own Jewish heritage and sense of Israel with that larger culture of the campus.”
When asked about the response to the protest, he said: “Instead of their protest […] they’ve all been offered the opportunity to spray-paint with us and to have shirts made, the same way the entire student body has been allowed. That they chose to separate themselves and segregate themselves from an event that’s supposed to be about inclusiveness […] I think speaks for itself as to what their true intentions are. We would have loved them to be part of it.”
In a comment sent to The Daily by email, however, Julie, a member of Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions (BDS) McGill said that she had been present at the protest for more than an hour, and had never been invited to write on the installation.
The protesters partly took issue with the statements about Israel on display beside the art installation, which portrayed the nation as a place of tolerance and equality. One section, in particular, alleged that non-Jewish Israelis “enjoy equal rights and freedoms.” In fact, Israel has drawn criticism from minority voices internally, and from the international community for the systemic discrimination that many non-Jewish citizens face.
However, event organizer, Eva Chorna, objected to this characterization, saying, “To have that [statement] on the board I think is very representative of the essence that is Israel, because if there is one country that understands what it’s like to be a refugee, I think it’s Israel.”
“Israel isn’t a perfect society,” she continued, “as no society is, but there are so many instances where they try to be inclusive towards the Palestinians, towards the Israeli Arabs in society, towards all the different religions.”
However, protesters also took issue with the concept of the installation.
“The board itself resembles the Apartheid Wall that runs in the West Bank and restricts access to medical resources and water supplies of Palestinians that live there,” said Julie in her email to The Daily. “The idea of graffiti-ing the ‘canvas’ mocks and appropriates the forms of Palestinian resistance that appear on the Apartheid Wall.”
“Furthermore, the ‘graffiti’ displayed the word peace next to the Israeli flag alongside the Canadian flag as well as the McGill Martlet, which completely disregards the settler-colonial history tied to all three of these,” she continued.
She added that she “was asked to move multiple times.” She was also “asked to leave because they claimed this art (that resembled the Apartheid Wall with flags of Israel, Canada, and the McGill martlet) was not political.”

2016-11-14,McGill,Israel,"“Palestine and Feminist Paradigms” lecture critiques feminist canon 
On Thursday, November 10, approximately eighty people gathered in Morrice Hall 017 for a lecture by Rabab Abdulhadi, professor of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University (SFSU).
Adulhadi’s lecture, “Revising the Narrative, Critiquing the Canon: Palestine and Feminist Paradigms,” challenged the homogenization and dehumanization of Arab men and women in the women’s studies canon. Her lecture also contested feminist paradigms that subscribe to the colonial mission of “saving brown women from brown men” and fail to acknowledge the agency and voice of Palestinian women.
Abdulhadi began her talk by discussing instances when Palestinian women’s voices and agency were overlooked or misunderstood by women who have more power. For example, she spoke about a self-avowed feminist fashion house that staged a photo shoot for its summer catalogue in front of the Israeli-West Bank Separation wall in 2004, with the supposed aim of jarring the Israeli state with this image of suffering and despair. Abdulhadi shared a story wherein a chief executive of the company, an Israeli woman, is asked by Umm Muhammad, a Palestinian woman passing by, to join her at a sit-in and call for the wall to be torn down, instead of using the Palestinian’s suffering as a backdrop for her photoshoot. The Israeli woman disregards this invite and says of Umm Muhammad, “She’s too full of hurt, she cannot listen.”
Abdulhadi challenged the audience to question which of these women would be acknowledged as a feminist in the mainstream women studies canon – the “self-avowed feminist” or “the woman who invites those who colonized her land and her life to join her sit-in.”
“Sisterhood is neither powerful, nor global, if it is not on the basis of principled solidarity,” Abdulhadi said, emphasizing multiple times that what matters in any social justice movement is “the indivisibility of justice,” making issues of gender equality, queer rights, and the liberation of Palestine part of the same project.
Abdulhadi also spoke optimistically in her lecture about an increasing show of solidarity from Jewish communities for the Palestinian liberation movement. She explained that, historically, Zionism has always been “a contested narrative” in Jewish communities around the world.
“Sisterhood is neither powerful, nor global, if it is not on the basis of principled solidarity.”
“The Zionist settler-colonial project in Palestine, which claims to speak for the Jews, actually does not,” she said, “and increasingly today, more and more Jews are coming out and saying, ‘not in my name.’”
“I thought [Abdulhadi’s] recognition of anti-Zionist Jewish voices in her talk was really important,” said Anna Ty, a U3 Anthropology and Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies student who attended the lecture, in an interview with The Daily.
For Abdulhadi, critiquing hegemonic narratives is essential to academic work. In an interview with The Daily, she explained that activists in academia who are “speaking truth to power” are doing their job.
However, because of her scholarship and activism, Abdulhadi has been the target of fear tactics and attacks by Zionist groups, like Canary Mission and Campus Watch, for several years. Canary Mission and Campus Watch are websites that profile and personally target activists working for justice in Palestine.
“I thought [Abdulhadi’s] recognition of anti-Zionist Jewish voices in her talk was really important.”
Posters featuring cartoon portraits of Abdulhadi were posted around the SFSU campus earlier this year, targeting her with defamatory charges.
“They want to scare us out of business,” Abdulhadi told The Daily, describing the coordinated attacks of such groups as “cyberbullying” and “incitement of violence.”
“Justice for Palestine is not just a project for the Palestinians,” she told the audience. “Justice for Palestine is a project for everybody who seeks justice.”
A U3 Economics student in attendance, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily that this was what they found to be the most interesting part of the lecture. “The thing that stood out to me the most was her idea [of] how you can’t really separate the different issues within the anti-colonial struggle,” the student said.
“Justice for Palestine is a project for everybody who seeks justice.”
Abdulhadi concluded her lecture on this note as well, by explaining that Israel’s settler-colonial project implicates not just Israelis and Palestinians, but rather “every single person who lives anywhere in the world whose [government’s] policies are making it possible for Israel to continue oppressing Palestinians, to continue stealing land.”
“Everybody is invested in either being part of the problem, or in being part of the solution. And that goes for every struggle, not just for Palestine,” Abdulhadi concluded.

2016-11-21,McGill,Israel,"IJV McGill holds first event on the creation of a modern Jewish nation
Independent Jewish Voices (IJV)’s McGill chapter hosted their first lecture event on Monday, November 14. The club invited Yakov M. Rabkin, professor of history at l’Université de Montréal, to talk about his book “What is Modern Israel?” which was released earlier this year.
Rabkin began his talk by explaining the relationship between Zionism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Semitism. In his book, he traces the birth of Zionism, which emerged at the end of the 19th century as a reaction to several instances of anti-Jewish violence in Europe and the onset of writings by German intellectuals such as Theodor Herzl.
He discussed the exile and massive migration of Jews from Central and Eastern Europe due to religious and political discrimination that led to a forced settlement in Palestine.
“There is a very important transition that happened with the concept of anti-Semitism,” explained Rabkin. “A hundred years ago, if you thought Jews belonged to a different state, you were an anti-Semite, but now if you deny it, then you are an anti-Semite.”
He said he believes it is important to distinguish between racial and religious anti-Semitism in order to better understand the frameworks in which Israeli sentiment function.
“Religious anti-Semitism offers a way out by means of conversion,” he explained, “however, racial anti-Semitism offers no escape as such.”
This distinction ultimately postulates the existence of a Jewish race and a nation-state propagated within a colonial setting , according to Rabkin.
In his book, Rabkin also discusses the role of Soviet Jews in constituting the Jewish nationality.
“The Soviet Jews [when they settled in Palestine] took with them not only Russian songs and Russian culture, but they took with them the concept that the world hates us,” he said.
He went on to shed light on the influence of Jerusalem-based think tanks that have been working for several decades to make Israel central to Jewish identity.
“This agenda has succeeded for a large majority of secular Jews through programs like birthright,” he said. “Israel has become a residual identity for Jews even if they have never been to Israel or don’t speak a word of Hebrew.”
He concluded his talk by analyzing why organizations like IJV disturb Zionist voices.
“People who equate Zionism to Judaism become very sensitive to criticism since religion is supposed to be private,” Rabkin explained. “The concept of anti-Semitism has become a tool by which any sort of Zionist criticism is silenced, but criticism of Israel does not necessarily have to be anti-Semitic.”
The talk was followed by a question and answer period where several students, professors, and members of the Montreal community shared their experiences of going to Jewish day school, practicing Judaism, and what Zionism means in the context of Judaism as a religion.
In an interview with The Daily, the AUS Equity Commissioner who attended the event, spoke about the importance of solidarity with pro-Palestine Jewish voices on campus.
“I came here because solidarity is important to me, and I know that there are wonderful, wonderful Jewish people on campus that are pro-Palestine,” he said. “So I’m just here to show my support and solidarity and because IJV is new to McGill, so I want to be part of that.”
A co-founder of IJV McGill, Anna, spoke to The Daily about her hope of establishing a community of diverse Jewish voices on campus through their group.
“Events like this […] speak to Jewish voices that otherwise don’t have a place to go or to feel like their story is being validated,” she said. “There is clearly an empty seat in the Jewish auditorium that is now being filled.”

2017-01-23,McGill,Israel,"Documentary screening and panel highlights Indigenous empowerment
In 2007, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (FNCFCS) and the Assembly of First Nations began a historic legal battle against the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada, arguing that the welfare services available to Indigenous children on reserves were vastly – indeed, dangerously – inferior to those offered to other Canadian children.
After nine grueling years, during which the federal government attempted to delay and obstruct the complainants, the latter won their case. In her film “We Can’t Make the Same Mistake Twice,” Alanis Obomsawin documents the case in detail, bearing witness to the tireless work of the children’s rights advocates involved.
On Thursday January 18, the documentary was screened at Cinema du Parc for the McGill community. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of the FNCFCS and a professor in McGill’s School of Social Work, was in attendance, along with Obomsawin.
Blackstock is a central figure in “We Can’t Make the Same Mistake Twice.” In her role at FNCFCS, she was heavily involved in bringing the initial discrimination complaint, and gave extensive testimony throughout the case.
Blackstock opened Thursday’s screening with an indictment of the apathy and systemic racism that has devastated the lives of many Indigenous children on Canadian reserves. In particular, she mentioned the case of two twelve-year-old girls from the Wapekeka First Nation in Ontario, who committed suicide earlier this month.
“Throughout history, Canada has always known about the inequalities, known about the harms, and relied on the public to stop watching and not demand change,” said Blackstock. “My one request of you is that you don’t look away.”
Obomsawin also spoke, thanking the attendees for their presence.
“You’re about to see a very important story,” she said, “one that is, of course, very dear to me and to thousands of people.”
Obomsawin told the audience that in the course of her career as a documentary filmmaker on Indigenous issues, she had been present in many courtrooms, watching many Indigenous people receiving discriminatory treatment at the hands of the Canadian justice system. After a lifetime spent witnessing and being subjected to racial and colonial oppression, this case had brought her hope.
“The feeling in the courtrooms was so horrifying,” she said, “mainly because of the disrespect. And when I say disrespect, I mean everybody, including the judges and the lawyers. […] The feeling was, ‘we know all about you, you’re guilty, shut up, go to jail.’ And what I want to say, when I sat in the courtroom this time, at the tribunal of human rights, I watched the 72 witnesses that came to speak, and I saw our people be respected.”
The documentary itself follows the nine-year legal battle in great detail, showing extensive courtroom footage, supplemented by interviews with those participating in the case. The audience at Cinema du Parc seemed engrossed, with many gasping audibly during particularly harrowing portions of the film.
After the screening, a panel discussion was held. The panel featured four McGill students and was moderated by Allan Downey, a McGill professor specializing in Indigenous history.
One of the panelists, Amal Elsana Alh’jooj, a PhD candidate in McGill’s School of Social Work, noted the parallels between the systemic discrimination documented in Obomsawin’s film and the discrimination faced by Palestinians like herself, living in territory controlled by Israel.
“Canada has a reputation as a place where human rights are protected,” said Alh’jooj, “and we look at Canada as really an idol for these kinds of things.”
“So all of a sudden to come here,” she continued, “and discover that in the backyard of Canada, there is this catastrophe of many, many years, it’s kind of really shocking. And I think the role of social workers, community organizing, and all of us here is how to bring this case to the forefront – in the front yard of Canada, and to […] be brave enough to put these things on the table.”
“As someone who came from an Indigenous community in the south part of Israel, living many years in situations of discrimination, house demolition, evacuating in the name of the law, and advocating for my own people’s human rights, what this [film] is telling us is that all systems are very similar.”
Israeli officials, said Alh’jooj, routinely make the same arguments that the Canadian government used to attack and delegitimize Blackstock and her fellow activists. For this reason, the documentary resonated deeply with her.
Another panelist, Carlee Loft, a Kanien’keha:ka student majoring in psychology at McGill, spoke “not as someone who has gone through child welfare myself, but who has cared very deeply about someone who has, and who has seen them struggle, trying to connect back to their community, trying to find ties to their family.”
“What’s even harder is watching them struggle against this label that’s given to them, of a ‘problem child’ […] and this troubled Indigenous youth,” continued Loft. “This isn’t the same generation that went through residential schools, but they’re going through something very similar.”
Christian Quequish, a Saulteaux student currently serving as the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Indigenous Affairs Commissioner, spoke about the challenges of effective allyship and the pitfalls of reconciliation.
“I guess what really struck me [about the film] was non-Indigenous children […] supporting Indigenous children,” he began. “It’s incredibly symbolic – it’s not something that I grew up with, but it’s good to see that that’s a trend that’s happening. […] I think for us older folks there needs to be a recognition that the relationships between Indigenous peoples has been historically imbalanced, and that discriminatory policies sustain this imbalance.”
“The way allies approach Indigenous peoples’ issues sometimes reinforces that balance to the point where it’s more about feeling good about themselves than actual empowerment of Indigenous people,” he continued. “So in approaching better relations between the two groups, it seems as if it’s time to start privileging Indigenous voices. […] Empowerment should come first, and symbolic acts should follow.”
A previous version of this article omitted to include Christian Quequish’s preferred Indigenous identifier (Saulteaux). The Daily regrets the error.

2017-02-11,McGill,Israel,"Internal regulations motion tabled until next Council session
On Thursday February 9, the Legislative Council of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) convened for an exceptionally long and confrontational meeting, with Council lasting over six hours and ending at one a.m.
During the first two hours of Council, people speaking during Question Period primarily voiced concerns over a tweet by Arts Representative and former Daily editor Igor Sadikov, which has drawn intense criticism for its alleged incitement to violence.
Furthermore, a motion to amend SSMU’s internal regulations was debated extensively and then postponed until the next Council meeting, on February 23. Council also discussed six notices of motion and three other motions.
The day before the Council meeting, on Wednesday February 8, a recent tweet reading “punch a Zionist today” had surfaced online.
The tweet, which was posted to Sadikov’s personal account after working hours on February 6, was a reference to the recent “punch a Nazi” memes which circulated online following the viral video of white supremacist Richard Spencer being punched in the face at the inauguration of United States President Donald Trump.
The tweet in question has since been deleted, but not before screenshots of it had been widely shared within the McGill community and beyond.
The day before the Council meeting, on Wednesday February 8, a recent tweet reading “punch a Zionist today” had surfaced online.
Over the course of the following day, Thursday February 9, an intense storm of criticism developed around Sadikov and his tweet, with many at McGill and in the wider world portraying it as an incitement to anti-Semitic violence.
This interpretation rests on the conflation of Zionism with Jewishness which, while widely believed, is in fact a misconception; many Jewish people do not identify with the settler-colonial ideology of Zionism or the goals and actions of the state of Israel.
Moreover, it should be noted that Sadikov himself is Jewish, a fact which has been ignored by many media outlets and in the discussion surrounding this controversy.
On Thursday morning, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), of which Sadikov is a council member as one of the Arts Representatives to SSMU, published a statement on their Facebook page condemning the tweet and asking for his resignation.
Over the course of the following day, Thursday February 9, an intense storm of criticism developed around Sadikov and his tweet, with many at McGill and in the wider world portraying it as an incitement to anti-Semitic violence.
Meanwhile, Christopher Manfredi, McGill’s Provost and Vice-Principal Academic, issued a public statement calling the tweet “disturbing,” stating that disciplinary action was underway on the grounds that the tweet violated McGill policy, despite being sent from a personal account after working hours.
Sadikov has been harshly criticized within certain segments of the McGill community, and in a variety of local, national, and international media outlets. Nonetheless, a movement in support of him has also developed.
A number of student groups and individuals in the university community expressed public support for Sadikov, using the hashtag #BiasedMcGill to call attention to what they perceived as a disproportionate and unjust response to his tweet.
On Thursday morning, the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), of which Sadikov is a council member as one of the Arts Representatives to SSMU, published a statement on their Facebook page condemning the tweet and asking for his resignation.
It was in this incendiary context that SSMU Council met on Thursday evening. While such meetings are generally only attended by the councillors themselves and a few members of the student press, this one had attracted a crowd of roughly 50 students.
Some came with the intention of confronting Sadikov for perceived incitement to violence, while others wished to stand in solidarity with him and call attention to what they saw as political bias underlying the attacks against him.
After a number of lengthy presentations which were previously scheduled for that Council meeting, a question period began during which members of the gallery could air their concerns, and have them addressed by members of Council.
Arts student David Naftalin opened the session by telling those assembled that he personally felt frightened by Sadikov’s tweet, and didn’t see “how a member of this board has a right to be here based on the SSMU constitution, which prides itself on inclusivity and diversity.”
In response to this, engineering student Laura Khoury said that as a Palestinian, she felt unsafe due to the presence of Zionists on Council.
“Since SSMU has a social justice mandate,” asked Khoury, “why does it allow Zionist councilors on Council, when Zionist ideology is inherently [linked to] ethnically cleansing Palestinians?”
“Your question I think is really inappropriate,” replied Social Work Representative Jasmine Segal, “because freedom of speech [means that] people are allowed to believe what they want.”
Segal publicly identified herself as a Zionist, and characterized Sadikov’s tweet as a “hate crime.” When this statement elicited criticism from some in the gallery, she stated that she had consulted thoroughly with her constituents before the meeting, and was using vocabulary which they had endorsed.
“Since SSMU has a social justice mandate,” asked Khoury, “why does it allow Zionist councilors on Council, when Zionist ideology is inherently [linked to] ethnically cleansing Palestinians?”
Much of the question period involved heated debate over how exactly to define Zionism, and over who had experienced violence.
Iris Madeleine asked Council what would be done “to guarantee Igor’s safety after this hateful campaign against him.”
AUS President Becky Goldberg, who was present in the gallery, replied to Madeleine, making it clear that she was speaking as an individual, not as the voice of her Society.
“Your question I think is really inappropriate,” replied Social Work Representative Jasmine Segal, “because freedom of speech [means that] people are allowed to believe what they want.”
“It seems to be a little bit of […] a political witch-hunt,” said Goldberg, “and I have tried to ensure Igor’s safety just in providing my personal support […] but we have been contemplating formulating a statement that does not condone the use of […] defamation or […] the promotion of harm in response to something that people perceived as harm.”
Indeed, on the following day, AUS published a second statement on its Facebook page, condemning the violence enacted or threatened against Sadikov in recent days.
“It seems to be a little bit of […] a political witch-hunt.”
“I am grateful for President Goldberg’s support provided on a personal level,” responded Sadikov at Council. “That said, I’m in agreement with [Madeleine] about the need for institutional support. Over the past 24 hours I have received hundreds of insults and threats on social media, my personal information has been posted online, it has been reported to various institutions and authorities. I cannot say that […] I feel safe.”
Following the question period, Council discussed a motion to reform SSMU’s internal regulations which had been moved by Sadikov in collaboration with SSMU VP University Affairs Erin Sobat. In essence, the motion aimed to improve accountability at the level of the SSMU Board of Directors (BoD).
Last year, a series of reforms were passed which significantly increased the BoD’s power, in an effort to allow Council to function more efficiently. In doing so, however, reforms failed to put in place adequate checks and balances; as a result, the BoD, an unelected body, currently has the unchecked ability to make substantive decisions independently of Council in certain cases.
The motion brought to Thursday’s Council meeting aimed to address this problem by obliging the Chair of the BoD to present a full report at every meeting of Council.
The motion also made a slight adjustment to the regulations surrounding the ratification of opinions from SSMU’s Judicial Board (J-Board). Currently, every time the J-Board issues an opinion, it is presented to the BoD to be either ratified, returned for further consideration by the J-Board, or overturned. In order to overturn an opinion, a four-fifths majority of BoD members is required; this threshold can be difficult to reach in certain cases, resulting in institutional paralysis.
The motion brought to Thursday’s Council meeting aimed to address this problem by obliging the Chair of the BoD to present a full report at every meeting of Council.
As Sadikov put it, “At the BoD, we had this situation where the Board was not able to ratify [a certain] opinion, nor overturn it. So this opinion is basically not in effect because it hasn’t been ratified, nor overturned, so it remains in this procedural gray area or limbo.”
In order to address this issue, the motion proposed by Sadikov and Sobat only required a simple majority of BoD members to overturn an opinion from the J-Board. However, this small procedural change sparked a heated controversy. Many students had expressed firm opposition to the motion in the days leading up to Council, contending that this change was motivated by a desire to thwart J-Board favourable opinions towards Zionism.
Some of those who spoke against the motion during Thursday’s Council meeting referenced the judicial opinion issued in May 2016 which ruled that a General Assembly motion in support of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions (BDS) campaign had violated SSMU policy. This controversial J-Board opinion was never ratified by the BoD; nor was it overturned.
In addition to allegations that Sobat and Sadikov’s motion was politically motivated by anti-Zionist intentions, some of those who spoke against the motion at Council appeared to be under the erroneous impression that the BoD does not currently have the power to overturn J-Board opinions at all. Notably, VP Operations Sacha Magder argued repeatedly and at length that, as he put it, “as you allow J-Board decisions to be overturned, you remove its separation from some of the political levels of governance.”
“At the BoD, we had this situation where the Board was not able to ratify [a certain] opinion, nor overturn it. So this opinion is basically not in effect because it hasn’t been ratified, nor overturned, so it remains in this procedural gray area or limbo.”
Magder’s confusion about the precise nature of both the motion at hand and SSMU’s own governance structures was emblematic of the protracted debate which followed. Ultimately, Environment Representative Tuviere Okome expressed the opinion that “this motion was badly explained,” despite the fact that both Sobat and Sadikov had explained it at great length beforehand, and that notice had been given at Council two weeks previously, as required by SSMU bylaws.
Close to midnight, after more than two hours of debate on the motion, Council voted to postpone the discussion until the next meeting, on February 23.
The motion regarding the endorsement of the McGill communities’ council letter to the Board of Governors was tabled until the next meeting, as well.
Ultimately, Environment Representative Tuviere Okome expressed the opinion that “this motion was badly explained,” despite the fact that both Sobat and Sadikov had explained it at great length beforehand, and that notice had been given at Council two weeks previously, as required by SSMU bylaws.
The motion regarding the amendment of the SSMU electoral timeline and the motion for SSMU to advocate for an immediate suspension of the Canadian-U.S. safe third country agreement passed.
At the time of publication, the SSMU executive team had yet to release a statement regarding Sadikov’s tweet or the events of the Council meeting.

2017-03-13,McGill,Israel,"The VP University Affairs plays a pivotal role in student advocacy, sitting on Senate and representing SSMU and its constituents to the McGill administration. This coming year will see some responsibilities removed from the University Affairs portfolio, such as mental health and student services, leaving the VP University Affairs to oversee the SSMU Library Improvement Fund, work with student senators on advocacy projects, oversee student research initiatives, and implement equity initiatives.

Alexander Dow is currently an engineering senator on SSMU Council. Before that he served as the Budget Director for the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), Blues Pub Manager, Student Space Fund Commissioner, VP Public Relations for EUS Junior Council, and VP Comms and Sports for MORE housing. He told The Daily that in his time at McGill he has been consistently “working with students or working with admin.” He has “seen a lot of students hurt” and “screwed over” by admin. He says his main goal is to help students deal with the bureaucracy of the university. He values teamwork and expresses a commitment to helping students on an individual basis. He has the trust and support of the EUS and hopes to bring some of their concerns to the SSMU Council.
He stressed that if elected he is not committed to introducing any new policy. Instead he wants to “cement what already exists” and lift up side projects that have fallen by the wayside. In particular, he supports the movement to create an Indigenous studies major, as well as institute a fall reading week. He is currently working to sway the opinion of the Engineering faculty on this issue. He has limited experience with equity and mental health and would take a back seat on issues of that nature if elected, emphasizing that he would use his privilege to advance the agendas of marginalized communities on campus.
Dow likes the apolitical nature of EUS, however, he understands the need for SSMU to be more vocal on political issues. He “draws the line in taking political stances when [SSMU] starts excluding other student groups.” Dow says that while he “grieves for Palestine […] you can’t just openly target an entire community on campus, namely the Jewish and Israeli communities.” However, Dow says that he is good at working with others despite political differences. With regard to David Aird, Dow found out about his resignation five days beforehand. He thinks that the same is true for the other SSMU Execs and does not condone the negative feedback they have received in the past couple of weeks. He aims to work with campus groups such as SACOMSS to create and adopt a sexual assault policy within SSMU, but was unclear on what the specifics of this policy would be.

Oke has held multiple roles in the Black Students’ Network (BSN) over the years, serving not only as the President of the Network, but also as an External and Political Coordinator. Working as part of the Network displays a commitment to organizing and advocacy that VP UAs should have, she says.
Currently, Oke works as VP Floor Fellows of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE). She was part of the AMUSE bargaining team which negotiated with the administration to give Floor Fellows salaries, and cites the experience as an example of her adamantly advocating for student’s rights when dealing with the administration.
Additionally, as part of the proposed MUNACA-AMUSE merger, Oke was involved in writing new bylaws for the proposal, demonstrating experience in policy development, and cites her training as a Floor Fellow as being conducive to working in University Affairs, having received more than seventy hours of training as a result, learning active listening, equitable community building, and first response to crises.
Her overall platform prioritizes accountability and campus outreach, especially in a time where SSMU feels incredibly disjointed from the student body. Oke wants to create specific student positions to perform outreach initiatives to campus groups that are not formally part of the Society, saying that “in her experience, active in-person outreach is an effective way of keeping in touch with realities on campus.”
In regards to the Library Improvement Fund, Oke wants to foster healthier spaces in McGill’s libraries, adding visual and nonvisual guides in the libraries to remind students that while studying is important, “there are small actions students can take to mitigate the negative effects of many studying practices.” Oke also wants to install “happy lights” to combat Seasonal Affective disorder (SAD) during midterms and finals.
Oke plans to build on the current VP UA’s “Know your Rights” campaign, which she feels doesn’t give students the option to ask for more “tailored or relevant information.” Oke also feels that SSMU should be doing more to make student services more accessible, and intends to meet demands to improve said services by working with first years’ like in a focus group, letting them discover McGill services and subsequently SSMU officers learning about their experiences and how they can be improved upon.
Oke’s work with AMUSE, as well as her experience as a Floor Fellow and as part of the BSN make her a prime candidate for this position. The VP University Affairs portfolio requires direct relations with the administration, which Oke also has experience in bargaining on behalf of AMUSE at the level of the administration. Her initiative to reach out to more student groups in a more organized fashion would be a welcome adjustment considering many student groups feel currently alienated from the SSMU.
While Dow has a background in student politics with his work in EUS, his limited experience with equity would be a considerable disadvantage in a position which requires heavy knowledge and experience of both these issues. His stance on political issues is also disheartening, given that the VP University Affairs is the only executive other than the President who would advocate for students regarding political issues at the University level.

2017-03-20,McGill,Israel,"Shedding light on a rarely-discussed part of the BDS movement
On Tuesday, March 14, a group of around twenty students and community members attended a panel arguing in favour of an academic boycott of Israeli universities. Following the panel, participants held small discussion groups to present their own strategies for implementing such a boycott.
Held in McGill Arts Building as part of Israeli Apartheid Week, the event featured Michelle Hartman, a professor at McGill’s Institute of Islamic Studies; Ralph Haddad, a member of McGill BDS Action and an editor at The Daily; and a representative of the Anthropology Graduate Student Association (AGSA) of McGill, who wished to remain anonymous.
On an international level, the movement for an academic boycott is spearheaded by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). PACBI, in turn, is part of the larger Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. The aim of BDS is to pressure institutions and governments into complying with international law by upholding Palestinians’ right to self-determination.
According to PACBI’s website, “Israeli universities have played a key role in planning, implementing and justifying Israel’s occupation and apartheid policies, while maintaining a uniquely close relationship with the Israeli military.” The organization also holds that the majority of Israeli academics have, directly or as a result of their silence, contributed to maintaining Israeli oppression of Palestinians.
“Israeli universities have played a key role in planning, implementing and justifying Israel’s occupation and apartheid policies, while maintaining a uniquely close relationship with the Israeli military.”
“People think that the academic boycott is against freedom of speech and expression,” said Haddad, in an interview with The Daily, “but we need to rethink these rights as universal and start thinking about them as rights that some people have and some don’t.”
Haddad added that Palestinians do not have the same access to education as Israelis do.
“For example,” he said, “Israel has repeatedly closed schools and universities throughout the West Bank as part of its military regime of the area. In one famous documented case, Israeli soldiers are seen throwing tear gas at a group of children on their way to school.”
Academic boycott of Israel, according to PACBI, includes measures such as refraining from participation in academic collaboration with Israeli institutions, and withholding funding from such collaborative initiatives. Instead, PACBI calls on the international community to support Palestinian academic institutions, and to pass motions in support of BDS at universities around the world.
At McGill, the only direct Exchange Programs in the Middle East are with Israeli universities. Students wishing to study at universities elsewhere in the region do not benefit from the same institutional support as Exchange students do, and must arrange their own Independent Study Away singlehandedly.
“People think that the academic boycott is against freedom of speech and expression, but we need to rethink these rights as universal and start thinking about them as rights that some people have and some don’t.”
“Many of these universities are built directly above a razed Palestinian village,” Haddad continued. “The Technion Institute of Technology manufactures weapons for the Israeli occupation forces, which are fieldtested on Palestinians in Gaza. McGill students actively participate in this research by going on Exchange to the Technion, oftentimes given special awards by McGill in order to make it easier for them to travel and study there.”
The AGSA representative discussed the successful passing of a BDS motion within AGSA last January, and shared insight with those present.
Then, once the issue at hand had been contextualised by the panelists, the attendees broke up into small groups to strategize and troubleshoot possible obstacles to an academic boycott campaign.
According to the participants, one of the issues faced by Palestinian solidarity activists is the unwillingness of other like-minded individuals to show their support for fear of harassment. Many people keep their support of the cause private, as it can lead to being profiled and targeted.
Another difficulty identified by the participants concerned community outreach. While interested in fostering open and constructive conversation, participants said they often it difficult to present themselves as approachable to those opposing BDS. As one student attending the panel told the room, “if we really want to counter the anti-BDS campaigns, we should go to their events, sit, listen to their arguments […], and then counter them during the Q&A.”
In an email to The Daily, written in French, organizer Abir Haddade explained the rationale behind the panel and discussion:
“The goal was […] to offer more space for the [BDS] movement,” she said, “and particularly to the academic boycott, which is still not discussed very much as compared to other forms of boycott.”
“I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of the event,” Haddade continued. “Several innovative ideas were raised, actually. Michelle [Hartman] emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between the different universities in Montreal. Montreal is a student city par excellence and knowing that the BDS movement has been particularly successful on university campuses, it’s a shame for each of us to work on our own.”
“The goal was […] to offer more space for the [BDS] movement, and particularly to the academic boycott, which is still not discussed very much as compared to other forms of boycott.”
One of the breakout groups, she added, had also suggested organizing wine-and-cheese events from time to time.
“We disagree? Our ideologies are in opposition? That’s OK, let’s discuss it over drinks. It’s as simple as that,” Haddade said.
“I think that this meeting allowed us to get a valuable sense of the challenges and obstacles we face,” she finished, “but also to engage with approaches which will allow us to overcome them. Discussing with students from neighboring universities (Concordia and UQAM) was very promising with regard to future collaborations. […] Linking McGill to the rest of student life in Montreal will only strengthen our local BDS network.”

2017-04-16,McGill,Israel,"#BringBissanHome campaign calls on Canadian government to secure exit visa for Bissan Eid
Bissan Eid, a 24 year old Concordia graduate student, has been prevented from leaving the Palestinian territory of Gaza for four months. Her family launched #BringBissanHome, a campaign appealing to the Canadian government to intervene on behalf of Bissan, a Canadian citizen since 2005.
On Thursday April 13, Bissan’s father, Hadi Eid, held a press conference alongside two supporters: Norma Rantisi, a Geography professor at Concordia, and Rami Yahia, the Internal Affairs Coordinator of Concordia Students’ Union (CSU). “We’re asking the Canadian government to help us, to let Bissan come back to Canada as soon as possible,” said Hadi Eid.
Bissan travelled to Gaza in June 2016 to visit her grandparents and get married. She is now eight months pregnant and due to give birth in the first week of May. According to a press release, when Bissan tried to travel back to Canada, she was prevented from leaving due to the slow processing of her exit visa by Israeli authorities, “who seldom prioritize the applications of Palestinians from Gaza who hold other passports.”
“She needs [medical] support because her doctor told her that she has a difficult pregnancy. It’s better that she gives birth in Canada,” said Hadi Eid. In 2009, according to data from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the infant mortality rate in the Gaza Strip was 21.5 per 1000 live births – compared to 4.9 per 1000 live births in Quebec in 2013.
“We’re asking the Canadian government to help us, to let Bissan come back to Canada as soon as possible.”
“In December, Bissan contacted the Canadian embassy at Tel Aviv, and she told them about her situation, and they told her, ‘We can’t help you,'” explained Eid. Eid has also contacted his Member of Parliament, Pierre Nantel of the New Democratic Party with Bissan’s medical reports, to no avail.
Entry to occupied Palestinian territories is controlled by Israeli authorities. Travellers must apply for entry and exit, and even if approved, Israeli authorities can turn them away with no explanation. Since 2007 there has been a land, air, and sea blockade that restricts medical supplies, construction material, and certain food items from entering and leaving the Gaza strip. 1.8 million Palestinians are currently being held captive in the Gaza strip, unable to move freely within the rest of the territory.
“The movement of people into and out of the Gaza strip is highly restricted,” explained Rantisi. “Residents are largely cut off from the outside world and from access to some of the most essential services like healthcare and education. At the same time, Gaza has been subject to recurrent bombings – and this includes bombings that have occurred since the time that Bissan had arrived there.”
“This is an ordeal that no Canadian – or Palestinian – should have to endure,” continued Rantisi. “And yet, after trying again and again to leave for the past four months, she’s been denied an exit permit.”
“This includes bombings that have occurred since the time that Bissan had arrived there.”
The CSU and the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) are also calling on Concordia to support Bissan, by pressuring the Canadian government to intervene. Concordia has a responsibility to “a member of its own community – a member whose freedom of movement and even physical health is being compromised because of their Palestinian nationality,” said Rantisi.
In December 2014, Concordia’s undergraduate students voted to approve the CSU’s support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel. “After the massacre in Gaza [Operation Protective Edge], the CSU was given the mandate by the students through Council to hold a position against illegal settlement and disproportionate use of force, as well as the blockade on Gaza,” explained Yahia.
“This is an ordeal that no Canadian – or Palestinian – should have to endure.”
Though the Canadian government says that “Canadian consular officials have very limited ability to intervene on behalf of Canadians who choose to enter or remain in the Gaza Strip,” there is precedent for government intervention for Canadian citizens in Gaza. In August 2014, Canadian officials escorted 8-year-old Salma Abuzaiter out of Gaza, after she became trapped in Gaza city when Israel launched Operation Protective Edge.
“The Canadian government can make an appeal to the Canadian embassy in Tel Aviv, the foreign affairs department, and resolve the situation,” said Stefan Christoff, a community organizer who has been helping the Eid family with their campaign. “It’s been done before, and it can be done now.”

2017-09-02,McGill,Israel,"The NDP leadership race, flooding in South Asia, and Indigenous resistance from Peru to Palestine
The New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) is holding its leadership elections between October 1-15, 2017. The party is selecting a leader to replace Tom Mulcair, and challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party and Andrew Scheer of the Conservative Party. Over the summer, the race has narrowed down to four candidates: Niki Ashton, Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Churchill, Manitoba; Charlie Angus, MPP for Timmins, Ontario; Guy Caron, MPP for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques, Quebec; and Jagmeet Singh, MPP for Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Ontario.
The race has largely focused on how to win back the support that was won in the 2011 federal election, and subsequently lost to the Liberals in 2015. A huge portion of that loss was suffered in Quebec, where Tom Mulcair’s opposition to Liberal Bill 62 was perceived negatively. Bill 62 is a bill put forward by the Provincial Liberals of Quebec to ban the wearing of face coverings by governmental employees in the province. The bill has been widely described as Islamophobic, as it would target Muslim women who wear the burqa or the niqab.
As the race moves into Quebec the only Quebecois candidate, Caron, has announced his support of the bill. Ashton initially suggested that she too supports it, later tempering her statement after receiving substantial criticism from her base. Angus, meanwhile, has stated that the matter must go to the courts, and that the government cannot infringe upon religious freedoms. Singh, who is Sikh and wears a turban, has not yet commented on the issue.
Polls in Quebec show a massive loss of interest in the NDP, with 68 per cent of the population describing themselves as “not interested” in a poll conducted by Léger. However, debates over religious freedoms are often explosive in Quebec, and the candidate who impresses the most in the province could generate considerable support for the party nationally.

On August 23 in Jubbet al-Dhib, a village in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian children ready to attend their first day of school were shocked to find the building demolished. The six-classroom school had been razed to the ground by Israeli military forces the night before, leaving volunteers and teachers scrambling to construct makeshift classrooms for the 64 students. A temporary tent to accommodate the children was pitched to replace the caravan school, which was donated by European Union humanitarian organizations.
In defiance of the destruction, students peacefully protested by singing the national anthem before returning home with new school backpacks.
The building and all school materials had been confiscated and/or demolished by Israeli forces on the grounds that no permit had been issued for the construction of the school. Reports claim local residents threw rocks at the soldiers in protest, while the soldiers used tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets to clear the area.
The school itself had been a step forward for Palestinian children in Jubbet al-Dhib in terms of gaining easier access to education. Jubbet al-Dhib is located in Area C of the West Bank, and is under the complete control of Israeli forces, which makes obtaining a permit for opening a Palestinian school almost impossible. The next closest Palestinian school to the village in question is an hour’s walk away over dangerous mountain terrain.
This incident is not an anomaly, but rather one demolition among 92 others this year alone conducted by Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank, despite widespread international condemnation.

Indigenous leaders in Peru have issued an official statement condemning the government for not adhering to laws regarding issues that affect the Indigenous population. Peru’s government is currently negotiating with Frontera Energy, an oil-based Canadian energy firm, on renewing a 30-year contract.
The leaders, who represent more than 100 Indigenous communities, referenced a law passed in 2011 that requires the government to consult these communities before implementing decisions that might impact their territories. However, Ángela Acevedo, the Director of Indigenous Peoples Rights at Peru’s Vice Ministry of Intercultural Affairs argues that while the law is in effect, the state still “takes the final decision.”
The Indigenous leaders, meanwhile, consider the negotiations an unlawful violation of their rights. To protest the government’s action, the Indigenous communities are threatening to prevent the oil firms from accessing their land if a valid consultation with the communities does not take place.
Added to the tribal rights issue is the concern over oil spills in the region. The United Nations special rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes stressed the importance of dealing with the existing environmental hazards before issuing any new deals or contracts that may further exacerbate the issue. Additionally, the rapporteur emphasized that the Indigenous peoples’ concerns should be included when making decisions such as these, because oil spills have been proven to contaminate water to a point that can cause poisoning and death.

As of August 28th, an especially aggressive flood has hit South Asia, causing major infrastructural damage and the deaths of approximately 1200 Indian, Nepali, and Bangladeshi citizens. The storm is said to have affected around 40 million people in the region already, and the situation is quickly exacerbating to an unprecedented level. While some loss brought about by the monsoon season in South Asia is expected, scientists say this level of damage is unnatural—it is the direct result of climate change. The extreme weather has deprived some villages in India of basic resources such as food and water, destroyed more than half a million homes in Nepal, and submerged approximately a third of Bangladeshi land. The relief efforts will require upwards of 100 million USD. The government of India has already pledged 78 million USD for the heavily affected Bihar state alone.

2017-09-27,McGill,Israel,"BDS members question the validity of decision 
Last Sunday, September 17, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Board of Directors (BoD) voted to ratify the Judicial Board’s reference on the legality of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) motion brought to the General Assembly (GA) last winter. The reference, issued in May 2016, ruled that BDS was discriminatory in nature and violated SSMU’s Constitution and Equity Policy.
The reference was the result of tensions on campus following the Winter 2016 GA voting in favor of ratifying a motion in support of BDS. The BDS movement advocates for economic pressure against the state of Israel, in order to bring about a nonviolent end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories. While the GA vote was overturned, the BDS motion failed the school-wide online ratification process.
According to SSMU President Muna Tojiboeva, the BoD’s ratification vote was not facilitated in a confidential session. Eleven out of twelve Directors voted in favor of ratification, with only one abstention. While the decision was nearly unanimous in procedure, many on campus remain unconvinced of the reference’s validity.
The JBoard reference concluded that “SSMU’s commitment against discrimination in favour of creating ‘safer spaces’ renders motions similar to the BDS Motion, which specifically compel SSMU to adopt a platform against a particular nation, unconstitutional.”
However, Sydney Lang, a member of RadLaw, a social justice-oriented group of law students at McGill, has specific objections to section 33 of the reference.
“Their end reasoning,” Lang explained to The Daily, “is that yes, SSMU can take positions against nations but under certain circumstances, if it’s phrased in certain ways, and only in extreme cases. […] What I’m most concerned with is that they’re giving the Judicial Board in the future the ability to determine what’s an extreme case. They’re technically saying that we could hypothetically do this if it was a really extreme case and we would do it in a certain way. That’s not based in the Constitution. The Constitution doesn’t set that out. They’re creating this idea that they’re the ones who get to gauge the extremity of an issue before SSMU can take a stance on it.”
“What I’m most concerned with is that they’re giving the Judicial Board in the future the ability to determine what’s an extreme case. […] That’s not based in the Constitution. The Constitution doesn’t set that out.”
“They’re making decisions about what’s an extreme international conflict,” continued Lang, “or what’s extreme for the lives of Palestinians or other people around the world who are facing occupation, but how are they the ones to determine what’s extreme?”
“By adopting official positions against certain nations,” reads part of section 33, “as the BDS Motion aims to do with Israel, SSMU would be placing Members from those nations at a structural disadvantage within McGill’s community […] In essence, SSMU signals to those Members from the very beginning that it is hostile towards their country thus, indirectly, them. Motions which compel SSMU to do so threaten the fragile bonds which hold McGill’s international community together.”
“They’re conflating the political state of Israel with individual Israelis citizens,” said Lang in response. “They’re making this connection between the two that isn’t factually grounded. Look at any other [case] in history; McGill took a stand against South African apartheid, but weren’t against South Africans. Similar examples are when students in HK protested against the Chinese government or Indigenous peoples challenge the state of Canada. You are critiquing a system of governance, oppression, or occupation, not individual citizens”
“In essence, SSMU signals to those Members from the very beginning that it is hostile towards their country thus, indirectly, them. Motions which compel SSMU to do so threaten the fragile bonds which hold McGill’s international community together.”
BDS has yet to put out a statement following the Board’s ratification vote, but in an interview with The Daily, BDS member Maia Salameh gave some insight into how members of McGill’s BDS Action Network are feeling.
“We’re gonna fight it, but it is a huge blow obviously and a disappointment,” said Salameh. “That doesn’t mean it’s over. […] the whole problem stems from the structural nature of SSMU,” said Salameh. “To fight this, we need to […] reform [the structure] because right now there are unelected members that are making these huge decisions without any accountability or transparency.”
Currently, the JBoard, a body of the BoD, is composed of seven SSMU members appointed by the Nominating Committee. JBoard decisions are then ratified or rejected by the BoD, with decisions never being reviewed by an elected SSMU body.
“We are forming a new campaign called Democratize SSMU,” explained Salameh. “It’s going to be a coalition not just of BDS members because we don’t think this decision just affects BDS. We want to mobilize student groups and student activists in general because we want institutional change. We’re going to go through Equity complaints because [we] think there’s been a gross injustice here and we will be staging protests just to make people aware of this decision and why it affects them.”
“Right now there are unelected members that are making these huge decisions without any accountability or transparency.”
The minutes from the September 17 BoD meeting have yet to be released. As of publication, none of the BoD’s members-at-large have responded to comment regarding the ratification vote.

2017-10-02,McGill,Israel,"Transparency of Board of Directors and constitutionality of BDS questioned 
On September 28, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council convened for a meeting. Council heard presentations from the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ), and from the McGill Office of Sustainability regarding a bike centre project that is part of the climate action plan. The meeting was followed by an extensive question period which focused on the constitutionality of the Board of Directors’ (BoD) recent decision regarding the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
The Board of Directors is the highest governing body within SSMU and is responsible for running the business affairs of the society and ratifying certain political decisions. The constitutionality of the Board has recently been called into question because there are only three SSMU Execs currently serving, which is one too few, and eight members at large, which is four too many.
BDS is a pro-Palestinian movement that works to eliminate international support for Israel in its continued occupation and oppression of Palestine. BDS McGill is an on-campus branch of the movement that fights for the university to boycott, divest from and put sanctions on Israel.
During question period, Councillor Vithushon Thayalan addressed a potential conflict of interest in the BoD’s ratification of the BDS reference. The reference declaring BDS unconstitutional was first issued in 2016 by the SSMU Judicial board. The board ruled that BDS violated the SSMU Equity Policy. At the time, current SSMU President Muna Tojiboeva, served as one of the three judges who was assigned to the case. Tojiboeva currently sits on the BoD, which almost unanimously ratified the BDS decision September 2017.
According to SSMU’s conflict of interest policy, councillors with a conflict of interest must abstain from voting “on matters materially connected with their employment at the Society.” Failure to comply may result in a temporary suspension, a formal apology, or removal from the office.
When asked why she did not abstain from voting on the constitutionality of BDS, Tojiboeva answered, “I don’t have a personal conflict of interest because I don’t derive any personal interest from the [BDS] decision, I also don’t derive any financial gains from the decision.”
Referring to the same BoD meeting, SSMU VP External Connor Spencer asked Tojiboeva whether the Council can expect a report from the BoD on the BDS ratification. While such a statement has apparently not been prepared, Tojiboeva told Council that the meeting’s minutes addressing the ratification were already available online. However, a student present at the meeting confirmed that the last available meeting minutes were from April 2017, and thus that the minutes regarding the BDS decision were still unpublicized.
In response, SSMU’s General Manager, Ryan Hughes, pointed to some technical difficulties in transferring from SSMU’s old website to its new one. While the soft launch of the new website is scheduled for next week, Hughes explained that the minutes would still “not necessarily be available to the public.”
When reminded by SSMU VP Internal Affairs Maya Koparkar that the BoD must publicize minutes as well as report to council on all BoD decisions (per section 1.7 of the SSMU constitution), Tojiboeva answered, “I was unaware that a report needed to be made in terms of our presentation to Council.”
“I was unaware that a report needed to be made in terms of our presentation to Council.”
Further into question period, SSMU VP Finance Arisha Khan asked Tojiboeva why the SSMU Speaker has not presided over BoD meetings. While the Speaker may not vote or be counted towards quorum, section 11.6 of the SSMU Constitution requires them to preside over all BoD, General Assembly (GA), and Legislative Council meetings.
In response, Tojiboeva claimed that the Speaker no longer facilitates BoD meetings since the Constitution was amended in March 2017. The amendments in question allow President Tojiboeva to chair the BoD instead of the Speaker, while retaining voting and quorum rights.
An audience member questioned the validity of amendments, however, pointing out that “[the] Winter GA didn’t reach quorum, so the constitutional amendments couldn’t have been made.”
“[the] Winter GA didn’t reach quorum, so the constitutional amendments couldn’t have been made.”
Tojiboeva then clarified that the amendments were ratified through an electronic vote after the GA. However, the documents regarding the motion are not available on elections SSMU. Neither is the BoD resolution book, which has not been updated since 2016. The question of the resolution book was brought up during the last BoD meeting, according to Khan.
While Tojiboeva recognized the concerns regarding the unpublicized documents, she did not provide a clear timeline on when the resolution book would be updated.
“I think that’s a very valid concern and we should address this seriously. In terms of the timeline […] I would like to inquire my secretary general who would most likely be addressing the issue […] because […] in terms of my own capacities as President, I would not be able to address this immediately on my own time.”
A motion to appoint SSMU VP Student Life Jemark Earle to the BoD was passed, effective immediately. In order to maintain the requisite 12 member composition on the BoD, one member-at-large will resign from their position. The resignation is to be decided at the next BoD meeting.
“The approval of the VP Student Life is immediately necessary to have a functioning BoD,” said Koparkar. At the time of the BDS ratification, the BoD was composed of three SSMU executives and nine members-at-large instead of the required four executives, four members at large, and four councillors. The constitutionality of the BDS decision has been contested due to the composition of the BoD.

2017-10-21,McGill,Israel,"Procedural legitimacy of decision questioned
Arisha Khan, VP Finance of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) has been suspended from her position on the SSMU Board of Directors (BoD) for a period of two weeks, from October 15-29. Although the decision was never formally announced to the public, it eventually emerged that her suspension had been enacted in response to an alleged breach of confidentiality, as Khan had forwarded an email exchange between SSMU executives to a non-executive member of SSMU’s staff.
The decision to suspend Khan was made during a BoD meeting on the night of October 15 which, though nominally public, occurred in a locked building without official notice given to either the press or the public. Moreover, although the minutes from the discussion pertaining to Khan’s suspension have now been made public, it initially took place during a confidential session of the BoD, meaning that no non-Directors were permitted to witness it. In addition to this, SSMU President Muna Tojiboeva, VP Internal Maya Koparkar, and VP Student Life Jemark Earle, all three of whom sit on the BoD, left the room for this discussion. It remains unclear why they did so; in an email to The Daily, Tojiboeva explained that “the Directors felt it [was] appropriate for executives to leave the room while a breach of confidentiality concerning executive members were discussed,” but this has no basis in SSMU procedure. Despite having left the room while the other Directors discussed the context behind Khan’s breach of confidentially, the executives concerned re-entered the meeting in order to vote on her suspension; all three reportedly abstained.
Khan herself was absent, as she was in California attending a conference for improving access to education for youth from foster care. Tojiboeva told The Daily that “this [vote] was scheduled in advance, […] meaning if Director Khan wished she could have participated even though she was out of the country,” but Khan maintains that, on the contrary, she was not notified ahead of the vote.
Khan herself was absent, as she was in California attending a conference for improving access to education for youth from foster care.
“The Board had ample opportunity to provide me with notice that my standing was up for debate during the meeting,” she wrote in an email to The Daily, “and I of course would have made myself available in order to make a fair case for myself.”
Tojiboeva also claimed that Ryan Hughes, SSMU’s General Manager, notified Khan of her suspension on October 17; Tojiboeva did not offer The Daily any explanation of why this allegedly occurred two days after the decision was made. Khan, however, told The Daily that this too is untrue.
“I still have not received an official notice,” said Khan on October 19. “As well, [notifying me] was [Tojiboeva’s] responsibility and when I called the General Manager […] he was surprised that Muna had not informed me. I emailed the board 24 hours after the decision for an official notice but still have yet to receive one.”
Tojiboeva has not responded to The Daily’s requests for proof that Khan was told in advance that her standing as a Director would be up for debate, and that she was notified of her suspension following the BoD meeting on Sunday night.
At the SSMU Legislative Council meeting which occurred on October 19, the McGill Tribune asked why the BoD had decided that a two-week suspension was the optimal choice for SSMU in response to Khan’s breach of confidentiality, rather than, for example, a censure.
In response, Isabella Anderson, a Senate Caucus Representative to Council who also sits on the Board of Directors, explained that she herself had brought up the possibility of a temporary suspension.
“I suggested the suspension only because the other options that were being thrown around by other Directors made me extremely uncomfortable,” said Anderson. “I did make it clear at the time though that I was also uncomfortable suggesting a suspension, which is why I personally abstained from the vote. I will be honest, I felt like a minority voice, and uncomfortable for most of the time, and I do feel quite bad that I did not speak up at any time about the discomfort I felt with the process of that conversation and how it was handled. But I did make it clear that that suggestion, for a vote on suspension, was the lesser of several evils […] that were being passed around. […] But I did ask for input from the executives when they came back into the room, and no one spoke, no one asked about why or anything, which I found unsettling too.”
“I did make it clear at the time though that I was also uncomfortable suggesting a suspension, which is why I personally abstained from the vote.”
With Earle, Koparkar, and Tojiboeva out of the room, Khan out of the country, and Director Ellen Chen absent from the meeting, the individuals who participated in the then-confidential discussion of Khan’s suspension were members-at-large Jonathan Glustein, Simon Shubbar, Noah Lew, Alexander Scheffel, Sophie Schaffer-Wood, Dany Morcos, and Anderson herself. All but Anderson voted in favour of the two-week suspension.
Following her account of the discussion, Glustein, who had attended Thursday’s Council meeting as a member of the gallery, addressed the room. He described other options which had been considered, including temporarily suspending Khan from confidential sessions of the Board, setting up “an email-monitoring system or person put on the VP Finance’s account” until a given date, or the release of a public statement to the SSMU membership.
Later on during the Council meeting, the Tribune asked whether an investigation is underway into allegations that confidential information from a BoD meeting was leaked to the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA). On September 17, the BoD ratified a reference from the SSMU Judicial Board which declared the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement unconstitutional; within an hour of the decision, the CIJA announced it in a statement, breaking the news before the SSMU executive team, the press, or the membership had been informed.
“Why was this leak not pursued with the same haste as the VP Finance’s leak?” asked a reporter from the Tribune.
“The approval of the Judicial Board decision was done in public session, so there was no leak whatsoever,” responded Tojiboeva, “however in this situation, the VP Finance basically leaked information that was only available to executives. […] So the difference between the two is that one of them was in public session and there was absolutely no need for confidentiality – this [CIJA statement] is just coverage that no one can control, however actually leaking information to outside sources that don’t usually have access to the information is why the Board was very concerned.”
Tojiboeva did not elaborate on her assertion that the passing of information to an external advocacy organization such as the CIJA did not constitute leaking to outside sources. She also declined to respond to a question sent in by The Daily over email earlier in the week, which asked why the sharing of an email exchange between executives, reportedly concerning BoD nomination timelines, constituted a serious threat to SSMU – particularly since the email exchange was shared with a long-time SSMU employee.
“If we are regarding all correspondences between executives as confidential,” Khan told The Daily, “that could be very dangerous and all of us at some point would have been in breach of confidentiality per the Board’s decision.

2017-11-19,McGill,Israel,"McGill students must educate themselves on racial discrimination
On November 9th, QPIRG McGill hosted an “Anti-Racism 101” workshop as part of their Culture Shock event series. The series ran from November 7th to November 12th and dealt with issues such as anti-racism, migrant justice, and Indigenous solidarity. The anti-racism workshop was moderated by Vincent Mousseau, a community organizer and activist for groups such as Montreal Noir, Pervers/Cité, and RÉZO. Mousseau is currently studying Social Work at McGill.
The workshop began with a discussion about the difference between racial discrimination and racism. Mousseau defined racial discrimination as “discrimination based on aspects such as race and skin colour, which is a manifestation of prejudice.” They noted that “prejudice is the idea, and discrimination is acting upon that idea.” They also stressed that “anyone can be discriminatory towards anyone of any other group; [however], racism is understood as the systemic institutionalization of these prejudices. This is present everywhere…I live in fear of my life and I think of these things consistently.”
Mousseau continued by discussing their own experiences with racism, citing one of their first experiences at McGill. “When I got to McGill the first thing I did was buy a McGill lanyard, a McGill hoodie, and I kept my student card in the front of my wallet.”
“The reason for this is I have not worn a hoodie since Trayvon Martin died. I am terrified of what any interaction with the Montreal police can look like for me in this way. And I know that, as unfortunate as it is…it is more unacceptable to kill a McGill student than it is to kill a Black person.”
“As unfortunate as it is…it is more unacceptable to kill a McGill student than it is to kill a Black person.”
Mousseau discussed Indigenous residential schools as an example of racialized violence. “As Sir John A. MacDonald…said, this was the attempt to ‘kill the Indian in the child.’” Mousseau also spoke of the Sixties Scoop, “where social workers actively targeted Indigenous communities, found the smallest reason to pull children from their homes, and adopted them into white families.”
“A person that I adore and respect, Nakuset, who is the Executive Director of the Native Women’s Shelter in Montreal, was taken from her community and adopted into a Jewish family in Montreal and was told that she was brown because she was from Israel. That’s the reality of her life. She had to go through trying to understand that and go through these aspects of racialization.”
“We are on stolen land…the reason why we are here as settlers, irrespective of our issues of racialization, is because of the inherent violence that was committed against Indigenous populations, this act of cultural genocide being one of them.”
“We are on stolen land…the reason why we are here as settlers, irrespective of our issues of racialization, is because of the inherent violence that was committed against Indigenous populations, this act of cultural genocide being one of them.”
When asked about systemic racism at McGill, Mousseau talked about the SSMU building closure and the effect that it is having on student groups. For example, the Muslim Students’ Association will no longer have a space to pray. “When SSMU tells folks, ‘Oh, oops, surprise! Your building is being shut down,’ [and] there is a prayer space so many students on our campus rely on [that is] being taken away from them, that’s an issue.”
Mousseau also talked about the importance of SSMU as a space for marginalized groups to organize. “[Soon] there [will] no longer [be a] specific hub [for] Black queer [people]. [Right now] you can walk between Queer McGill and the Black Student Network in order to try to organize something. That is a barrier to making sure that our services are represented. This is just an example of some of the violence that exists against racialized folks at McGill. It’s often times coming from a place like ‘we didn’t even think about it that way.’”
“I try to give this workshop in order to try to raise consciousness on these issues and try to force people trying to organizing on campus to think more about the [role] racism plays in their organizing.”
An anonymous participant added to the conversation, “You need to call out your white friends for their racism. Direct them to specific resources. Educate yourself. You can not surround yourself with people of colour for the sole purpose of having them educate you. Do your own educating.”

2018-01-29,McGill,Israel,"Open forum discusses respect, inclusion, and free speech
On December 4, 2017, the Principal’s Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life emailed a survey to McGill community members requesting their opinion on values of respect, inclusion, and free speech on campus.
Created as a support line for people who have experienced, or are experiencing, exclusion or discrimination on campus, the task force itself is made up of people from varying roles and positions on campus, consisting of two co-chairs, both professors at McGill; one undergraduate student from the downtown campus, one undergraduate student from Macdonald Campus, one graduate student, two additional faculty members and two staff members. No members are directly tied with the university’s administration. The survey was available from December 4 to 7.
A majority of the survey’s questions focused on the concept of free speech, while others constituted inquiries into possible instances of discrimination and exclusion on campus. The survey’s choice of language sparked some criticism, mainly as a result of its focus on issues of freedom of speech with only a few questions about inclusiveness, despite the task force’s mandate.
In addition to the survey, as part of the consultative process, five closed-door focus groups around different themes of inclusion were organized, occurring between January 17 and 29: Teaching & Learning, Social Spaces, Graduate Student Life, Residence Life, and an open-themed discussion. Each one was composed of twenty students, lasting for 90 minutes. As of publication, four have been held (all expect Residence Life).
The University held an Open Forum on Campus Culture Wednesday, January 24 in Leacock 232. McGill staff chose not to moderate the forum beyond requesting people’s definition of the theme of the focus group, discussing inclusion or exclusion experienced in that space, and requesting that the participants concentrate on discussion rather than debate.
The night’s exchange revolved around whether or not the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement had a place (or simply a right) on campus. Laila Parsons, a professor specializing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at McGill, spoke about her views on the movement’s legitimacy.
“If the upper administration wants students themselves to engage in respectful and inclusive dialogue in a genuine way, then it needs to itself practice what it preaches,” she asserted. “It needs to respect the right of students to mobilize around the BDS movement, without picking those students out from all other activist groups on campus for special condemnation.”
“It needs to respect the right of students to mobilize around the BDS movement, without picking those students out from all other activist groups on campus for special condemnation.”
She also reproached Principal Suzanne Fortier’s February 2016 statement condemning the BDS movement after the SSMU motion to endorse the movement failed to be ratified. Parsons referred to the Principal’s statement as “bullying,” “intrusive,” the “opposite of respect and inclusion,” and “exacerbat[ing] tension rather than reduc[ing] it.”
Shanice Yarde, the Equity Advisor with McGill’s Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office, acknowledged the value of the task force and the hotline, but brought up important questions about the priorities and driving motives of the task force; this worry seemed to be common among many students.
One student, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to The Daily.
“I question the extent of which the university genuinely values free speech,” they said, “considering that, in my time at McGill, the only times the admin stepped in about student voices had to do with activism that related to Palestine. Similar responses were not expressed when, for instance, an association at McGill hosted a transphobic discussion by noted pushers of hateful propaganda. Nor was there much concern or action against students who drunkenly paraded around campus with misogynist messages on their clothes.”
“Does McGill value free speech without qualification, or only on specific issues that might upset their donors?” they concluded.
During discussion, there were a few instances of students arguing for the free roaming of ideas. These students were arguing for the need to defend “free speech” even when other students’ might feel that their sense of safety was put in jeopardy by such speech, a theme many religious minorities, queer, and racialized students feel conflates freedom of speech and freedom to discriminate with one’s speech.
Another student who chose to speak with The Daily anonymously said: “It was a nice experience, people who would normally not sit together had a chance to have some debates. The board of volunteers took many notes. Unfortunately, like most commission, I seriously doubt there will be any concrete implementations of the suggestions made to the administration. In other words, such a committee with no authority does not help me believe in a better future at McGill.”
“It was a nice experience, people who would normally not sit together had a chance to have some debates.”
Proposals brought up during the forum included: having more face-to-face debates from opposing sides on controversial issues, implementing a binding process to make syllabi fit a required diversity clause to ensure racial and gender diversity in syllabi sources, increased support to the SEDE office, greater inclusion of student input on tenure-track applications, and representation of student perspectives in tenure-track application committees.
The task force is expected to deliver a final report and submit its recommendations to Principal Fortier by April 27, 2018, to be made public shortly thereafter and formally presented at the May 16, 2018 meeting of Senate, where the initiatives findings on inclusivity and respect will be given the opportunity to shape future policies at McGill.
Group submissions are being welcomed by the task force until January 31, 2018 at principals.taskforce@mcgill.ca as Word or PDF documents not exceeding two pages. At any time, any individual can also send the task comments or suggestions by email to the same email.

2018-02-12,McGill,Israel,"Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS), the Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice, and equality has been nominated the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. Norwegian MP Bjørnar Moxnes, the leader of Rødt (the Red Party), nominated the movement with the support of his party. The nomination was also endorsed by Norwegian trauma surgeon Dr. Mads Gilbert, who has worked for fifteen years in Gaza, and written Night in Gaza, a book which describes his experience at Al-Shifa hospital during Israeli bombardments.
In January, Norway promised to impose sanctions on 26 states and countries who have committed or are committing violations of international laws and human rights. Yet, as Moxnes’s press release points out, Norway leaves Israel off the list, “despite Israeli occupation, annexation and collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” it states. “If the international community commits to supporting BDS to end the occupation of Palestinian territory and the oppression of the Palestinian people, new hope will be lit for a just peace for Palestinians, Israelis and all people across the Middle East” the press release stated. “My hope is that this nomination can be one humble but necessary step towards bringing forth a more dignified and beautiful future for all peoples of the region.”
Norwegian parliamentarians. those who have received the prize in the past, and any university professor in an appropriate field have the authority to nominate any organization or person to the Nobel Peace Prize. Nominations for the prize closed on February 1. The proposed candidates will now be evaluated and a nominee shortlist will be released in September. Nobel Laureate(s),will be announced in October and then celebrated in Oslo at the end of the year.

Ahed Tamimi’s trial began at the Ofer Military Court on February 13 behind closed doors, as an Israeli military judge banned media from entering the court. Tamimi’s trial has been deemed illegal by United Nations human rights investigators, who stated that it violates her rights under international law. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also condemned Tamimi’s detention. Tamimi garnered international media attention in December, after a video of her slapping and hitting Israeli soldiers went viral. Every year, the state of Israel detains and prosecutes 500 to 700 Palestinian children as it continues to illegally occupy the Palestinian West Bank.

According to a report published in December 2017, the economic, social, and economic crisis in Venezuela has caused more than one million people to leave the country between 2014 and 2017. Of the entire population of forced migrants, only 103,000 have requested refugee status, in the region and in Spain. In 2017, 17,130 demands for refugee status were registered by the Brazilian Federal Police. Brazil and other neighbouring countries are reinforcing police and military presence on their border with Venezuela, boxing in the country’s citizens to face famine and social unrest.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported that ethnic violence has pushed over 22,000 people to flee from the north-east of the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) to Uganda. In total, 34,000 people have fled the province of Ituri since the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of the month, thirty people have been killed following fighting between Hema herders and Lendu farmers of the province. In December 2016, President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his term coming to an end, leading 120,000 to flee the country in 2017. Domestic and international fear of a new civil war in the DRC increases as ethnic clashes continue in the central African country.

The establishment of “Modicare” was announced at the Indian union budget meeting for 2018-2019. The program will allow about half of the Indian population to gain access to health insurance. While the government has described the scheme as “the world’s largest government funded health care program,” the government has come under criticism. The programme is described as an initiative to court poor rural voters in next year’s general election, as many of them struggle with high healthcare costs. India currently is one of the world’s lowest spenders in public health, with only about one percent of its GDP being invested in the sector. The country is also plagued by a shortage of hospitals and doctors, but the government has taken steps towards making health services more accessible.

2018-02-26,McGill,Israel,"David Heap discusses breaking the blockade on Gaza
On February 20, McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestine Human Rights (SPHR) hosted David Heap, a community-based activist for peace and human rights, and media coordinator of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), a self-described “grassroots people-to-people solidarity movement composed of campaigns and initiatives from all over the world working together to end the blockade of Gaza.” Heap discussed the important role the FFC plays in defying the illegal blockade of Gaza, detailing how the movement raises international solidarity with Gazans who experience the ongoing siege from the Israeli occupation. The FFC also provides a platform for international civil societies to mobilize and discuss the Gaza situation. Several missions organized by the FFC attempted to reach the shores of Gaza to distribute much-needed supplies to Gazan residents; however, all were either stopped or assaulted by the occupation’s navy.
Missions to break the siege did not begin with the FFC, but with the Free Gaza Movement. Heap clarified: “two voyages in [August and October] 2008 sailed to and from Gaza and brought medical supplies without any security risks, and without any harm to anyone.” But when the occupation’s military carried out operation “Cast Lead” from December 2008 to January 2009, Heap explained, “free Gaza voyages arriving during the operation came under attack, […] the navy began shooting and ramming boats, and it became very difficult and dangerous.”
The Israeli occupation is responsible for putting activists in danger, Heap stressed. “The only thing that makes [the voyages] difficult is the occupier’s violence.” This hostility is exemplified in the FCC’s first voyage in 2010, organized by the Free Gaza Movement and the Turkish Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH). Of the six ships sailing to Gaza, “the largest, the Mavi Marmara, was attacked and boarded in international waters by the occupation’s commandos, killing nine activists and injuring several others,” stated Heap. The attack received extensive media attention generating an international public outcry, and caused the occupation to temporarily ease the blockade on Gaza.
Heap then described Israeli tactics to intercept humanitarian boats en route to Gaza. “Before we encountered the occupation’s navy, we lost contact with satellite radio […] the satellite phones all got blocked. This is in itself an admission of guilt, the occupiers are saying they’re about to do something they don’t want the world to see, so they have to cut off all channels of communication to control the narrative. They boarded with armed commandos, but we are committed to non-violent resistance. They are not committed to nonviolence.”
Heap was detained along with the other activists present onboard, spending six days in jail.
Heap explained that “typically flotilla participants are deported after 24 to 48 hours because it’s a media liability to keep [Western] internationals in prison.”
 
“Before we encountered the occupation’s navy, […] the satellite phones all got blocked. This is in itself an admission of guilt, the occupiers are saying they’re about to do something they don’t want the world to see.”
 
Heap went on to say that the most important thing was that “we were not forgotten, [however] the dangers for the Palestinians in Gaza [are] being forgotten. If nothing else, these actions serve to remind the world that they are not forgotten. They may be forgotten by the governments of the world, but they are not forgotten by the people of the world.” With this, Heap underlined one of the main goals of the flotilla, “this is one of the reasons to sail, it reminds a captive people that they in their international prison are not forgotten.”
He also reminded the attendees that the “blockade itself remains illegal under international law […] the special Rapporteur for Human Rights in September 2011 said that there is no way the blockade of Gaza could be legal because it deprives a civilian population from the right of freedom of movement […] which is considered collective punishment under International Law and the Geneva Conventions, guaranteeing the freedom of movement for all people within their state.”
Heap then described the Estelle Flotilla in 2012 which stopped at various European ports, raising awareness in the cities. He explained, “we learned in that case about the importance of the pre-voyage. The last part of the voyage can be predictable when we’re intercepted by the occupier’s navy. When we meet people in a European communities we have an impact on that community.”
An alternative tactic to the flotillas was the Gaza’s Ark campaign from 2012-2015, which sought to challenge the blockade from the inside out. Heap explained, “Gaza’s Ark was a project to sail from inside Gaza out, to emphasize the fact that it’s not about us bringing stuff to Gaza, it’s about freedom of movement for Palestinians in Gaza.” Heap and his colleagues would “rebuild a fishing boat in Gaza, buy trade goods from Palestinians who wanted to trade with the world, and sail out to challenge the blockade. [We were] demanding freedom of movement and freedom of commerce […] and the project sold about $25,000 worth of export goods.”
The Gaza’s Ark campaign addressed the plight of Gaza’s fishermen, who “since 2012 and in fact earlier, suffered from the occupier pushing back the very narrow band of waters where Palestinians are allowed to fish. Sometimes it’s six nautical miles, sometimes it’s as little as four nautical miles. Keep in mind that any other coastal people in the world has a minimum of 12 nautical miles of territorial waters and normally a 20 nautical mile economic zone.” Heap stated “many end up in the occupation’s prisons for the crime of fishing. For the crime of trying to feed their families.”
Heap went on to express his support for the Women’s Flotilla which sailed in 2016 that “underlined the aspects of the blockade which particularly affect women […] and the role women play in the resistance and the survival of their societies.”
George Ghabrial, a member of SPHR, said “it’s important to remind the McGill community at large that [the struggle for Palestinian liberation] is bigger than just McGill or a campus. We have a room full of people who are relatively aware of the issue today thinking about the occupation of Gaza. It inspires people to think a little bit differently and maybe empowers them to take action in different ways they hadn’t done so before in their communities and in that way spread more internationally.”
Regarding future flotilla plans, Heap stated that “this year, we’re planning a sail called ‘A Just Future for Palestine’ and the flotilla will be called ‘Al Awdah’ [The Return] with representatives from all over Europe, Malaysia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States as well as several [representatives from] international organizations. We need to continue to spread the international nature of this. The purpose is to break the media blockade and to reach people with the story of what’s happening in Gaza.”
 
“It inspires people to think a little bit differently and maybe empowers them to take action in different ways […] and in that way spread more internationally.”

2018-02-26,McGill,Israel,"Rally participants discuss systemic incarceration of child prisoners
On Sunday, February 18, around 50 people gathered to protest against the trial of Ahed Tamimi and the treatment of other Palestinian political prisoners at Norman Bethune Square. The rally was organized by Solidarité pour les droits humains des Palestiniennes et Palestiniens in coalition with five other groups as part of Free the Tamimis Global Day of Action, an international campaign organized in response to the arrest and detainment of the 17-year-old activist, Ahed Tamimi. The ongoing imprisonment of the Tamimi family has sparked public outrage, in response to the military court’s ruling last month to keep Tamimi and her mother in custody during closed-door trials.They, allegedly, do not have a clear timeline. Various speakers at the event denounced the prosecution of child prisoners, as participants held banners reading “End apartheid,” and “Stand with Gaza.” Two police vehicles were present at the rally.
“Israel does not differentiate between the child, the elderly, the women,” said Omar Ben Ali, a speaker and Palestinian refugee participating in the event. “In the eyes of the Israeli occupation, every Palestinian is an enemy. Every Palestinian must be punished.”
Ben Ali, who is from the Jenin region of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is currently stateless because of the Canadian government’s refusal to recognize his claimed refugee status.
Ben Ali emphasized that the Ahed Tamimi case is not an isolated incident, as all Palestinians under occupation, including his wife and children in Palestine, are at risk of violence.
“When I see Ahed al-Tamimi, I see five daughters of mine”, said Ben Ali. “Every second, I have a fear that my daughter will be subjected to what Ahed al-Tamimi is subjected to. Not just my daughters, but […] all Palestinian children.”
According to the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, approximately 700 children are put on trial in military courts each year. Recent cases include the detainment of Abdel-Raouf al-Bilawi and Razan Abu Sal, two 13-year-olds, who were sentenced to four months in prison in January this year for throwing stones at occupation forces. They are reportedly the youngest Palestinian prisoners to date, and the youngest prisoners in the world.
Both al-Bilawi and Abu Sal live in the occupied West Bank, like the Tamimi family members, where Human Rights Watch have documented multiple cases of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) being physically abusive, and where the Tel Aviv based Haaretz has reported on allegations of IDF officers purposefully disabling Palestinian youth.
“With Ahed Tamimi we have a young person who happened to be born Palestinian, who happened to be born into occupation of her land, who happened to be born into the resistance struggle of her people for freedom and justice,” said Dolores Chew, another speaker at the event told the audience.
In Israel, there are two distinct legal systems in operation: the civilian legal system applied to Israeli citizens and a military court system applied to the Palestinian population.
According to the prisoners rights group Addameer, there are currently 350 Palestinian children in Israeli detention. According to a study published on October 2017 by Israeli rights groups HaMoked and B’tselem, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) incarcerates Palestinian youth under harsh conditions, such as night interrogations without the presence of a guardian or a legal counsellor. The report states that 91 per cent of interviewed minors were arrested at night, and minors were not made aware of their right to remain silent, or their rights to counsel. Such detainment is unlawful: Israeli law prohibits night interrogations.
Moreover, Israel, as a signatory of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, is obliged to uphold international juvenile justice standards which mandates that “[t]he arrest, detention, or imprisonment of a child […] shall be used only as a measure of last resort.”
Chew noted that while minors are unlawfully arrested and interrogated, “soldiers […] have authority from the Israeli state to invade homes regularly, vandalize the contents, destroy food, terrorize children asleep in their beds and shoot them in the head. All this with absolute impunity.”
A report published by Breaking the Silence, a non governmental organization (NGO) run by former Israeli soldiers, mentioned the discretion given to soldiers to open-fire and identify targets, which led to massive casualties of unarmed Palestinians.
“It is the Israeli state declaring ‘we can do this to you and get away with it’,” said Chew.
“With Ahed Tamimi we have a young person who happened to be born Palestinian, who happened to be born into occupation of her land, who happened to be born into the resistance struggle of her people for freedom and justice”
This state-sponsored military campaign on Gaza operates in areas which are legally under Palestinian authority. Most of the attacks perpetuate the persecution of Palestinian children in villages within the West Bank.
The Palestinian West Bank is currently separated into three administrative divisions: Areas A, B, and C. Each division operates under varied levels of civil control by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israeli occupation forces. Areas A and B comprise respectively of only 18 and 22 percent of the West Bank, and are supposed to be administered under the PA. The remaining 60 per cent, Area C, is occupied by Israeli forces, and is considered to be illegally administered under international law. Nabi Saleh, the village where the Tamimi family resides, is part of the former division under PA control. However, the Israeli state maintains de facto authority and governance through raids conducted by Israeli soldiers to arrest and detain Palestinians. Chew stated that Palestinians under the occupation have the right to resist these actions.
“The […] Zionist state of Israel flagrantly violates international law,” she said. “The occupation of Palestine is the longest military occupation in modern history. Under international law, people under occupation have a right to resist. Therefore what Ahed and other Palestinians do to resist occupation is their legitimate right under international law.”
*Anna, a Palestinian student present at the rally told the Daily in an interview, “International law grants Tamimi, and many other Palestinian activists placed under PA division control the right to legally resist the presence of Israeli soldiers […] on their land. It is important to distinguish ‘aggression’ from ‘legal resistance against colonialism.’”
According to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314, the definition of aggression does not “prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom, and independence […] particularly [of] peoples under colonials and racist regimes […] nor the right of these peoples to struggle to that end and to seek and receive support.” Moreover, the UN has recognised the right for occupied populations to use legitimate armed force to see “liberation from colonial and foreign domination” in numerous occasions.
“The Israeli occupation of Palestine is illegal, and has always been colonial,” said Anna, referring to the Israeli state’s decision not to withdraw from Palestine in 1967 despite a unanimous decree of the UN Security Council to adopt Resolution 242, which called for the “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied.”
Under international law, people under occupation have a right to resist. Therefore what Ahed and other Palestinians do to resist occupation is their legitimate right under international law.”
“As Western governments are supporting the Israeli occupation, what will become of us?” asked Ali. Ali claimed refugee status on arrival in Canada almost ten years ago, a status which has been denied despite being unable to return to Palestine due to the occupation. He subsequently applied for immigration status under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, but that however was too refused.
One of the speakers, Andrew Welsh pointed out that Canada currently does not recognize the existence of a Palestinian state.
“It is not a coincidence that in 2016, the Trudeau government passed a motion condemning the BDS [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions] movement,” said Welsh.
In February 2016, Canada’s Parliament passed a motion condemning the BDS movement, a grassroots movement seeking a peaceful resolution to the Israeli occupation.
“We need to be in solidarity, with those that are fed up,” said Welsh in French. “Fed up by the lies of the government, that claims to have no money to finance the creation of jobs, but has the money to build new weapons. Canada is going to increase its military budget by 70 percent. A part of this budget will go in the support of the Zionist occupation of Palestine.”
Anna explained in an interview to The Daily how the extent of apathy of Palestinian human rights is reflected in the international responses towards cases like Tamimi’s.
Anna stated that the content and amount of information, or lack thereof, published in Western news sources such as the New York Times and Newsweek further reflects the inaction of the international community.
She explained how, for example, Tamimi’s trial was postponed from January 31 to February 6 and finally to February 13, but “Western news sources have, for the most part, refrained from publishing the news of this postponement.” Anna illustrated her point by noting how an article published by the New York Times (NYT) on February 4 regarding the change of date of the trial was taken down.
In an article published in December 22, 2017, the NYT included the perspectives of several Israeli figures, such as Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute, a Jewish research and education institute, who stated that “when you see yourself as under permanent siege, your greatest fear is the loss of deterrence.” However, Anna told the Daily that this statement does not reflect the experiences of Palestinians because “Israeli occupation forces control the movement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank, and Palestinians are thus the people under siege.”
“For those of us living at a great physical distance from Palestine where we don’t experience the heel of a military boot on our necks,” stated Chew, “it might have seemed that things were relatively quiet, relatively peaceful but the […] [Israeli airstrikes] on Gaza just a few hours ago are a reminder that this is a state of continuing war and civilians including children are the targets.”
On the day of the rally, the Israeli military carried out multiple strikes overnight in the Gaza strip, killing two Palestinians in an Israeli tank fire. The same day, two Palestinian teenagers were killed near Rafah, the southern region of the border, for approaching the border in an allegedly “suspicious manner.”
“We need to make people aware that even when Palestine drops out of the news for us over here, Palestinian people have to live the daily indignities of occupation,” continued Chew.
“You are the ones who have to stand for the Palestinians,” continued Ali, echoing Chew’s words and stressing the importance of international solidarity. “Because even Palestine’s children no longer trust in these [Western] governments.”
“Palestine’s children only call for the people, those who are free all over the world,” said Chew, quoting resistance movements such as “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS),” which have been “called for by the people of Palestine.”
“We need to make people aware that even when Palestine drops out of the news for us over here, Palestinian people have to live the daily indignities of occupation”
BDS was formally nominated for the a Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian parliamentarian Bjornar Moxnes, backed by the support of his party, the Rødt (Red) Party. BDS is currently active in Montreal among other resistance groups such as Tadamon, an organization in support of Palestinian human rights.
“We must continue the pressure, there is an end in sight. […] Ahed, we send you our love and deepest solidarity,” concluded Chew.

2018-03-26,McGill,Israel,"SPHR organizes discussion on contemporary colonialism
On Tuesday March 20, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill hosted a workshop comparing the contemporary colonialisms of Tibet and Palestine, presented by Khando Langri, a Tibetan-Canadian member of SPHR McGill and an activist for the liberation of Tibet. The workshop was held in conjunction with other events as part of Israeli Apartheid Week in Montreal.
Langri began the presentation by explaining the need to recognize Palestine and Canada as both occupied territories.
“In order to resist colonization abroad, we must first address how we are complicit in the continuous colonial process in Montreal,” explained Langri.
She established that although there is a “universal perception within university settings that we have entered the age of postcolonialism […] colonialism is not only alive but is thriving in the modern age” as exemplified by the occupation of both Palestine and Tibet.
The NGO Freedom House, which according to its website is “an annual comparative assessment of political rights and civil liberties,” ranks the political rights and civils rights of the occupied territory of Tibet at -2/40 and 3/60, those of the occupied West Bank at 6/40 and 24/60, and those for the occupied Gaza Strip at 3/40 and 9/60, respectively. In comparison, Canada is ranked at 40/40 for its political rights and 59/60 for its civil rights.
Portrayal of child prisoners
Langri compared the occupations of Tibet and Palestine first in terms of child prisoners held in both regions. The eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a “high reincarnate Lama,” an important religious leader in Tibet, was recognized by the Dalai Lama on May 15, 1995 and was subsequently rejected by the Chinese government which “abducted both [the Panchen Lama] and his family,” explained Langri. Neither him nor his family have been heard of or seen since and no charges have been exposed nor have any trials have been held.
“[The Panchen Lama] was […] removed from Canada’s list of prisoners last year” which is a list of different prisoners compiled by Canada used in order to lobby against certain countries, stated Langri. “The list that was […] for China […] omitted the Panchen Lama so clearly China’s winning here since [Canada doesn’t] remember him anymore.”
This example was juxtaposed with the situation of Ahed Tamimi, a sixteen-year old child prisoner facing eight months in prison after slapping an Israeli soldier who trespassed onto her home in the occupied West Bank, and consequently is being tried in an Israeli military court.
“Because Tammi is portrayed as an adult in mass media and […] the Panchen Lama’s identity as a tuku […] a high reincarnate Lama […] are the forefront of any discussion involving these two people they are not allowed to exist as children in the popular psyche,” elaborated Langri.
“It’s important to talk about them even if they’re politicized so we can’t let the fact that […] many are perceived as being […] very controversial figure[s] […] to stop us from talking about them because this politicization does not [take away from] their childhood.”
Ecology of occupied land
Langri also discussed the concept of China’s “greenwashing” of the occupation in Tibet. Greenwashing is “the act of packaging something to make it seem eco-friendly and thus more acceptable to mainstream media,” she explained. This concept is part of China’s “Ecological Migration Scheme” which displaces Tibetan nomadic families and relocates them to “ghettos called ‘Socialist New Villages’.” These nomadic inhabitants do not have skills for the labor market, are not offered education, and face an increased living cost, Langri explained.
“What’s ironic is that […] the Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N. has recognized the role that pastoralists play in preserving the environment so in terms of Tibet the nomads […] were very crucial in maintaining […] soil carbon because the animal’s waste added nutrients to the soil […] maintaining fertility and also the hooves would aerate the soil by pressing in seeds and trampling dead plants.”
This concept of ecological manifestation of colonialist occupation is also present in Palestine. Langri used the example of the establishment of the “South Africa Forest,” a tree-planting initiative by the Jewish National Fund in the destroyed Palestinian village of Lubya published in article by Heidi Grunebaum.
“By using nature against indigenous people we can […] erase their narratives,” said Langri.
“Changing the land [of native peoples] physically […] translates into […] [a change in the] conception of national homelands.”
Apoliticism of traditional symbols
Langri explained how “we as a consumer culture really enjoy indigenous aesthetics but that means on the one hand as we consume them we render them apolitical.” She explained how in the case of Tibet, “Tibetan struggles [are] consistently erased from news struggles and has been substituted with this fascination for the Dalai Lama [the spiritual leader of Tibet] as a media personality.”
“As a society we are charmed by him but we don’t want to engage in Tibetan issues because they’re not very savory.”
For example, the use of Tibetan prayer flags, flags which contain mantras which are believed to blow in the wind and spread compassion and peace and the usage of the keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism and protest against Israeli occupation, as decoration and fashionable pieces is testament to a “love for Tibetan and Palestinian aesthetics but [a lack of] […] love for the people themselves.”
Tourism as a “tool of occupation”
In terms of tourism, Langri discussed how “tourism is in fact the tool of occupation.” She explained how in the case of Palestine, Birthright trips to Israel which are offered to Jewish young adults ages 18-32 “erase all traces of the land’s original […] inhabitants.” These trips represent an “unequal spreading of […] touristic resources” because Palestinian refugees cannot return to their homeland in the regions of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s prevention of Palestinians from returning to their homeland is parallel to China’s prohibition of movement for Tibetans even though China advocates for tourism within Tibet. All Tibetan passports have been confiscated by the Chinese government and only government-affiliated individuals are offered “semi-official public affairs passports,” Langri explained. Additionally, traditional Tibetan “sky burials,” a religious and sacred Tibetan custom, are being advertised as a tourist attraction and are being photographed and recorded.
Mobilization
Anna* a student who attended the workshop explained that “Tibet has now officially stopped requesting to be an independent nation and now wants […] political recognition […] these rights are inscribed in the Chinese constitutions and so it’s simply asking that China now respect these rights to autonomy […] but they’re not [upholding these rights] […] [and] in fact nothing is really being respected on paper.”
“That’s […] the political way that we could mobilize,” Anna continued. “Canada for example hasn’t taken a stance […] with regards to recognizing Tibet’s desire to […] have these autonomy rights respected and that’s something that the [Canada Tibet Committee] tries to do […] to [get] the Canadian government to take a stance.”

2018-03-27,McGill,Israel,"Professor accused of sexual misconduct
McGill professor accused of sexual misconduct

Islamic Studies Institute in the spotlight following abuse allegations against professor

On September 2017, stickers warning students about a McGill Islamic Studies professor’s alleged history of sexual misconduct began to appear in women’s’ washrooms across campus. The stickers, put up by a group called Zero Tolerance McGill, prompted readers to send any testimonies of abuse at the hands of other faculty members, noting that the professor named in the stickers was up for tenure.
The professor agreed to answer some of The Daily’s questions on the condition that he remain unnamed. He claimed that the allegations were “categorically untrue” and that he was “deeply committed” to doing his part in order to “make every student feel safe in [his] classroom and on McGill’s campus.” He made no further comments to the Daily.
The World Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies Student Association (WIMESSA) executive team for 2016-17 previously wrote an open letter to Robert Wisnovsky (director of the Institute for Islamic Studies) addressing the reputation of the professor. The letter, signed by roughly 50 students, accused the Institute of failing to take allegations of misconduct seriously and urged the administration to not reward the professor with a tenured position.
After The Daily published the first article in relation to this issue, the current WIMESSA executive team released a statement on Facebook expressing solidarity with those affected, and detailing their frustrations with institutional barriers to robust accountability. The WIMESSA VP Finance eventually resigned from her position, citing a mishandling of the professor’s actions as her reason for leaving the exec team. It also came to light that the president of WIMESSA was an employed research assistant of the professor accused. Thus, she decided to remove herself from any further conversations on the matter.
The incident brought attention to the lack of regulations on student-professor relationships as well as the lack of sufficient student consultation in the tenure process.
WIMESSA pledged to organize an open forum on the issue of sexual misconduct wherein students are able to voice their concerns to the administration.
Bill 151/survivor bill of rights
Gaps in Bill 151

SSMU Council unanimously passes Survivor Bill of Rights

In December 2017, the Quebec National Assembly passed Bill 151, mandating that all educational institutions, including CEGEPs, must propose a policy addressing sexual assault, including relationships between students and teachers. The Bill was developed in collaboration with student organizations like the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ), Our Turn, a national student-led action plan to end campus sexual violence, and the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU). The policy required that authorities be notified of any sexual relations between a student and someone who may have an influence on their education, like a professor.
However, not all recommendations made to protect the rights of the survivors were included in the final version of the bill, such as a “Defined Stand Alone Sexual Violence Policy,” which would discontinue processing sexual assault cases through the Student Code of Conduct. McGill’s sexual assault policy was graded a C- as it is not a stand-alone policy, and does not provide any avenues for justice if someone is assaulted by a faculty member.
The gaps in Bill 151 prompted community members, including AVEQ’s Coordinator of Mobilization Kristen Perry and SSMU VP External Connor Spencer to write an open letter criticizing the bill, which was later signed by 20 student organizations and 300 individual students. The letter calls for the introduction of “rape shield protections” to protect the privacy of the survivor’s sexual history, student representation of 30 percent on committees, as well as the students being made aware of sanctions put into place for their case.
Measures to ensure reasonable and defined timelines were recommended, such as a complaint process which does not exceed 45 days, and accommodations for survivors to be arranged within 48 hours of sending the complaint. The letter also suggested the creation of an independent oversight body, which would serve to listen to individual complaints put forth on the violation of their safety and/or rights by the institution.
Some of these requests were later adopted by SSMU in the unanimous passing of the Survivor’s Bill of Rights on January 25 2018.
Task Force
Task Force on respect and  inclusion addresses free speech

Task Force on respect and  inclusion addresses free speech

In November 2017, the Principal’s Task Force on Respect and Inclusion was created. The Task Force was aimed to create “respectful and inclusive debate” in the university context, and how the university can develop “best practices” to handle conflict over issues of speech.
The task force is organized under the office of the Principal, and reports to Senate to provide recommendations after the completion of its research. While the Task Force does not have direct power to enact policy change, it serves as an advisory body to the Principal moving forward. The Task Force is composed of two McGill professors who serve as co-chairs, one undergraduate representative from the downtown campus, one undergraduate representative from the MacDonald campus, one graduate representative, two faculty members and two staff members.
On December 2017, the Task Force held a survey to the McGill community members regarding their experiences on respect and free speech. The language used in the survey prompted criticism, with only a few questions asked about inclusiveness. The consultative process included five closed-door focus groups around different themes throughout January, each composed of twenty students. Group submissions regarding the Task Force was accepted from the general public until the end of January.
In September 2017, the SSMU Board of Directors unanimously voted that the BDS movement violated SSMU’s constitution. Again, in January, an Open Forum on Campus Culture was the site of a discussion on whether or not the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement should be given on campus. Laila Parsons, a professor specializing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at McGill, spoke in support of students’ right to mobilize around the BDS movement, and criticized Principal Suzanne Fortier’s statement condemning the BDS movement after SSMU’s motion to endorse the movement did not pass in 2016.
The Task Force is expected to deliver a final report and submit their recommendations by the end of April 2018, then released to the public by mid May at the Senate.
Colten Boushie
February 2018 saw the acquittal of Gerald Stanley, the man accused of killing Colten Boushie. Boushie was a 22-year-old Indigenous man from Red Pheasant First Nation, who allegedly drove to Stanley’s farm to ask for help with a flat tire. Stanley then shot Boushie, later claiming his actions were the result of a “freak accident.” The acquittal garnered widespread outrage from Indigenous communities and settler allies, with demonstrations across the country demanding justice for Colten.
“How First Nations are treated in the justice system is not right,” said Boushie’s uncle Alvin Baptiste, speaking to the Toronto Star. “A white jury came out with a verdict of not guilty [for] Gerald Stanley, who shot and killed my nephew. This is how they treat us First Nations people. It is not right. Something has to be done about this.”
A vigil commemorating the life of Colten Boushie was held at Norman Bethune Square in Montreal near Concordia University to raise awareness about the injustice of the trial. The vigil was attended by over 100 people, policed by around twenty SPVM officers. 
Two weeks after the acquittal of Stanley, Raymond Cormier was acquitted of the murder of 15 year old Tina Fontaine. The not-guilty verdict came even after Cormier’s apparent admission of guilt, caught on tape by the RCMP.
Another vigil was organized in response to Canadian institutions’ denial of justice to Indigenous people.

2018-09-10,McGill,Israel,"U.S. cuts funding for UN refugee agency
The United States discontinued funding to a United Nations agency that aids Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria on August 31 2018. The U.S. has been a major contributor to the The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for decades; in 2017, the United States donated $350 million to the agency, and was planning to make the same contribution this year. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, offers a multitude of health, educational, and social services to Palestinians. The UNRWA helps attain schooling for over 500,000 children in the area, and grant medical aide to 9 million. The Trump administration also recently cut $200 million in aid to other agencies helping Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. To explain this cut of funding, the U.S. government described the UNRWA as “irredeemably flawed,” and said their business strategy is “unsustainable.” In response to the United State’s decision, the UNRWA stated that “the international […] community, our donors and host countries have consistently praised UNRWA for its achievements and standards.” The U.S. used to supply 30% of its total budget, meaning that the elimination of funding from the U.S. could have disastrous results for millions of Palestinian refugees. In response to the actions of the US., Arab and European countries have promised to continue to defend the UNRWA, and Germany has pledged to increase its aid for the program. In May of this year, President Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to the much disputed city of Jerusalem, a decision critics believe is in line with the funding cut, and an overall shift towards a more pro-Israel stance.
Trans Migrant Sex Worker Vanessa Campos Murdered in France
content warning: death, anti-sex work sentiment, transphobia
Vanesa Campos, a trans Peruvian migrant sex worker, was murdered by seven to eight men while trying to protect a client from being robbed at the Bois de Boulogne (West of Paris, France), the night of August 16. A new protest in honour of Vanesa Campos is scheduled for September 22 2018. 5 men are currently being detained for “organised group murder” and “group thefts with hurt.” Associations, like Acceptess Transgenres (AcceptessT) and STRASS (a French sex worker union), have been protesting the government’s silence, especially that of Marlène Schiappa’s, France’s Secretary of Equality between women and men. They particularly criticize France’s laws on sex work, which penalize clients and push sex workers into precarity. Activists also decry the general treatment of trans people, sex workers, and migrants in French society. On the matter, a representative of STRASS wrote: “our [sex workers’] deaths are normalised. […] A trans woman who dies remains a ‘tranny’.”
Journalists arrested in Myanmar 
Two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, are being sentenced to prison for 7 years for the possession of official Myanmar documents. They were investigating the massacre of 10 Rohingya men in the Burmese village of Inn Din. The verdict is being considered a roadblock for the country’s free press and transition to democracy. Multiple governments and International Human Rights groups are calling for the reporters’ immediate release.
The reporters pleaded not guilty to violating Myanmar’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which is an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. They claim that they were framed by the police: the reporters told the court that two police officials handed them the papers at a restaurant in Yangon just prior to their arrest by other officers. Testimony presented by prosecution witnesses was contradictory. Another police witness testified the restaurant meeting was a set-up to block, or punish, the journalists for their reporting on the mass killings of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine by Burmese military officials.
UN investigators have called for senior Burmese military officials to be prosecuted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The State Counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has remained silent on the issue, and has been criticized for failing to stand up for the free press after having championed the rights of journalists during her own house arrest.
India overturns section 377
The Indian Supreme Court decriminalized the “carnal intercourse” clause under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code on September 6 2018, in what experts are calling a “landmark decision”. While Section 377 still exists, it can no longer be used to punish consensual gay sex. This law originated from the British colonization of India in the mid-1800s, and continued to be used for prosecution, despite Britain decriminalizing homosexuality in 1967. In a public statement, Chief Justice Dipak Misra described the law as being “irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary.”
In 2008, a High Court in New Delhi overturned the law and decriminalized homosexuality. However, in 2013 this order from the New Delhi High Court was brought to the Supreme Court and ruled unconstitutional, reinstating Section 377. The Supreme Court decided to revisit the legality of Section 377 through the lens of privacy; in 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that privacy was an essential human right and that “sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy.” Following this decision, the recent revision to Section 377 focused on protecting the privacy of consenting adults. Currently, gay marriage and the adoption of children by same-sex couples is still criminalized, but many LGBTQ+ activists have been invigorated by the recent developments and are hopeful for future change. Dhrubo Jyoti, a queer LGBTQ+ activist, told CNN in an interview that the decriminalization of Section 377 “not just affirms one’s faith in the Constitution, but it also means that the gloom and the despair in this atmosphere of abuse for many of us, hopefully, for a new generation of queer people, it won’t be there.”

2018-11-05,McGill,Israel,"Vigils for Pittsburgh Shooting Held Across Montreal 



Content warning: murder, anti-Semitism
Continue or go back to the main page


On October 27, a man opened fire at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The shooter killed 11 people and injured six. The attack took place while members of the synagogue were praying. The suspect allegedly yelled “all Jews must die” before opening fire, and had various anti-Semitic posts on his social media. The shooting is being labeled as an anti-Semitic hate crime. 
Content warning: murder, anti-Semitism
Continue or go back to the main page
On October 28, despite the sleet, about two hundred people gathered in front of Montreal’s Holocaust Museum to commemorate the lives of those killed in the Pittsburg synagogue shooting. The vigil was organized by Independent Jewish Voices (IJV) Montreal, IJV McGill, am McGill, and If Not Now McGill.
Speakers, including Niall Ricardo, Sam Hersh, Hani Abramson, and Rachel Kronick reaffirmed their Jewish identity and emphasized anti-Semitism as part of broader racist violence. Niall Ricardo told The McGill Daily that “anti-Semitism doesn’t exist in a void; it’s tied to all kinds of racism and discrimination linked to the global rise of fascism.” Samer Majzoub, the President of the Canadian Muslim Forum, and Shaheen Junaid, the President of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, spoke as well. Both offered their sympathies and emphasized the importance of solidarity in the face of violence and racism.
 Two other vigils have been organized in Montreal since then. One, organized by Federation CJA and CIJA-Quebec, took place Monday at 7:30pm at the Beth Israel Beth Aaron Congregation. The Congregation was at its maximum capacity; estimates range between several hundred and over a thousand attendees. Both David Ouellette, Director of Research and Public Affairs at CIJA-Quebec, and Lesli Green, Chief Communications Officer of Federation CJA, emphasized the importance of this vigil for Montreal’s Jewish community.
 Another vigil, organized by McGill, Concordia, and UdeM organizations such as Israel on Campus at McGill, IJV McGill, McGill Jewish Studies Students’ Association, Ghetto Shul, CIJA-Québec, Hillel Montreal, and others, took place at Concordia and McGill at 5:00p.m. on Tuesday, October 30. The Y intersection was full; approximately three hundred people attended. Jazlyn Hellman, President of Am McGill, told The McGill Daily that this vigil was important for campus Jewish communities to come and grieve together, both at McGill and Concordia. 
Niall Ricardo, of IJV Montreal, told The McGill Daily that various organizations such as Federation CJA and Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) were invited to the vigil on Sunday, but they declined. Ricardo implied that this had to do with the differing positions of the organizations in terms of Israel: one of IJV’s key tenets is Palestinian solidarity, which is not an opinion shared by Federation CJA and CIJA. Ouellette, of CIJA-Quebec, said that the Sunday vigil was announced very shortly after the shooting, and that his organization was busy preparing for Monday’s vigil. Hellman, of Am McGill, said that because the shooting happened on Shabbat, during which some Jews do not work or use electricity, certain people were not aware of the vigil or could not attend. 
Representatives from all three vigils emphasized that these events brought communities together. More specifically, it brought the Jewish community together in the face of rising anti-Semitism.

2018-11-19,McGill,Israel,"International news for the week of Nov. 19
Ceasefire in Gaza 
On November 11, seven Palestinians in Gaza were killed by an Israeli special forces operation. This was the latest event in the violent, decades-long occupation of Gaza by Israel, though there had been a ceasefire since 2014, with Israel easing up its siege and allowing money and fuel to be sent over the border. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader, said on November 13 that if Israel “stops its aggression,” it would be possible to return to the ceasefire understanding of before. Even with the ceasefire, Gazans still live in unfair and inhumane conditions.
On November 14, an agreement was reached between the Palestinian and Israeli governments with the help of the deal brokered by Egyptian officials. Egypt has also been engaged in blockades against Gaza, restricting movement at the border between Egypt and Palestine. This deal, which was agreed upon in order to avoid the possibility of war, has reportedly already decreased violence in the region. The possibility of peace seemed to be in jeopardy after Israel’s covert mission, but Haniyeh has stated that “[Hamas] will respect this declaration as long as the Zionist enemy respects it.” Yahya Sinwar, another leader of Hamas, has said that he would also like to avoid war. “Through war, we achieve nothing,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also wishes to avoid war, as evidenced by his agreement to the deal. Gideon Levy, an editor at Al Jazeera, commented that while “both parties are not interested in war, [neither are] doing enough to prevent one.”
UK and EU Reach Deal
British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a Brexit deal this past Tuesday November 13, calling an emergency Cabinet meeting. Since the 2016 referendum, where over 50 per cent of UK citizens voted in favour of leaving the EU, there have been extensive deliberations on how Britain can and should exit the European Union.
May’s deal includes details of the 21-month withdrawal and transition period, the new rights and commitments of EU and UK citizens, as well as the the sum of money to be paid to the EU. On November 14, the deal was approved by Cabinet, but not without opposition. Since an agreement was reached, two Cabinet ministers and numerous junior ministers have resigned, and Prime Minister May has received several letters of non-confidence. If May is presented with 48 letters, a vote to oust her as leader and Prime-Minister could be held.
The deal will be up for EU approval at the emergency summit to be held on November 25. If passed, the current deal will be voted on within the UK Parliament. If Parliament does not back the deal, the government has 21 days to produce a new deal, or face following re-negotiations, or even hold a general election. If Parliament votes in favour of the deal, the EU will produce an official Withdrawal Bill which will have to go through a number of stages of approval at the EU ahead of the withdrawal, which will occur on March 29 2019.

Conflict in Cameroon Escalates 
Dozens have been killed in Cameroon this past week as fighting increases between Cameroon militia and separatist rebels. The increase in casualties on both sides follows the October re-election of President Paul Biya for a seventh term. Biya is the oldest leader in sub-Saharan Africa; he has ruled Cameroon for almost 40 years.
The conflict stems from a divide in the predominantly French-speaking nation between Anglophone separatists and government forces. The then-German protectorate of Kamerun was split between France and England by the League of Nations in 1919, causing the current language divide. Following a referendum in 1972, French and English speaking territories came together to form the United Republic of Cameroon.
Separatist rebels seek the creation of an independent, English-speaking state called “Ambazonia.” Separatists have targeted English-speaking areas that conform to the Cameroonian national identity, including kidnappings and violence in Western Cameroon. However, it is often unclear who is behind the violence. To stifle the rebels, army forces have actively killed, kidnapped, and targeted villages. Strict and enforced curfews have been imposed in English-speaking zones to limit separatist activities after dark. Reports indicate that more than half of the English-speaking city of Bamenda have fled their homes, with schools closing, and roads remaining unsafe. The crisis has forced civilians to flee Anglophone regions for French-speaking ones, or to neighbouring Nigeria.

2019-02-03,McGill,Israel,"Arts Undergraduate Society Council Votes on Summer Course in Israel
On Wednesday, January 30, approximately 30 members of the McGill community attended the AUS biweekly Legislative Council. This spike in attendance was spurred by the proposed creation of POLI 339, a summer course to take place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The meeting lasted from 6 pm until around 9 pm. The majority of the meeting was spent discussing POLI 339. A motion was scheduled to approve the participant fee of $1,000 associated with the course. 
Those in favour of the course, by and large, argued that the course was an “academic opportunity.” Some argued that this “exclusively procedural” vote was being turned into a “proxy vote” for debates concerning Palestine. It was argued that voting against this fee would be hypocritical since the AUS Legislative Council had voted in favour of a course to take place in Italy. 
Those opposed to POLI 339 reasoned that the motion was political; by approving the fee, AUS would be endorsing the course, they argued. They maintained it was wrong to endorse POLI 339 because Israel participates in ongoing settler-colonialism through its occupation of Palestine. Many opponents said the vote was not a proxy vote; rather, it was about students of all backgrounds being able to access the course. Opponents argued that students holding certain passports, students of Palestinian descent, and/or students involved in pro-Palestinian activism could be detained at the Israeli border, as in the case of American student Lara Alqasem who was detained for two weeks in an Israeli border detention facility. Endorsing such a course would create unequal opportunities for McGill students based on nationality, race, ethnicity, and political opinion, according to the dissenters of POLI 339.
Endorsing such a course would create unequal opportunities for McGill students based on nationality, race, ethnicity, and political opinion, according to the dissenters of POLI 339.
In a statement following the vote, McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) has alleged that “many students who spoke against this program [were poorly treated].” Students who spoke against the motion were allegedly filmed by other members of the gallery. Additionally, a representative from World Islamic & Middle Eastern Studies Student Association’s (WIMESSA) point of personal privilege was repeatedly and harshly dismissed by the speaker. The point of personal privilege was about the emotional discomfort of Palestinian students at the candid discussion of villages from which their families were expelled. According to Robert’s Rules of Orders, which govern AUS Legislative Council meetings, points of personal privilege relate to matters that may affect an individual’s comfort or safety. A number of other points of personal privilege were addressed before the representative to WIMESSA’s point was rejected.
The Legislative Council voted for a confidential vote. All gallery members were asked to leave and representatives voted on ballots rather than by raising their placards. 
According to anonymous sources, the vote was 13 for, 14 against, and four abstentions. After the vote, the rest of the agenda was tabled to the next meeting. 
SPHR hailed the vote as a “victory,” while supporters of the motion were heard discussing ways to bring the motion to higher governing bodies.

2019-02-17,McGill,Israel,"On January 30, during AUS’ biweekly Legislative Council, members discussed POLI 339. POLI 339 is a proposed summer course for McGill students that would take place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As mandated by provincial law, any course with additional fees must be approved by a student body. The $1000 fee for POLI 339, to be paid by each student in the course, was subject to lengthy debate. Those in favour argued that it was an “academic opportunity,” while those opposed argued that this “academic opportunity” discriminated against Palestinian students, Arab students, and students who oppose the Israeli occupation of Palestine, as they could be denied entry at the border and detained by Israeli officials. Ultimately, in a confidential vote, 14 AUS representatives voted against the course, 13 voted in favour, and nine abstained.
On February 12, AUS issued a statement via email claiming that “necessary information” was not provided or present at the council meeting of January 30. Due to the “time-sensitive” deadline for the course approval, “the decision was brought to the Executive Committee [Exec]” rather than back to council. The Exec voted in favour of the course by a slim majority. According to anonymous sources, four members of the Exec voted to overturn Legislative Council’s vote, two against, and four abstained. Arts Representatives also participated in this vote on the basis that they are paid as though they are Executives, a depart from standard procedure. Senators are also paid as though they are Executives, but they did not have a vote.
From comments made at the February 14 AUS Legislative Council, it seemed that the Arts Representatives all voted to overturn the original decision.  Sources suggest that former VP Internal Billy Kawasaki also voted in favour of overturning the Legislative Council vote. He has since resigned. At Legislative Council on February 14, AUS President Maria Thomas suggested that he resigned after feeling pressured to vote a certain way. 
The internal proceedings of the Executive vote are unclear, as they happened last minute via Facebook and Slack. Executives gave contradictory reports of their conversations when questioned during the February 14 Council meeting . While there was debate over the constitutionality of publishing Slack and Facebook communications as though they were minutes, the discussion was inconclusive. 
It was implied that Arts Representative Andrew Figueiredo, the initial motioner of POLI 339, put pressure on the Exec to overturn Legislative Council’s vote. Figueiredo admitted to having sent a member of the Exec messages asking, “is there anything I can do to get you to vote yes?” He was asked if he intended to resign by Bee Khaleeli, a member of the gallery. He said he was not.
The Secretary General, a neutral third-party observer charged with maintaining the accountability of AUS, has launched an investigation into how the Exec handled the situation. As a result, the Exec’s vote has been suspended. At Legislative Council, AUS President Maria Thomas said that the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning (DPSLL)) had said that they would cease action if SSMU agreed. SSMU President Tre Mansdoerfer stated that SSMU would take measures to stop action based on the Exec’s vote in favour of POLI 339 as long as the DPSLL agreed. Neither SSMU nor the DPSLL has yet confirmed that they are halting action taken by the AUS Exec.
On Saturday, AUS posted a statement from the Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General on their Facebook page. The statement said that the Secretary General had been receiving information requests regarding the Exec’s vote and related Facebook chats. They went on to say that Facebook messages are not confidential according to AUS’ constitution. At Legislative Council, some said that the vote was confidential, while others said they were not aware of any such decision. According to the statement, the Secretary General concluded that the Exec did not conduct such a vote, and thus the meeting notes “are deemed public.”
According to various sources, there is mounting pressure on AUS to release screenshots of Facebook messages and Slack conversations related to the vote. The Secretary General’s statement suggests that there is no constitutional basis to not do so.

2019-04-13,McGill,Israel,"“Occupation is a Crime; Cancel POLI 339”
On Wednesday, April 10 at around 1:30 PM, students staged a sit-in at the James Administration Building, protesting McGill’s decision to offer POLI 339. The political science course is slated to take place this summer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose Mount Scopus campus is situated on illegally-obtained Palestinian land in East Jerusalem and is in violation of international law, as per Resolution 446 of the UN Security Council. The demonstration came after a related petition was published and circulated online. At the time of this article’s publication, the petition had 359 student signatures and 14 signatures from professors. Both the petition and the protest on Wednesday outlined the ways in which McGill University has violated student democracy, is putting students at risk, and is actively “ignoring the ethical and violent ramifications of its decisions to operate, fund and promote numerous exchanges with Israeli institutions.”
The Sit-In
Shortly after the demonstration began, Interim Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Fabrice Labeau came to address the protesters. He told students that he had not read the email that had been sent to him regarding the demands of the petition, and mentioned official procedure a number of times to state why the course could not be cancelled. In an earlier account provided by the petition, it is stated that “Fabrice Labeau claimed there was no precedent for reversing a course fee approval.” (It is relevant to note that courses have been cancelled at McGill for various reasons before, and that there are channels to do so within official procedure.) The approval that Interim Deputy Provost Labeau referred to was deemed invalid by the Secretary-General of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS). Protesters then stated to Interim Deputy Provost Labeau, as well as Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) Christopher Manfredi, that if they had not read their email, it was evident the administration ultimately did not care about student concerns or democracy.
The protesters then began chants, such as “Israel is an apartheid state; 339 discriminates,” “occupation is a crime; cancel POLI 339,” “are we mad, yes you bet; Suzi can you hear us yet?” and “occupation isn’t funny; students over donor money.” The sit-in blocked the front door to the James Administration Building, causing administrators to have to use an alternate entrance. At this entrance, protesters simulated Israeli checkpoints to show administrators the discrimination and harassment Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim students would face at the Israeli border if they enrolled in POLI 339. This detainment and harassment at the Israeli border is well-documented, with numerous cases of activists being detained, as well as marginalized folks without a history of activism. In some instances, these concerns continue even after initially being granted entrance into the country.
As of now, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), Omar Shakir, is in the process of appealing the decision of the Israeli government to revoke his work permit and expel him from Israel. Shakir had previously been denied a work permit in 2016, but was eventually granted one two months later following international criticism. However, the government has used legislation passed in 2017 (the same legislation often used to deny activists entry into Israel) to provide a reason for his expulsion, accusing Shakir of promoting boycotts against the state. Throughout his tenure, Shakir has only promoted the official stance of HRW – “that businesses should halt their activities in illegal West Bank settlements” because they violate Palestinian human rights. Prior to the shutting down of the US consulate in Jerusalem and subsequently its website, the official consulate website stated that people who appear of “Arab, Middle Eastern, or Muslim origin […] may face additional, often time-consuming, and probing questioning by immigration and border authorities, or may even be denied entry into Israel or the West Bank.”
In addition to the sit-in, protesters handed out flyers to passersby, detailing the discriminatory treatment marginalized students would face at the border, the illegal occupation of Palestinian land by the Mount Scopus campus, and the donors to this course: the Gerald Schwartz & Heather Reisman Foundation, “[who] have funded scholarships for non-Israelis who enlist in the [Israeli] military.” The petition then argues that “[POLI 339] is therefore intellectually dishonest, because the source of its funding is strongly tied to the violent Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territories”. This has been described in detail by Amnesty International.
While a few people attempted to break through the protesters’ sit-in and disturb them, the students maintained their ground, and the demonstration continued. The protest went on until 5:30 PM, at which point the group disbanded.
Student Concerns
One student emphasized her concerns with the course, stating, “Israel has a well-documented history of discriminating against people of colour. [Incoming travellers have repeatedly] been detained for long hours [and] interrogated.” She went on to say, “this is McGill putting their students’ […] safety at risk. We had the student democratic results for the AUS council show that we didn’t want to fund this course, but McGill [is] still going to promote and fund the course.”
Another student echoed these concerns, saying, “[we] also need to talk about the professors who will be teaching this course: Professor Richard Schultz and Professor Harold Waller. They’re in their last years of teaching at McGill, […] and if you look through what happened in the AUS apology email and all of the information they gave us, you see an email Harold Waller sent to Maria Thomas, who’s the president of AUS, and it’s very pressuring. She even says explicitly [that she] felt pressured by that email.” The student then asked, “how did they know about these FIO [Frais Institutionnels Obligatoires (mandatory fees)] by-laws? […] On top of the fact that this is complicity in ethnic cleansing and occupation, […] you have these professors who are trying to get this to happen in ways that are not democratic and not facing any repercussions for that.”
There were also specific concerns relating to Professor Waller, with one student stating, “in his course on Israel, he has never once mentioned Palestine, which you can see on the syllabus. […] How can you teach a course on domestic Israeli politics if you don’t mention Palestine? I think that’s really key – the issue is that these professors don’t have good intentions to begin with; they’re trying to game the system, and that’s a problem.” The course in question taught by Professor Waller, POLI 437 (Politics in Israel) – as of the Fall 2017 syllabus – has a lecture on minority politics, referencing the Arab population in Israel, but not a specific lecture on Palestine.
Another activist spoke about McGill’s past and ongoing complicity in the occupation of Palestine and its continued silencing of student activists, stating, “student activists have been met with silence, co-opting of struggles, and active pushback. We refuse to continue to remain silent and inactive.”
The petition is still active and circulating, and it can be found here. Students ultimately hope to have the course cancelled, demanding “McGill University show that it values justice, international law, and its students’ safety as much as it values academic freedom by immediately cancelling this year’s POLI 339 summer course and thereby respecting the decision made by the student councillors of the AUS council.”

2019-09-30,McGill,Israel,"On September 17, 2019, Israel held snap elections to elect the 22nd Knesset, with Benjamin Netanyahu (Likud) and Benny Gantz (Blue and White) competing to form a coalition government. The vast majority of Palestinians were, as usual, deprived of the right to vote.
Netanyahu has been given 42 days to create a coalition government by negotiating with the other parties that form the Knesset. His last attempt, in April of 2019, was the first failure to form a coalition government in Israeli history. If he succeeds this time, Netanyahu will enter his fifth term, becoming Israel’s longest-reigning prime minister.
Netanyahu ran his campaign on violent colonial promises and racist, hypernationalist anti-Arab statements, including a promise to annex the Jordan Valley. In a segment for the BBC World News, human rights attorney and Jadaliyya co-editor Noura Erakat discussed this promise and the election as a whole. Erakat explained that there is “very little difference between [the two parties] except in rhetoric,” clarifying that the Blue and White claimed that “[Netanyahu] stole the idea [of annexation] from them.” Both parties in question are advancing further violence on Palestinians in the Jordan Valley, which is already under a de facto annexation, which stands in violation of international law.
The Joint List, an alliance of Arab-Israeli parties, was the third largest coalition in this election cycle – something Erakat finds encouraging. The Blue and White party is opposed to allying itself with the Joint List, directly due to Gantz’s refusal to align with non-Zionist parties. The head of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, expressed that he would be interested in working with the Blue and White only if they shared common direction, and stated that the Joint List is “not in his [Gantz’s] pocket. He will have to come to us.”
For Palestinians already living under a violent occupation, the election has no positive outcomes. The international community’s inaction in the face of illegal occupation is itself a violation of human rights. Responding to the threat of further, explicit annexation of the Jordan Valley, Erakat asks, “Why are we leaving it to an election and to an Israeli leader to decide what international law has already prohibited?”

2019-10-21,McGill,Israel,"SPHR Holds Its First General Meeting of the Year
Students gathered for the McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) general meeting on September 26. SPHR was founded in 1999, and has been intermittently active on campus since its inception. SPHR is a non-profit, student-based organization that advocates for Palestinian people’s rights, in defiance of human rights violations, discrimination, racism, misrepresentation, and misinformation. 
SPHR’s Internal Organization
SPHR follows a non-hierarchical structure with no formal positions, allowing members to have transient roles throughout the year.
One of the topics discussed in the general meeting was the introduction of three working groups. The first working group plans to focus on campaigning, political action, solidarity work, outreach to other on-campus social justice groups, and student mobilization to support the Palestinian cause. A second working group will be in charge of materials and journalism, in terms of making leaflets, pamphlets, writing articles, and maintaining social media presence. The final working group will organize events, such as movie screenings, workshops, cultural nights, and hummus sales, in addition to booking rooms and contacting guest speakers. Students will be allowed to take part in the organization’s activities with varying levels of commitment.
A new administrative board will also handle SSMU paperwork and communication with the Quebec Public Interest and Research Group (QPIRG). Regular internal meetings are to be held, where feedback is exchanged in order to reach “consensus-based agreements,” according to the general meeting’s conductor.
SPHR’s Presence on Campus
SPHR has been widely active on campus. In the 2015-16 academic year, it urged McGill to endorse the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, mainly focusing on boycotting and divesting from companies complicit in the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Motion Regarding Support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, put forth by the McGill BDS Action Network, was approved in the 2016 Winter General Assembly (GA) by secret ballot, with 512 votes for the motion, 357 opposed, and 14 abstentions. However, in the following online ratification process – which is unique to McGill’s procedures – the motion failed, with 53.3 per cent of students voting against it, 40.1 per cent in favour, and 6.6 per cent abstaining. There were 5,286 voters in total, which was 25.1 per cent of the electorate at the time.
Following the online ratification process in 2016, a petitioner “brought forward a reference question which [sought] to declare the BDS Motion, and similar motions, incompatible with SSMU’s by-laws, internal regulations, and legal structure more generally,” per a SSMU Judicial Board (JBoard) ruling on BDS. In 2017, BDS as a whole was then officially ruled problematic and unconstitutional by SSMU JBoard, preventing any BDS motion from being introduced by a student-run organization or endorsed by SSMU. After the JBoard rules on a case, it must be ratified by SSMU’s Board of Directors (BoD), where, in 2017, 11 out of 12 directors voted to ratify the JBoard’s decision. However, there were concerns from students that the process itself was unethical – at that time, only three SSMU executives were serving on the BoD, where four are required. Further, one legislative councillor noted that the SSMU President at the time of ratification, Muna Tojiboeva, seemed to have a conflict of interest. Tojiboeva sat on SSMU’s JBoard in 2016 when the petition was considered unconstitutional, and then voted to approve the JBoard’s ruling as a director on the BoD.
SPHR’s Presence On Campus in 2019
SPHR’s biggest campaign of 2019 was the campaign against POLI 339, which urged McGill to cancel an externally-funded, one-off exchange course with the Hebrew University in East Jerusalem about comparative Canadian and Israeli politics. The Hebrew University in East Jerusalem is on occupied Palestinian land and is in violation of international law as per Resolution 446 of the UN Security Council. SPHR members and non-members blocked and “occupied” the entrance of the James Administration building on the downtown campus and were met with hostility and ambivalence from the staff. According to one SPHR member, this campaign was a “wake-up call” to many McGill students about the struggle against Israeli colonialism and imperialism.
Community and Cultural Events
With regards to their work with other campus groups, SPHR has collaborated and worked with the Muslim Students’ Association, the McGill Syrian Students’ Association, the African Studies Students’ Association of McGill, and Independent Jewish Voices McGill – among other campus groups – to organize different events throughout the year, including a vigil for victims of the Christchurch massacre last year. During the general meeting, speakers stressed the importance of collaborating with other solidarity organizations on campus.
Cultural activities are an important aspect of SPHR’s presence on campus. According to one member, SPHR serves as a community to come back to, reflect on, and grow from. “I think that is one of its accomplishments that almost happens indirectly,” they said. “It gives you friends [and] a face to the global Palestinian rights movements that are also working with you.” Among their most popular cultural activities are homemade hummus sales, hosted in McConnell and Leacock and famous for selling out in less than a couple of hours. Along with traditionally-Palestinian hummus, students also distribute leaflets about the organization’s mission at these sales. They remind students that Palestinian existence is more than a mere political struggle and that they have deep-rooted traditions and culture, all the while “promot[ing] and protect[ing] Palestinian human rights, both locally and internationally.” 
Education and Safety with SPHR
SPHR also hosts and conducts educational workshops about a wide range of topics, including – but not limited to – the ongoing political situation in Palestine, Palestinian citizens living in Israel, ethnic cleansing, colonialism, and imperialism. They also provide workshops on pink– and green-washing tactics in Israel, as well as strategies the Israeli government uses to deny entry to activists.
Cybersecurity workshops are also hosted to emphasize the importance of maintaining anonymity as student activists. SPHR members consider anonymity to be of paramount significance. In recent years, Israeli border authorities have been relying on a blacklist website that exposes pro-Palestine and BDS activists’ full names and pictures as a means of denying entry. Students and professors are included on this website, and finding one’s picture and full name on a blacklist website through a simple Google search is harmful for school, university, or job applications, and especially dangerous for Palestinian citizens living in Palestine or visiting family. To that end, anonymity is always embedded into any event, action, and political campaign.
This Year’s Goals 
The general meeting concluded with a summary of SPHR’s goals for the coming academic year, which include organizing more direct action on campus, maintaining an active social media presence, and increasing production of leaflets, pamphlets, and banners regarding the ongoing situation in Palestine.
Students of all backgrounds can get involved with SPHR without becoming official members of the organization, or they can join the organization’s working and administrative groups. SPHR also maintains a social media presence on Facebook and Instagram, where constant political updates are posted and public events are announced. This month, SPHR will be hosting a Palestine 101 workshop on October 10, a movie night by a Palestinian filmmaker on October 11, and a workshop about pinkwashing on October 18 in collaboration with Queer History Month.
Correction: The print version of the article stated that the movie night would take place on October 17, but it was rescheduled for October 11. The Daily regrets this error.

2019-10-21,McGill,Israel,"SPHR Holds Workshop for Queer History Month



Content warning: colonial violence, homophobia, transphobia, anti-LGBTQ+ violence

On October 18, McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) held a workshop on “pinkwashing”: the hijacking of LGBTQ+ rights and struggles for a specific political agenda, namely one which reinforces oppressive systems.

Continue or go back to the main page
The workshop, sponsored by McGill as a part of Queer History Month, included a presentation, followed by an open discussion, during which attendees were free to ask questions and reflect on their experiences as well as the information presented.
After an overview of the term “pinkwashing,” the workshop moved into examples of its use in Israeli propaganda, emphasizing the way Israel distinguishes itself from surrounding countries. The 2017 promotional video for Tel Aviv Pride was shown as an example. The video advertises a very sanitized, party-like atmosphere, presenting the event (and, by extension, the city and country) as an appealing and cosmopolitan tourist destination, rather than a political protest for LGBTQ+ rights. This strategy works to improve Israel’s image and strengthen the perception of Israeli social rights – despite the fact that Israel still allows conversion therapy, and that there is only one doctor in the country who is allowed to perform gender-affirming surgeries (and even then, only after approval by a committee).
The presenters then deconstructed the dominant narrative that Israel is the only “Westernized,” democratic country in the Middle East. By aligning itself with “American” (and “Western”) values and by opposing itself to Muslim-majority surrounding countries, Israel casts its neighbors as the “other,” and presents itself as uniformly progressive. This, they added, is a common narrative passed down from the rhetoric of colonial-era scholars that depicts Muslim and Arab communities as “backwards,” which provides “legitimacy” for Western interference and imperialism. Further, as the presenters explained, this progressiveness is used as a shield from outside criticism: often, critiques of Israel’s human rights abuses are met with questions about social issues (LGBTQ+ rights, in this context) in neighboring countries. This “whataboutism” – redirecting the focus from one issue to another – helps to distract from the real problems at hand.
During the discussion period, one attendee asked if the presentation was denying that Israel is progressive on certain social issues. The presenters clarified that, while Israel is in some ways accepting, it is most important to recognize the ways that Israel takes advantage of its “progressive” appearance to advance its political goals and provide cover for its human rights abuses. They provided the example of Israel’s explicit acceptance of queer soldiers in its military: this leads to the idea of a “progressive” – or justifiable – military, ignoring the reality that those who refuse to serve in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) are jailed, and ignoring the numerous documented human rights abuses committed by the IDF.
Especially during Queer History Month, spreading understanding of pinkwashing is crucial, both in the context of the Middle East and globally. During the discussion period, this question was raised: “What can we do now, and from a distance?” The presenters emphasized the importance of raising awareness of this issue in North America and of challenging both external assumptions and internalized prejudices. They also expressed that pinkwashing is not specific to Israel, and it exists – and can be addressed – in Canada and the US as well.
Beyond its purely educational aspects, the workshop opened the floor for personal questions and conversations that could otherwise be difficult. Several attendees shared their perspectives on how pinkwashing, and institutionalized anti-Arab sentiment, has appeared in and affected their lives.
In the coming months, SPHR plans to host a workshop on “greenwashing” – environmental progressiveness as a political tool.

2019-11-19,McGill,Israel,"Last 15 Minutes of Council Reserved for Discussion
AUS held its sixth Legislative Council of the year on Wednesday, November 13. On the agenda were a number of motions to change the design of departmental logos, as well as a presentation from the Associate of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (AGSEM).
The presentation informed AUS councillors about the ongoing unionization drive (which is open to graders, markers, tutors, note-takers, and “any non-unionized academic casual job on campus”) and to ask AUS for their support. Per AGSEM’s presentation, notetakers at McGill have seen their compensation per semester decrease from $425 in Winter 2017 to $0 in Fall 2019, and non-unionized teaching support staff at McGill receive substantially lower wages than their unionized counterparts.
A large portion of the meeting was also spent discussing the results of the AUS Accountability Survey. The survey closed on November 9, and the AUS Secretary General noted that turnout was low – only around 22 people had taken it out of the approximately 200 people eligible (Arts departmental executives and members of Council).
In particular, specific concerns were raised about Arts Representative Shreya Dandamudi, who addressed those comments (“Doesn’t write reports, not taking initiative to do her own projects, tends to leave early for no reason”) by stating that they were factually inaccurate, and by sharing the projects she has worked on this semester. With regards to the comment made about Dandamudi that she “does not care about students or represent them well,” she responded by saying, “I’d ask you to be constructive in your feedback” and to “check your biases.”
Concerns were also raised in the survey about VP Finance Stefan Suvajac, including comments such as “not showing up for office hours, unprofessional and generally unknowledgeable about different departmental associations.” In response, Suvajac stated that he was sorry about missing some office hours in October and that he couldn’t “speak to concerns about knowledgeability,” but that he responds to most emails within 48 hours. Lastly, the survey raised concerns about VP Services Haidee Pangilinan. In response, she stated that while she had been out of the province due to a family emergency, she had put an automatic response on her email informing incoming messages of her absence, and that she had asked other executives to check her email.
Only at 8:45 p.m., with just 15 minutes left of Council, did councillors have the opportunity to enter moderated debate on the reason that many gallery members attended the meeting in the first place – the participation of a number of AUS councillors in an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel, news of which had been published in The McGill Daily that same day.
The trip, slated to take place over winter break, is paid for by Hillel Montreal. More than 40 other trips sponsored by Hillel chapters across North America have been funded by Maccabee Task Force (MFT), an anti-BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) organization that states on their website that “students are more likely to work against BDS activities, protests and resolutions on campus” after returning from these free trips. As the Daily article, co-authored by Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and Independent Jewish Voices, notes, MTF expanded to Canada last year, the same year that Hillel Montreal began offering these trips to student leaders at McGill, making it “reasonable to suspect that MTF is providing much, if not all, of the funding for Hillel Montreal’s initiative.”
The generative discussion began with statements by the three (known) AUS councillors who plan on attending the trip – VP Finance Stefan Suvajac, Representative Adin Chan, and Representative Andrew Chase, who emphasized the “personal nature” of the trip. A full list of questions from concerned AUS councillors was then projected on the screen. Religious Studies Undergraduate Society (RSUS) Representative Mo Rajji read aloud the questions, the first being “Are you aware of the organization funding this trip, being the Maccabee Task Force, and their explicitly anti-BDS goals in promoting trips to visit to Israel, and do you think that this presents a problem?” As there were only nine minutes left in Council, the entire list of questions was uploaded to the Facebook group for further discussion.
“I understand that many of you consider this to be personal […] but a lot of us here don’t see this as being entirely personal, and it should’ve been in your reports, we believe, regardless of how you view this,” Rajji stated. In addition, the RSUS representative added that “I know for a fact that there are other students in this room who were offered this trip.”
The placement of this discussion at the end of the meeting was decided before the meeting began by AUS Council Speaker Marie Fester and the AUS Executives – including VP Finance Suvajac, Representative Chan, and Representative Chase, who plan to attend the trip and who other councillors had concerns about that were not addressed (due to the lack of time at the end of the meeting). In an email to the Daily, Fester stated that “next meeting, [she] plan[s] on putting the discussion time earlier in the meeting, before reports and maybe before motions.”

2020-01-13,McGill,Israel,"On November 14, the SSMU Legislative Council convened for their second-to-last session of the fall semester. On the agenda were a number of motions, but also a number of recent controversies and concerns that had arisen over the prior two weeks. In addition, there were presentations by Lester Asset Management, the Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill (who came to announce their unionization drive), FL Fuller Landau LLP, and the McGill Scarlet Key Society.
Motions
Regarding motions, the Motion Regarding Amendments to the Committee Terms of Referencepassed unanimously, and the Motion concernant la Loi resserrant l’encadrement du cannabis passed, with two No votes (Councillors Andrew Chase and Evelyn Silverson-Tokawtlidis) and two abstentions (Councillors Kevin Franceschini and Beatrice Courchesne-Mackie). The latter motion, presented by Councillor André Lametti, mandates SSMU to oppose the recent changes passed by the provincial government on November 1 – raising the minimum legal age of cannabis consumption to 21 years and prohibiting the use of cannabis in any public space (outdoors or indoors).
The Motion Regarding Suspension of the Management Representatives, which arose due to the representatives’ failure to attend mandatory sexual and gendered violence training, also passed unanimously. Finally, there were two notices of motions, namely the Notice of Motion Regarding Adoption of the Climate Justice Policy, and the Notice of Motion Regarding Changes to the Internal Regulations of the Society’s Finances.
Question Period
Of particular note was the discussion that took place during question period, which covered a few controversial topics that had been brought to Council’s attention. During this time, Councillor Lametti asked what the SSMU listserv review process was, in light of the recent incident regarding the November 11 listserv, in which VP Internal Sanchi Bhalla was criticized for not having acknowledged Remembrance Day. In addition, Councillor Lametti asked why the VP Internal was not a signatory on the recent SSMU statement on Indigenous allyship, to which it was announced that Bhalla would be putting out a separate statement on the matter.
Councillor Jo Roy also asked about the status of the SSMU mini-courses, to which VP Student Life Billy Kawasaki stated that they were still being organized.
Councillor Bruno Marcoux brought up concerns over the use of profanity in a Facebook post from VP University Affairs Madeline Wilson condemning anti-Indigenous racism amongst the student body. In response to these concerns, Wilson responded that “I tend to use it […] specifically with regards to issues or topics I feel quite strongly about and that I feel deserve strong language, such as explicit racism directed at individuals, which is the reason I chose to use profanity in those communications.” Councillor Roy also pointed out that the debate over language amounted to tone policing, in addition to throwing support behind the VP University Affairs on the issue.Concerns about Free Trips Offered by Hillel
Finally, councillors discussed the recent offers of free trips to Israel from Hillel Montreal, given to a number of campus leaders – news of which was published in the Daily earlier that week. A number of SSMU staff – including Andrew Chase (Arts Representative), Adin Chan (Arts Representative and SSMU Director), Paige Collins (SSMU Director), Jonah Levitt (SSMU Director), and Jordyn Wright (Science Representative and SSMU Director) – all planned to attend the free trip at the time of Legislative Council. (As noted in The Bull and Bear, Councillor Chan has since declined the offer.) During the discussion there were concerns over both whether this represented a potential conflict of interest, as well as whether it would be possible to go on this trip as an individual completely independent of one’s office.
The feature, co-authored by McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) and McGill Students’ Chapter of Independent Jewish Voices (IJV), noted the expansion of Maccabee Task Force – an overt anti-BDS organization (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement) – to Canada in 2018. “Given that the first trip of this kind was allegedly offered by Hillel Montreal in the same year (2018), it is reasonable to suspect that MTF is providing much, if not all, of the funding for Hillel Montreal’s initiative,” SPHR and IJV wrote in the Daily. In response to these concerns, Councillors Chan and Chase read statements to why they felt this would not violate conflict of interest, as did Councillor Wright.
Following their statements, Wilson addressed Council, saying, “do not think it is possible to separate your position as arts representative, or whatever your position may be, from your personal interest in this trip. Whether you are compliant with the conflict of interest policy of not, I do not think is relevant in this case.” These sentiments were further echoed by VP External Adam Gwiazda-Amsel, Councillor Noah Meralli, and Councillor Jo Roy in separate statements.
Additionally, Councillor Lametti brought up concerns that “we have two different stories, one saying that members of council received these offers on a personal basis, and one saying they received it on the basis of the position they hold.”
“To me,” Lametti continued, “if it is the case that if they did indeed [receive] it based on the position they hold, this may or may not constitute a conflict of interest. I don’t think councillors should be receiving monetary gifts of a significant value based on their position.”

2020-02-18,McGill,Israel,"Candidates Talk Controversial Campus Issues
The Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) held its annual candidates’ debate on Thursday, February 13 at 6 p.m. in Leacock 232. With only a few students in the audience – and an unfilled slate of candidates – the debate finished promptly at 7:55 p.m.
The positions of AUS President and VP Services are uncontested, with Ananya Nair and Samad Fagbohun running, respectively. Two candidates are campaigning for VP Social – Belanna Gans and CJ Pospisil. For the position of VP Academic, there are three candidates – Catherina Musa, Rachel Lawal, and Avni Aghi. There are two open positions for Arts Senator, and two people running – Mary Lynne Loftus and Darshan Daryanani. As for Arts Representative to SSMU, there are three open positions and four people running – Paige Collins, Chip Smith, Jonah Fried, and Alex Karasick. (All available campaign platforms have been linked here.)
No candidates are running for the positions of VP Communications, VP External, VP Finance, and VP Internal. According to an email received by the Daily, these positions will be appointed by the AUS Executive Council at a later date.
To begin the debate, each candidate had two minutes to give their opening statement. They then answered questions from the incumbent and the audience, as well as those submitted via an online form. The candidates were then given one and a half minutes to make their closing arguments.
Questions for Arts Representative candidates were a substantial part of the debate. Due to the nature of the position and its close relationship to SSMU and its Legislative Council – as well as a history of controversy surrounding various Arts Representatives’ decisions and policies – the candidates received a great number of questions regarding how they would handle such controversial topics on campus.
When asked about this, candidate Fried stated, “the [AUS] is a diverse constituency with different ethnic, national populations, and I think there are a lot of international, geopolitical issues that come into play on campus that really have no place […] I think the issues we focus on should be student issues.” The issues Fried is highlighting in his platform include advocacy for student housing; he currently sits on the SSMU Housing Committee.
Other candidates echoed similar sentiments. In a question directly related to the role that Arts Representatives have had in recent years in issues related to the Israeli-Palistinian conflict on campus, candidate Smith stated, “If I’m elected as an Arts Rep, I’m ready to put my biases aside, to hear the arguments from both sides […] I’m not going to let my biases and my own personal beliefs get ahead of me in this scenario.” Smith’s platform stresses “changing the culture” in SSMU, “reduc[ing] drama and discontent.”
Karasick emphasized hearing from constituents in matters like this. “The most important thing, in my opinion […] is that we need to listen to constituents,” Karasick stated. “I want to listen to everyone’s opinion, [to get] most of the constituents I can to tell me what they believe, [to] tell me what they think should be done about an issue like this.” His platform highlights a list of initiatives for addressing equity and governance reforms at SSMU.
As for Collins, she suggested a press-conference-style hearing for students to voice their concerns – a suggestion that Collins recalled came from SSMU VP External Gwiazda-Amsel last November. “That way, academics and experts and representatives from either side of this debate are able to speak, and students are able to go and understand some of these issues,” she stated. “I think that that kind of formal channel would work really well.”
Collins is one of a number of student leaders who, last November, accepted an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel potentially funded by the Maccabee Task Force – an organization founded by conservative billionaire Sheldon Adelson. The case was taken to SSMU Legislative Council but deemed not an apparent conflict of interest by the Board of Directors, of which Collins is a member. Collins’ platform includes advocacy for paid note-takers and accomodations, as well as “establishing a working group to pursue an implementation of a co-op program” for Arts students.

2020-02-26,McGill,Israel,"IJV, SPHR, and Suzanne Weiss Call for Open Discussion on Campus
Ahead of Suzanne Weiss’ talk at Concordia, members of SPHR and IJV, as well as Weiss herself, gathered outside of the James Administration building on Monday, February 17, to call for open and free discussion of Israel-Palestine on McGill campus. Surrounded by students holding a banner that read “STAND AGAINST OPPRESSION – STAND FOR JUSTICE IN PALESTINE,” Weiss read aloud a letter addressed to Deputy Provost of Student Life and Learning Fabrice Labeau. Her speech referenced Labeau’s letter to the McGill community on December 2, 2019, and raised concerns with the “irresponsible accusations of antisemitism” following the campus debate regarding free propaganda trips to Israel. “I find no evidence of antisemitism here. What I see is a passionate debate on the politics of Israel-Palestine,” Weiss said, voicing her “alarm” with the “unfounded charges of antisemitism.” Weiss added that the suppression of these discussions “put[s] Jewish people at risk by weakening our ability to focus on genuine acts of antisemitism,” and leaves Palestinians to “face an implacable attempt to silence them entirely.” 
Organizers with both IJV and SPHR also denounced the administration’s “attempts to stifle student activists” on campus. Speaking to the debate around the free trips, they criticized Labeau’s presentation of Jewish students as a “monolith” and his “conflation of anti-Zionism as antisemitism,” highlighting Labeau’s call for “ensuring respectful debate on campus.” Both spoke to the common ground that Palestinians and Canadian Indigenous peoples share in their “vibrant fights against settler-colonialism,” emphasizing the need for solidarity and the prevention of “willful ignorance” on campus.
After directing their words towards the James Administration building, members of SPHR and IJV presented Weiss with a keffiyeh from Palestine. Followed by both groups and attendants of the demonstration, Weiss entered the lobby to present Labeau with a physical copy of her letter. While the group waited, chants of “Solidarité avec la Palestine” continued. Eventually, Labeau’s secretary agreed to see Weiss, but only if the rest of the gathered students left the building and waited outside. Initially, security refused to let anyone besides Weiss remain in the building, and IJV and SPHR had to request multiple times that one person stay to assist her, as she is hard of hearing. Though Weiss was originally told she would be able to meet with Labeau in his office, she instead was met by his secretary and communications coordinator, and was not allowed past the lobby.
Weiss was successful in delivering the letter, and although she did not get to hand it to Labeau personally, she affirmed that she made her feelings clear to the administration. She exited the building back into the Community Square to cheers from the demonstrators. As the group dispersed, Weiss thanked the gathered students for attending, commending their efforts to fight for the rights of Palestinians and Indigenous peoples of Canada.

2020-02-26,McGill,Israel,"On February 18, Holocaust survivor and social activist Suzanne Weiss spoke at Concordia University about her life, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Islamophobia, and the climate crisis.
“Back in 1942, Adolf Hitler marked me down for death. I was only one year old. Why did Hitler want to kill me?’’ Weiss started her speech by recalling the first time her life was at risk. Born into a Jewish family in Paris in Nazi-occupied France, she answered the question herself: “Because he was a racist, a white supremacist.”
It took her several decades to find out how she was saved: “There was a civilian resistance which obstructed the Nazi rule and provided refuge for thousands of Jews, including me,” she told the attendees, adding, “It was also a multitude of individuals who helped [in various ways]. A multitude of small individual acts of courage and kindness forged a chain of solidarity across the country, which helped defeat the Nazis.” Her parents did not survive – Weiss’ mother was deported to Auschwitz, while her father died of war wounds, leaving her an orphan.
After the liberation of France, at age nine she was adopted by a Jewish American family in New York. Her stepfather had a narrow view of women, believing their destiny was to “find a mate, marry, and take care of [their] husband and household and their children.” She rejected this stereotype, and at age 17, she left home and took refuge with a girlfriend. Weiss recalled, “It was illegal for a girl of my age to leave home without permission. My parents had me arrested and charged my girlfriend’s mother for influencing me to be a lesbian!”
Weiss has recently published a memoir, Holocaust to Resistance, My Journey. Abigail B. Bakan, a professor of social justice education at the University of Toronto, has called it “a page-turning narrative about her remarkable life of survival, resistance and solidarity,” asking “everyone who wants to change the world” to read the book.
At the age of 17, Weiss became a social activist. She has engaged with the Black Power movement, the women’s liberation movement, the Labor Union Movement, and the Cuban Revolution. She also became an advocate for peace during the Vietnam War and a justice supporter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Weiss said “The mass movements of those years profoundly changed society. All the different movements were allied and had a collective impact. Today, we call it intersectionalism.”
The event was organized by the Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV), a grassroots organization grounded in Jewish tradition that opposes all forms of racism and advocates for justice and peace in Israel-Palestine. IJV has active branches at Concordia and McGill.
Weiss believes that Israeli Jewish people and Palestinians are both victims: “The victims of one great historic injustice, the Jews, themselves became the agents of an inflicting injustice on an indigenous innocent population, the Palestinians.” She added that Palestinians have found allies among Indigenous peoples of Canada, whose land was stolen through a similar process of colonialism. In Weiss’ words, “Palestinians and natives of Turtle Island, they have been both colonized and subjected to ethnic cleansing.”
Drawing a parallel with the apartheid regime in South Africa, Weiss reminded attendees how the racist system in South Africa collapsed: “a global boycott contributed to the non-violent outcome, an agreement seeking racial justice and reconciliation.” Similarly, she said, we need to achieve peace and justice in Palestine through nonviolent methods of persuasion, boycott, divestment, and sanctions, or BDS.
She expressed her deep concern about a new rise of antisemitism, a hatred of Jewish people, but she emphasized, “Antisemitism is not caused by Palestinians. Hatred of Jews is a form of racism, deeply rooted in European society and closely linked to white supremacy. We need to reject racism.”
Weiss noted the importance of defining antisemitism properly. On January 28, 2020, a motion to have Montreal adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism was withdrawn when Montreal mayor Valérie Plante proposed to further study the matter. Weiss summarized this as, “The city of Montreal was asked to officially state that antisemitism means undue criticism of Israel. The city council said no! Well done!” In contrast to the IHRA definition, IJV defines antisemitism as hostility, prejudice, or discrimination against Jewish people because they are Jewish people, stating that the vital battle against antisemitism is undermined whenever opposition to Israeli government policies is automatically branded as antisemitic.
Weiss emphasized the catastrophic risk of racism in view of the climate crisis, saying, “The victims of the climate crisis are mostly people of colour in the Global South. The racists have an answer: build walls, keep them out. If racism and climate barbarism triumph, they will infect and poison every aspect of our lives and destroy our world.” The phrase “climate barbarism” was coined by Canadian author, social activist, and filmmaker Naomi Klein, to refer to the combination of white supremacist violence and vicious anti-immigrant actions.
When asked about her view on Islamophobia, Weiss replied, “The Muslims helped us in France […] They gave us garments and all kinds of help. […] The move against the Muslims now in this society is part of white supremacy.” She stated that Muslims are being targeted just like Jewish people, people of colour and immigrants, arguing, it is important to unite against white supremacy rather than turning against each other.
IJV Canada will be co-hosting an event with SPHR McGill on February 25, where anti-occupation activist Zohar Chamberlain Regev will speak on her work with Freedom Flotilla Coalition and the 2020 Gaza Freedom Flotilla. IJV will also co-organize a movie and pizza night on February 26 at McGill, screening Junction 48, an award-winning movie about young Palestinians in the city of Lod.

2021-03-15,McGill,Israel,"Policy passed to the Board of Directors to be ratified
On Tuesday, February 16, SSMU held its Winter 2021 General Assembly. Remarkably, the GA reached its quorum of 350 people and, for part of the meeting, held official GA status, meaning that any votes during those portions of the meeting would be binding. The most time consuming topic of discussion was the Motion Regarding the Adoption of the Divest for Human Rights Policy, which was submitted by petition. The motion sought to “expand the SSMU’s commitment to leadership on matters of social justice and human rights by establishing” a campaign urging McGill to divest from companies “which enable and profit from multiple forms of systemic violence, including settler-colonial land theft, environmental destruction, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.” The corporations listed in the appendix of the motion are TC Energy Corporation (and therefore the Coastal GasLink Pipeline), Lockheed Martin, Re/Max, Oshkosh Corporation, Puma, Foot Locker, Nordstrom, and Kohl’s. 
The motion generated much discussion from attendees of the General Assembly, both in favour of and against its contents. Most controversial was the topic of divestment from Re/Max, which the motions states “sells real estate in illegal Israeli settlements on stolen Palestinian land, thereby facilitating and profiting from the transfer of Israeli settlers into occupied Palestinian territory by the Israeli government,” and Oshkosh Corporation, “whose vehicles are used to transport the soldiers and weapons of the Israeli military.” Discussion lasted for approximately two and half hours. Though the motion focused on military activity and the corporations’ operations on Palestinian land, much of the discussion centred concerns that a divestment campaign would lead to an increase in antisemitism on campus, due to a belief that the motion specifically targeted Israel. Multiple attendees, including VP University Affairs Brooklyn Frizzle, responded by explaining that the motion targeted specific corporations and not nations as a whole. 
The assembly moved to vote on the motion at approximately 9:00 p.m. EST. At this time, a number of participants left the GA, therefore causing the loss of quorum and turning the assembly into a consultative forum, meaning that votes would not be binding and the motion would have to be passed to the Legislative Council. Upon voting, the motion passed and was tabled to be discussed at the following week’s Legislative Council meeting. 
During the February 25 Legislative Council meeting, the motion was presented by VP External Ayo Ogunremi, who explained that the motion is intended to expand SSMU’s commitment to social justice and human rights by participating in divestment campaigns concerning several companies in which McGill is invested. He also noted that the “significant” amount of interest which students showed in the motion was important for SSMU representatives to consider while voting on the motion. 
Following Ogunremi’s introduction was a question period, which began with Management Representative Noah Gundermann asking movers of the motion to identify who they consulted in creating the motion. Maya Garfinkel, who moved the motion by petition, responded that the motion’s creators began their consultations by discussing with students, SSMU representatives, and student organizations such as Divest McGill and Climate Justice Action McGill (CJAM). Ogunremi added that the “Consultations Completed” section of the motion specifies that consultations were conducted with SSMU’s Governance Manager, President, and Communications Manager. He also stated that the motion had been reviewed and endorsed by SSMU’s Student Equity Committee.
Gundermann further questioned Ogunremi and Garfinkel, asking whether members of McGill administration or human rights experts had been consulted on the motion. According to Ogunremi, no McGill administrators were consulted, and though there was no “direct consultation” with human rights experts, sources and testimony from such experts are cited within the motion. Garfinkel claimed that there is precedent for approving similar policies despite a lack of consultation with McGill administration or human rights experts: the “Motion Regarding a Policy on Harmful Military Technology” had been passed at the Legislative Council just two weeks prior, without movers being questioned about such consultations, she pointed out. 
The debate period for the motion began with a pre-recorded statement from a student. The speaker asserted that the motion “creates a false and misleading parallel between the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict and human rights concerns worldwide.” They claimed that the other countries mentioned in the motion are “incomparable” to Israel, and characterized the “anti-Zionist elements” of the clauses concerning Israel as antisemitic. The student further argued that the motion was associated with the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement, making it a “fundamental violation of SSMU’s commitment to leadership in matters of human rights and social justice.” They speculated that the adoption of the motion would “jeopardize the safety and well-being of students,” claiming that Jewish students on campus saw an increase in antisemitism “following the many anti-Israel occurrences at McGill.”
Members of the Legislative Council expressed concern over the motion’s political content. Medical Representative Benson Wan explained that he felt the motion violated the Medical Student Society’s (MSS) Policy on General Council Positions and Press Releases, which holds that MSS representatives must survey members of the MSS via referendum or general assembly before taking political positions. Arts Representative Libby Williamson claimed that she had spoken to many constituents who felt that SSMU was neglecting student concerns by focusing on political issues. Additionally, Williamson characterized the motion as controversial, and claimed that divestment from Israel is unjustified: “the clauses that focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict attempt to create parallels between Israel and Palestine and other human rights concerns worldwide. [These parallels] do not exist and are harmful to imply.” Similarly, Dentistry Representative Tom Lee claimed that his constituents were largely opposed to the motion, on the grounds that it “disproportionately focuses on Israeli-Palestinian conflicts,” and may set a precedent for SSMU supporting the BDS movement. 
However, Frizzle claimed that they had never seen students with a higher level of engagement or interest than in the passage of this motion. “As democratic representatives, our mandate is clear: this is a policy represented by the membership […] I believe it is our responsibility as councillors not to be swayed by what I see as misinformation.” Likewise, Ogunremi described student interest in the motion as “extraordinary,” and said that SSMU executives have a responsibility to support marginalized communities from across the world. Member of the gallery Simone Bobrow expressed frustration with the claim that the motion was irrelevant to student concerns, saying that Palestinian students “have faced discrimination on campus as a result of [the Israel-Palestine] conflict.”
Councillor Gundermann also expressed opposition to the motion. He claimed that SSMU has no reason to divest from Lockheed-Martin – which the motion identifies as “the developer of weapons […] that has been used in violent conflicts in over 15 countries –” because the purchase of weapons should be “in the hands of governments.” He also took issue with divestment from the Oshkosh corporation, claiming that Oshkosh has been “internationally recognized as ethical,” and ultimately characterized the motion as “misleading and biased.” 
Supporters of the motion argued that it was not intended to perpetuate antisemitism or single out the state of Israel. Mover Noah Fisher said that the motion should not be interpreted as denouncing the state of Israel as a whole, as it only focuses on Re/max’s use of occupied Palestinian territory and not the entire state. “I find it insulting to suggest that the main way to oppose [antisemitism] is to fight individuals who are simply trying to end an occupation. I can guarantee that most of the instances of antisemitism that I’ve experienced, if not all of them, have not involved individuals trying to end an occupation,” he said, explaining that opposing human rights efforts would not help to combat antisemitism on campus. Similarly, Frizzle noted that the motion does not contain references to any individual nation, nor to Israeli corporations. Member of the gallery Ghida Malawi pointed out that the motion has no affiliation with BDS, and expressed frustration that councillors were conflating BDS with antisemitism. She also asked why councillors were claiming that Israel had been singled out, when human rights violations in other countries were also cited in the motion.
Garfinkel also spoke about her experiences with antisemitism: “As a Jewish student, the antisemitism that I’m concerned about is not coming from movements like [the motion and BDS].” She also said that “criticizing the occupation [of Palestine] is not the same as criticizing Israel’s right to exist.” She characterized some councillor’s treatments of the motion as insulting, and asked, “What claim for Palestinian human rights would this legislative council not take issue with?”
Clubs Representative Hussain Awan further expressed support for the motion, and said that he had been “dumbfounded” by some criticisms of the motion. He argued that portraying movers of the motion as “closeted BDS activists” was “wild speculation,” and further explained that he had seen much student interest in the many human rights issues addressed by the motion. 
After about one and a half hours of discussion, the motion was put to a vote. With 21 members in favor of the motion, 5 opposed, and 3 abstaining, the motion was passed.
A previous edition of this article erroneously stated that the policy had been adopted – in fact, the policy had not been adopted, but rather moved to the SSMU Board of Directors to be ratified. Additionally, the motion linked in the article was not the motion presented to Legislative Council, but rather an older version of the motion. The Daily regrets this error.

2021-11-15,McGill,Israel,"Despite the rain and cold on Friday, November 12, students and activists gathered at the Roddick Gates in a rally concluding BDS (Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions) Week, hosted by the McGill and Concordia chapters of Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR). Demonstrators spoke about the ongoing occupation of Palestine, chanting, “Free, free Palestine.”
Organizers from Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU) distributed pamphlets detailing the purpose of the BDS Movement. “Resist the systemic inequality and discrimination of Israel Apartheid,” the cover read, alongside the slogan “Boycottons Israël!” The BDS Movement aims to put financial pressure on corporations involved in the occupation of Palestine.
Sabine Friesinger, who was president of the Concordia Student Union when Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, was invited to speak at the university in 2001, attended the rally. “Public institutions should be held accountable for their [financial] ties, and if they have ties with apartheid regimes like Israel, they should cut those ties in solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she said.

2021-11-15,McGill,Israel,"From November 8 through November 13, Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill and SPHR Concordia hosted a series of events for Boycott, Divestments, and Sanctions (BDS) week. 
The week’s events started on Monday evening, with a screening and discussion of the film Grey, Black and Blue by Karam Abu Ali. The screening was held at J.A. de Sève Cinema at Concordia University. 
The following evening, organizers from SPHR McGill, SPHR Concordia, and Palestine Youth Movement led a “Palestine and BDS 101” workshop at Concordia University. Presenters organized the workshop into four sections: (1) defining concepts, (2) the region’s history, (3) contemporary oppression of Palestinian people, and (4) forms of resistance. Attendees were encouraged to ask questions, share ideas, and learn from one another. 
In defining concepts, presenters highlighted the importance of looking at Palestine through a conceptual framework. Specifically, they emphasized that individual atrocities must be examined as part of the larger system of settler colonialism, occupation, and apartheid. Presenters further outlined the importance of language in discussing Palestine – terms like “conflict” and “occupation” used in discussion fail to recognize the unequal distribution of power between Palestine and Israel. Describing Israel’s violence as an act of “ethnic cleansing” and “settler colonialism” is more appropriate, according to presenters. 
Presenters also discussed historical and contemporary definitions of “Zionism,” highlighting the ways in which the ideology is inextricably linked with settler colonialism. In the creation of Israel in the late 1940s, presenters said, evidence of imperialist efforts to select land show a clear intention to dislocate Arab people. They highlighted that this is in line with settler colonialism’s logic of elimination (via confrontation, carceration, and assimilation), which ultimately dispossesses Indigenous people of their lands. 
Presenters then dived into Palestine’s history, starting with the 1947 Partition Plan, which called for the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, and the 1948 Plan Dalet which outlined a plan for the ethnic cleansing of Arab people in the region. Nakba Day in 1948 was then discussed, the day that the state of Israel declared their so-called independence. The “nakba,” Arabic for catastrophe, refers to the consequent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the land and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages, as outlined by presenters. They pointed to a clear difference in the Israeli narrative vs. the Palestinian narrative that resulted from the state’s creation; the former frames the events as a civil war that resulted in independence, while the latter views the events as catastrophic nakba that resulted in ethnic cleansing. Discussion was also prompted by attendees concerning the importance of seeing Nakba not as a historical event, but recognizing that settler colonialism in Palestine is an ongoing process; the nakba continues to this day. The presenters then outlined the 1967 war between Israel and neighbouring states, the subsequent Intifadas, and the Oslo Accords. 
Next, presenters delved into the contemporary systems today used to stifle Palestinian voices and threaten their livelihood. Apartheid, which describes a system of racial dicrimination, is used in the state of Israel to deny Palestianians of many rights. Presenters highlighted the use of checkpoints, which impose control over Palestinian movement; settlements, through which Palestinians are violently expelled in favor of new development; the Separation Wall, which cuts through Palestinian communities; and incarceration, which targets specific individuals and systematically denies them of autonomy. 
Lastly, presenters outlined forms of resistance to the Israeli settler-state, primarily the BDS movement. Part of a long heritage of non-violent Palestinian resistance, the BDS movement is borrowed from the South African model of the ‘80s and ‘90s. Presenters also highlighted the importance of academic boycotts, which for students means boycotting university exchanges, relationships, and joint research with Israeli institutions. Next, McGill’s investment in the Israeli state was discussed, specifically its investment in RE/MAX and Oshkosh, its memorandum of understanding with Technion, and its exchange programs with four Israeli universities. Pro-Palestine activism at McGill is often met with resistance and roadblocks. Notably, last winter the proposed Motion Regarding the Adoption of the Divest for Human Rights Policy was very divisive within SSMU; many were reluctant to pass the motion, seeing as it outlined divestment from many companies profiting from Palestine’s occupation. In a legislative council meeting discussing the motion, it was implied that SSMU cannot support BDS as it is allegedly a “fundamental violation of SSMU’s commitment to leadership in matters of human rights and social justice.” After the presentation, attendees were invited to ask questions and participate in discussion. 
On Wednesday, organizers hosted an event at Abo hadi Restaurant. Attendees were invited to eat Palestinian food,  listen to Palestinian music,  dance, and socialize free of charge. The week concluded with the “Students Speak-out for Palestine” event; see page seven for coverage of this demonstration.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Separation Wall separated the East and West Bank. The article has been updated to be more accurate.

2022-04-04,McGill,Israel,"Canadian universities see “renewed momentum” in pro-Palestine activism
Over the past month, student unions at a handful of major Canadian universities have established pro-Palestine policies, often to the chagrin of university administrators. While such policies are passed in student-led, democratic forums, administrators at these universities have attempted to intervene in student affairs on the grounds that advocating for divestment from companies complicit in Israeli apartheid will lead to divisiveness and discrimination within university communities. In light of this, the Daily examined administrators’ responses to pro-Palestine policies recently passed in student unions at McGill, the University of Toronto (UofT), and the University of British Columbia (UBC).
The history of pro-Palestine policies within SSMU is a tumultuous one: in the Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA), a motion mandating SSMU’s support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement was passed in the initial round of voting, only to fail the subsequent online ratification process. Following the nullification of this motion, an anonymous student filed a Judicial Board (JBoard) petition inquiring into its constitutionality; in May of 2016, the JBoard came to the unanimous decision that “all motions which compel SSMU to actively campaign against specific countries are unconstitutional” – including motions in support of BDS. Despite this, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill has continued to campaign for divestment from corporations complicit in settler-colonial apartheid against Palestinians; the passage of the Palestine Solidarity Policy (PSP) in SSMU’s Winter 2022 Referendum was to be their latest victory.
The Policy had initially been absent from the referendum ballot following a notice from Elections SSMU that the JBoard issued an interim order prohibiting the PSP from being placed on the ballot “until such time a legal determination [could] be made,” per a March 13 email sent from Elections SSMU to Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR). The following afternoon, Elections SSMU issued a statement explaining that the referendum ballot was “declared faulty and incomplete” – when the ballot was re-issued on Tuesday, March 15, the PSP was present, and later passed with 71.1 per cent of votes in favour.
The PSP, which SPHR described as “historic,” outlines nine action items, including the mandates that: 1) SSMU campaign for McGill to condemn Canary Mission and other surveillance campaigns against Palestinian and pro-Palestine students; 2) SSMU boycott “corporations and institutions complicit in settler-colonial apartheid against Palestinians,” and advocate for McGill to do so as well; and 3) SSMU establish a Palestine Solidarity Committee. In their statement regarding the passage of the PSP, SPHR observed that “Time and time again, [Palestinian students’] activism has been met with censorship, blacklisting, and repression from an openly hostile McGill Administration” over the past two decades of pro-Palestine advocacy at McGill. 
As if on cue, the PSP was met with strong opposition from McGill Administration just three days later: on Thursday, March 24, Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau issued an email with the subject line “SSMU referendum outcome” via the Media Relations Office (MRO). Labeau expressed disappointment in the policy – which he said “calls for several actions that echo key tenets” of the BDS Movement, although the PSP makes no mention of BDS – referencing the recent development of the “Initiative to Prevent Anti-Semitism [sic] and Islamophobia.”  He continued that initiatives like the PSP “create excessive polarization in our community” and are “in contradiction with the principles expressed by SSMU in its own constitution.” The Daily asked the MRO whether Labeau had any student testimonials or data verifying the claim that the PSP would divide the McGill community; the university did not provide evidence substantiating this claim. In response to the Daily’s inquiry as to which specific part of the SSMU constitution was violated, McGill merely repeated that initiatives like the PSP are “in contradiction with the principles expressed by SSMU in its own constitution.”
Labeau also said that the university had “communicated [his] concerns to the SSMU leadership and advised them to take […] remedial action,” and divulged that the university is prepared to terminate its Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with SSMU. According to Article 12 of the MoA, the University may default the MoA “when the Association [i.e., SSMU] violates its constitution;” SSMU would be given 30 working days to remedy the default in the event of this happening. However, 2019-2020 SSMU President Bryan Buraga emailed SSMU Directors, Councillors, and Executives just under two hours after Labeau sent his MRO to explain that a default would not enable the university to “unilaterally dissolve the SSMU.” Buraga pointed out that in accordance with Article 12.3 of the MoA, SSMU could dispute arbitration within 90 days of receiving notice of the default. Furthermore, Articles 13.2 and 13.3 of the MoA and Sections 53 and 55 of the Act respecting the accreditation and financing of students’ associations mandate McGill to collect and distribute SSMU funds – termination of the MoA would make SSMU’s financial processes more cumbersome, but would not pose an existential threat to the Society, per Buraga.
According to current SSMU President Darshan Daryanani, McGill did not communicate its disapproval of the Policy prior to providing the Notice of Default: “The McGill Administration failed to engage with the SSMU with more consideration for the democratic and constitutional values of the Society,” Daryanani wrote in an email to the Daily. The statement sent to the Daily by the MRO says that the university “has communicated [its] concerns to the SSMU leadership,” but does not specify whether the university reached out to SSMU regarding the PSP prior to threatening a notice of default. Per Daryanani, Labeau’s Notice of Default states that “in no way can [the PSP] be considered to ‘facilitate communication and interaction between all students from all McGill communities’ or to ‘act in the best interests of [SSMUʼs] Members as a whole.’ It will also clearly lead to discrimination based on characteristics such as race, national or ethnic origin, and religion.” Daryanani does not appear to believe that the PSP violates SSMU’s Constitution, writing that it is the constitutional obligation of student representatives “to uphold matters of human rights, environmental protection and social justice.”
During the March 24 Legislative Council meeting, Councillors passed the “Motion Regarding Statement by SSMU in Response to MRO 2022-03-24,” which mandates SSMU to draft a public response to Labeau’s MRO as swiftly as possible. Arts Representative Yara Coussa, who told the Daily she is advocating for SSMU to contest the Notice of Default, is leading this initiative. Daryanani said that SSMU’s response is set to be released on April 5, pending approval from SSMU’s legal counsel.
The University of Toronto Students’ Union (UTSU) has likewise had its controversies surrounding pro-BDS initiatives. In July of 2015, the UTSU Board of Directors (BoD) voted against the formation of a BDS committee, as reported in The Varsity. More recently, on February 16, the UTSU approved a motion to divest from firms complicit in the occupation of Palestinian territory following a lengthy and heated debate. Afterwards, the UTSU released a statement affirming that they would support Palestinian students “in a manner that unequivocally condemns anti-Semitism [sic], Islamophobia, and systemic oppression in all its forms.” According to this statement, the Special General Meeting wherein the motion was passed was meant to clear up “what precisely was meant by the terms used in the motion,” but there was not an opportunity to do so – as such, how the motion will impact UofT students remains to be seen.
On February 16, the University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU)  voted to reject recommendations made by UofT’s Complaint and Resolution Council for Student Societies (CRCSS) regarding the Union’s BDS caucus. In February of 2021, the CRCSS reviewed the caucus due to allegations of antisemitism and found that it violated the Union’s Anti-Discrimination Policy “on the grounds of discrimination based on nationality.” In a statement to the Daily, the UTGSU wrote that it “believes that the caucus is not discriminatory, but rather that it calls for equity through activism to support Palestinians who are facing oppression.” Furthermore, the Union contends that the CRCSS itself is undemocratic, writing that it was created “to infringe upon student union autonomy without the consent of the UTGSU.”
In response to the UTGSU’s rejection of the CRCSS recommendations, UofT decided to withhold student fees allocated to the BDS caucus – $10,918 total, according to a news article which UofT sent the Daily. Per the UTGSU, the consequences of withholding these fees will likely not be felt until the summer semester, but “it sets a dangerous precedent […] for universities to overrule democratically-decided student union decisions that they don’t like.” The UTGSU is working to strengthen solidarity among student unions, and encouraged McGill’s student unions to join the Global Student Government coalition in its email to the Daily. “A divided student movement makes it easier for university administrations to infringe upon student union autonomy and weaken the student voice. We cannot afford to be isolationist,” the Union explained.
On March 23, the Alma Mater Society (AMS) Council voted “yes” to a motion mandating the Council to “urge [UBC] to divest from companies involved in or complicit in human rights violations against Palestinians.” AMS declined to respond to the Daily’s request for comment; the Daily also reached out to the UBC chapter of SPHR, but did not receive a response.
In an email statement to the Daily, UBC wrote that the university “does not invest directly in individual stocks or companies,” instead investing in “pooled funds and external fund managers” in accordance with principles “based on the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment.” However, the statement continues to explain that “the aggregate exposure of the Endowment Portfolio to the names cited in the motion on the UN database was approximately $43,000, or 0.002% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Including the full list of companies cited in the motion, the Endowment’s aggregate exposure was less than 0.05%, or approximately $1 million.” As of writing, UBC has not attempted to intervene in the AMS decision; the university did not express any intention to interfere with the Society in its statement to the Daily.
Michael Bueckert, Vice President at Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME), wrote that there has been a “renewed momentum” in pro-Palestine activism on university campuses within the last year, pointing to the policies recently passed at McGill, Concordia, UofT, and UBC. Universities have historically repressed pro-Palestine activism, per Bueckert – for example, when Israeli Apartheid Week was brand new, administrators “bann[ed] event posters and [shut] down organizers.” Bueckert explained that such repression had seemed to subside, but there has recently been increased interference in student activism – “with a resurgence of activism, it’s not surprising to see a new wave of efforts to shut it down,” he observed.
Communications Lead for Independent Jewish Voices, Aaron Lakoff, echoed these concerns in an interview with the Daily. “It’s absolutely abhorrent when university administrations take these kinds of punitive actions,” Lakoff said, adding that universities should be celebrating vibrant student democracies and the presence of anti-racist movements on their campuses. Of McGill and UofT’s response to pro-Palestine activism on their respective campuses, Lakoff remarked, “Who is the one guilty of the divisive atmosphere when you are threatening a democratic student body and democratically-made decisions?”
Still, Bueckert and Lakoff both emphasized that students have an important role to play in anti-racist and anti-apartheid efforts. In 1985, McGill divested from its holdings in apartheid South Africa in response to student pressure; per Bueckert, student initiatives at the time included “establishing apartheid-free zones, protesting speeches by ambassadors, and implementing general anti-apartheid policies” on McGill’s campus. Likewise, Lakoff pointed out that institutions like McGill are often complicit in Israeli apartheid due to their investments in companies which profit on occupied Palestinian land – as such, “students should never underestimate the powerful and important role they can play in terms of bringing down apartheid.”
Lakoff, who is himself Jewish, said that alleging motions such as the PSP are antisemitic “ignores the fact that there are Jews all around the world […] who are standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people.” He also pointed out that universities should make an effort to protect Palestinian students from racism: if universities want to create a culture of inclusion, respect, and safety, they must consider “the safety of people of colour and Palestinian students who are attending a university that is complicit in their own people’s dispossession and complicit in apartheid.” 
Bueckert and Lakoff also expressed concern for the well-being of student democracies at the hands of administrators willing to interfere in student politics. “The fact that universities are using [financial] threats specifically to try to shut down anti-racist organizing is appalling,” Bueckert wrote, describing UofT and McGill’s behaviour as “anti-democratic and heavy-handed.” Similarly, Lakoff characterized these universities’ punitive actions as “abhorrent,” adding that these actions are “threats against student democracy and threats against the wellbeing of students and campus life.”
The Daily inquired as to why McGill chose to default its MoA with SSMU as opposed to another course of action; the university did not address this question in its statement to the Daily. Additionally, the Daily asked what Labeau feels would be an appropriate way to “address serious and important questions” such as the PSP – the university’s response only reiterates that “robust debate is key to what we do and who we are as a University.” 
Affairs related to the PSP are still developing as SSMU prepares its response to the Notice of Default; the Daily will continue to follow this story.

2022-09-19,McGill,Israel,"Activists criticize donor for “sportswashing” Israeli colonialism
On August 31, McGill announced the establishment of a new sports science institute, made possible with a large gift from a wealthy donor – “$29-million donation is largest-ever gift to a faculty of education in Canada,” the subheading of the press release boasted. Indeed, Sylvan Adams – the billionaire behind the eponymous Sylvan Adams Sports Science Institute (SASSI) – has spent millions of dollars on educational ventures in Israel and Canada over the past several years. In 2017, Adams funded a similar institute for Tel Aviv University (TAU): the Sylvan Adams Sports Institute. Both establishments tout innovative approaches to sports science, focusing on the study of “optimal health, rather than disease” and seeking to improve the performance of elite athletes. Researchers from McGill and TAU will partner with one another in collaborative research efforts.
However, pro-Palestine activists were quick to point out Adams’ history of supporting and financing pro-Israel initiatives. During a university-led event announcing the establishment of the SASSI, writer and pro-Palestine activist Yves Engler interrupted a speech by Principal Suzanne Fortier to denounce the university’s continued suppression of pro-Palestine activism on campus: “Madame Fortier, do McGill students have the right to oppose Israel killing Palestinian children? Do they have the right to oppose Israeli colonialism and apartheid?” He went on to reference the Palestine Solidarity Policy, the passage of which prompted Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau to threaten termination of SSMU’s Memorandum of Agreement with McGill in May; ultimately, SSMU’s Board of Directors decided against ratifying the policy, and it was not adopted by the Society. Engler’s video of his interruption – which has accumulated more than 100,000 views on Twitter – ends with shaky footage of attendees averting their gaze as he is escorted out, yelling, “Free Palestine! […] You’re complicit in Israeli colonialism and violence!” As of writing, the university has not publicly acknowledged or responded to Engler’s comments.
In a phone interview with the Daily, Engler explained that interrupting the funding announcement was both an attempt to attract media attention to McGill’s complicity in Israeli apartheid, and a way of demonstrating solidarity with Palestinians and pro-Palestine activists. According to Engler, media outlets present at the announcement ignored his interruption, highlighting that The Montreal Gazette’s coverage of the announcement wholly neglected to mention his comments at the event. Still, Engler succeeded in raising awareness of the university’s response to the Palestine Solidarity Policy and Adams’ pro-Israel involvement via social media, which he believes is an important consequence of interruptions like his: “You get a message out there, but also you’re trying to have a sense of, like, there is a resistance, right? […] We don’t just allow these people in power to just get away with whatever they want to get away with.” 
In a September 1 blog post, Engler took issue with Adams funding the institute, writing that Adams has “plowed tens of millions of dollars into various sports and cultural initiatives explicitly designed to whitewash Israeli apartheid and violence.” For example, Adams organized Madonna’s Eurovision performance in Israel and helped fund a soccer tournament so that soccer superstar Lionel Messi could make an appearance in Tel Aviv. Engler told the Daily that these initiatives are “designed to basically whitewash Israeli colonialism.” Adams himself has admitted that he sees sporting events as opportunities to bolster support for Israel among those who are “generally apolitical,” and although he has described himself as Israel’s “self-appointed ambassador at large,” he claims that the work he does is not political. Engler also expressed concern over McGill’s readiness to please influential donors, remarking that universities will oppose any attempt at “meddling” in their financial investments, as has been the case with McGill’s refusal to divest from fossil fuels and its reluctance to divest from South African companies. Although universities may put on a “liberal facade” or “talk a decent game on the climate crisis,” university administrations tend to be conservative bodies that cater to fundraisers, he claimed. To illustrate this point, Engler brought up his own experience within the Concordia Student Union 20 years ago: when students protested an event where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to make a speech, the university had to “get the student activists in line, because there were donors threatening to withdraw their funds,” per Engler. 
The McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) shared this sentiment: in a written statement sent to the Daily, they described the announcement of SASSI as “sportswashing,” a method of distracting from a country’s human rights offenses by drawing attention to sports enterprises. A journalist from The Times of Israel asked Adams about sportswashing in a 2019 interview, to which he Adams replied that “Haters gonna hate” and explained that he feels he is showing “the real Israel.” SPHR also pointed to a handful of interviews where Adams denied Israeli apartheid, characterizing Israel as a peaceful country despite the fact that Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have found that Israel is committing apartheid against Palestinians. The statement also alluded to the university’s response to the Palestine Solidarity Policy as an example of McGill’s typical response to “students’ activism against Israeli settler colonial apartheid,” writing that McGill “runs to appease its donors while giving a big middle finger to its students.”
In an email to the Daily, McGill’s Media Relations Office (MRO) emphasized the need for respect, empathy, and inclusion when debating on campus. “Robust debate is key to what we do and who we are as a University. However, such debate cannot be carried out at the expense of respect and inclusion,” the statement continued – almost a word-for-word reiteration of what Labeau wrote in his May 24 email regarding the Palestine Solidarity Policy. The MRO email concluded by inviting students to participate in the events and activities recommended in the Initiative Against Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism (IAIAS) report; while the iaias@mcgill.ca email address is open for students to submit feedback, the statement did not specify whether this email would be an appropriate forum through which to present feedback regarding the SASSI.
When asked how he believed students should express opposition to the establishment of the SASSI, Engler said, “I think the most important thing is to protest, and what the actual mechanism of that protest is, is less important.” He added that increasing pressure from activist groups from outside the university would be key to furthering pro-Palestine messages on campus. SPHR indicated that a response from their organization is forthcoming: “rest assured that this initiative will not be left unanswered. Keep your eyes peeled because once again SPHR will not back down.”

2023-02-13,McGill,Israel,"Turkey and Syria hit by one of the strongest earthquakes in over 100 years
Content warning: injury and death
On Monday, February 6, around 4 AM, one of the strongest earthquakes in over 100 years hit Turkey and Northern Syria. The deadly power of its 7.8 magnitude was quickly followed by another 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the early afternoon, and 100 powerful aftershocks were felt throughout the day. According to the United States Geological Survey, it was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region. Tremors were felt as far away as Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan and Israel. Four days later, the death toll had reached 20,000 casualties, with 17,406 deaths reported in Turkey and 3,317 in Syria. Death tolls are predicted to keep rising in the upcoming days as rescue teams operate under difficult conditions. This catastrophe hit an already fragile region, as Turkey faces a longstanding economic crisis and Syria undergoes one of the world’s most persistent humanitarian crises. At a greater scale, the McGill community is also impacted as student groups organize campaigns to contribute relief to Turkey and Syria. 
Where did the earthquakes hit, and why were they so deadly?
The first earthquake in Turkey and Northern Syria was classified as “major” on the Richter magnitude scale and broke along 100km (62 miles) of the fault line. An earthquake is caused by the friction of adjoining plates (in this case, the Arabian moving northwards toward the Anatolian plate) until pressure builds up and one plate suddenly causes the surface to move. Two major fault lines trigger shocks on a regular basis in the region. However, larger quakes are less frequent, as Professor Joanna Faure Walker, from the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction at University College London, tells BBC: “only two in the last 10 years have been of equivalent magnitude, and four in the previous 10 years.” Although scientists usually know where earthquakes might happen using historical records and geological measurements, it is more difficult to estimate when they will occur because the forces that cause them to happen operate slowly over a vast area, yet with concentrated effects over a narrow region. Nevertheless, their force can destroy lives and cities in minutes. Although building quality is supposedly controlled and enforced by a building code, standards are not always respected. The fault rupture caused the collapse of nearly 5,700 buildings in Turkey, which was particularly damaging given the region’s high population density.  In Syria, Bill McGuire, a volcanologist at University College London, said to Al-Monitor that “many structures have already been weakened by more than a decade of war.” 
What are the conditions in Syria?
Syria has been destabilized by the civil war that has been ongoing for over ten years, creating a chronically underfunded humanitarian emergency. According to the UN, nearly 70 per cent of the Syrian population required humanitarian aid before the earthquake. The earthquake caused widespread damage in northern Syria, including the last rebel-held holdout in the northwest. Within these regions, many people have been displaced from other parts of Syria, many live in camps, and four million depend on international humanitarian assistance. Still, much of the emergency aid from the international community arrived from one border crossing in Turkey, which was heavily damaged by the earthquake. The first United Nations aid convoy crossed into northern Syria on Thursday. International sanctions have also been straining the country’s economy, as the country faces widespread poverty and food shortages; about 90 percent of Syrians live below the poverty line. Moreover, the geopolitical and domestic political situation likely increases the risk of unequal aid access and assistance to Syria since the West doesn’t recognize Bashar Al-Assad’s leadership. Most Western governments will channel their resources towards the UN and international humanitarian support organizations rather than provide direct support. The international community has called to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria. Currently, with the support of Russia at the UN, Assad’s government allows aid to enter through only one border crossing. The Syrian Association for Citizens Dignity argues that all borders should be opened on an emergency basis. The Guardian highlights that the recent earthquakes in Syria have intensified a humanitarian crisis that is testing the ability of the international community to come together and respond. Despite existing divisions caused by the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, it is critical for nations to set aside their differences and prioritize aid for those in need, they argue.
What are the conditions in Turkey?
Turkey’s quickly-rising death toll doubles that of Syria and has further destabilized the region. Turkey has been facing a profound economic crisis, with an inflation rate of about 80 per cent last year (as compared to 6.3 per cent in Canada). Such an economic situation has exacerbated food insecurity in the region, with about 70 per cent of those surveyed by Yonëylem Social Research Centre in Turkey unable to afford food. Although the economic costs are still not fully clear at this time, the United States Geological Survey estimates that it could rise up to 10 per cent of Turkey’s GDP. The hundreds of kilometres of damage and millions of people affected could “completely reset” Turkey’s economy and politics, said Atilla Yesilada of Global Source Partners. A day after the quake struck, Erdogan’s opposition parties and residents in damaged areas criticized the weak and slow governmental response. The upcoming presidential election on May 14 will be a test of President Erdogan’s ability to manage the crisis in the aftermath of the quakes and cooperate with other countries. The perception that the government is not effectively addressing the disaster or allegations of non-compliance with building codes could harm the incumbent’s chances in the election. The opposition also emphasizes the importance of the government in providing aid without discrimination to the affected regions, which include Kurdish communities and Syrian refugees. 
How to help
The recovery process after a disaster has various stages. The initial response involves search and rescue, emergency medical care and other critical needs. Logistics, such as access to damaged areas, often pose a greater challenge than funding at this stage. Secondary emergencies can also result in further casualties if medical care and supplies are not available. In the long term, donations play a crucial role in helping disaster victims rebuild their homes and lives. Here at McGill, the Turkish Students’ Association (TSSM) provides both resources and support for victims and their communities. They will be hosting a second round of supply donations this week, which will be published on their Instagram account. The McGill Syrian Students’ Association (SSA) is also raising funds to be delivered to trusted local volunteers on the ground. E-transfers will be accepted to vp.finance.ssa@gmail.com. Raised funds will be directed to most affected regions and then be used to buy blankets, food, clothes and supplies on-site. Updates and follow-ups on their fundraiser can be found on their Instagram.
Within the McGill Community
Both the SSA and TSSM will organize meetings and aid assemblies in the upcoming weeks to offer support and answer questions. In an interview with Sarah Al-Ani, VP Advisor for SSA, she emphasized the importance of the Syrian community at McGill: 
“Although there are only about 48 new Syrian students that were accepted to Mcgill this year, we have around like 900 to 1000 followers, and we have some events that bring 400 students. A lot of us moved here, there is a large community. It’s just maybe a lot of them aren’t aware of our club or aren’t aware of what we do. ”
Although it may be difficult for a student’s club to reach the greater community, she explains the solidarity that exists among the greater student’s community:
“Even if a friend of mine is not Syrian, they could come to this event or even if someone is not from Turkey, they’ll come to Turkish events. So I feel like even though someone is not Syrian, they feel for it. There is also a large Arabic community. We all feel the hardship that’s happening.” 
Although McGill itself has yet to make a statement about the situation, she explains how raising awareness and knowledge is crucial to grieving students, especially during the exam period, and encourages impacted students to reach out to professors for accommodations. Nevertheless, Sarah points out the important role that McGill could play now: 
“McGill has such a large platform. They have TikTok. They have Instagram. They have Facebook. So for them to use their platform to help us shows their support, shows that they’re allies with us”.
In the meantime, you can always contact the SSA and the TSSM for any further questions or concerns.

2023-04-03,McGill,Israel,"Students protest McGill’s ties to SASSI, among other initiatives
On Friday, March 24, students gathered on McGill’s campus for a rally against the university’s financial and academic ties to Israel. Organized by Students for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill, the rally was the last in a series of events put on by SPHR McGill and other pro-Palestine groups for Montreal’s Israeli Apartheid Week. Activists from SPHR McGill, SPHR Concordia, and the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) spoke to the crowd and led students in chants of “free free Palestine,” “occupation isn’t funny, students over donor money,” and more.
Speakers drew attention to the Sylvan Adams Sports Science Institute (SASSI) project – made possible by the $29 million dollar donation of Sylvan Adams, an Israeli-Canadian billionaire and self-described “ambassador-at-large for the State of Israel.” 
“This initiative, painted as a commitment to the advancement of sports performance through academic research, constitutes a highly politicized attempt to systemically normalize colonial Zionist institutions,” said a speaker from SPHR McGill. 
The speaker pointed to the SASSI project as an instance of “sportswashing” – the practice of an individual, company, or government funding or organizing sports to improve their reputation. They also condemned the planned collaboration between McGill and Tel Aviv University over SASSI, citing Tel Aviv University’s ties to Israeli weapons manufacturers and influence in shaping Israeli policy.
“We will not stand for collaboration with the university that is a core participant in Israel’s occupation mechanism,” said the speaker. “How can we trust that our administration will feel comfortable taking stances against Israel and for the Palestinian people? How can we believe that it will not impede on student activism against Israeli apartheid when it’s receiving $29 million from someone whose explicit and proclaimed objective is to paint Israel as peaceful?”
Multiple speakers drew attention to last years’ Palestine Solidarity Policy – which earned a 71 per cent “yes” vote in a SSMU referendum and over which McGill’s administration threatened to withdraw funding from SSMU. Speakers also called on McGill students to pressure the university to divest from Israeli companies, referencing the successful student movement for divestment from South African apartheid in the 1980s as a precedent.  
“The PYM calls on the students at McGill University today to continue their fight against the administration and to continue advancing the struggle for Palestinian liberation,” said another speaker. “The divestment that happened in 1987 […] was only possible because students organized, because they got together. They collectively got together to organize and pressure the administration. And we will do the same.”
“We need to ask ourselves what allowed the occupation […] to enact this violence from 1948 to 2023 with complete impunity,” said the speaker. “It’s because of the imperial allies, like Canada and the US, who bankroll the settlements and prop up the Zionist entities. From our pension funds, to our banks, to our schools, to our libraries, bookstores, and charities, every single industry in Canada is complicit in the occupation […] McGill University is one of the many Canadian institutions that is actively normalizing and upholding the occupation’s war crimes.”
“I wish McGill would actually listen to the students rather than just think about money only – because money isn’t our future,” said Zeyna, a U0 student at McGill, to the Daily. “It’s just really unfortunate to see a big institution, in a country that prides itself on being democratic and pro-freedom, choose money over the lives of people.”
The rally marked the end of SPHR McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week events, which included a film screening, a “Palestine 101” workshop in partnership with the PYM, and a talk by ex-Google employee Ariel Koren entitled “No Tech for Apartheid.”
“We really focus on the education aspect,” said a representative of SPHR McGill to the Daily, “but also at the same time really mobilizing and showing Palestinians on campus that we are here for them and that the fight is not over. We’re not stopping even if McGill is standing in our way. […] We’re here. We’re not going anywhere. We’re still as strong as we were last year with the Palestine Solidarity Policy. We’re not losing momentum.”
The representative encouraged concerned students to look out for SHPR tabling on campus and possible upcoming petitions against the SASSI project. They said students can get involved with SPHR by sharing their contact information in-person at tabling sessions and by following SPHR McGill on Instagram @sphrmcgill, where they post about events. Future events include a film screening and iftars for Ramadan. 
“Even if you don’t feel educated enough about the issue, please, come reach out to us,” said the SPHR representative. “We are more than happy to talk about it, really. One of the biggest myths about the genocide of Palestinians is that it’s a complicated issue. It’s really not. Come talk to us. We’re here. We also want a diversity of voices and opinions in the group. So it doesn’t matter if you’re Arab, it doesn’t matter if you’re Palestinian. There is a space for you here and we welcome you and we want you around.”

2009-01-15,McGill,Palestine,"An estimated 10,000 people marched Saturday in protest against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, part of a worldwide movement denouncing recent violence.
The frustrations of the crowd were tangible. Participants walked down Ste. Catherine from Peel to St. Urbain, chanting “Viva! Viva! Intifada!” and “Israel—Assassin! Israel—Terrorist!”
“I feel a little helpless,” said McGill graduate student Kianoosh Hashemzadeh at the protest. “I feel like this is helping me feel as if I am a part of a movement that is against the activity taking place in Gaza.”
According to the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Tzipi Livni, the aim of Israel’s offensive is to stop the barrage of rockets and mortars being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, numbering about 500 since the start of the 20-day offensive. However, due to the low mortality rate of the Hamas rockets, the conflict has left 13 Israelis and over 900 Palestinians dead. In addition, 4,400 Gazans have been injured to date.
Protester and McGill law student Maha Hussain defended Israel’s right to protect its citizens, but felt the Israeli response to be disproportionate.
“It’s like shooting fish in a barrel; they have nowhere to evacuate to,” she said, referring to Gaza’s borders, which have been sealed for the past 18 months.
The campaign was organized by the Coalition for Justice and Peace in Palestine, Tadamon! Montreal, and Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR).
Many Jewish groups also took part in the rally, including the Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians (ACJC), Independent Jewish Voices, and Young Jews for Social Justice (YJSJ), a new Quebec Public Interest Research Group-McGill working group.
Elise Eisenkraft Klein, a member of the YJSJ, emphasized the diversity of voices within the Jewish community.
“I think it’s important that the Jewish community is not shown as being a monolithic voice, and that there are opinions that Jews have out there other than [those of] the big organizations and pro-Israel…lobbies,” said Klein.
Speaking at the demonstration, Independent Jewish Voices representative Abby Lippman called on Jewish history to justify Jewish opposition to Israeli policies in the Occupied Territories.
“Silence kills. Jews know this all too well,” said Lippman. “We cannot stay and watch others kill in our name.
“We will stand up in solidarity with all those who are demanding an end to Israel’s attacks in Gaza, to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, and to the continuation of violations of human rights and international law,” added Lippman.
Aaron Lakoff, a collective member of Tadamon! Montreal, maintained that Israeli treatment of the Palestinians contradicts Jewish values.
“A lot of people have interpreted Jewish values to be standing for liberation and for justice. And what Israel is doing is actually smack in the face of those traditions and a smack in the face of all of humanity,” said Lakoff.
No opposing groups organized against the protest. However, onlooker Yoni Khajehzadeh was displeased with the march. Identifying himself as an Iranian Jew, Khajehzadeh was concerned the demonstration threatened Israel’s legitimacy as nation-state.
“I’m not saying that everything that is going on in Gaza is right, but what I am saying is that Israel has a right to exist as a sovereign Jewish state,” said Khajehzadeh.
The Montreal demonstration coincided with several held across Canada in Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver over the weekend. Tens of thousands have also protested in Britain, France, Belgium, and Spain.
According to Nina Amrov, spokesperson for SPHR, the primary goal of the protest was to mobilize those outraged by the alleged war crimes committed by the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. The organization hopes the demonstration will incite the Conservative government to end its support of Israeli policies that flagrantly abuse international law, said Amrov.
In addition, both Amrov and Lakoff underscored the need to consider the context in which Hamas has been firing rockets, saying the targeted towns – Ashkelon, Sderot, and Ashdod – are where many Gazans lived before 1948 and 1967.
“We’re talking about the Gaza Strip: 75 per cent of the population there are refugees. It’s the world’s largest open-air prison,” said Lakoff.
“People have to go through the largest obstacles in the world just to get basic necessities of life.”

2009-01-25,McGill,Palestine,"Some young diaspora Jews have strong cultural and spiritual ties to Israel, making carte blanche criticism challenging
In light of the recent escalation of violence in Gaza, many members of the Jewish community feel torn between their political views and their cultural identity.
Rabbi Leibish Hundert of the Ghetto Shul explained that certain young diaspora Jews feel disconnected from Israel because of the current political and military situation in the Middle East.
“There is a moral and ethical dilemma that is facing Israel. This has caused some alienation and some mixed feelings,” Hundert said, adding that few demonstrators at pro-Israel rallies are 100 per cent supportive of Israel’s actions.
“There would be a small percentage of people at a pro-Israel rally who would say they are happy with every single thing. People feel a deep unsettledness about the millions of Palestinians who are living a very difficult life.”
Dr. Eric Caplan, Chair of the Jewish Studies Department at McGill, explained that Israel is significant to Judaism for many reasons, one being a cultural connection.
“Jewish civilization formed in Israel…. It goes back…to the time of Abraham in 14th or 15th century B.C.E,” said Caplan. “In the two millennia where Jews were in exile, the security of the Jews was often called into question. Jewish life has often been precarious, predating the Holocaust.”
Caplan added that in the 60 years since its formation, Israel has accepted a large Jewish population fleeing from persecution.
Yael Smiley, Israel Affairs Chair for Hillel McGill, also explained the importance of the country.
“It is the one state that will always grant asylum to any Jew at any time,” said Smiley.
The spiritual connection to Israel that many Jews feel is very important, said Hundert.
“[Israel is] the manifestation of the collective soul of the Jewish people,” he said. “It is a tribal connection [sharing] the same symbols, families, [and] experiences.”
Caplan echoed the importance of Israel to Jews.
“A personal connection to Israel is very enriching for Jewish identity,” said Caplan, “and those who do not have it are missing an opportunity.”
Smiley pointed out that Israel’s controversial military actions can complicate diaspora connections to the country.
“I don’t think there is an inherent connection between a cultural bond and support of the military,” said Smiley. “There is room for criticism, but more important than criticism is education.”
With the recent mass of hate crimes against Jews around the world, it can be challenging for Jewish people to criticize a country that means so much to their identity.
“The thing is that the language of the opposition is so often so total, so completely rejecting, that it creates a survival instinct in people,” Hundert continued.
Caplan drew a distinction between criticizing Israel and attending a pro-Palestine rally, where some participants may question Israel’s right to exist.
“I do not think that [pro-Palestine rallies are] a great venue for someone who believes there should be a state but is merely unhappy with some of its actions.”
Caplan also said that non-Jewish critiques of Israel are not necessarily anti-Semitic.
“It is not anti-Semitic to criticize Israel’s military action as long as the criticism that you give is one that you would apply equally toward all conflicts,” said Caplan.
“People are angry at the U.S. for the Iraq war; people are angry at the Sudanese government for the genocide in Darfur, but no one questions the right for these countries to exist. Israel is unique in having its existence questioned when some people have trouble with what it does.”
Independent Jewish Voices, Young Jews for Social Justice, and Chabad McGill were unavailable for comment.

2009-02-19,McGill,Palestine,"Reporting independently from the frontlines of war is an increasingly rare engagement for journalists working for major international media outlets. From Iraq to Afghanistan, reporters are increasingly embedded in advancing western forces on the front lines, making it challenging to maintain an independent voice.
When Israeli military forces launched an invasion into the Gaza Strip, international journalists were barred entry into the territory by the Israeli government. Major international media outlets, including CNN and the BBC, reported on Gaza from hilltops in Israeli controlled territory, kilometres away from the actual conflict.
Reporting from the Middle East, British journalist Robert Fisk has offered decades of fiercely independent accounts of the region’s conflicts. Stationed in Beirut, Lebanon, Fisk reports for the U.K.-based Independent newspaper, which has a large global distribution. Fish spoke recently with local journalist Stefan Christoff, offering comments on the media response to the recent war in the Gaza Strip.
The McGill Daily: Historical context is often not included in daily reporting on the Middle East. Could you offer some historical perspectives to the recent war in Gaza?
Robert Fisk: In 1948, when the Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes – 750,000 is the figure widely accepted – those in the north, in the Galilee area of what became Israel, fled into Lebanon; those in the Jerusalem area fled east toward what we now call the West Bank; those in the south of what became Israel fled south into what we now call the Gaza Strip.
For example, in 2000, after the Israelis finished their final withdrawal after 22 years of occupation [in Lebanon] and went across the border back into Israel, many Palestinians in Lebanon went down to the border and looked across, not because they were looking at northern Israel but because they were looking at the northern part of Palestine as they had known it. Some could actually see the villages that their parents or grandparents had come from in 1948.
So there is this whole Diaspora around the state of Israel who can’t go home because our home is on the other side of the border, and this reality revolves around the whole issue of United Nations General Assembly resolution 194 on the right of return, [which stipulates that] these Palestinian refugees have the right to return to their homes.
Well over half of the people living in Gaza are families, either survivors or descendants of Palestinians, who lived only ten or 12 miles in what today is Israel. So when you hear the Israelis say “the terrorists are firing rockets into Israel,” the Palestinians in Gaza can in many cases say “well my grandson is firing a rocket at my town because before 1948, these areas would have been Palestinian property.”
MD: What were your perceptions on media coverage during the latest war in Gaza?
RF: The international press allowed for their own humiliation: Israel told the press that they couldn’t go into Gaza and they didn’t really try to, so the press sat outside Gaza and pontificated from two miles away. Israel wanted to keep the international press out of Gaza and they were kept out; that was that.
It is instructive to note that no major western media outlet had a reporter based inside Gaza who would have been there when it started. Clearly after the kidnapping of a BBC reporter, who was based in Gaza, it is not surprising that the international news agencies were hesitant to base reporters in Gaza. However, it is also instructive to note that it was the Hamas government that had the BBC reporter released, which is not often mentioned now.
Faced with the fact that the only journalists left inside Gaza were Palestinian reporters, the major networks were forced to hand over their reporting to Palestinian Arabs, who in many cases were refugees inside Gaza.
This meant that you had Palestinian reporters on the ground talking about their own people, unencumbered by western reporters cross-questioning them, or trying to put 50 per cent of the story on one side and 50 per cent of the story on the other side.
Al-Jazeera came out as the heroes of journalism because they had both their international service, their English service, and also their Arabic service fully operational from offices inside Gaza.
Individual Palestinians working for western news organizations showed that they could be competent journalists and the western journalists who sat outside Gaza looked as pathetic as their reporting on the Middle East is becoming.
Palestinian reporters were telling their own stories.  In the case [of the Independent], our Palestinian reporter inside Gaza had his father killed in an air strike – his father who was a pro-Palestinian Authority, English-speaking, well-educated judge, killed in his orchard. So the Independent had on our front page, this terrible and tragic story of this innocent man destroyed, atomized into pieces of flesh by an Israel air strike in his orchard, a story reported by his own son in our newspaper.
So this was the kind of journalism from Palestine that we hadn’t seen in the major [western] press, so there was an upside to the [international] press being banned from Gaza. However, the work of the international reporters was truly pathetic.

2009-03-09,McGill,Palestine,"ANC minister Ronnie Kasrils examines Israel with South Africa in mind for McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week
The Daily caught up with former African National Congress (ANC) Minister Ronnie Kasrils  on his way to his keynote speech for McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week. to discuss what South African apartheid can teach the world about Gaza.
Of Jewish Lithuanian descent, Kasrils was born in Johannesburg and was a founding member of the ANC’s military wing. He worked as Chief of Military Intelligence for the ANC while exiled to neighbouring African countries and was later involved in South African politics as Deputy Minister of Defence.
McGill Daily: There was a recent petition that was signed by 500 prominent Israelis calling upon the international community to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) for Palestine campaign…. Could you comment on the state of anti-apartheid activism in Israel?
Ronnie Kasrils: I think that the fact that there are 500 courageous enough to come out in support of BDS is fantastic. It’s almost treasonable in Israel… and 500 is a very significant number.
There were times when there were far less than 500 South African whites who were prepared to stand up and side with the liberation movement. [But] it’s not just the number; it’s the symbolism.
It’s the fact that [Israelis who support BDS] are breaking with the orthodoxy of the state and the doctrine which basically says with an exclusivist state, that if you’re white or if you’re Jewish then the only way we can all survive is by standing together. So those whites who broke with that in South Africa really challenged the essence of racism and apartheid. The same thing is happening in Israel.
MD: How do you feel about comparisons between the ANC and Hamas? And in the face of the reality of the gross asymmetries when it comes to armed conflict in Israel-Palestine, do you think that the ramifications of Hamas’s militant policies need to affect the way in which its leaders are engaged in the international stage?
RK: I’ve met with Hamas leaders, and we’ve had very interesting, useful discussions. They’re very interested in our experience, our strategy of winning over whites in South Africa, They are very interested in [winning over Jews in Israel] and they began to see quite frankly that using indiscriminate violence against civilians is counter-productive. We might not endorse some of the methods they use but Hamas has stopped suicide bombings…
These are people who are patriots, who are serious, who are human beings and shouldn’t be demonized. If you want to solve a problem in the end, it’s not your friends that you negotiate with, it’s your enemies.
And Israel has not taken the opportunity of getting together to resolve these problems and why? Because of the Zionist doctrine, they are not interested in negotiation. They want the entire land of the British Mandate to themselves, that’s the reason.
MD: In the case of South Africa, the end of apartheid meant integration and liberation for blacks: living in the same country under the same rights. What tack do you take in the Palestinian solidarity struggle vis-à-vis the one-state versus the two-state solution?
RK: With South Africa, right from an early time of the struggle we made it very clear that we were talking about the liberation of the whole country and the unity state in which all our people would be equal citizens. In 1955, [the ANC] came up with this blueprint for a free South Africa and it starts in the preamble, “We South Africans, together we say that South Africa belongs to all the people who live in it, black and white, as equal citizens.”
But when you look at Palestine, it’s not for us to decide for the Palestinians, or for the Jews living in the former British Mandate Palestine, how to struggle, or what the objective should be. We want to support a whole movement which is for justice, which is for equality of people and so on.
Up until the late eighties the Palestine Liberation Organization talked about one state…. But when [Yasser] Arafat went into Oslo from the Madrid talks and stated that they would settle for a two-state solution along the lines of the pre-1967 borders, it wasn’t for us to argue with that. We supported that.
But of course what’s happened since Oslo in terms of the two states has greatly undermined it. Israel has moved against the idea of real contiguity and sovereignty.
[Palestinian] territory is shrinking because the illegal settlements have been expanding over time no matter which party is in power. So from that point of view, [the two-state solution] needs to be reconsidered.
MD: If we look at the BDS campaign, designed as it is as more or less a blanket boycott of Israeli goods, industry, academics, do you fear that the majority of the Israeli public will be alienated by it?
RK: I think you’ll find [Israeli support for the boycotts] narrow when they are appalled and they will react with anger. [Support] in turn [widen].
In South Africa, initially, [whites] were affronted by this and asked “how dare these people challenge us this way? They’re crazy, they don’t understand.” But in time it opens people’s eyes, as you sustain such pressure.
So in 1959 when the international boycott started, the support was very narrow, but by 1989 huge numbers of whites were actually joining these anti-apartheid protests. They were tired of finding themselves treated like lepers in the world, seeing their sports teams being jeered at internationally, the life lines cut off for their trade, for their cultural exchanges. For the academics it all came home to roost; for the business people, it was biting their pockets.

2009-03-12,McGill,Palestine,"Recent conflict closes the border, restricting aid workers and goods from reaching Gaza
Ehab Lotayef, a Montreal writer, activist, and engineer arrived in Gaza on February 19 after two unsuccessful weeks of trying to cross the Egypt-Palestine border, which was closed during recent conflict.
According to Lotayef, Egyptian control of the crossing has made access to Gaza unpredictable, leaving many aid workers and activists stranded at the border for days on end. He said, however, that government at the crossing can be swayed by the presence of large groups, because they do not want to see too many international travellers stranded at the border.
“It is very difficult to cross the border. You have no recourse. If they decide the borders are closed, there is nothing you can do about it,” Lotayef said in an interview from Gaza.
Lotayef was repeatedly turned away from the border until he joined a delegation of 60 aid workers organized by CODEPINK – a women-initiated grassroots peace and social justice movement. The delegation was the first of its size to cross the border since July 2007.
He noted that border restrictions have had a severe impact on civilians, as all goods entering the region are now brought through tunnels – resulting in skyrocketing inflation.
“The needs of the people of Gaza are not satisfied…. These tunnels also support weapons smuggling. If you want to stifle the tunnels, then open the borders. It would be much more difficult to smuggle weapons across an official and legally monitored border,” Lotayef said.
His real work will begin now that he is in Gaza. Delegations such as CODEPINK allow activists from around the world to collect photographs and first-hand accounts of their experiences, so that they can be taken back to their local communities.
Mohamed Boudjenane of the Canadian Arab Federation – one of the groups sponsoring Lotayef’s travel – commented, “Lotayef is well-respected within the Canadian humanitarian community. By sending someone like Lotayef, we will have a first-hand report of what is taking place in Gaza.”
Lotayef said he has spent his time connecting with Gazans, documenting cases, taking photographs, and blogging in order to better inform Canadians about the current humanitarian crisis.
“The devastation is enormous. I believed that I had a good idea of what the devastation was like, but over the last few days I have seen more destruction than I expected: of agricultural areas, houses, and city centres. In the north of the Gaza Strip, the American School of Gaza has been completely flattened,” he said.
“I met a 12-year-old who told me how many of his friends had died in the conflict. He told me, ‘I don’t want to make friends anymore; it is too painful when the die.’ This alone was the most striking moment for me so far. I just froze; I didn’t know what to say.”
The CODEPINK delegation is composed of 50 women and ten men from the United States, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Turkey, and Egypt. They were joined by the Viva Palestina Caravan led by British MP George Galloway that arrived March 9, after travelling 5,000 miles from Hyde Park in London.
According to Lotayef, the arrival of both these delegations has helped to uplift spirits in Gaza for the moment.
“The Palestinian people need to see that there are people in the world far away, people of different colours and nationalities that understand their plight and support them in their struggle.”

2009-03-26,McGill,Palestine,"Bassem Eid is a Palestinian journalist and Executive Director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) – an independent organization founded in 1996 that provides impartial documentation of human rights violations by Palestinian political factions. PHRMG monitors Hamas, the militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, as well as its rival Fatah, which controls the West Bank and maintains a much closer relationship with Western governments. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both frequently draw information from PHRMG reports. Eid was awarded the Litvack Award by McGill in 1996, and has returned to Montreal to deliver a speech on human rights at the McGill Law Faculty tomorrow. The Daily caught up with Eid to get details on the Hamas-Fatah rivalry, the isolation of Gaza, and honour killings in Palestine.
McGill Daily: In your talk on Friday, the press release said you will discuss human rights violations by Fatah and Hamas. What have the recent trends been?
Bassem Eid:  The human rights record is very disturbing from both sides – Hamas or Fatah. When Hamas starts arresting Fatah people in Gaza, immediately Fatah in the West Bank starts arresting Hamas. When a Fatah prisoner in Gaza dies as a result of torture in Gaza, immediately the security forces in the West Bank start torturing someone to bring them to their death. The quality and quantity of human rights violations is equal on Fatah and Hamas sides. While Israel is bombing, shelling, and killing in Gaza, there are still armed gangsters from Hamas running after Fatah members, to kill them [as] so-called collaborators. Unfortunately the international community today [speaks much more] about Hamas human rights violations rather than Fatah.
MD: The PHRMG has many programs to monitor human rights – but what does the day-to-day fieldwork involve?
BE: For over a year and a half, Hamas has ruled Gaza. We really don’t have access to some information, especially when we are talking about honour killings, which is a very wide phenomenon in the Gaza Strip – even more than in the West Bank. We have another phenomenon: the killing of suspected collaborators in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas police. It becomes very difficult to investigate all these incidents. Sometimes besides the name and age of the person and date of death, we have no information.
MD: What about your experiences in the field? Have they been tedious or draining?
BE: To create human rights under this regime is not so easy…especially [because] the Arab government looks at human rights activists sometimes as spies, or [thinks] that they are in touch with the enemy…. The response is just to defame, to slander the organization rather than to give facts on what the report is talking about. We know about Syrian human rights activists who [have spent] almost over seven years in jail. In January 1996, I was arrested by Arafat’s order, but I was so lucky. I spent only 25 hours in jail.
MD: Why are there more honour killings in Gaza than in the West Bank?
BE: I think the West Bank is much more educated than the Gaza Strip. The West Bankers –  I consider them a multicultural people. A lot of foreigners are in touch with [them]. More West Bankers are travelling for education in Western countries. That’s [reflected] in their mentality, [and their] culture.  The most important thing is that in the West Bank people are less and less religious.
[For instance], a very courageous initiative began recently to put out a report on Palestinian gays and lesbians – which is not an easy step, because these things are completely prohibited by Islam. We started investigating this phenomenon mainly in the West Bank, but we couldn’t speak about it in the Gaza Strip. [Homosexuality] happens completely secretly within Palestinian society, so we are unable right now to [show] examples [of what] gay people or lesbians think about society, the laws.
MD: I read that the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to meet Israeli security demands has led them to illegally detain many of their own people. Can you comment on that?
BE:  The problem is that the international community tries to put more and more pressure on the PA [to increase] security – and security means that anything related to security must be coordinated with the Israelis. Now what does this mean? Sometimes they are much [better than Palestinians] at collecting secret information, that X is committing a suicide in Nablus. Now Israel doesn’t  want to invade Nablus, so they inform the PA, and they bring them to jail. As a human rights activist, I probably can live with that because I don’t want people to commit suicide, but on other side, what I am against is how they keep these people sometimes for months, years, without investigation, a fair trial, or without any judgement. Our problem is the lack of justice which is implemented by PA on the political detainees.
MD: You’ve written about a “one state” solution. Do you support it?
BE: I never supported it because I don’t think Israelis will agree on it. Israel is seeking a Jewish state, so with a one state solution, Israel [would] kill its dream. But Israel also refuses to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders, so what is the solution?…. I don’t believe in [the one state solution], but it looks like [over] the years it [has become] the only solution between Israel and Palestine.
MD: What will you discuss at your talk tomorrow?
BE: The Palestinian judicial system, and how it has to be reformed. Two years ago we received a fund for a proposal [to reform] the Palestinian judicial system from Japan. We conducted 12 different workshops in the West Bank, with law students from different universities, retired judges,  lawyers, and even some people from the security forces. People [are] very angry  [with] the Palestinian judicial system for one reason: this judicial system, which used to be an independent system, hasn’t really [been] independent under the PA. This is a problem, because rule of law will never be implemented without an independent judiciary system.
Bassem Eid will speak tomorrow from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Chancellor Day Hall, 3644 Rue Peel. A light lunch will be served.

2009-08-17,McGill,Palestine,"More than 50 Montrealers braved the chill last night at a downtown vigil in support of the people of the Gaza Strip, who are suffering under an Israeli blockade that has severely restricted their access to food, water, fuel, and electricity.
Held on Ste. Catherine Street across from the Bay, the candlelit vigil brought in supporters from a range of organizations calling for the end of the Gaza blockade, and for Canada to put pressure on the Israeli government.
“It’s very cold here, but it’s nothing compared to what the people in Gaza are going through right now,” said Mohamed Kamel, a member of the Canadian Muslim Forum, to the small crowd.
Last Wednesday, Israel launched military incursions into Gaza and on Thursday imposed an embargo, saying it was punishment for rockets fired over the border by Palestinian militants.
John Dugard, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian Territories, last week called the Israeli military operations war crimes that violated the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law. In September 2007, Israeli declared Gaza a “hostile entity” and has threatened a full-scale invasion.
Israel eased the blockade on Tuesday to allow some delivery of goods, but quickly strengthened it again. Yesterday, tens of thousands of Gaza residents flooded into Egypt to buy food and fuel after Palestinian militants breached the border walls.
“Gaza, it’s a prison… People cannot go out of it, they cannot fly in or out,” said Jean Gravend, a member of Palestinians and Jews United at the Montreal demonstration.
The European Union and many Arab countries have condemned the blockade, warning that it is hastening a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The European external relations commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said the Israeli actions constitute “collective punishment.”
At yesterday’s demonstration, Gravend and others called for Canada to also condemn Israel’s actions.
“We are an accomplice if we do not protest and try to change things,” Gravend said.
Feroz Mehdi, a member of Alternatives International, said grassroots actions such as the vigil were crucial for disseminating information, and for pushing the Canadian government to act.
“We have to impress upon the Canadian government that it’s got to get its act together, and call this a humanitarian crisis,” Mehdi said. “There are 1.4 million people in Gaza. These people are not terrorists; they’re ordinary people trying to live.”
Israeli military operations since last week have killed 40 Palestinians, at least 10 of them civilians. Palestinian militants killed an Ecuadorian kibbutz volunteer last week.
A coalition of various Palestinian groups organized the event, including the Coalition for Peace and Justice in Palestine, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, Palestinians and Jews United, and Alternatives.
Also at the vigil were members of the Confederation des syndicats nationaux (CSN), Quebec’s largest trade union, and CEGEP teachers.
Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and other groups are planning a larger demonstration for tomorrow, starting at 2 p.m. at Concordia’s Hall Building.

2009-10-01,McGill,Palestine,"Superior Court Justice rules that Bil’in land dispute should be heard in Israel
On September 18, the Superior Court of Quebec dismissed a lawsuit brought against two Quebec-registered companies by the West Bank village of Bil’in. This lawsuit claimed that the two companies were complicit in Israeli war crimes.
In this first ever application of Canada’s War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Act to a civil case, Justice Louis-Paul Cullen’s judgment stated that it “would clearly be more practical to try the action in Israel rather than in Quebec.”
He also stated that the plaintiffs, the Bil’in Village Council, had not presented sufficient evidence to suggest that the case could not be heard in Israel in a fair and impartial manner.
The two Montreal-based companies, Green Park International Inc. and Green Mount International Inc., are both based in Montreal, and have been contracted to construct high-rise apartment buildings and houses in the Israeli settlement of Modi’in Illit, which is adjacent to the village of Bil’in.
The Bil’in Village Council disputes the companies’ claim to the land and insists that the construction of the settlement, as well as the surrounding security barrier, have cut them off from the bulk of their farmlands and olive groves.
Mark Arnold, the attorney who represented the Bil’in Village Council at the proceedings in mid-June, stated that Cullen’s ruling – a forum non conveniens in legal jargon – was “an error of law.”
“The Quebec Superior Court has jurisdiction over Quebec companies and directors who are residing in Quebec. To suggest that it goes to the Israeli High Court of Justice is simply an error,” said Arnold.
The plaintiffs moreover claimed that the two companies are complicit in Israel’s violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a signatory, and which states that in cases of military occupation, “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.”
“What that means in the Israel-Palestine context,” Arnold said, “is that Israel, the occupier of the West Bank, cannot be removing West Bank population and replacing it with Israeli population. To do so is a war crime.”
He added that Israeli courts have never heard a case based on the Fourth Geneva Convention, and that Cullen’s decision indicated a skewed perception of the Israeli legal system.
“The problem is that [Cullen] is fundamentally wrong. The Israeli High Court of Justice will not hear this case, so he has sent this case into oblivion.”
But despite the Judge’s dismissal of the suit, Arnold said that the Superior Court’s decision to hear a civil cause of action for the commission of a war crime has set an important precedent.
“[The Judge] said in theory you could have a civil claim brought in Quebec for the commission of a war crime. But in this case, he said, the Israeli court is better suited to hear the case,” said Arnold.
Ronald Levy, the attorney representing the two corporations, said that his clients had legitimately acquired the rights to develop the land when they purchased it from another company, which in turn, he said, bought it from its Palestinian proprietor.
Levy added that the two corporations had refused to register their title to the land for fear that the proprietor would be subject to violent attacks from other Palestinians.
“They stopped registration to save the lives of Arabs from whom they purchased land,” Levy said.
Levy refused to comment on the judgment due to the possibility of an appeal, but did state that any future land claims cases brought by the Village Council to the High Court of Justice of Israel “would be, as they have in the past, properly and impartially dealt with.”
Arnold, however, was skeptical of the judgment’s faith that the case would ever be fairly litigated in Israeli court, and added that the Quebec Superior Court was the appropriate venue for such a proceeding.
“The Green Park company has no presence in Israel, it’s not incorporated in Israel, it carries on no business in Israel. And the village of Bil’in has no presence in Israel; it’s located in the West Bank. And the director of the Green Park company, who lives in Quebec, has no connection to Israel,” Arnold said.
The Bil’in Village Council remains in discussion with Arnold on whether to pursue further legal action in Quebec’s Court of Appeals.
Bil’in has garnered increasing attention in the international media since its residents began staging weekly protests against the Israeli military occupation over four years ago. The demonstrations are regularly broken up when the Israeli military fires upon them with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Mohammed Khatib, a member of the Bil’in Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements, visited Canada during the summer to participate in a speaking tour with Arnold. Upon returning to his home in the West Bank, he was imprisoned by Israeli authorities for over a week.
“[The speaking tour] was aiming to mobilize support for the struggle of this village and also in general for the Palestinian popular resistance movement,” local activist and Tadamon! member Stefan Christoff said.
Christoff asserted that the Israeli army has stepped up its nighttime raids on the village in response to the Council’s legal actions.
“It was only after they visited Canada and spoke publicly in Canada across the country to major media – during [which] CBC and the Toronto Star published interviews with Mohammed [Khatib] – that Israeli military forces started [increased] nighttime raids on the village,” Christoff said.

2009-11-12,McGill,Palestine,"SPHR-McGill discussion explores options for peace
Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR-McGill) held a panel discussion Tuesday called Israel & Palestine: The Next Step. The panelists included McGill political science professor Rex Brynen, Concordia political science professor Eric Abitbol, and Professor Jim Joyce of John Abbott College. The three professors discussed a variety of obstacles to peace – including ongoing settlement expansion, Israeli monopolization of West Bank water aquifers, and increasing religious fanaticism on both sides of the conflict. The Daily sat down with Abitbol, who specializes in peace studies and global governance, and Joyce, who is also Amnesty International Canada’s Coordinator for Israel and Palestine, to discuss the way forward for both nations.
—————————————-
Interview with Eric Abtibol, Concordia political science professor
McGill Daily: During yesterday’s panel discussion, you mentioned the idea of a conflict ethos existing in Israeli and Palestinian society. What exactly is a conflict ethos in this context?
Eric Abitbol: I would define it as an attachment to a particular interpretation of the conflict, and to a sense of victimization. It is a need for a strong sense of self-sufficiency, unity, and emancipation rooted in exclusivity and collective security, and a sense of delegitimization of the other.
MD: How can Israelis and Palestinians get past this mentality?
EA: By creating relational spaces with one another, in ideology and in practice, that reflect the desire to cultivate cross-boundary relationships, and by constructing, on the level of the imaginaire, a picture of future peace in the region.
MD: What are some of the organizations involved in this process, and what is their potential?
EA: I am particularly inspired by three of these organizations…. These three, specifically, are Friends of the Earth Middle East, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, and the Israel-Palestine Centre for Research and Information.
These organizations, and others like them, situate their efforts on a trans-boundary level. They contribute to constructing a trans-boundary base of knowledge. They work at a grassroots level, and deal with eco-political sustainability as well as peace education. They engage in a relationship of advocacy and lobbying, and do a great deal of intra-civil society work.
They reflect very much the discourse of cultivating a political agenda with the “other” instead of in opposition to the “other,” and as such it can be argued that they are in the process of contributing to the development of a trans-boundary community, incorporating Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians, and others in the region and worldwide. These organizations are doing some of the grassroots and multi-sectoral work that encompasses slowly building a security community.
MD: In what ways can this culture of dialogue enter the mainstream of Israeli and Palestinian civil society and government?
EA: There are many obstacles to making this an effective political movement. In a sense, we can begin by imagining how we may dismantle these obstacles…. There is a lack of inclusive regional civil space. Regional and international funders must attempt to build this.
Other obstacles include separatist visions of peace, militant terrorist attacks, and continued settlement activities.
The issue of leadership in civil society is very important. There are grassroots leaders who are taking risks and trying to facilitate dialogical encounters. We need this leadership to expand to encompass inter-generational work in the spirit of this culture. As well, these trans-boundary communities need to lobby the government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas in order to eliminate specific obstacles.
The transformation of the attitudes and imagination of a society takes place through risk-taking. Individuals need to recognize their participation in political culture, and take the risks of encountering the other, without simply accepting societal frameworks of how to relate to the other, and do this in places that are both comfortable and uncomfortable. People need to set the table for dialogue, and take place in encounters where the table is set by the other, as well. If we can begin to do this, we can begin to transgress some of the material and ideological objects that prevent a culture of dialogue. This culture has the capacity to influence and shape dominant political relationships.

Interview with Jim Joyce, John Abbott College professor and Amnesty International expert
McGill Daily: During the SPHR panel discussion you mentioned the possibility of a “shared Jerusalem” and a more dynamic version of a two-state solution. Can you elaborate?
Jim Joyce: While Amnesty International as a organization will not express views about what are desirable political outcomes, it will continue to comment about such outcomes inasmuch as they are consistent or not with the human rights agenda. The human rights of one individual cannot be founded on the loss of rights of another individual. In the conflict over the final status of Jerusalem, partisans on both sides make maximum claims to the city, exclusive of the other.  Within proposed two-state solutions, there is the assumption of a divided city, perhaps enshrining the green line between West and East Jerusalem.  A third – or fourth – proposal would return to the original conception within UN Resolution 181 of a “shared” city, an international city, open to the citizens of both Israel and Palestine.
MD: Do you think it is more important to be critical of the injustices committed by Hamas and the Israeli government, or to push forward with a purely “relational” approach, as recommended by Eric Abitol?
JJ: Amnesty International, basing its work on a commitment to international human rights standards, understands that Israelis and Palestinians themselves must define and develop the human rights principles that will provide a just and durable foundation for peace.  To account for past human rights violations should be part of the same process. The cycle of violence of the past decades has permitted both sides to justify their next act of violence as a legitimate response to the act of violence of the other side. The Goldstone Report, by calling for both the Government of Israel and the Hamas de facto administration in Gaza to undertake credible, impartial investigations of the possible war crimes committed in Gaza and southern Israel from December 2008 to January 2009, is an important step forward in ending the impunity which has so long fed the cycle of violence.  Peace based upon justice would be served, not hindered, by such a process.
MD: The panel discussions did not touch on the influence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the wider Middle East region. What impact do you think the currently stalled negotiations will have on other countries in the area?
JJ: The State of Israel is not currently recognized by most countries in the region.  Its borders with Lebanon and Syria are not mutually agreed upon.  The territorial integrity of a possible Palestinian state is not determined. In the Madrid Process of the early nineties, the rights of Palestinian refugees were part of the discussion as well as the bilateral relations between countries – Lebanon-Israel, Syria-Israel, as well as the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.  In all subsequent bilateral Palestinian-Israeli talks, the concerns about Palestinian refugees have been pushed to the side, and no agreement has been reached.  Canada undertook within the Madrid Process responsibility for guiding possible outcomes on the refugee issue – and made considerable progress on possible mechanisms.  This work was put on the back burner when the Oslo Process became the only game in town.  Oh yes, the Israelis and Jordanians did achieve mutual recognition after the Madrid Process.  The ongoing “peace process” between Israelis and Palestinians will continue to flounder until it is located in a truly and fully regional context.

2009-11-19,McGill,Palestine,"A discussion of Abdelrazik’s six-year exile in Sudan, and Canada’s  complicity in his imprisonment and interrogation
Abousfian Abdelrazik is a Sudanese-born Canadian citizen who recently returned to Canada after being stranded in Sudan from 2003 to 2009.
Detained, interrogated, and tortured by Sudanese authorities in Khartoum after being profiled by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Abdelrazik was denied the right to return to Canada by successive governments – a clear violation of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which outlines that “every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada.”
Barred from returning to Canada, Abdelrazik’s six years in exile point to a wider context in which multiple Canadian citizens, including Maher Arar in Syria, faced torture and imprisonment abroad resulting from racial profiling by Canadian and U.S. security and intelligence agencies. In Sudan, Canadian CSIS agents interrogated Abdelrazik in the very same Sudanese prison where Sudanese military officials carried out violent torture against him.
In 2008, he took refuge in the Canadian embassy in Khartoum in coordination with an Ottawa-based legal support team, while a grassroots campaign for Abdelrazik’s return quickly spread to communities across Canada lead by the Montreal-based Project Fly Home.
A solidarity campaign with Abdelrazik quickly developed across Canada to apply pressure on the Conservative government to immediately return Abdelrazik to Canada, culminating in April 2009, when activists purchased a return ticket for Abdelrazik, a condition fixed by the Conservative government in order for emergency travel documents to be issued for Abdelrazik to travel home to Canada. Conservative foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon went back on the previously expressed conditions for Abdelrazik’s return – refusing to issue an emergency passport – a move that led a Federal Court judge to order the government to return Abdelrazik to Canada in a landmark decision in June 2009.
In the Federal Court decision that forced the Conservatives to issue emergency travel documents to Abdelrazik, Judge Russel Zinn described him as a “prisoner in a foreign land” and “as much a victim of international terrorism as the innocent persons whose lives have been taken by recent barbaric acts of terrorists.” Zinn also highlighted the direct involvement of CSIS in Abdelrazik’s arrest, detention, and torture in Sudan.
Today, Abdelrazik continues to struggle for justice, and is calling for his name to be removed from the 1267 UN terror watch list, a list basued not on law but on association and profiling administered by the UN Security Council, to which Abdelrazik was added at the request of the Bush administration without evidence or trial in 2006. Although Abdelrazik has returned to Canada, regular citizenship rights, including social services, education, and health care are not accessible to him due to Canada’s enforcement of the UN 1267 list.
Stefan Christoff:  It was a long struggle to force the Canadian government to respect your right to return to Canada and today your struggle is not over. Can you explain?
Abousfian Abdelrazik: Absolutely. It is not over because still I am on the UN 1267 list. Now it is a huge struggle to fight to be removed from that list as it prevents me from living as a normal person, a normal citizen.
SC: Being on the UN 1267 list means you face a complete asset freeze, barring you from receiving a salary for your work, accessing social assistance or medical care, things that many take for granted in Montreal. Can you explain how the UN 1267 list is impacting your life in Canada despite returning to Canada after exile in Sudan?
AA: Canada’s government should help me to be removed from this list. Actually it is the responsibility for the government in Ottawa to appeal for me to be removed from this list after everything that happened in Sudan.
Although I am back in Montreal, I am not free.  I can walk on the streets in Montreal but it is not possible for me to live a normal life. The 1267 list puts me in another prison. I can’t work and I can’t access health care. Today I continue to face injustice. Canada needs to appeal for me to be de-listed immediately from the UN 1267 list. I want my full human rights.
SC: For many, the fact that CSIS has a direct responsibility to your imprisonment and torture in Sudan is surprising. Throughout your recent speaking tour across Canada, you have spoken very openly on the direct role the CSIS and the government of Canada played in your imprisonment and torture in Sudan. Can you explain?
AA: After my lawyers received government documents on my case, it became totally clear that the Canadian government in Ottawa and CSIS were directly involved in my detention without trial or charge in Sudan. I was jailed in Sudan because of CSIS; my torture is directly tied to the Canadian government.
SC: Canadian officials visited you during the very same period that you were in prison and facing torture in Sudan. What did these Canadian officials do to assist you?
AA: I was actually interrogated by two CSIS agents in prison in Sudan, in the same prison where I was being tortured, hung from the door frame, beaten with a rubber hose, slapped, and punched. CSIS interrogated me, asking the very same questions as the Sudanese secret police. The CSIS officials knew about my torture and were directly linked to it.
SC: Do you feel that the Canadian government officials involved in your case need to be held accountable?
AA: All those people who played a role in this matter, in my exile in Sudan, in my torture and imprisonment, must face justice.
SC: It must be difficult for you to put into words what you experienced in Sudan. I remember right after you returned from Sudan, you explained that you wanted to make sure no one else experiences what you experienced, that your experience shouldn’t happen to anyone else ever again. Is this why you continue to campaign today?
AA: Really I want to end torture and prisons; I want to be the last victim that experienced such horrible things. I must struggle for this to be reality.
SC: Some who experience torture take years to gather the courage to speak out and campaign publicly, but you chose to speak out on the very same night that you returned to Canada and continue to campaign for justice; explain why.
AA: The experiences that I went though in Sudan were really awful. It is so hard to describe; I want to make sure that no one experiences the same thing ever again. I will continue with my tour across Canada this winter; I will continue to tell people across Canada my story.  I want torture to stop completely, for it to never happen to anyone else anywhere in the world.
SC: Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Convention against Torture, a very important piece of international legislation, but instead of defending your rights in the Sudanese prison where you were tortured, CSIS agents interrogated you in the very same prison in which you were being tortured. At one point in Khartoum, a Conservative MP, Deepak Obhrai, also interrogated you. What do you have to stay to the Conservative government in Ottawa after your experiences?
AA: Representatives from the Conservative government came to Sudan and interrogated me in the Canadian embassy – which is horrible. MP Deepak Obhrai interrogated me rather than helping a fellow Canadian citizen. This is horrible behaviour from the government and must be stopped.
SC: How did this experience make you feel while being stranded in Sudan?
AA: Actually I expected the government to come to help me after being released from prison in Sudan and living at the Canadian embassy struggling to go back to Canada. I expected the MPs who visited to help me, not to interrogate me.
I felt that all hope was gone at that time, because the people who were supposed to help me, the Canadian government, instead interrogated me, which actually made me lose all hope. Obhrai asked me my opinion on Palestine, on Israel, on bin Laden – not talking to me about my own situation as a Canadian stranded in Sudan.
SC: You lived many months in the Canadian embassy in Khartoum. Can you explain this period?
AA: It was very difficult to stay in the Canadian embassy – very, very difficult. Cameras watching you all day and all night, monitoring every movement. Having your life monitored at the embassy and not being able to go anywhere was so difficult, just staying night after night at the embassy compound without any support from the Canadian government to return. For me, staying at the embassy was like another prison because I had to stay 24 hours a day within the embassy compound.
Staying at the embassy was mental torture; embassy staff were always pressuring me to leave. Actually the embassy staff who tried to help me were fired, especially the local staff from Sudan. [They were] fired for just bringing some food for me to eat.
SC: When you made that choice to enter the Canadian embassy in Sudan, you were looking for protection?
AA: Yes, absolutely. After I entered the embassy in Khartoum, from the moment that I told the embassy staff that I was staying and gave them a letter from my lawyer in Canada, they treated me very badly, especially the consular official Eric O’Connor.
SC: In April 2009 many people across the country came together, buying you a plane ticket back to Canada, a condition issued by the government for you to return to Canada, for you to secure your own ticket. Although the ticket was secured by activists in Canada, your hopes were dashed – as the government didn’t issue you travel documents. Can you talk about how you felt following the pressure from the grassroots in Canada calling on the government to return you to Canada?
AA: [I spoke] with my lawyers and supporters quite often over the phone. I heard about the protests in Montreal and other cities in Canada. Actually it is hard for me to describe how much this meant to me.
SC: Back in Canada, you have had an opportunity to connect with the grassroots activists who worked to educate people about your forced exile in Sudan and held street protests while you were in Khartoum. How has it been for you to connect with the people in Canada who fought for your return?
AA: Actually I am very glad to meet the people who supported me across Canada. While living at the Canadian embassy in Khartoum, activists from Montreal called me, expressing their support. This gave me strength to continue to remain at the embassy and fight to return.
Officials at the Canadian embassy really pressured me to leave and treated me badly, but knowing that the people of Canada were supporting me gave me spirit to continue. I slept in the bathroom at the embassy for many months. This was so difficult and humiliating. The bathroom at the embassy was my room after years in prison and torture in Sudan.
After coming back to Montreal I have connected with the activists that supported me. I am so glad to see them and to know them today.

2010-02-11,McGill,Palestine,"Motion to create corporate responsibility committee passes without Palestine reference
The Winter 2010 General Assembly (GA) approved five motions on Wednesday, mandating that SSMU divest from the tar sands, support a cap on ancillary fees at McGill, restore $5 ATMs, create a corporate social responsibility committee (CSR) to oversee McGill investments, and take an active policy against the self-funded tuition model. A motion originally banning pro-life groups from campus failed, in spite of numerous proposed amendments.
While several SSMU councillors said they were happy that all motions were discussed and that the GA maintained quorum, some were less pleased by the actual debate. SSMU VP (Clubs & Services) Sarah Olle said that she was “upset by the lack of constructive dialogue that was had and I think our community, as demonstrated today, is just incredibly divided about issues external to the University, and I wish that people could focus more on the university experience itself and bringing people together.”
Arts Senator Sarah Woolf described the GA’s proceedings as “messy,” and was “disgusted and depressed with how the beginning of the GA went,” but added that the structure is constantly being improved, and was pleased that students stayed to see every motion through. “I don’t think this is the death knell of the GA,” she said.
At its peak, the GA exceeded the capacity of the Shatner cafeteria, with over 600 students present. The CSR motion, which referred to the the occupied Palestinian territories in its preamble, contributed to the sizable turnout, but also prompted Speaker Zach Newburgh to issue warnings to students about adhering to decorum soon after the call to order.
Twenty minutes into procedure, the GA was bombarded with complaints about the inability to hear speakers, repeated calls for decorum, and motions to reconsider almost every decision made, leading to a record five-hour duration.
Before debate could begin, the agenda was amended to move the CSR motion to the top of the docket. After Khaled K, the motion’s author and an executive for Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights – McGill (SPHR), spoke in favour of the motion, an amendment was passed to strike two clauses in the motion’s introduction.
The clauses specified that McGill has ties to “organizations that engage in and profit from unethical practices including but not limited to profiting from the unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”
Debate quickly became heated during discussion of the amendment and the motion; one student was asked to put away their Israeli flag while another accused Newburgh of a conflict of interest as SSMU speaker, because he is president of Hillel Montreal and his roommate is president of Hillel McGill.
An inability to estimate majority decisions during discussions of the amendment led to an hour and a half of inaction as various votes were counted to strike clauses, and then to reconsider the decision to strike. Debate resumed, and after a failed attempt to adjourn the GA altogether, a simple majority vote passed the motion, without reference to occupied Palestine.
Prior to the GA, the Facebook account of a member of SPHR was hacked, and a message was sent to members of SPHR’s GA event claiming that voting had moved online, including a link to Elections McGill. SPHR coordinators and SSMU executives took immediate action to correct the misunderstanding.
The motion against McGill adopting a self-funded tuition model was moved by SSMU VP (External) Sebastian Ronderos-Morgan.
During his motivation speech, Ronderos-Morgan pointed to other Canadian universities’ substantial tuition increases, and saw McGill’s attempt toward a self-funded model as a sign that they were making a “serious statement about what it sees as means necessary to balance the budget.”
The motion passed, quickly followed by a motion to reinstitute $5 ATMs on campus, and a motion demanding SSMU’s refusal to accept mandatory ancillary fees. Both were debated for several minutes.
A motion calling for SSMU to investigate investments with ties to tar sands in Alberta was passed by a simple majority, despite debate about the economic feasibility of the motion and a failed amendment which would have eliminated references to the financial institutions with ties to the tar sands. SSMU currently owns over $230,000 in bonds with the Royal Bank of Canada, which finances tar sands projects. SSMU councillor Joël Pednault recommended SSMU move its investments to banks like Desjardins, which does not finance such projects.
The final motion, on banning discriminatory groups on campus, was led by statements from authors Maddie Ritts and Liam Olson-Mayes explaining their choice to single out pro-life groups, stating that they are necessarily discriminatory and that “by allowing pro-life groups, we condone and accept their position,” and targeting the Silent No More campaign. After extensive debate and votes on multiple amendments, including one to strike direct reference to pro-life groups in the resolution, the entire resolution failed to pass.

2010-02-11,McGill,Palestine,"Muslim Students Association calls for apology
An email regarding security at club events has some students accusing administrators of prejudice, SSMU execs calling for a reformed policy on room bookings, and the administration insisting the whole thing was a misunderstanding.
In an email sent on February 2, McGill events administrator Debbie Yacoulis asked SSMU VP (Clubs and Services) Sarah Olle to provide advance warning of any events held by QPIRG, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), and the Muslim Students’ Association (MSA). Yacoulis claimed that advance time was needed to grant these groups security clearance for their events.
Olle forwarded the email to members of the three organizations mentioned. The message came as a surprise to the MSA. The group is currently drafting a request for a formal apology.
“Our events are never controversial and we never have problems. Most of our events are [attended by] Muslims coming for more knowledge,” said Anais Massot, VP (External) for the MSA.
Massot has been with the MSA for three years and could not recall any group events where extra security was needed.
Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson explained that the email did not reflect University policy, which mandates that security needs are to be determined on an event-by-event basis
“I don’t see it as being an issue; I see it as being a mistake,” Mendelson said.
Yacoulis emailed Olle after learning that the MSA planned to host a lecture entitled “The Essentials of Islamic Knowledge and Practice.”
Olle is familiar with the University’s event-by-event policy and said that the email from Yacoulis was confusing.
“It’s always been on a per event basis, which I think is a good system because you can’t assume that just because a group is a certain group, its events will be a certain way,” Olle said.
Jim Nicell, McGill’s Associate Vice-Principal (University Services), echoed Mendelson’s statement, reaffirming the University’s per event security policy.
“The message that was delivered was incorrect and did not represent in any way the position of this University in the way that we deal with events,” Nicell said.
Khaled Kteily, SPHR VP (Membership and Development) believed the three groups were singled out because of their pro-Palestinian stances on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
“The only commonality that I can see here is that these [three] organizations are supportive of what is happening in Palestine,” Kteily said.
Massot saw a similar trend. “SPHR is pro-Palestinian, QPIRG does a lot of events that are [pro-Palestinian]…and we’re Muslim, so I guess we fall into that category as well,” she said.
Anna Malla, QPIRG’s internal coordinator, was upset but not particularly surprised upon reading the email.
“I know that we do get profiled to a certain degree, but the degree to which this is a situation of actual racial profiling of speakers really shocked me. They specifically have been flagging events that have Palestinian speakers,” Malla said.
Rebecca Dooley, VP (University Affairs) indicated that other groups have been profiled by the administration. Dooley described a “human tunnel” of security guards at the Senate meeting where the university’s research policy was discussed. The issue attracted students opposed to military research on campus. Dooley said the increased security presence was likely brought in to restrain these students.
“They weren’t violent, but it was just assumed that students with that sort of opinion were going to be aggressive, and violent, and disruptive,” Dooley said.
When security is required at events, the club must cover the additional costs.
Kteily said this was an unfair burden to place on clubs.
“If they are going to mandate additional security guards, the very least that could be done is that McGill cover these costs. Realistically, we are dealing with a budget that is in the thousands of dollars at best,” Kteily said.
Nicell stood by the University’s policy.
“At a certain point, if there’s no subsidies available for carrying out those events, it’s going to have to be carried by the group itself,” Nicell said.
For Olle, the initial email points to problems with the University’s policy that extend beyond the cost of security. Olle explained that since policies are developed by high-ranking administrators, the actual regulations are not always communicated effectively to the people who help clubs book events.
For instance, Olle also mentioned an email she received from an administrative assistant who referred to Choose Life as “Abortion McGill.”
Olle said she sees this as indicative of inadequate knowledge of clubs among lower-level administrators.
“The knowledge trickle-down about what’s happening gets very convoluted when it gets to those lower levels,” Olle said. “I hope that this does continue to push the University to come up with a more comprehensive, clear policy about events on campus…because I just think this is just another example to show that what they’re doing right now doesn’t work.”

2010-03-04,McGill,Palestine,"Signatories support boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israeli government
On February 25, Montreal-based Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! announced that 500 local artists had signed a declaration of support for the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against what they call Israel’s apartheid policies against Palestinians.
The statement argues that there are parallels between South Africa and Israel’s systems of segregation, and that support for the Palestinian struggle for human and civil rights should mirror the international anti-apartheid movement of the 1970s and eighties.
“A matrix of Israeli-only roads, electrified fences, and over 500 military checkpoints and roadblocks erase freedom of movement for Palestinians,” it states. “Israel’s apartheid wall, which was condemned by the International Court of Justice in 2004, cuts through Palestinian lands, further annexing Palestinian territory.”
The statement goes on to reference the Israeli military’s blockade of the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip, which has been ongoing since 2007. “Israel continues to impose collective punishment on the 1.5 million Palestinians of Gaza, who still face chronic shortages of electricity, fuel, food, and basic necessities.”
“These 500 artists signify a very critical shift in our society: a shift toward questioning in many ways the Israeli government and its policies and Canada’s support for Israel and Israel’s policy of occupation and apartheid,” said photographer and Tadamon! member Stefan Christoff.
He added that the artists are not calling for the boycott of Israel to be all-encompassing. “Is this a boycott of all Israeli artists? No. It should be on a case-by-case basis. It should target institutional structures,” he said.
The BDS movement began following a 2005 request by Palestinian civil society groups that Israel conform to international law by withdrawing from the Arab territories it annexed in 1967, and by permitting the return of Palestinian refugees to the homes they lost in 1948.
Several of the artists in attendance stated that support for the BDS movement has become necessary due in part to the Canadian government’s unwavering support for Israel.
“I think the BDS movement is something that will permit us to slowly take back the reins of control and help pull back the money that is flowing into the government that is propelling this occupation,” said Yassin Alsalman, a local hip-hop artist who goes by the anonym The Narcicyst.
Fortner Anderson, a poet who also signed the declaration, echoed Alsalman’s statement, and added that the letter should be seen as a first step in a broader, global movement.
“The 500 Montreal artists, who create the climate of ideas that we live in, have said enough is enough – something must be done,” he said. “This cannot be left to the governments because the governments are incapable of resolving the problem.”
Freda Guttman, an installation artist and Tadamon! member, said that the 500 signatures were a significant accomplishment given the pressures artists often face from their patrons.
“There are people who wanted to [sign the letter] but couldn’t to protect their jobs,” she said. “[Blacklisting] is happening more and more because Israel realizes it’s working.”
Anderson agreed that the political statements artists make can adversely affect their professional lives. “A lot of artists in Canada survive entirely off government largess, so for people to take positions like this can, for some, be of concern,” he said.
The list of signatories includes members of local bands Kalmunity Vibe Collective, Nomadic Massive, Silver Mt. Zion, and The United Steelworkers of Montreal.

2010-04-12,McGill,Palestine,"SPHR accused of defamation of character
Incoming SSMU president Zach Newburgh threatened to take legal action against McGill’s chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) on April 3 if the group refused to drop their Judicial Board hearing within 48 hours, according to two sources.
SPHR allowed the deadline to expire, and the Judicial Board meeting went ahead as scheduled Friday night. As the Daily went to press, a lawsuit had not been filed.
SPHR called for a Judicial Board hearing on March 17, accusing Newburgh of bias while chairing the February 10 General Assembly (GA).
The Judicial Board heard the case on Friday evening, but has not made a ruling.
One of the motions voted on at the GA was submitted by SPHR, and called for SSMU to establish a committee that “will thoroughly investigate McGill University’s involvement with companies on the basis of negative ethnical practices.”
The preamble of the motion mentioned the Israel-Palestine conflict within the context of ethical investments and boycotts, drawing ire from pro-Israel campus groups.
SPHR holds that there was a conflict of interest, given that Newburgh is the president of Hillel Montreal, the umbrella organization that links the various anglophone Hillel student groups on Montreal campuses, including Hillel McGill.
When the motion was brought to the floor of the GA, the clauses  referencing Israel-Palestine were struck by popular vote.
SPHR cited a January 28 meeting between SPHR and Hillel McGill members, attended by Newburgh. According to Nafay Choudhury, lead counsel for SPHR, the two parties adjourned for five minutes, and Newburgh spent the break in private with the members of Hillel McGill.
“The conversation Hillel McGill [had in private] points to what we don’t know,” said Choudhury. “No equivalent meeting was held with SPHR.”
However, both Newburgh and Hillel McGill president Mookie Kideckel claimed that Newburgh refused to voice an opinion for the entire duration of the meeting, including the private meetings.
“Zach refused to say anything. We wanted him to say something, but he didn’t,” said Kideckel.
One key issue from the January meeting involved GA procedure, specifically whether a preamble clause could be amended. Newburgh confirmed that he told both parties at the meeting that such clauses could not be amended. The night before the GA, Newburgh received a call from Corey Omer, the clubs and services representative to SSMU and VP (External) of Hillel McGill, who directed him to a passage in Robert’s Rules – the legislative procedure for General Assemblies – stating that preamble clauses could be amended after certain motions had been passed. SPHR said they were not made aware of the change until Newburgh brought it up in the assembly.
“It took everyone somewhat aback,” said Choudhury.
Newburgh’s lead counsel, Max Reed, said that it was unrealistic to expect the speaker of council to know every rule in the 600-page Robert’s Rules book. SPHR countered that, as speaker, it was his job to know all of Robert’s Rules.
SPHR claimed they had begun to review Robert’s Rules before the GA, but that their meeting was disrupted when they discovered SPHR member Alexa Romanelli’s Facebook account had been hacked, cancelling the GA event she was administrating. McGill security was unable to trace the hack.
SPHR also contended that Newburgh’s bias was revealed during the GA when he threatened vocal members of the assembly with ejection, but failed to act on these claims.
Reed said that Newburgh followed all of Robert’s Rules to the letter, including the speaker’s ability to eject members of the GA.
“A motion must come from the floor [to eject members of the Assembly],” said Reed, implying that Newburgh was not legally allowed to follow up on his threats.
“If the motion passed without incident, if everyone was perfectly happy, Mr. Newburgh would still be biased – which in my opinion makes no sense,” concluded Reed.
Newburgh confirmed during the hearing that he made SSMU aware that there could be a perceived conflict of interest if he chaired the Winter GA. Newburgh said SSMU president Ivan Neilson told him he would chair the GA anyway. Newburgh said that these facts undermine the SPHR allegation of a conflict of interest.
“Their arguments don’t seem to hold,” said Newburgh. “I myself knew that there was potential conflict of interest. I had given full disclosure to the executive and they gave me full support. They told me that as an employee, I would be doing my job chairing the meeting.”
Max Silverman, former SSMU VP (External), thought Newburgh had performed well at the GA, given that it was a highly-charged, divisive event.
“I think Zach actually did a pretty good job, all things considered,” he said.
Silverman sent a Facebook message to Newburgh expressing a similar sentiment after the GA. Newburgh cited the message in his respondent factum before the hearing, but when Silverman learned of it, he issued Newburgh a cease and desist order, and the message was pulled from the factum.
Despite Newburgh’s performance at the GA, Silverman said that even the appearance of a conflict of interest undermines the process.
“Regardless of how highly one thinks of Zach, the optics of it make it appear as if there would be a conflict of interest and the mere appearance of a conflict of interest can delegitimize the process,” said Silverman.
Neilson said that Newburgh was in danger of having this rift with SPHR define his presidency, but was confident in Newburgh’s ability to reconcile with SPHR, as well as all other student groups.
“Regardless of the outcome, he’s just going to have to work a little bit harder to demonstrate not only to the members of SPHR, but really to everyone, that that’s not what defines his presidency, that he really brings something more to the table, that he won’t allow this to be a distraction, and really not to try to ignore the past, but just to try to move on and proactively engage student groups,” said Neilson
“I don’t think he’s trying to bring an overly aggressive attitude, despite whatever facts are floating around,” said Neilson. “I think that…he’s seeking mediation, that he’s trying to find a solution, and that next year he will bring that sort of attitude to any other conflict.”

2010-11-11,McGill,Palestine,"Ewa Jasiewicz is a British-Polish activist, a coordinator with the Free Gaza Movement, and a member of the editorial collective of Le Monde Diplomatique’s Polish edition. She was in the Gaza Strip throughout the conflict there in January of 2009. Last May, she rode on the Challenger 1, one of the six boats that attempted to break the siege of Gaza before they were apprehended in international waters by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Nine Turkish nationals were killed by the IDF soldiers aboard another of the boats, the Mavi Marmara. Gaza has been blockaded by Egyptian and Israeli forces since Hamas took control of the Strip in June 2007.
The Mcgill Daily: How did you get involved in Palestine solidarity activism?
Ewa Jasiewicz: I first got involved through the [International Solidarity Movement] in 2003, because of friends of mine who had been out to Palestine. … I didn’t know that much about Palestine when I went there. This was just about six months after [Operation] Defensive Shield, so there were still a lot of incursions and curfews and, you know, once you see what the Israel army and state is doing to the Palestinian people – you see people’s homes destroyed, blown up, people killed, people injured and just daily violence – you can’t really forget it, can you? You can’t not be active around it because it becomes personal.
MD: What were the objectives of the flotilla that was attacked in May?
EJ: The objective primarily was to break the siege. The carrying of humanitarian goods was for us symbolic. … It did physically ease the blockade because the Rafah crossing [between Egypt and Palestinian-controlled Rafah] is now open. Okay, still not far enough, and Egypt is still a co-oppressor in the siege, but thousands of people were able to cross who wouldn’t have been able to cross before. That’s one measure of success. But it was also the boost it gave to the [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)] movement because it shifted many people into supporting the BDS tactic who before had maybe been on the fence. So many artists, musical acts cancelled their acts afterwards – [like] the Gorillaz and the Pixies. And then of course the United Nations fact-finding mission report just shows you again how Israel has violated international law. But it is a success to have brought in effectively another country. The government of Turkey reacted strongly and demanded a NATO emergency meeting and got it and really diplomatically put the spotlight on condemning Israel. And that’s a really positive thing and the whole of Turkey was really behind that. And it has really changed the relationship between those two countries.
MD: Israel has claimed that some of the members of the flotilla are linked to Al-Qaeda and that IHH [The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Aid, a Turkish NGO] is also linked to Al-Qaeda.
EJ: This is just absolute bullshit. Because if Israel really believed that there’s no way they would have let everybody go and released everybody. … They didn’t do that because it’s not true.
MD: Can you describe the flotilla raid?
EJ: The flotilla raid began in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark. That was a political decision by the Israeli navy, because they wanted to use the darkness to terrorize us and also to hide the actions of their soldiers. … So they continued trailing us and we were outrunning them for a while, maybe half an hour. We did hear shooting [from the Marmara], that was really horrible, but we were carrying on and then our captain decided to stop because he was feeling like they were going to cut us off and ram us and he didn’t want that. So he cut the engine and then they came closer and closer and then they just opened fire on the boat with plastic projectiles, smoke bombs. And they hit my friend in the face and she had blood all over her face and they wouldn’t let me treat her, they wouldn’t let anyone get to her, they were beating [my friend] Huwaida, and smashed the glass door open on the inside of the boat, they tasered the Sydney Morning Herald journalist, they cuffed me, they cuffed Huwaida, they put a hood on Huwaida and [another friend] Anna, they threatened to taser us, they were really brutal, they stomped on my face and then they took us into custody. … When it came to us being deported we kept saying that we wanted to see our council or our lawyer, that we didn’t want to leave, that we didn’t agree to this deportation, and they were just physically very aggressive with us and forced us out. They were beating people with truncheons and throwing chairs, and it was really horrible.
MD: And that’s when you were in detention?
EJ: Yes, we were still in detention.
MD: Were any of your fellow activists carrying weapons?
EJ: No, there were no weapons. Every single boat was searched. there were absolutely no weapons aboard any of the boats. That’s why people on the Marmara had to blowtorch some of the railings to make primitive weapons, to make crowbars, because they didn’t have normal weapons. They did have the right to defend themselves. You even have the right to defend yourself using firearms if you’re attacked at sea [in international waters].
MD: Do you feel that Hamas needs to be engaged diplomatically?
EJ: Without a doubt.

2010-11-27,McGill,Palestine,"Founder hopes Omeq will have a “moderating effect”
A new McGill group calling itself Omeq is aiming to change the dynamics of the Israel-Palestine discourse on campus.
The group takes its name from the Hebrew and Arabic letters OMQ, the root letters of the words “depth” and “profundity” in both languages.  According to Omeq VP External Michah Stettin, debates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are consistently hampered by an adversarial atmosphere.  He described the formation of Omeq in early 2010 as “a response to too much inflammatory rhetoric on campus, as opposed to substantive discussion and dialogue.  We felt that there was a need to have a group on campus that was hospitable to numerous viewpoints.”
Stettin cited last winter’s SSMU General Assembly as a particular source of strife, when the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) brought forward a motion calling for the creation of a financial ethics review committee. The motion made numerous references to the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
Another reason for the new group, according to Stettin, is the frustration expressed by Omeq’s mostly Jewish members that positions taken by Hillel McGill, a major Jewish student group, did not reflect their own perspective.  “I don’t think that there is such a thing as the Jewish political opinion.  Thus if an organization takes a political opinion, there will be Jews that disagree.  Hillel in the past has taken stances on issues on campus, and there were people on campus who were left outside of those positions,” he said. Stettin did, however, maintain that “Hillel is a great place for Jewish students and serves very important functions.”
Corey Omer, president of Hillel Montreal, said that he sees Omeq “as a positive thing, to have other groups. Any way Jewish students can represent themselves is good.  Hillel strives to represent everybody; however, it is hard for one organization to say everything to everyone.”
The effort to create what Omeq’s executives call “increased dialogue” on campus has not, however, been met with universal acclaim. Sam Bick, a McGill student and SPHR member who stressed that he did not speak for the group as a whole, said that dialogue may hurt more than it helps. “People don’t come to the table on the same footing. … When there are different degrees of power, when there’s military violence happening, dialogue becomes a much different thing,” he said, adding that dialogue may end up diverting attention “from dealing with real issues.”
Through a series of talks on subjects such as anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and the role of activism in Israel and Palestine, Stettin hopes that Omeq can act as a moderating force in conversations that have been tense on campus in recent years. A talk scheduled for last Wednesday,  “Debunking Myths about Islam,” would have been the fourth this year for Omeq, but was postponed in favour of a general meeting due to a scheduling miscommunication.
Rex Brynen, a McGill Political Science professor, sees a respectful environment as something that will come naturally to Omeq because of its structure. “If you set up contexts–whether it’s speakers on campus or internal dialogue sessions–in which the understood rules of the game are that you can say what you want but you have to be respectful with it, [dialogue] doesn’t become terribly hard,” he said.
Brynen feels that organizations like Omeq have an important role to play in decreasing the polarization of campus discourse. “People get upset at occupation of the settlements, people get upset by terrorism, and and it sort of drives them apart and leads them to a situation where they can’t recognize common interests, so I think [OMEQ] kind of re-centres the discussion in useful ways,” he said.

2011-02-03,McGill,Palestine,"Young Palestinians pressure the Palestinian ambassador to the UK for free and fair elections
On the January 27th, about 20 students from the Palestinian diaspora met in the offices of Palestine’s general delegation to the United Kingdom to voice their concerns to the ambassador. Lé Délit, The Daily’s sister publication, interviewed one of the protestors, Merna Azzeh.
Le Délit: How did your group organize the sit-in at the embassy?
Merna Azzeh: Everything was more or less organized the day before. About 12 students were there from 1:00 pm, but most students came later in the afternoon. We all came from different universities in the UK (LSE, UCL, SOAS, Oxford, Notthingham). The majority were of Palestinian origin (living in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, the West Bank, Europe). Even if I only knew two people in the group before the sit-in, we all wanted the same thing: to reclaim representation and direct elections.
LD: What triggered your initiative? The Palestine Papers? The social unrest in Tunisia and Egypt?
MA: It was a bit of both, but we didn’t want to make a direct link to these events. We spoke about representation with the ambassador. No matter the corruption (because yes, there is corruption!), we asked for more democracy. This was our call for direct elections to the Palestinian National Council (PNC). We were conscious of the limits of our demands at the sit-in, but we wanted our actions to be a wake-up call to the Palestinian youth. In other words, this was the launch of a campaign for elections and a new body of representatives for the Council. The fact is that this isn’t done regularly. Some have been in office since 2006 and the PNC is very important because it is the main body that gives authority and strategies to the PLO.
LD: How did everything proceed?
MA: Well, we didn’t invade the embassy. We simply wanted to get our voices heard in the most civilized way possible. Some students were sitting in the reception area while others were in the ambassador’s empty office. We said that we wouldn’t leave until he came and spoke with us. When he came, we shared our point of view and asked him to take action, but he answered that everything was out of his control. We continued discussing until the police arrived after they heard about it in the media. The ambassador, insisted that we should stay, and that we were welcome guests in our embassy. We left at around 8:00 pm. Even if the ambassador agreed with our demands, I remain skeptical. Maybe this was just a utopian effort. But this is about people’s rights to choose their representatives, and we all knew that before the Palestine Papers. Moreover,  being a refugee, I need to worry about my future and my people. I think it was a good start for our campaign.
LD: Have you done this for the youth or for all Palestinians?
MA: We did it in the name of the youth, because we are the future of the country. We however called for democracy for all Palestinians, especially those in the diaspora: we called for direct elections, and it is the right of all of our people no matter where they are to take part in the process. At the end of the day, we talked about what we wanted to do next. I hope that it was a spark that will be transmitted to Palestine, because it is quite hard to protest over there. It’s the launch of a campaign: we need other initiatives of this kind in order to promote these goals of representation and democracy.

2011-02-12,McGill,Palestine,"A  throng of about one hundred Montrealers gathered in front of the Egyptian consulate Friday afternoon to celebrate the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak earlier that day.
Mass protests have taken place in Cairo and throughout the rest of Egypt since January 25 – ten days after a similarly widespread protest movement led to the resignation of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
“Today is an incredible day,” said Mostafa Henaway, a member of the local Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! “Nobody expected this so soon after yesterday’s speech by Mubarak. … The mood is euphoric. This was something that was considered impossible.”
Mubarak has sat in the president’s office since 1981. Discontent has been mounting in recent years as a result of rising food prices and unemployment rates among the under-thirty demographic. Approximately half of the country lives below the poverty line.
Ehab Latoyef, a member of the Canadian Arab Federation, was among those attending Friday’s rally.
“There was a lot of discontent in Egypt for many years whether financial, respect for human rights, dignity, employment, prices – all that was accumulating,” he said. “But for it all to come to closure in two weeks like that was unexpected for everybody.”
Latoyef added that in his opinion the recent release of U.S. diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, as well as the Palestine Papers, has galvanized the demonstrations. Documents revealing Egypt’s complicity with Israel’s 2009 attack on the Gaza Strip, killing 1,400 Palestinians, are now available to the public as result of these sources.
Mubarak’s executive powers were handed over to the military Friday morning. Despite the military’s close connection with the U.S., their handling of the uprising has thus far been sensible, Latoyef said.
“The army is acting in a respectable manner today, and it is not showing any signs of greed to power. Of course, on the other hand, when you taste power, you want to keep it. That’s human nature,” he said.
“What’s needed now is to put the army in check all the time – not to make it feel that it has the right to make decisions. It’s just a caretaker,” he added.
Latoyef noted, as many others have, that there is no obvious successor to the current provisional government, nor does Egypt have any well-organized political parties at the moment.
“It’s a problem, but I think it’s also a safeguard – meaning that the fact that there is no one dominant party in Egypt at this point is part of the road to a healthy growth in the Egyptian democratic process,” he said.
Henaway commented on the broader impact the Egyptian revolution will have on the Arab world.
“Tomorrow in Algeria there is a national day of action; we see ongoing demonstrations in Jordan, Yemen, and all over the Arab world. A movement is really, really burgeoning at this moment and I think is taking everybody by surprise.”
Dina, who grew up in Cairo, also attended the demonstration.
“Me and my husband left Egypt and came here because we [didn’t] find a good job, and there is no security there – a lot of problems in Egypt,” she said. “I’m so happy he’s gone, because a lot of people are suffering from poverty and a lot of people don’t have an opportunity to have work.”

2011-03-26,McGill,Palestine,"New partnership launched last November; concerns focus on human rights program
A group of students in McGill’s Faculty of Law met with administrators Friday to express their opposition and concerns regarding a new program launched in conjunction with Israel’s Hebrew University.
The faculties participating in  joint initiatives are Medicine, Management, Law, and Agriculture. Specific projects revolve around health and epigenetics, international business, human rights law, and food safety and water management.
Sam Bick, U4 History, spoke about the wider implications of McGill’s association with Hebrew University.
“McGill’s partnership with Hebrew University, as well as the Technion [Israel Institute of Technology], is clear support on the part of University for an apartheid government,” he said. “Beyond tangible effect of the research done at these universities, it’s important to acknowledge the apartheid in education, and Palestinians face multiple levels of unequal access to education.”
Fundraising for the partnership is ongoing, but according to Vice President (Research and International Relations) Rosie Goldstein, $1.5 million has already been raised to fund the partnership by “both McGill donors and CFHU[Canadian Friends of Hebrew University], with the proceeds shared by both universities.”
The initiative was announced in November when CFHU presented the 2010 Scopus Award to McGill Principal Heather Munroe-Blum. The Scopus Award is the “highest award that the Friends of Hebrew University gives out ” said Carolyn Steinman, director of the Montreal branch of CFHU.
Steinman described the previous relationship between McGill and Hebrew University as “friendly,” though this is the first formal relationship established between the two institutions. She added that Munroe-Blum encouraged the partnership after a visit to Hebrew University.
Goldstein pointed to shared research interests as a factor that lead to the collaboration.
“A trip to Israel in 2008 by a number of senior administrators, for example, led to a conversation between our Dean of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Chandra Madramootoo, and experts there. They realized they had similar research interests, especially around the subject of water, and this led to a joint project in Kenya,” wrote Goldstein in an email to The Daily.
Steinman explained that research in epigenetics “will look at disease in a fundamentally new way by providing novel tools for prediction, diagnosis, and prevention.” She added that the project on food security and water management “will initiate a two-university program to improve the lives of the world’s most disadvantaged people,” she added.
Part of the initiative includes a summer law program called The McGill/Hebrew University Summer Program in Human Rights, which is a collaboration between McGill’s Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism (CHRLP) and the Minerva Centre for Human Rights at Hebrew University. The topic for summer 2011 is “Regulating Internal Diversity.”
McGill Dean of Law Daniel Jutras described the objectives of the program’s human rights component.
“The program explores the human rights implications of the regulation of internal diversity given the very different models inspiring Canada, said to be a ‘multicultural mosaic,’ and Israel, said to be a ‘Jewish and Democratic State,’” wrote Jutras in an email to The Daily.
“This brings up issues of law and identities, discrimination and equality, the integration of immigrants and refugees, and the rights to autonomy and self-determination,” he added.
Jutras said that the concerned students and the CHRLP were engaged in a “fruitful dialogue,” and noted that the groups will continue to communicate over the next several weeks.
Safia Lakhani, a third-year law student, expressed reservations about the program. “I don’t know that the institution we’re partnering with shares the same ideals that McGill does, like democratic dissent, equality and a commitment to human rights,” she said.
Lakhani added that she felt it is “particularly perverse that this program would be called ‘Regulating Internal Diversity,’ when there’s been international criticism of the appropriation of Palestinian land and the demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem by the Israeli government.”
“This [program] is particularly worrying about what it says about our standards,” said Lakhani. She stressed the need to consider “what the implications are for the faculty of law, especially our centre for human rights, to endorse this program.”
Goldstein responded to the students’ concerns by stating, “It is likely students have divergent views about all sorts of research that is conducted at McGill and the research partnerships in which the University becomes engaged. McGill, as a leading research-intensive institution, engages with other top-level institutions all over the world.”
“I know that many, many of our students enjoy the incredible experiences international collaborations provide for them,” she added.
Douglas Smith, a member of the Montreal-based Palestine solidarity group Tadamon! called upon McGill to respect the movement for boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
“We support BDS, so we’re calling for academic boycott in the frame of the Palestinian call for BDS,” said Smith, a graduate student at Concordia and member of Tadamon! “The Hebrew Universtiy partnership obviously signals a complete ignorance as far as the role of Israeli institutions of higher learning in human rights abuses.”

2011-04-08,McGill,Palestine,"ERIN HUDSON – THE MCGILL DAILY
 
Tensions arose Tuesday at Queer McGill’s (QM) general assembly as the group attempted to pass a constitutional amendment mandating them to boycott international bodies and institutions they consider to be oppressive.
Many of those who opposed the amendment – which was voted down 26 to 24 – saw it as a veiled attack on Israel, although QM Treasurer Kevin Paul explained that the amendment had a wide scope.
“We did not want to single out any particular conflict, nation, state,” Paul said. He added that it was not an endorsement of the movement for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
SSMU speaker Cathal Rooney-Céspedes voiced his opposition to the amendment at the meeting, and explained that he viewed it as a politicization of a SSMU club on the “wholly decisive issue” of Israel-Palestine.
“I would really hate for someone – if QM were to take a stance against Israel – of Israeli descent and who is looking for a community of LGBT to not feel welcome in QM because of the stances they take external to queer politics,” he said.
The text of the motion read, “Queer McGill resolves to adopt financial practices that oppose international state oppression. … Queer McGill shall limit the definition of bodies that fund state oppression to corporations and institutions which directly, or through the redirection of their profits by primary stakeholders, contribute, financially or through sharing of resources, to the official practices of an oppressive regime or its agents.”
According to QM co-administrator Ryan Thom, the amendment was controversial among the QM community, and he had expected it to be “debated hotly.”
Thom asserted that the GA lost its traditional informality when Rooney-Céspedes demanded the meeting adhere to a strict version of Robert’s Rules.
“QM runs on a very informal basis,” he said, and only nominally adheres to Robert’s Rules.
“I think what was lost was our ability to communicate with each other in a non-hierarchical fashion,” said Thom. “To identify as queer and then walk into a queer general assembly – that is a powerful symbolic gesture and that was threatened. I think that’s why we saw people crying and reacting so strongly.”
“It angers and frustrates me to see constituents looking so upset, expressing such discontent, such disenfranchisement,” he added.
Rooney-Céspedes spoke to the outcome of the assembly and his view on QM’s proposed amendment.
“I truly do regret the way that I made people feel but I don’t regret fighting for something that I feel so strongly about,” said Rooney-Céspedes.
He said he felt that without rules to govern the meeting, it would have degenerated into a free-for-all.
“I think that when you’re debating contentious issues there needs to be an order to the way that things are done,” he said.
“If you don’t know or if you’re not as aware of the rules then it can come off as intimidating – and I do sympathize with that. Otherwise I think that it was a very well-run debate with all things considered,” said Rooney-Céspedes.
The issue was raised again at SSMU Council on Thursday night, which was the final council meeting of the school year. VP External Myriam Zaidi prepared a letter regarding the events at Tuesday’s assembly and her recommendations for the response of SSMU Council.
“In my letter I was urging the Speaker of Council to write an apology letter,” said Zaidi. “I feel like there was a lack of accountability.”
Zaidi did not finish reading her letter due to interruptions.
Thom then addressed Council on behalf of QM. After hearing his speech, the councillors ruled to issue a statement reaffirming their commitment to safe space on campus.
Thom said he would have liked to see a more supportive declaration.
“I had thought that SSMU was a powerful and strong space for promoting QM’s existence,” he said. “It’s just sad that the idea of protecting our space from people who should be protecting us.”
Zaidi noted her disappointment that some members of Council did not recognize the problematic nature of the events at the meeting.
“They apologized for people feeling uncomfortable but not for the events. If you’re going to go saying things that are patronizing, [it’s better] not to say anything,” she said.
Zaidi added that she was emotionally affected by Tuesday’s meeting.
“It’s extremely unacceptable,” she said.
Rooney-Céspedes said that his job as Speaker did not prevent him from participating in political debates outside of SSMU Council. After leaving Council Thursday night, however, he said he intended to write letters of apology.

2012-11-16,McGill,Palestine,"At least 15 dead, 118 wounded in first day of operation
Over fifty people gathered in front of the Hall Building of Concordia University at 6 p.m. on Wednesday to protest the launch of Israel’s most recent Gaza military operation, “Operation Pillar of Defence”, which began earlier that day.
Sara Sheltony, one of the organizers of the demonstration and a member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights Concordia (SPHR Concordia) told The Daily that the purpose of the demonstration was to “give a place for Palestinians in Montreal and others to express their sadness, frustration, and anger at what is happening in Gaza and Palestine in general.”
She also mentioned that they wished to “raise awareness among the Canadian population and the population in Montreal about the occupation and the apartheid that is happening in Israel, and about the massacre that is about to happen in Gaza and the massacre that happened in 2008 and 2009.”
Sheltony attributed the speed with which they managed to organize the demonstration to “the power of Facebook.” According to Sheltony, the event was posted to Facebook at 12:30 p.m., and by 3 p.m. over 100 people had confirmed their attendance.
Operation Pillar of Defence came four years after Israel’s three-month “Operation Cast Lead” from December 2008 to January 2009 – also known as the Gaza War – in which over 1,400 Gazans were killed.
Escorted by police cars, the demonstrators marched down Ste. Catherine – which had been blocked off by police cars from Concordia to Phillips Square for the march – chanting “Solidarité avec des Palestiniens,” “Palestine will be free, from the river to the sea,” and “Israel terrorist, Harper complicit.”
Scarlet Harris, a McGill student who participated in the demonstration, told The Daily, “The international community cannot sit back and watch bombs fall on Gaza.  We are complicit in Israel’s war crimes, and therefore I’m here to show my solidarity.”
When the demonstration reached Phillips Square, speakers Doug Smith, Dan Freeman-Maloy, Mostafa Henaway, and Antoine Bustros gave speeches on the issue.
Henaway, a member of the Tadamon! collective, explained that Canada was the first country to cut off aid to Palestine when Hamas was elected.
Activist and writer Freeman-Maloy agreed, accusing Canada of “cheering whenever Israel attacks Palestinians.” According to Freeman-Maloy, it is critical to build international pressure to block Israel from being able to commit these kinds of crimes.
One demonstrator called the operation “an insult to the modern Western society.”
“I am a Palestinian, I was born in Lebanon, I am Canadian,” they said. “I do not believe in lands, borders, and citizenships.”
At the time of the demonstration, Palestinians reported 15 dead – including an 11-month old boy and 7-year-old girl – and 118 wounded. Among the dead was the top military commander of Hamas.
According to Sheltony, these “indiscriminate” killings were “done by a state that definitely has the military capability to target accurately,” and are “very hard to justify.”

2013-03-14,McGill,Palestine,"Professor’s door defaced with Zionist slogans
A panel entitled “Zionism in Academia” discussed on Tuesday that academia in North America is complicit in privileging Zionist discourses, rendering the study, analysis, and discussion of Palestine invisible. Facilitated by Michelle Hartman, professor of Arabic Literature at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill, the panel – held as part of Israeli Apartheid Week – drew a crowd of fifty people.
The panel was composed of Mohsen al Attar, a visiting professor and human rights lawyer, and Douglas Smith, a PhD student who was a member of Tadamon!, a Montreal-based collective working in solidarity with struggles for self-determination, equality, and justice in the Middle East.
“I’m not interested in the question of if Zionism holds a privileged place within the environment of North American universities, because I think that it does. I don’t think that it is a question whether or not Palestine is colonized, because I think that it is,” Hartman said in her introduction to the panel.
“In many university spaces, to say this is not accepted,” she added. Instead, Hartman continued, the panel would focus on the way in which this privilege manifests itself.
Hartman told the audience that it had been hard to find people to talk at the event, as many people that she had approached didn’t want to talk about these issues in public.
Hartman herself was on the receiving end of political smearing at McGill in February, when her office door was defaced with Zionist slogans.
In 2009, Hartman, along with 81 other Montreal CEGEP and university professors, signed an open letter published in Le Devoir in the wake of the Israeli bombing of the Islamic University of Gaza.
The letter, which was in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, called for academics around the world to support a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, and an ending of all economic relations between Canada and Israel.
“We call on the Harper government to re-evaluate its policies and to unequivocally condemn the Israeli siege and assault on Gaza, which constitute serious violations of international and humanitarian law,” the letter read. “We further demand that the Israeli government immediately cease its violence,” it said.
Hartman previously had a copy of this letter posted on her door. Sometime between the evening of February 4 and the early morning of February 5, slogans stating that Hartman was a “lover of terrorists,” and that “Israel has been a state for 1,200 years,” were scrawled across her door.
“I don’t feel personally threatened. I see this rather as a way to silence the issue. My understanding of that defacing is in the context, not necessarily particularly here, but in a broader context of silencing of people on university campuses who talk about the issue of Palestine and Palestinians,” Hartman told The Daily shortly after the incident.
The incident was downplayed by her department, and her colleagues came to a consensus not to say anything publicly about it. Hartman, however, felt that it would have been better to issue a public statement about it.
Hartman said during the panel that many of her colleagues, but particularly students, often do not feel that they are able to speak about the question of Palestine in many places within the university, especially in classrooms.
A member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR), a group that advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people, and organizer of the conference, told The Daily that at McGill, “Zionist discourse has so ingrained itself in the university, you aren’t free to use the ‘anti’ [Zionism] discourse.”
Another SPHR member told The Daily that they actively try to hide their political ideas in their classes in fear of the consequences of voicing them. “People are afraid of talking about it more than any other issue,” they said.
Adrienne Hurley, a professor in East Asian studies who also signed the open letter, asserted to The Daily that McGill had taken a particularly aggressive stance against BDS.
“You have a university that has taken a side, and this is a really clear side. You have these slogans written that echo the political sentiment of the administration, and that specificity is important, ” she said.
Hurley speculated that had a similar political action been carried out in another department, the response would have been much different.
Al Attar, however, said during the panel discussion that the issue of Zionism, which as an idea contains many contradictions, is often oversimplified, and that academics self-censor as a direct consequence of irrational fears that stem from such oversimplification.
“Zionism is not overrepresented in academia, but oversimplification gives rise to the illusion of an overrepresentation of Zionism, and this gives rise to allegations of anti-semitism,” he said.
Smith outlined various cases across Canada and the U.S. where anti-Zionist voices had been silenced.
For instance, in February, around the same time that Hartman’s door was vandalized, New York City officials threatened to cut funding to Brooklyn College because the school’s political science department sponsored an event featuring Omar Barghouti and Judith Butler, both of whom are advocates of BDS. Glenn Greenwald wrote in the Guardian that this type of action was a threat to academic freedom.
Some professors believe that what is allowed to be said on campus has changed as McGill moves toward funding more programs through donors. Abby Lippman, a professor in Epidemiology, told The Daily by phone that “the way you have to go for funding has changed a lot over the years. That has changed the sort of research people can do.”

2013-10-21,McGill,Palestine,"Since 2006, Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill and SSMU have teamed up to offer Culture Shock – eight days of panels, workshops, art, and film screenings, dedicated to breaking down myths about communities of colour, Indigenous peoples, immigrants, and refugees. The annual event series openly addresses issues such as race, white supremacy, colonialism, xenophobia, and anti-migrant sentiments.
Series like Culture Shock, said Kira Page, External Coordinator at QPIRG, are important in a “broader context of neoliberalism that is telling people that racism is not an issue – that colonialism is not an issue.”
“At McGill specifically, I think there’s a comforting discourse [about] multiculturalism – that this is a diverse school, it’s all good, there’s a lot of diversity,” Page said. “Representation is certainly a barometer we can use […] but just the fact that it isn’t just white people who go to this school doesn’t mean that people don’t experience institutionalized racism in a McGill context.”
Another motivation for Culture Shock is McGill’s position on unceded Mohawk territory, Page said. “The fact that McGill is on stolen land is not just a historical issue. It’s a current issue.”

“Canada Behind Bars: On the Incarceration of Indigenous Communities”
Written by Hannah Reardon.
Statistics Canada findings show that 30 per cent of female offenders in federal prisons are Indigenous, and this figure is steadily climbing, according to Patricia Eshkibok, one of the speakers at the Canada Behind Bars panel on October 10.
Panelists Eshkibok, Jessica Danforth, and Kawate Tawe, focused mainly on the incarceration of Indigenous women in Canada, while also highlighting the crisis facing Indigenous youth. The “pipeline from school to prison,” as Danforth referred to it, is an intergenerational effect of the residential school system. Many of its effects, such as alcohol and drug abuse, identity loss, and high suicide rates, are all serious and pervasive problems, the panelists stressed, which push Indigenous youth disproportionately out of the education system and into the prison system.
Dismal health conditions, extreme homophobia, racism, and violence are all issues that face Indigenous people within the prison system. However, some efforts are being made to improve the rights of Indigenous people in the prison system. Danforth is the founder and executive director of the Native Youth Sexual Health Network, an organization that works to protect the health rights of incarcerated individuals. “You don’t lose your right to health as soon as you enter prison. Just because you’re incarcerated doesn’t mean you lose your rights as a human being,” she said.
“Colonization is happening,” said Danforth, adding that racism and loss of identity are day-to-day realities for Indigenous people. There is a pressing need, according to the panelists, to spread the truth [about] the present-day effects of colonization. Raising awareness and fighting for justice for marginalized Indigenous people is the only way to move forward, the panelists stressed. “We are here to speak truth to power,” said Danforth.

“Roundtable Discussion on Solidarity City”
Written by Olivia Larson.
QPIRG McGill and SSMU co-hosted a roundtable discussion on Montreal’s Solidarity City declaration, presented by migrant justice network Solidarity Across Borders. Dozens of public service organizations across Montreal have signed the declaration in an effort to make basic resources such as education, food, and housing accessible to non-status migrants. At the roundtable discussion, representatives from various public service organizations were present to share their successes and to discuss the challenges they have faced in implementing the declaration.
Quebec’s residency clause bars thousands of undocumented children from free schooling every year, pointed out Anne, a CEGEP teacher. She works with the committee on education, which has successfully “made this problem exist” for the government through persistent lobbying in the hopes that the word ‘resident’ will be omitted from the law.
The Food For All committee, a part of the Solidarity campaign, reaches out to food aid organizations and banks, asking them to adopt the declaration and implement a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy in regards to immigration status. So far, the committee has had relative success in signing organizations on, and thereby increasing “food justice,” as one representative put it, for non-status migrants.
Several organizations are working with Solidarity City to increase the number of subsidized housing projects across Montreal, and to make shelters for those who identify as trans* or as women safe spaces for those who are undocumented.
The shortage of available social housing for Quebec residents has made the government reluctant to expand the list of people who qualify for public housing, leaving many who are non-status homeless. Shelters have had issues with the Canadian Border Services Agency raiding and subsequently deporting paperless immigrants. The declaration, for both social housing agencies and shelters, has been extraordinarily difficult to implement, as the struggle for increased accessible living is being waged at all levels of government.
Despite myriad obstacles, Solidarity City’s powerful declaration to “fight back with solidarity, mutual aid, and direct action” is making headway in achieving equal status for all those living in Montreal.

“Race at McGill”
Written by Dana Wray.
Racial microaggressions, systemic and institutional racism, and the specific experiences of racialized people at McGill were all topics of discussion at a workshop co-facilitated by Shaina Agbayani and Annie Chen on October 16. The first half of the workshop, presented by Chen, focused on the basics of racial microaggressions, in addition to systemic and individual racism.
Microaggressions are small, everyday actions – whether verbal, behavioural, or environmental – that are hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights. Although not always done intentionally, the slow accumulation of these microaggressions over a lifetime adds up to a marginalized experience.
Agbayani gave an example of the McGill-centric website McGill Microaggressions, where people at McGill send in their experiences with racism on an interpersonal, often casual and everyday level.
Chen’s part of the workshop also debunked the myth of reverse racism. A term thrown around to describe discrimination against white people, reverse racism is often used in arguments against programs such as affirmative action.
Agbayani focused more specifically on race at McGill, and how racism manifests itself on an institutional, day-to-day, and curricular level. She highlighted that there is an underrepresentation of people of colour within McGill’s faculty, as well as a lack of financial support for initiatives addressing racism, such as the Social Equity and Diversity Education Office.
Agbayani attributed the underrepresentation of faculty and staff of colour at McGill to a “feedback loop” between a lack of diversity in the student body and in staff. “Some [people of colour] who were offered jobs at Counselling Services rejected the offers because they noted that they wanted to serve student populations that [was] more diverse, and they wanted to be a mirror of identity in a position of authority for students of colour, which they didn’t see a lot of at McGill.”
In interviews with a former McGill dean and his daughter, a current staff member, Agbayani said the lack of diversity appeared to be a systemic problem that wasn’t getting any better. “[The former dean and his daughter] haven’t seen much progress [over the past few decades]. They’ve seen a decrease in diversity visibly – not of students, they noted more students of diverse backgrounds – but in terms of faculty and staff.”
According to Agbayani, diversity is used as a superficial buzzword for McGill. “Diversity for McGill [as stated online] would reflect a pursuit of diversity as a pursuit of cosmopolitanism, as opposed to diversity as a pursuit of social justice and [a process of] redressing historical injustices.”

“Ongoing colonization: Addressing systemic violence against Indigenous women”
Written by Dana Wray and Anqi Zhang.
At the trial of two men for the brutal murder of an Indigenous woman named Pamela George, the judge presiding over the case lamented that it would be “dangerous” to convict the “bright, promising young men” that were her murderers, and that George was “just a prostitute.”
According to Candice Cascanette, a member of Missing Justice, a Montreal-based organization and the leader of the workshop, this racist and sexist language is common in the media and the broader Canadian society when talking about Indigenous women. In Canada, there are 600 missing or murdered Indigenous women, although some activists argue that the number is closer to 3000. In addition, Indigenous women are five times as likely to face violence, a fact Cascanette called proof of “ongoing colonization.”
“Talking about the colonial present requires us to go to the colonial past,” asserted Cascanette, before giving a brief historical account of the theft of Turtle Island and subsequent colonization. As Indigenous women had power connected directly to this land within their communities, Cascanette explained, they were a threat to the patriarchal European forces, and therefore a target.
More recent practices like the residential school system continued the process of colonization by separating families, forcing Christianity upon Indigenous children, and attempting to destroy Indigenous culture. According to Cascanette, the “cultural genocide” extended past the schools, into the forces – such as the Indian Act – that imposed patriarchy, capitalism, and other oppressive European structures on Indigenous communities.
However, Cascanette also dispelled the notion that Indigenous people were victims without any agency. “There have been over 500 years of colonization and over 500 years of resistance – I just want to make that clear.”

“Teach-In Against the Charter of Values”
Written by Cem Ertekin.
In preparation for the October 20 demonstration organized by the Ensemble Contre la Charte Xénophobe Coalition, Aishah Nofal, Bochra Manaï, and Vincent Tao facilitated a teach-in on resisting the proposed Quebec Charter of Values. The event focused on what the Charter is presently, and what social ramifications it could have.
Tao, one of the lead organizers of the upcoming demonstration on October 20, outlined the Parti Québecois’s proposed content of the Charter. The Charter aims to ban the wearing of religious symbols, a goal which Tao critiques as discriminatory. “This is state sanctioned social exclusion of women of faith who need government services,” said Tao.
Manaï, a PhD candidate in Urban Studies at Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, said that the Charter has a clear electoral agenda. After conducting research looking at inter-ethnic relationships in middle class neighbourhoods, Manaï has concluded that people see diversity mostly when there is political discussion surrounding it.
Nofal, a second-year Law student at McGill, called the Charter blatantly discriminatory. “The PQ claims that the ban of religious symbols will neutralize [the] public sector. It deprives minorities of choice. They can’t simply discard their beliefs. What this Charter is saying is that some beliefs are suitable while others are not. […] This is really frightening. As a person wearing the hijab, I feel I’m subject to public scrutiny.”

“Political Prisoners’ Struggles in Palestine”
Written by Ralph Haddad.
Tadamon!’s workshop on October 16 discussed the harsh reality that Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip face when arrested by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Tadamon! – an Arabic word for solidarity – is a Montreal-based collective that works in solidarity with struggles for self-determination, equality, and justice in the Middle East as well as diaspora communities in Montreal and beyond.
As of 2013, there are an estimated 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel. These prisoners are illegally held in poorly-maintained facilities, tortured in interrogations, and are subject to immediate maltreatment upon arrest. Israel was condemned by the UN earlier this year for its “abusive” treatment of prisoners, who are also denied family visits, Palestinian-based education, and basic healthcare.
What is important to note is that Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to separate legal systems – Jewish settlers are seen by an Israeli civilian judge, while Palestinians are seen by an Israeli military judge. Furthermore, rates of incarceration for Palestinian children are almost ninefold compared to those for Jewish children in the occupied territories, according to the workshop. Some Palestinians are arrested using administrative detention, supposedly used in times of emergency for strict security reasons (though Israel has an almost perpetual state of emergency). This form of detention allows for prisoners to be prosecuted without trial and charge, and are kept in prison for a period for up to six months, subject to renewal.
Today, there are around 178 Palestinians under administrative detention. The number has decreased “due to international grassroots pressure,” claimed Paul Di Stefano, a member of Tadamon!, “but the number is still extraordinarily high.” He continued that this form of detention allows the state to “circumvent” people’s rights.
According to Tadamon!, Israel also outsources its human rights violations by employing a private security company, G4S, to run its prisons. This privately-owned British security company also provides the IDF with equipment for checkpoints. Pressure in the form of hunger strikes on behalf of prisoners, or from movements such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) are still used today in order to pressure Israel to stop its maltreatment of prisoners and give them better care and humane services.
“Palestinians can be tried as adults as young as 16, and are interrogated by Israeli soldiers,” said Amy Darwish, an organizer for Tadamon!

“Unsettling and Decolonizing: An Introductory Workshop”
Written by Joelle Dahm.
Heidi Pridy and Philippe – who preferred not to give his last name – of the Anti-Colonial Solidarity Collective led an introductory workshop on unsettling and decolonizing, urging settlers to be respectful and effective allies to Indigenous populations on Turtle Island – also known as North America.
After an introduction to the vocabulary of decolonization and the history of colonialism in Canada, and specifically in the Montreal area, participants engaged in an interactive discussion on works by Cree artist Kent Monkman and documentaries dealing with decolonization.
Later in the workshop, Pridy explained that people often react to negative stereotypes, but feel comfortable about positive stereotypes that might glorify the group in question and give it a preconceived identity. “It does not matter if a stereotype is negative or positive. The problem is that it’s is a fixed representation and an abstraction of a complex dynamic.”
“When one group is marginalized, another one is benefitting. We need to understand ourselves as complicit in and beneficiaries of the illegal settlement of Indigenous people’s land,” said Pridy. “This appropriation often leads people to experience feelings of guilt. Guilt is a state of self-absorption that upholds privilege in a lot of ways and can really immobilize people from doing anything. We would encourage people to embrace that discomfort as a sign of a much-needed shift in self-consciousness.”
In special regard of upcoming Halloween festivities, Pridy urged people to be conscious about their self-representation, especially considering “sexy Native women costumes” sold in stores.
“Given the grade of sexual violence against Native women, that is really problematic,” Pridy stated. “Using someone else’s cultural symbols to exercise a personal need in self-expression is an exercise in privilege. That does not mean that cultural exchange never does happen and that we never partake in someone else’s culture, but there needs to be some element of mutual understanding for it to be a true exchange.”

“Indigenous feminisms and historical and contemporary two-spirit identities in North America”
Written by Hannah Besseau.
On October 10, Molly Swain and Lindsay Nixon facilitated a workshop on contemporary Indigenous feminisms, anti-capitalism, and two-spirit identities. The workshop tackled what Swain described as ‘the sexist and racist colonial values” of Canada’s ongoing violence against Indigenous people.
“We hear a lot about the victimization of Indigenous women, but not a lot about the resistance,” Swain told The Daily. “I wanted to introduce people to the topic of Indigenous feminisms and get them thinking of it not just in terms of within [academic settings], but in their daily lives.”
Swain emphasized environmental degradation and the role of capitalism in the oppression of Indigenous peoples. “Canada was […] founded very much on the principles of resource extraction, pushing further and further inland. […] John A Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada, and his project of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was very much an extension of that need to keep pushing and [to] quell Native dissent and any Natives’ resistance to bring these dissenters under the fold.”
According to Swain, “colonialism, misogyny, and capitalism are deeply intertwined.” Decolonization – a continuous process whereby settlers, or non-Indigenous people, attempt to help heal the consequences of colonialism – is a crucial step in the struggle.
“It’s one thing to talk about decolonization and to acknowledge the land that we’re on, but it’s another thing to go out there and actually get involved in the struggles that are taking place, and to learn from those communities to figure out how to engage in a real responsible relationship with these folks. I think that’s a really important aspect of decolonization.”
Swain and Nixon are both co-founders of QPIRG McGill’s new working group, the Indigenous Women and Two-Spirit Harm Reduction Coalition. The group aims to provide resources and materials to Indigenous women and two-spirit people.
“We’re hoping to provide people with free materials such as needles, condoms, as well as resource guides to things like consent, safe sex, good drug-use practice, navigating the prison system, and guides to Montreal services,” said Swain. “Our group is open to Indigenous-identified folks only because we wanted this to be very much work we’re doing for our community.”
Culture Shock also featured a workshop on decolonization for settlers – scroll up to read Joelle Dahm’s article on it. For more information on the Indigenous Women and Two-Spirit Harm Reduction Coalition, contact ndn.harmredux@gmail.com.

2014-03-24,McGill,Palestine,"Event series seeks to bring awareness of Israeli human rights abuses 
From March 10 to March 17, McGill and Concordia hosted the Montreal events for the tenth annual Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW), an international series of events that seeks to raise awareness about Israel’s apartheid policies toward Palestinians, and build support for the growing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.
The BDS campaign was initiated in 2005, and demands “full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, an end to the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands – including the Golan Heights, the Occupied West Bank with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip – and dismantling the Wall, and the protection of Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in U.N. resolution 194,” according to the website for Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) USA.
On March 11, Noura Erakat, a human rights attorney and writer, came to McGill to talk about the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli apartheid regime that she referred to as “an Indigenous struggle against settler colonialism.”
Through the examination of Israeli law, Erakat works to denounce the institutionalized discrimination established against the Palestinian Christian and Arab population. She highlighted the fact that without an established constitution, the Basic Laws of Israel, which form an important part of the Israeli constitution, hold no guaranteed right to equality.
“What separates these two populations has not necessarily been a physical separation but even more so, it is the privilege that is afforded to the Jewish-Israeli population,” Erakat explained.
“We describe this situation as ‘the Palestinian-Israeli conflicts,’” she continued, “which distorts what is actually going on [because] it equates the Palestinian people and the Israeli people in the form of a conflict, when in fact what would be more accurate would be to say, ‘The Palestinian and Israeli conflict is a conflict because Israel has been a state since 1948, and Palestinians have been a stateless people since 1948.’”
Rana Salah, an organizer of IAW Montreal, told The Daily, “I hope that IAW will bring about understanding and empowerment to the McGill community. The unfortunate reality is that IAW continues to be a taboo topic for many. This taboo nature only continues to entrench racist attitudes towards Palestinians. A clearer understanding of the Palestine-Israel topic will foster a greater sense of understanding and respect amongst the McGill community.
 “It also empowers McGill students by encouraging them to voice their concerns on the ongoing apartheid treatment of Palestinians, and to resist via the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. The BDS movement aims to pressure Israel to respect human rights and to cease with its apartheid policies,” Salah continued.
Salah mentioned that she is very happy with the results of IAW so far. She explained, “Israeli Apartheid Week once started as a very fringe, ‘radical’ movement. It has now moved to the centre of the Israeli-Palestinian debate. It has not yet penetrated mainstream societal views, but support continues to grow.”

2014-07-14,McGill,Palestine,"Protesters demand end to occupation, condemn Canadian complicity
Stretching a 66-metre-long Palestinian flag along Ste. Catherine, over 1,000 Montrealers gathered on Friday afternoon to show solidarity with the Palestinian people in the context of Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza, and to call on the Canadian government to condemn violations of international law by the state of Israel. The demonstration, organized by the Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU), began at the Guy-Concordia metro station at 5:30 p.m., and ended in front of the Quebec premier’s office on McGill College about an hour later.
“We come here today as human beings [who] cannot […] watch what is going [on] in Gaza and just be silent, and just say, ‘It’s business as usual,’” said Ehab Lotayef, a spokesperson for the Gaza’s Ark campaign, in an address to the crowd.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza started on July 8, following a chain of events that began with the abduction and murder of three Israeli settler teenagers in the West Bank last month. The operation marks the worst outbreak of violence in the region since 2012.
“The state of Israel is […] killing people by the dozens for its own expansionist and control reasons, citing false security claims that are unjustified, and the world is standing silent,” added Lotayef. “The world is watching as Gaza is being [attacked], and when a rocket comes out of Gaza, they say, ‘Both sides should constrain themselves’? We are here to say to the world, to say to the Canadian government: enough hypocrisy.”
In an interview with The Daily, PAJU organizer Hala Marley noted that the Canadian government is complicit in Israel’s war crimes through its failure to condemn them, a sentiment shared by many demonstrators.
“When they say that Israel has the right to defend itself, […] to condemn one side and not to condemn the other, it’s hypocritical,” said Marley in French. “We’d like the Canadian and Quebec governments to stop doing business with the Israeli government as long as [it] doesn’t change its attitude toward the Palestinians, because the Palestinians don’t have the right to access to water, don’t have the right of return. We ask […] for the end of this ‘wall of shame’ [the Israeli West Bank barrier], the end of the blockade of Gaza, the return of the refugees.”
Jean Lacharité – vice-president of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), Quebec’s second largest trade union federation – found the Harper government’s professed unwavering support for the state of Israel particularly disheartening.
“I’m saying it loud and clear: the Harper government, a right-wing government like we’ve never seen in Canada, wholeheartedly supports Israel’s government, and lets [it] commit war crimes without denouncing them,” Lacharité told the crowd in French. “Harper must change course, must acknowledge that there is no democracy in Palestine, […] and say it. Otherwise, it’s a show of support for war crimes that [the Israeli government] commits.”
An anti-Zionist Orthodox Jewish contingent was also present at the protest. “The entire occupation of Palestine going on already for 60-odd years is a total crime,” a rabbi from this contingent told the crowd. “We declare that the acts of terror committed by the state of Israel against the people of Palestine [are] not supported by all Jews, neither does the state of Israel represent all Jews.”
“Israel a criminal, Harper an accomplice,” demonstrators chanted in French as they carried what is, according to organizers, the largest Palestinian flag in the world down Ste. Catherine. The flag, which attendees had the opportunity to sign, is destined to be shipped to a Palestinian refugee camp.
As the demonstration reached Premier Philippe Couillard’s office on McGill College, organizers highlighted the role of the Quebec industry in Israel’s military operations, and spoke in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for boycott of Israeli companies and academic institutions, divestment from Israeli corporations complicit in the occupation, and sanctions against the state of Israel.
“We’re standing here in front of the office of the premier of Quebec, because […] a lot of the drones that are used against the Palestinian people by Israel are manufactured here in Quebec,” said Lotayef. “We are responsible to speak against it all the time, […] until injustice ends, until the Palestinian rights are restored.”
“Israel and Quebec have bilateral [trade] agreements. We also have universities which do business with Israel. We ask for a boycott,” Marley told The Daily. “Today, we really wanted to put pressure on the Quebec government – the Israeli drones which are used right now [are] manufactured in Quebec.”
“We demand the right of return for the refugees, the end of the occupation, the end of the colonization which continues to intensify, the end of the blockade of Gaza, the dismantling of the ‘wall of shame,’ and above all, the end of apartheid practices and policies for a lasting peace in Palestine,” she told the crowd.

2014-09-29,McGill,Palestine,"Student group hosts panel on BDS, solidarity with Palestine
On September 25, the McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) hosted an informal panel discussion with three academics from the Institute of Islamic Studies – Associate Professor Michelle Hartman, Assistant Professor Ahmed Fekry Ibrahim, and Associate Professor Rula Abisaab – and the head librarian of the Islamic Studies Library, Anaïs Salamon. The event – the group’s first after being inactive for a few years – was centred on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and also served to introduce students to SPHR and its activities on campus.
Representatives of the group opened the discussion with a brief explanation of BDS and its objectives. “It’s basically an anti-colonialist call for solidarity with the human rights of Palestinian people in the OPT [occupied Palestinian territories], and with the diaspora as well,” said Nazim Elnur, an SPHR executive. “BDS espouses the tenets of non-violent political action in response to Israeli encroachment and transgressions against the life of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Similarly, BDS raises the call for solidarity with those Palestinians abroad [who were] expelled in the numerous periods of violent campaigns in the region and forced to migrate without the right to return.”
While the origins of the tactic can be traced as far back as 1945, when the Arab League called for a general boycott of the Zionist community in Palestine under the British Mandate, the BDS movement itself was initiated by Palestinians in 2005. Since then, the movement has achieved substantial international attention and support.
Elnur acknowledged, however, that BDS also has many detractors. “Some say the BDS movement works to delegitimize Israel and its status as a nation. […] Others say that, although BDS is a non-violent organization, many of its protests have turned violent.”
“These [accusations of violence] are all deflecting the question,” said Abisaab, stressing the importance of contextualizing isolated incidents of violence, rather than using them as a basis to judge BDS as a whole. “We cannot generalize that the movement itself carries the seeds of violence,” she said. “This is a non-violent cause, it is a just cause, and it is the only way to go.”
BDS initiatives fall into three broad categories, according to the movement’s website: boycotts, which target “Israeli and international companies and institutions that profit from the violation of Palestinian rights”; divestment, which involves selling off business interests or investments linked to Israel; and sanctions, which aim to “mobilize government officials and bodies to denounce trade with Israel, and especially with firms located on settlement ground,” according to Elnur.
Elnur made a point of highlighting the relevance of BDS to McGill, noting the existence of “University investment portfolios profiting from corporations directly involved in the Israeli occupation, more commonly [known as] the building of settlements internationally recognized as illegal.”
“I myself am torn over some of the issues,” said Ibrahim, discussing the moral complexity of the academic boycott. “I mean, how do you deal with Palestinians working at Israeli institutions? […] Those kinds of issues are difficult to resolve, but I think institutionally […] there is some collateral damage that will be done.”
Highlights from the SPHR McGill Panel 
The discussion was well-attended, exceeding the capacity of the room where it was held. “The mood was just fantastic,” said SPHR executive Anas Shakra. “It exceeded all our expectations.”
Hartman was also pleased that the event had attracted so much interest. “It’s so wonderful to see this many students […] from McGill at a meeting for Palestine solidarity. For me, that’s so exciting.”
Addressing the frustrations toward the often slow progress of BDS and the struggle for Palestinian human rights, Hartman shared grounds for optimism. “There is a momentum, which someone like me has seen over time, of a building of solidarity around the world,” said Hartman, who argued that there was a similarity between BDS and struggles against apartheid in South Africa. “It’s not nothing to say, well, we’re working on this little by little in places around the world.”
Hartman told participants that she is interested in the idea of normalization, which, in this context, is linked to a certain perception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to Hartman, it implies a certain equity between the two sides, and depicts the struggle as inevitable and age-old. “To me, that isn’t really the right analysis for this situation of colonialism.”
Salamon elaborated on the issue, sharing her experience of life in the OPT. “I lived in Palestine for two years in the early 2000s and this was really the moment when I realized that something needed to be done,” explained Salamon.
“I actually lived the daily effects of the occupation,” Salamon continued. “It made me realize how genuinely pro-Israeli we were in France. When you don’t know much about the conflict, you tend to oppose two equal sides without realizing that by doing that, you actually justify the Israeli occupation.”
One recurring theme was the actions McGill students should take in order to express their solidarity with Palestine and further the cause of BDS. According to Shakra and fellow SPHR executive Sara Ismail, one simple step would be to participate in the consumer boycott by avoiding Israeli products.
Another important demonstration of solidarity, said Hartman, is to seek information about the boycott. She stressed the value of challenging people’s misconceptions about BDS and spreading the word about the movement’s non-violent stance in day-to-day life. This, said SPHR executive Arezu Riahi, is one of the key objectives of SPHR at McGill. “Part of what we are trying to do is dispel this idea that resistance has to be necessarily violent. Awareness is a form of resistance.”

2014-11-02,McGill,Palestine,"Petitioners cite lack of simplified rules, denial of debate as bylaw infractions
Updated November 2, 2014.
Less than a week after its last case was settled, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Judicial Board (J-Board) has accepted a petition claiming that bylaw infractions occurred during the Fall 2014 SSMU General Assembly (GA) held on October 22. According to the petition, filed on October 29, the failure to adopt simplified rules of procedure for the GA and the indefinite postponement of the GA motion on solidarity with Palestine were violations of SSMU’s bylaws.
The two petitioners ask that the J-Board annul the decision to indefinitely postpone the Palestine solidarity motion and compel SSMU to hold a special GA for the purpose of discussing the motion. At the October 22 GA, the Palestine solidarity motion was postponed indefinitely by majority vote before it could be debated, and cannot be brought for discussion at a GA in its current form until Fall 2015.
“The main purpose [of the petition] really is to have a GA that follows the rules,” one of the two petitioners, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily. “It’s also to correct for the fact that the use of indefinite postponement was a violation of the bylaws, and also a violation of the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression that we are entitled to on a university campus.”
The petition names SSMU Council and the Speaker of Council as the respondents. According to J-Board Chief Justice Muna Tojiboeva, a hearing will occur only if a mediation session between representatives of the two parties, which will be confirmed after the two parties provide their factums to the J-Board, proves unsuccessful.
The petitioners claim that the indefinite postponement of the Palestine solidarity motion was a violation of article 5.4 of By-Law I-5, which states that “members present at the General Assembly must be given the opportunity to debate and amend each resolution.” According to the petition, the speaker was at fault for allowing a motion that was in conflict with this bylaw to pass at the GA.
“For students to be denied the right to actually debate and amend the resolution, which is what the bylaw states, that is where the violation was mostly felt around that motion,” the petitioner The Daily spoke to said.
In addition, the petitioners claim that SSMU failed to adhere to article 5.2 of By-Law I-5 in the lead-up to the GA. The article states that, one week before a GA, SSMU must adopt standing rules for the GA that “make Robert’s Rules easier for students to understand.” The article also states that the rules must be “publicized to the membership” at least five calendar days before the date of the GA.
“Looking at all the listservs that were sent by the VP Internal, as well as SSMU’s website, Twitter feed, and Facebook feed going back to September 1, there was no publishing of simplified rules,” said the petitioner. The simplified rules were never adopted by Council nor even drafted, the petitioner claimed.
SSMU President Courtney Ayukawa declined to comment.

2014-11-17,McGill,Palestine,"President, speaker deny breach of bylaws relevant to Palestine motion
On Sunday, Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) President Courtney Ayukawa released her and Speaker of Legislative Council Rachel Simmons’ defence factum in response to a recent Judicial Board (J-Board) case, in which petitioners Zain Ali Syed and Nadir Khan call for a special General Assembly (GA) to discuss the Palestine solidarity motion, which was postponed indefinitely at the October 22 SSMU GA. The case will bypass a mediation session and go right to a hearing.
The two petitioners have claimed that, at the GA, the indefinite postponing of the Palestine solidarity motion and Council’s failure to adopt a simplified version of Robert’s Rules constituted infractions of SSMU bylaws. Ayukawa is acting on behalf of Council in the case.
“Consistently not following the bylaw and then turning around and calling it ‘convention’ doesn’t magically make it okay.”
Khan and Syed’s factum has been revised since the case was first accepted by the J-Board in order to include a more detailed argument. The addition highlighted examples that indicated that students who spoke at the GA were unfamiliar with Robert’s Rules.
The revised version does not contain the original’s request to have the use of indefinite postponement declared unconstitutional, instead claiming that it should be overturned due to SSMU members’ lack of resources relating to Robert’s Rules – particularly in regard to motions that could have been used to counter the motion to postpone.
In their factum, Ayukawa and Simmons note that a simplified version of Robert’s Rules for a GA was only adopted once in the past three years, in 2012, most likely as a way to increase participation at the GA.
The factum argues that because the level of participation was not a concern to Council this year – there was evidently much interest in the motions being discussed, and quorum was not an issue – “[neither] the Speaker nor the Council was required to establish special standing rules for the General Assembly.”
It claims that this practice is convention at SSMU, and that, because no specific rules were drafted, the use of regular Robert’s Rules was in accordance with “official procedure.”
Syed and Khan refuted SSMU’s interpretation of their bylaws. “Consistently not following the bylaw and then turning around and calling it ‘convention’ doesn’t magically make it okay,” Khan and Syed told The Daily in a joint email.
“Bylaw I-5 article 5.2 clearly obliges them to adopt standing rules, so students can actually understand the procedures,” they continued.
Khan and Syed also claimed that the failure to adopt simplified standing rules for the GA was also a violation of article 5.4 of bylaw I-5, which requires that students “be given the opportunity to debate and amend each resolution,” arguing that students were not aware of the procedural tools available to fight the motion according to Robert’s Rules.
However, SSMU’s factum claims that the Speaker did not violate article 5.4 because it is stated in Robert’s Rules that, as soon as the question is stated by the Speaker, it is in the hands of the Assembly. “Once debate has been opened, the chair must recognize points and motions on the floor,” reads SSMU’s factum.
The declaration also notes that the Simmons, “recused herself from the position of Speaker for the Motion and was replaced by Mike Tong for the Motion and its proceedings,” meaning that Simmons was not acting as Speaker when the Palestine motion was postponed.
According to the email from the petitioners, Khan and Syed decided to forego mediation because there is limited time left in the semester and could not see any “meaningful solution” to the case outside holding a second GA.
Khan told The Daily that he has met with Ayukawa to discuss the alleged bylaw infractions. “Ultimately, we disagreed on the interpretation [of the bylaws]. The bylaws clearly oblige Council to adopt standing rules to make debate accessible,” said Khan.
The date of the hearing is yet to be determined, Ayukawa told The Daily in an email.

2015-01-19,McGill,Palestine,"Winter General Assembly pushed to March
The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council saw discussion on austerity and changes to tuition rates with Principal Suzanne Fortier at its first meeting of the Winter semester on January 14. Council also approved changes to bylaws regulating the SSMU Nominating Committee, and President Courtney Ayukawa announced the hiring of a new General Manager.
Ayukawa brought to Council a set of changes to bylaws regulating the Nominating Committee, which oversees the hiring of Elections SSMU staff and Judicial Board justices. The changes were originally intended to be part of a bigger set of changes to presidential portfolio regulations, the drafting of which has not yet been completed.
The motion will change the structure of the nominating committee to consist of four councillors and four members-at-large, compared to the previous composition, which had six executives and three councillors. It will also be chaired by the General Manager, a permanent, non-student position, instead of the President.
VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan said that the changes were meant to increase the objectivity of the committee. “We were looking to shift away from this extremely executive-heavy nominating committee, since these positions are supposed to be very distanced from SSMU, given that they [involve] elections and Judicial Board justices.”
Ayukawa announced in her report that the Winter 2015 General Assembly (GA) will be held in March, the week following reading week, as opposed to the originally scheduled date of February 11.
This, she said, is intended to put the GA during the SSMU Winter referendum and election campaign period – which runs from March 9 to 20 – when students are more passionate about SSMU, and to allow more time for SSMU to find a space to accommodate a large turnout of students.
“I have heard that there is likely going to be another very controversial motion coming to the GA,” said Ayukawa. A Palestine solidarity motion was responsible for most of the turnout to the Fall 2014 GA, which saw 800 students attending.
The date for the Winter GA will be announced at the next Council meeting.
Ayukawa also informed Council that a new General Manager has been hired and will begin work in February.
VP Clubs & Services Stefan Fong notified councillors that the SSMU building, along with other buildings on campus, is facing a mouse outbreak, noting that it was “not surprising” due to the amount of construction that has been taking place outside the SSMU building and throughout campus.
Fielding questions from councillors, Fortier reiterated her position that she does not oppose the government’s austerity measures. She said that she is in favour of capping the ‘clawback’ of international student tuition by the government in times such as these, when government contribution to the university is lower.
One councillor voiced concerns that with the proposed deregulation of out-of-province and international tuition, McGill might become a university for the financial elite, to which Fortier responded that the administration will do its best to keep McGill a university where admission is based solely on academic achievement.
Citing the high success rates of the Arts Internship Program, Fortier said that she is making the funding of student internship opportunities a priority, and that certain donors may create endowed funds to support these opportunities for students.
A common concern with some at SSMU has been with the legitimacy of McGill’s supposed dedication to community engagement. In response, Fortier listed instances of community learning in curriculums and student-led initiatives as examples of this dedication manifesting in real life, adding that that her main concern is being able to better communicate these initiatives to local community leaders.

2015-01-24,McGill,Palestine,"Settlement reached in case alleging bylaw infractions in Fall GA
A settlement was reached on January 17 in the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Judicial Board (J-Board) case filed by Nadir Khan and Zain Ali Syed against SSMU’s Legislative Council and Speaker. Despite the petitioners’ original intention, the settlement was reached in mediation, and there will be no special General Assembly (GA) to discuss the controversial Palestine solidarity motion that was postponed indefinitely at the Fall GA, as the petitioners had originally called for.
The terms of the settlement require the J-Board to make recommendations concerning two issues: first, whether or not article 5.2.2 of bylaw I-5 allows Council to institute a special standing rule requiring a two-thirds majority in the place of a simple majority for a motion to postpone indefinitely; and second, whether article 5.2 of the same bylaw obliges SSMU to adopt simplified Robert’s Rules for GAs, and, if it does, how SSMU should go about doing this.
The recommendations to be outlined by the J-Board are not binding, and would need to be adopted by the Council in order to take effect. At the October 23 Council meeting, following the GA, several councillors expressed concern about the confusing nature of Robert’s Rules.
The petition called for a special GA to be held, deeming several of the proceedings of the Fall GA unconstitutional according to SSMU’s bylaws, and claiming that these mistakes were why the Palestine solidarity motion was never debated.
“We hope we were able to at the very least raise awareness on some of the fundamental flaws of our General Assemblies.”
Khan and Syed, who initially wanted to forgo mediation and have a hearing last semester, said that they had agreed to compromise due to the fast-approaching date of the Winter GA, to be held in March. “It became clear that the effectiveness of our requests would no longer be feasible as the date of the Winter GA drew closer,” the petitioners told The Daily in an email.
While the J-Board has not yet delivered its recommendations as per the settlement, Ayukawa insisted that SSMU did not break its bylaws.
“The SSMU has followed its bylaws throughout this, and [it may be that nothing will change] in the upcoming GA. Only the petitioners have said that SSMU did not follow the bylaws. Furthermore, whether or not bylaws were broken at the first GA is not mentioned in the mediation agreement,” said Ayukawa in an email to The Daily.
The petitioners cited the J-Board’s lack of quorum during the end of last semester, and the subsequent pushing of the hearing of their case to the Winter semester, as reasons for these delays. Khan and Syed also explained that the settlement was reached over the course of one mediation session, facilitated by J-Board Chief Justice Muna Tojiboeva.
Overall, Ayukawa was content with the mediation settlement. “I am happy that we were able to come to a common ground with the petitioners that everyone is content with,” she wrote.
Khan and Syed indicated that they will not take further action if the impending J-Board recommendations are not in their favour, and expressed hope that they had at least succeeded in shedding light on some of the problems that exist at SSMU.
“Fighting this for nearly three months now was an exhausting process, and we hope we were able to at the very least raise awareness on some of the fundamental flaws of our General Assemblies,” they wrote.

2015-02-16,McGill,Palestine,"Social Justice Days event examines Israeli policies
Updated February 17, 2014.
On February 12, attendees convened at “The Face of State Violence and Police Brutality in Palestine,” the latest workshop in the Quebec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) McGill and the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)’s Social Justice Days 2015 series.
Facilitating the workshop were Maggie Gilligan and Zahra Habib, members of McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), a student organization that advocates for the rights of the Palestinian people.
The workshop offered an overview and discussion of the ways in which state violence and police brutality are used by Israel against Palestinians as part of a larger apartheid project.
The event began with a discussion of the ways in which state violence manifests visually in the lives of Palestinians, illustrating how these effects originate from institutions, such as the Israeli government and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), as well as ideologies like racism, Zionism, and settler-colonialism.
“What’s important to understand is that these are not isolated incidents,” said Habib, referencing the Israeli government’s disproportionate use of force. Habib cited the Dahiya doctrine, which calls for the use of asymmetrical warfare as a means of deterrence. Habib said that, although this doctrine violates the principle of proportionality in international law, it manifests itself on a daily basis for Palestinians through large-scale aerial raids (such as in Gaza last summer), home raids and demolitions, and arbitrary arrests, even of children.
Gilligan told The Daily that this kind of workshop is an important counterbalance to the dehumanizing effects of the Israeli and Western media. “The state violence perpetuated by the Israeli government is a very important part of the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is a part that is missed at best and silenced at worst,” she said. “So we think it is important to put forth the voices of civilians and children who have been harmed by state-sanctioned policies, and make sure everyone’s story is being told.”
One topic discussed was how to unpack the way Israeli and Western media tends to dehumanize Palestinians, and portray instances of state violence as responses to Palestinian dissidence.
In the discussion, workshop attendee Nadir Khan asserted that the world knows Israelis are using disproportionate force against Palestinians, but the magnitude of the violence and damage does not seem to resonate enough for the international community to demand change. Khan went on to question what students could do to bring about concrete change.
“The state violence perpetuated by the Israeli government is a very important part of the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and it is a part that is missed at best and silenced at worst.”
Ralph Haddad, a U2 Middle Eastern Studies and Women’s Studies stdent and former Daily editor, suggested countering the Israeli public relations machine as a method. “We should employ emerging media that exist outside of that sphere to further our own cause […] because Israel is known to employ students and employees in giant operations, using Facebook and Twitter and social media to spread propaganda to gain sympathy for the IDF. There is no way to counter that without stopping [the perpetration of] our own rhetoric.”
Haddad also stressed the need to recognize the connections between Palestinian struggles and other struggles. Intersectionality “makes us stronger,” he said.
During the workshop, Gilligan highlighted increasing awareness of the intersectionality between black struggles in the U.S. and those in Palestine, as both governments respond to dissent with similar repression. “It’s important to make this connection because they stem from the same place and I think a lot of similar strategies can be used to combat them. And again another direct link is that one of the police forces that was used in
Ferguson to calm protesters was trained by the IDF. So we have the policy links, the theoretical links, we also have a lot of direct links that are a lot closer than we think.”

2015-02-23,McGill,Palestine,"BRIEF
On February 20, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Judicial Board (J-Board) released a set of recommendations regarding rules of procedure at General Assemblies (GAs). These specified that SSMU is required to adopt and publicize a simplified version of standing rules for the GA, but that a special two-thirds majority rule instead of a simple majority for a “motion to postpone indefinitely” was not a valid standing rule.
The J-Board was mandated to investigate the matter on January 17 as a result of a mediation session to resolve a J-Board case against the SSMU president and speaker filed by Nadir Khan and Zain Ali Syed. They had sought a special GA to discuss the Palestine solidarity motion that had been postponed indefinitely at the Fall SSMU GA.
The J-Board ruled that article 5.2 of By-law Book I requires SSMU to adopt simplified standing rules and to publicize these rules to its members at least five days in advance of the GA.
However, the J-Board recommendation makes a distinction between “standing rules” and “special rules of procedure.” It notes that “standing rules” – which are meant to regulate the administration of SSMU – “do not interfere with the freedom of a meeting, and they may not conflict with the constitution, bylaws, rules of order, or other standing rules,” and can be changed without prior notice by a majority vote at any meeting.
However, “rules of procedure” are in place to facilitate the meetings, and cannot be changed as easily.
The two-thirds majority rule for the motion to postpone indefinitely is a change to rules of procedure. Thus, in its recommendation, the J-Board stated that it is not under the authority of Council to include a revision to the motion to postpone indefinitely.
However, the recommendation did note that the rule could be changed if the Board of Directors was to adopt a change, or if members at the GA voted to amend or suspend the rules of order. According to the ruling, both Robert’s Rules of Order and article 13.2 of the SSMU constitution support this.

2015-03-09,McGill,Palestine,"Panelists draw similarities between South Africa and Israel in SSMU-hosted event
On February 23, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) hosted a panel entitled “Boycotting Apartheid States.” Organized in collaboration with McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), the event was moderated by SSMU VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette.
The panelists – Michelle Hartman, associate professor of Arabic literature; Jon Soske, assistant professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies; and Samia Botmeh, a professor at Birzeit University in the West Bank – drew links between the apartheid regime in South Africa and Israeli apartheid practices in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They connected campaigns against the South African apartheid regime from the late 1950s until the 1990s to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement initiated by Palestinian civil society in 2005 to pressure the Israeli government into ending its occupation of the West Bank and its ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip.
Soske, who specializes in modern African history, opened the panel by asserting that the apartheid analogy between Israel and South Africa is uncontroversial in South Africa, and drew similarities between the conditions that Israel enforces on Palestinians and the conditions enforced by white South Africans on the black community under the apartheid regime.
Soske noted that sanctions came in the form of economic pressure on the apartheid South African government, which greatly affected the livelihoods of white South Africans, and emphasized the integral role of universities in kickstarting the movement through boycotts and divestment.
“For universities as institutions to take an early stance and say, ‘We will no longer be complicit with apartheid,’ was key to starting to push broader sections of society in [Canada and the U.S.] against apartheid,” said Soske.
“One of the most important things said here is that there’s no neutrality on an issue like this.”
Botmeh, a member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel, stated that the BDS movement was a response to the asymmetric nature of the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the 1980s and 1990s, notably in negotiating the 1995 Oslo Accords.
“You cannot make peace […] assuming symmetry of power, because there is no symmetry of power between the oppressor and the oppressed,” said Botmeh.
Botmeh also took issue with the international community’s response to the situation in Palestine, claiming that it is treated like a humanitarian issue rather than a political one. “Dealing with Palestinians as if the creation of the state of Israel led to a natural catastrophe has meant that the intervention was very charity-like,” said Botmeh. “So [they] feed the Palestinians, [they] provide them with all forms of charity, and that neutralized the political factor. What the BDS movement tries to do is hold the international community responsible.” 
Hartman maintained that it is the duty of professionals, academics, and students alike to respond to the call for BDS, which comes from their colleagues who live under occupation in Palestine. She called on the audience to reflect on why, for example, some might choose to boycott Israeli academic institutions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
“[The] Hebrew University [of Jerusalem] is built on confiscated land, it is built over a Palestinian village,” said Hartman. “As Canadians, and people studying at Canadian educational institutions [built in Indigenous land], I think we need to take that very seriously, and take that into account, and look [at] where the calls [for solidarity] are coming from. When we have a call like [BDS], it is our duty to respond to it.”
“It is very empowering to know that people stand in solidarity with us, and that enables us to resist and move forward on the path of liberation,” Botmeh declared. 
The fact that the panel was organized by SSMU drew opposition from some students. An online petition expressing concern with the event began circulating a few days before the panel, and gathered 220 signatures.
“SSMU should ensure that there is open and balanced dialogue on such contentious topics,” the petition reads. “We are upset that SSMU, which we expect to represent the entire student body of McGill, has chosen to host an event that offers only one perspective on such a divisive issue.” 
Moustaqim-Barrette explained to The Daily that the panel was a result of students’ calls for forums for such debates, made during the discussion of a Palestine solidarity motion at the Fall SSMU General Assembly (GA). SSMU was also mandated to “support campaigns that mobilize in solidarity with the people affected by the use of military technology” at the GA.
An anonymous U2 Science student, who attended the event, found the petition expressing concern about the event “hypocritical.”
“Facilitating those debates is what they were asking for at the GA to begin with, so in that sense I think it does fall under SSMU’s mandate and it is SSMU’s responsibility to facilitate,” they told The Daily.
U0 Arts student Jonah Winer told The Daily that the panel had brought about personal reflection. “In general I’m not a huge fan of the BDS movement, but I also realize that I’ve only heard really negative portrayals of it,” he said. “I think to hear people who [participate] in forming [the movement], and also people who are really [in] favour of it, gives it a lot of nuance and gives me a lot to think about.”
U3 Arts student Ameya Pendse expressed concern about the selection of panelists. “I was, to be honest, disgusted that SSMU was hosting an event on such a divisive issue on campus,” he said. “I think that it was very sad that there wasn’t a single person or academic to counter what these three panelists were saying. […] I think SSMU should focus on issues that are actually affecting students. […] They should not be taking foreign affairs decisions, that is not why we elected them.” 
Asked whether SSMU should remain neutral on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Moustaqim-Barrette said that this was impossible. “There is no way to be neutral in these kinds of affairs, I think that’s just a way of silencing dissent and just another form of censorship,” she said. “I think it’s important that SSMU talks about these things and has events like these where people can come talk about these things.” 
“I think one of the most important things said here is that there’s no neutrality on an issue like this,” noted Winer. “You’re either for or against, and to try to remain neutral is disingenuous.”

2015-03-16,McGill,Palestine,"Panelists note similarities in police behaviour, resistance tactics 
A panel titled “Racial Profiling & Police Brutality from Ferguson to Palestine” kicked off this year’s Israeli Apartheid Week.
Held on March 10 and organized by the Centre for Gender Advocacy as part of its Thick Skin event series on race, gender, and political resistance, the panel discussed the connections between police violence in Palestine and in Canada and the U.S..
This was done by inviting the unique perspectives of three activists – Nargess Mustapha, activist from the Montréal-Nord Républik collective; Ahmad Abuznaid, a co-founder of the Miami-based Dream Defenders; and Cherrell Brown, from the juvenile and criminal justice advocacy organization Justice League NYC.
Two of the event’s organizers, Talia Joundi, a law student at McGill, and Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, from the Centre for Gender Advocacy, introduced the event and explained the importance of drawing parallels between these different experiences.
Joundi noted that “making the connection to people in North America is important to make the lived reality of Palestinians more understandable.”
Rolbin-Ghanie added, “We are by no means saying the struggle is the same – the differences need to be respected. But there are definitely parallels between who the police is profiling and what kinds of colonial mentality are produced by the police in general.”
As the audience filled the Moot Court room in Chancellor Day Hall, some were excited to learn practical skills.
“I came to increase my knowledge of racial profiling and get some tactics to apply to my own life,” explained U1 Biology student Alice Salim.
Others came out of curiosity. “I was in Ferguson in the fall, and saw the early solidarity with Palestinians,” explained Julie Norman, professor in the Department of Political Science, whose research focuses in part on prisoner resistance and prison and detention policies in Palestine.
“Though they are different contexts, there are definitely similar situations in terms of mass arrests, mass incarceration, profiling certain populations, difficult interrogation tactics, and the pressure to confess for a lighter sentence. All these things are very similar,” commented Norman.
Mustapha, speaking in French with live translation, began by discussing the difficult realities faced by Montreal North residents, saying that “police harassment and racial profiling [are] a part of everyday life.”
Mustapha next discussed how the murder of Freddy Villanueva in 2008 – who was shot by Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) officer Jean-Loup Lapointe, who confronted Villenueva and his friends as they were playing dice in Parc Henri-Bourassa – was an example of the worst of the SPVM’s practice of profiling in minority communities.
“In 2010, the internal SPVM report by criminologist Mathieu Charest, which La Presse acquired, showed how common [racial profiling] is,” said Mustapha. “Since 2001, identity checks in Montreal North had gone up by 126 per cent. In 2006 and 2007, 30 to 40 per cent of young black men were being stopped and frisked, while non-racialized Montrealers were stopped and frisked at a rate of 5 per cent.”
Brown spoke next, discussing state violence by sharing stories from a recent trip to Palestine with members of Black Lives Matter – a movement dedicated to combatting racist police violence against black people – and emphasizing the power of social media in sharing tactics.
“That’s the beauty of social media, we have people in another country [who] some folks in Ferguson [have] never heard of, but these are the people tweeting us and telling us how to survive this occupation right now, [with advice like] ‘walk with the wind and not against it,’ or ‘use milk of magnesia and not water when tear-gassed,’” Brown explained.
Having witnessed police brutality and profiling in Palestine firsthand, Brown stressed, “We have to imagine safety and security for ourselves. […] We must imagine something entirely different for ourselves and our children. It will probably be our greatest art project – to imagine a truly liberated world, outside of the scope, definitions, and parameters given to us by our oppressors.”
Next, Abuznaid shared his personal story of returning to Palestine, his birthplace, and rediscovering his roots after a childhood in the U.S..
“At Ben Gurion airport, I was seven years old, and we were taken to a back room where myself and my mother were strip-searched,” Abuznaid recalled. “There were guns and military soldiers everywhere. Immediately, alarms went off in my head that something was not right.”
A lively question and answer period followed, covering the problem of charismatic male leaders in movements, attitudes toward violent resistance, and the on-campus mobilization for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which aims to increase pressures on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territory.
After a standing ovation at the event’s conclusion, one student, beaming, told The Daily, “It was absolutely amazing. I loved it.”

2015-03-30,McGill,Palestine,"The Daily looks back at the performance of the 2014-15 councillors

This year’s executive, currently entering the final days of its time leading the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), has demonstrated leadership in areas such as austerity mobilization and support for student-run services, often going above and beyond to advocate for the University to make student voices a priority when making decisions in these areas. 
SSMU made a big effort at its general assembly, which was much more organized that the Fall GA, revised the Equity policy in response to issues raised by students, and hosted many teaching events and forums, thus showing an increased push for student consultation this year. However, there definitely remains room for SSMU to improve in this area. Overall, despite bumps along the way, this was a much better year for SSMU compared to previous years.
Click on a position to see its end-year review.
For many students, the SSMU General Assembly (GA) is the most visible part of the President’s portfolio. Similar to last semester, the Winter 2015 GA was one of the central events of Ayukawa’s term. Indeed, it was very well-organized compared to the fall — while also the site of multiple controversial motions and with an initial turnout of over 500 students, it did not see the same time and security delays present at the Fall GA, and went much more smoothly. However, like the Fall GA, attendance dropped significantly after the first motion on Palestine solidarity, and quorum was lost for the last motion.

Ayukawa was also behind a number of small sustainability initiatives this year, including the introduction of a SSMU composting program and the broadening of the Green Events Coordinator and Green Buildings Coordinator job descriptions. Ayukawa also plans to do interviews with the incoming SSMU executive for the 2014-15 Sustainability Assessment, which will take place in May.

Additionally, Ayukawa has shown initiative in her negotiations with the administration, as she made an attempt to open Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) negotiations with the University one year early. This attempt, however, was unsuccessful due to a lack of cooperation from the administration. She has also been one of the less vocal members of the student Senate caucus this semester. While the bulk of the Presidential portfolio concerns Human Resources and is thus oftentimes less visible, it is important for the head of a student society such as SSMU to have a visible leadership presence, which has ultimately been inconsistent throughout Ayukawa’s term.
As the member of the executive charged with representing SSMU’s interests outside of McGill, VP External Amina Moustaqim-Barrette has motivated a variety of initiatives this year. Aided by her previous involvement with Divest McGill, Moustaqim-Barrette helped organize SSMU’s involvement with the People’s Climate March, and also initiated SSMU’s affiliation with anti-pipeline group Étudiant(e)s contre les oléoducs (ÉCO), which now represents over 100,000 students across Quebec. 

While environmental initiatives at SSMU have quieted down this semester, anti-austerity organizing has picked up. Initiatives such as the recent anti-austerity activities night, actions of the mobilization committee, and the hiring of a mobilization officer are commendable attempts to increase engagement with ongoing issues in Montreal and Quebec. However, the mobilization of McGill students has not been particularly successful — this lack of student interest in the VP External portfolio was highlighted by the fact that no one ran for the position in the first round of SSMU executive elections last week. Although two candidates are now running in by-elections, dwindling student engagement in external issues is a problem that both the current and future VP External should seek to improve. 

One of Moustaqim-Barrette’s recent projects has been to explore the possibility of starting a new student federation. In light of SSMU’s disaffiliation from the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ) last year, and the possible dissolution of the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), this move to maintain and improve McGill’s connection with other Quebec universities is a necessary step forward.
Kathleen Bradley has done well as this year’s SSMU VP Finance and Operations. She succeeded in bringing a more clearly presented budget to Council. A huge change from last year was Bradley’s outreach to the media concerning this year’s budget: when the budget first came out at the beginning of the year, Bradley sat down with campus media and explained it to them in full, demonstrating a clear dedication to transparency and willingness to communicate with students. However, further initiatives to increase the visibility of SSMU’s budget among the student body as a whole, and to make students more aware of where their fees are going, would have been beneficial. 

Bradley told The Daily she was glad to help SSMU break even on its budget and see sales rise at student-run cafe The Nest. She said that the continued expansion of student-run operations is one thing she hopes will be continued by next year’s executive as well. At SSMU Council meetings, Bradley has asserted that she expects the Nest to break even next year. 

Bradley has done a great deal of work this year to promote student-run operations beyond the explicit demands of her portfolio, and we commend Bradley on her involvement with the Food Coalition and for leading SSMU in its support of student-run services, which have been under constant attack from the administration this year. A minor criticism of Bradley, however, is that throughout the year she has been reluctant to give as much time to campus media inquiries as compared to other members of this year’s executive and past holders of Bradley’s current position.
During his second year as VP Clubs & Services, Stefan Fong has endeavoured to make clubs more accessible to students and to increase student consultation. Fong told The Daily that he hopes that the Club Hub, a club management portal Fong has been developing since his first year in office, will finally be implemented under next year’s VP Clubs & Services, as the research and consultative phases have been completed. 

In working toward achieving the Club Hub, Fong obtained constitutions from clubs that he identified as being active this year, thereby updating the list of functioning clubs. Additionally, Fong told The Daily that he wants to see the development of a co-curricular activities record, wherein participation in SSMU clubs would be recorded on a student’s transcript. While this is a worthwhile endeavor, it is still in developmental phases and is unlikely to be implemented this year. 

Fong also showed initiative by rewriting the bylaw book for clubs and services. Overall, Fong has been an active member of Council, taking one of the executive positions often perceived as more mundane and very much making it his own. However, Fong has also faced criticism from various clubs and services for failing to consult with them before SSMU imposed clubs regulations. While this is a near-inevitable side effect of improving the organization of the Clubs & Services portfolio, the future VP Clubs & Services should seek to maintain and improve SSMU’s relationship with its clubs to help facilitate future cooperation.
Daniel Chaim has prided himself on amassing larger amounts of revenue than last year’s executive in every social event that he has run as VP Internal, including 4Floors. Although some of the events still ran a deficit, Frosh almost broke even, missing the mark by a margin of only 0.35 per cent. 

He also assisted in the restructuring of the Students’ Society Programming Network (SSPN), which increased overall volunteer involvement by delegating more responsibilities to volunteers and giving them more experience with event planning. Chaim noted that he had worked closely with SSPN this year and said that the committee played an integral role in the running of SSMU’s social events. 

Chaim has not had many visible accomplishments this year outside of the standard organizing of these events; his proposed publications fee, for example, has as of yet failed to materialize. He has done little to go beyond the minimum requirements mandated by his portfolio; for example, he has failed to use the listserv as a tool to promote political engagement. This lack of drive to do more than the basic requirements of his portfolio was the most concerning aspect of Chaim’s performance this year.
Claire Stewart-Kanigan has been exceptionally active in student advocacy as VP University Affairs in many ways. On the policy front, she has been heavily involved in the continued development of a sexual assault policy for McGill, has helped update SSMU’s Equity Policy to allow for consultation with relevant student groups, and has worked on formalizing SSMU’s stance in opposition to harmful military research on campus. Stewart-Kanigan has also been central to the successful launch of SSMU’s mental health department.

Stewart-Kanigan has continued work on decolonization by seeking to bring a territory acknowledgement to Senate by the end of the year. Student researchers under her portfolio have also been very active, notably investigating equitable hiring practices at McGill. At Senate, Stewart-Kanigan has continued to provide a strong presence, and has acted as an effective leader for the SSMU Senate caucus.

Student consultation and collaboration have been a priority for Stewart-Kanigan. She has held forums and informational sessions, and has been receptive to concerns brought forward by students such as the women-only gym hours. Overall, Stewart-Kanigan has fulfilled her mandate exceptionally well, and has had a lasting impact on the university.

2015-03-30,McGill,Palestine,"The Daily looks back

The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) saw its fair share of the short-lived SSMU President Tariq Khan this year. Elections SSMU invalidated Khan’s election as SSMU President on April 1, 2014 – a week after he was elected president by a margin of only 78 votes – due to SSMU bylaw infractions committed during his campaign. The violations included the participation of individuals external to SSMU in his campaign, the sending of unsolicited text messages to the public – for which he had been censured on March 21, the last day of the campaign period –  inconsistencies in campaign expenditures, and the impingement of the spirit of a fair campaign and of the voting process.
Following his invalidation, Khan filed an appeal with the SSMU Judicial Board (J-Board), which upheld his invalidation on April 29. Khan later took this issue to the Superior Court of Quebec and filed a request on May 29 for a preliminary injunction to reinstate him as SSMU President until the full hearing for a permanent injunction. The Court dismissed his application on June 3, reasoning that his reinstatement would have incurred additional costs and caused undue inconvenience on the part of SSMU. Khan later withdrew his court case in October before its full hearing due to financial motivations and the decreasing timeliness of the case.
Khan resurfaced on the first day of the 2015-16 SSMU elections when screenshots of a Facebook conversation were released on reddit, revealing recently-elected SSMU President Kareem Ibrahim’s suggestion to hack Khan’s Facebook account last year. Upon news of the screenshots, he revealed his intentions to update the police report that he filed after his account was allegedly hacked on March 27, 2014.

Compared with 2011’s McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA) strike, the past few years have been fairly quiet on the union front. This year, however, has seen a flurry of activity at McGill unions.
Floor fellows began a union drive over a year ago in November 2013, driven by the University’s earlier push for a change in residence models. Since then, floor fellows have succeeded at forming a union, and joined the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE) last May. The process, however, has not been without hiccups: this January,collective agreement negotiations between the University and the floor fellows bargaining unit stalled over the exclusion of the “core values” of floor fellows (namely their anti-oppressive mandate and harm reduction approach) from the proposed agreement. The negotiations have started again and are currently ongoing.
McGill’s Teaching Union, AGSEM, has also been working to unionize undergraduate teaching support staff, which include course graders, note-takers, and teaching assistants (TAs). Despite receiving support from post-grads and undergrads, the process has not been without tensions: McGill challenged AGSEM’s promotion of its own union campaign due to disputing interpretations of the Quebec Labour Code. At the date of publication, the union drive is still ongoing.
This year also saw a merger between AMUSE and MUNACA, despite some internal trepidation over their differing sizes. Joint bylaws are on the way.

The mental health landscape at McGill for the 2014-15 academic year has been a disappointing one. Though a working group was struck under the purview of Senate in October 2013, most of the recommendations issued by the group in June 2014 have yet to be implemented. Of the 36 initiatives on the roster, only two have been completed, the first being the development of a student services app, and the second publicly presented only as “further [development] of a robust early alert program.”
While both the administration and student government have been pursuing mental health services reform, they do not appear to be working closely. SSMU VP University Affairs Claire Stewart-Kanigan told The Daily in October, around the time the University announced its intention to create a ‘wellness portal,’ that the relationship between the two was “a consultative arrangement, not a partnership. Given that SSMU is named as a partner on the website, consultation is not enough.”
There have been no updates on the ‘wellness portal,’ projected to be launched in Winter 2015.
Most of the visible events that have taken place this year – in particular, the second annual Students In Mind conference on mental health in October and the Mental Health Awareness Week in November – were largely student-driven and student-led initiatives. Additionally, the most vocal advocates for mental health reform have been students.
In addition to managing the planning and execution of the Mental Health Awareness Week, Stewart-Kanigan oversaw the successful launch of SSMU’s new mental health department, which involved the hire of a coordinator and the development of a mental health listserv to promote peer and professional support services for students and forward student-led anti-stigma initiatives.

After years of SSMU General Assemblies (GAs) that have failed to reach quorum or present particularly political motions, portions of this year’s GAs saw huge turnout – with over 700 students attending the Fall 2014 GA and over 500 students at the Winter 2015 GA – as well as plenty of controversy.
Most notably, both GAs saw motions that poked at the long-dormant Israel-Palestine divide on campus. At the Fall 2014 GA, a motion to stand in solidarity with the people of the occupied Palestinian territories and condemn Israel’s violence toward Palestine over the summer was postponed indefinitely, with 402 in favour and 337 against, after hours of debate. At the Winter 2015 GA, a motion to divest from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories garnered the endorsement of many campus groups (including The Daily), but failed by only 64 votes.
Despite the intense attention given to these two motions, a number of other political motions passed, mandating SSMU to take action on diverse issues such as unpaid internships, military research, climate change, and austerity. SSMU also saw a J-Board challenge after the contentious postponement of the Fall 2014 Palestine motion, where the judicial body ruled that simplified standing rules should be adopted and publicized at GAs to better facilitate debate.
More broadly, this year’s GAs have prompted a campus-wide (and still ongoing) dialogue on the political role of the student union – which most notably played itself out in the recent 2015-16 SSMU executive elections – with some students questioning whether SSMU should take stances on ‘divisive’ political issues.

This year has seen a whirlwind of opposition against austerity measures and budget cuts set in place by the Liberal provincial government, which have reduced funding to social services, including welfare, healthcare, and education. In the fall, as part of an ongoing push that began even before this academic year, students at UQAM organized a group to allow students and community members to work together to protest these cuts: the Comité Printemps 2015, which helped mobilize around 80,000 students to go on strike on Halloween, and over 80,000 students planned to strike against austerity during March and April. This mobilization has not evaded McGill, as French language and literature students recently voted to go on strike for a week, and other departments have planned strike votes.
These student initiatives contrast with the stance taken by the McGill administration, which has been accommodating of austerity measures. McGill has been making cuts of its own, after undergoing $45 million in cuts from the provincial government over the last four years. The results of these cuts have been felt by workers at McGill, as the administration has set up a hiring freeze, decreasing the number of jobs available, and increasing the workloads of many employees. To combat the administration’s decrease in the number of full-time jobs at McGill, as well as the fact that many positions with benefits have been replaced with lower-paid, part-time jobs that do not receive benefits, AMURE recently voted to start a fund for counselling services for its members.

In response to the austerity measures taken by both McGill and the Quebec government SSMU and the Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS) have taken stances against the government’s measures and asked McGill to oppose these huge cuts. At the SSMU Fall 2014 GA, students voted to add advocating against austerity to the portfolio of the VP External, and SSMU has since hosted an anti-austerity activities night to show students just how wide-reaching the damaging effects of austerity can be.
—Jill Bachelder
Many important initiatives that began in previous years were continued and strengthened over the course of this one. Divest McGill helped organize a bus to take McGill and Concordia students to the People’s Climate March in New York City, where over 400,000 people marched in the streets of Manhattan to protest the United Nations Climate Summit and raise awareness about global warming. Divest also submitted a new petition for McGill to divest from fossil fuel companies to the Board of Governors (BoG), making a comeback two years after its first petition was presented to, and rejected by, the BoG. In addition, over 100 faculty members signed on to an open letter submitted to the BoG in support of divestment.
SSMU also continued its efforts to promote sustainability on campus, starting a composting program in the Shatner building, and joining Étudiant(e)s contre les oléoducs (ÉCO), after the a motion passed at the Fall 2014 GA that mandated SSMU to stand alongside groups combatting climate change.
Finally, the McGill Office of Sustainability launched its Vision 2020 program, an initiative aiming to create a more sustainable McGill by the year 2020.

2015-10-15,McGill,Palestine,"New socialism will be better, more capable, Miguel Figueroa says
Miguel Figueroa has been leading Canada’s Communist Party since 1992 and fighting for socialism in Canada for over 40 years. In the upcoming 2015 federal election, Figueroa is running in the Ontario riding of Davenport. The Daily interviewed Figueroa while he was in Montreal to campaign.
The McGill Daily (MD): Could you talk a bit about your party, your program, and how it’s different from other parties?
Miguel Figueroa (MF): The main point of departure is that we consider the crisis situation of capitalism, not only in Canada, but internationally. […] The Harper Conservatives are probably the most reactionary, pro-war, misogynist, anti-Aboriginal government in Canadian history, so obviously there needs to be an alternative. But the alternatives that are being offered are really quite feeble and tepid, and all within a narrow box of neoliberal economic dogma – the primacy of the market, the idea that business is what creates employment.
We’re the only party in this election campaign that’s talking about the ‘s word,’ about socialism. […] Even the Greens, with respect to transitioning our economic model toward a greener economy, are within the context of finding market-based solutions to this problem, basically upholding the status quo.
Canada’s fundamental transition to a greener economy will involve massive investments in renewable energy and transportation systems to move toward high-speed rail and other forms of massive transit. […] All of these things can only be done, first of all, if the Canadian people own, control, and develop our energy resources socially, as opposed to [these resources] being developed by the private oil monopolies. Secondly, we’ll need that wealth [from nationalizing energy] in order to finance that kind of significant transition in our economy. […] So we call for nationalizing energy.
“The Harper Conservatives are probably the most reactionary, pro-war, misogynist, anti-Aboriginal government in Canadian history, so obviously there needs to be an alternative.”
MD: How do you see the way to move forward in this kind of direction in Canada? What do you see as the best way to put these issues back into public consciousness?
MF: Even one communist in Parliament would change that institution – we could raise things in Parliament that right now aren’t being discussed at all. […] The corporate-run media virtually blacks us out, so it’s very tough, but what we’re finding is that where we do reach people, people have the sense that the system is in crisis and the problems are systemic. People are really searching for alternatives, perhaps more than they have been in a long time.
MD: What is your vision for a socialist or communist Canada? How do you envision it as different from those experiments that might not have been successful in the past?
MF: If you measure capitalism today by its early days, when there was the slave trade, child labour – well, that’s not capitalism today, that was a long time ago. […] But for socialism, that’s [usually] the end of the debate – tried it once, didn’t work. […] The next wave of socialism will be rather different from the earliest experiences, for no other reason than we’ve learned a lot of lessons about the importance, for instance, of working people truly having control and a sense of ownership over the building of a new society. It shouldn’t be built on their behalf, passively.
“The next wave of socialism will be rather different from the earliest experiences.”
MD: What is your party’s position on Canada’s role in colonialism, for instance, as it relates to the occupation of Palestine?
MF: In general, it’s a shameful role that Canada’s playing internationally, a very aggressive, pro-imperialist role. […] We’re the only party in this election campaign that says that Canada should get out of [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]. […] We call for a truly independent foreign policy based on peace and disarmament.
Our party unreservedly supports and is in solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people for their right of self-determination, and for the right to have a viable independent state and an end to the occupation, tearing down the wall, ending the seizure of Gaza, the release of political prisoners.
MD: What about Canada’s relationship with Indigenous communities here, on whose lands it’s built?
MF: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission report says that the [Canadian government’s] policy against the Aboriginal peoples constitutes cultural genocide, and yet our government won’t even recognize that, much less implement the 94 recommendations that the commission proposed. That’s outrageous, so we’re also obviously in solidarity with the struggles of Aboriginal peoples, for the just resolution of their outstanding land claims, for their right to self-determination in the sense that they should be recognized as nations within Canada in the constitution – and so should Quebec and the Acadian peoples.
“In general, it’s a shameful role that Canada’s playing internationally, a very aggressive, pro-imperialist role.”
MD: Earlier, you mentioned democracy, mass participation in the building of a new society and worker participation [in its building]. This is something that goes deeper than just electoral democracy, so what kind of work does your party do between elections and what can other people do to create those conditions today?
MF: We don’t believe in coups or conspiracies, we think that socialism will only come when the majority want it to come and are prepared to act to bring it about. […] We think it’s likely that there will be a convergence of social forces and political forces into a kind of people’s coalition, including the Communist Party, but other left forces as well. For us, the battle of real social change is the battle of ideas, and getting working people particularly to start becoming conscious of their place in society.
MD: Is there something you’d like to say to us specifically as university students? What is our role in this broader struggle?
MF: You have your whole future ahead of you, and it’s a future that is pretty bloody bleak. The cost of housing has exploded, the cost of getting an education, it’s completely out of control. If anybody should be voting en masse it should be young people, because you have the most at stake. I think it’s really important for students to be conscious about what their interests are, but then to go out and express it everywhere: at the polls, but also in your communities, on your campuses, and in social struggles.

2015-11-02,McGill,Palestine,"McGill student solidarity group focuses conversation on human rights
On October 28, Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill presented a workshop entitled “Palestine 101: Intro to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.” The event was organized as part of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Week at Concordia, and was the only event held by SPHR McGill.
The speakers were Melis Çagan, Ralph Haddad (former Daily editor and current director on the Board of the Daily Publications Society), and Michael McCauley, three members of SPHR McGill.
The workshop began with a brief overview of the occupation and the plight of Palestinians living in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and the diaspora, respectively. The overview, presented by McCauley and Haddad, described the blockade and military assaults on the Gaza Strip, instances of police brutality against Palestinians, and the Israeli West Bank Barrier, also known as the Wall.
“This blockade of the Strip has prevented the reconstruction of homes that have been demolished in previous military assaults against the region, and have also virtually destroyed the Gaza economy,” McCauley said. “There is […] a 43 per cent unemployment rate in the Strip – that is the result of both the blockade and these repeated military assaults.”
“There is […] a 43 per cent unemployment rate in the Strip – that is the result of both the blockade and these repeated military assaults.”
The presentation included footage showing Palestinian refugee camps being demolished by the Israeli state, as well as analysis of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, with a focus on the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords, and the 2000 Camp David negotiations.
“The problem with these peace talks [is] that they’re very asymmetrical. They lean more toward Israel’s side than the Palestinian side,” said Haddad. “They also assume that both parties are equal and they have the same to bring to the negotiation table, which is inherently wrong. You can’t sit down at a table with your oppressor and talk about an equal exchange that will happen between you.”
The visual presentation displayed the three demands of the BDS call: “Ending [the Israeli state’s] occupation and colonization of all Arab lands [occupied in June 1967] and dismantling the Wall; recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties, as stipulated in [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194].”
“Because there is no constant stance in Palestine about a one-state or two-state solution, by focusing BDS on having [human] rights, [since] there’s a general consensus on what rights people should have […] it’s easier for people from different political views to take part in it,” noted Çagan.
“Neutrality in this case means complicity with the oppressor, and I think this attitude needs to change if we are ever to make any strides in standing in solidarity with the liberation struggles of [the Palestinian] people.”
Çagan concluded the presentation by discussing the relative success of international calls for BDS, which began in 2004 with a Palestinian campaign for academic boycott. Recent successes of the BDS movement worldwide include the French multinational infrastructure company Veolia selling its shares in the consortium that runs Jerusalem Light Rail as well as the global mobilization to divest from G4S, a British multinational security company that provides security equipment and supplies to Israeli prisons in the West Bank.
Following the presentation, participants brought up questions comparing boycott and divestment tactics used to end South African apartheid in the 1980s and 1990s and BDS against Israeli apartheid today. Discussion also centered on McGill’s role in the BDS movement. McGill has investments in G4S as well as Re/Max, a real estate company that sells properties in Israeli settlements.
Liza Riitters, a U1 Political Science student who attended the workshop, noted that while many students she knew were in support of the Palestinian cause, many others at McGill did not support divestment. “I was here last year when they were trying to [divest from the occupation of Palestinian territory], and so many people were saying ‘Oh, the university shouldn’t have an opinion,’” said Riitters.
Ayesha Talreja, a U3 International Development student and member of SPHR McGill said, “Neutrality in this case means complicity with the oppressor, and I think this attitude needs to change if we are ever to make any strides in standing in solidarity with the liberation struggles of [the Palestinian] people.”

2015-11-02,McGill,Palestine,"A look at the boycott, divestment and
sanctions movement at Concordia and McGill
Between October 26 and 30, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) Concordia organized a week-long campaign dedicated to raising awareness about the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
BDS Week was the first of its kind at Concordia, and featured speakers such as Kanien’kehá:ka activist Clifton Nicholas, human rights attorney and activist Noura Erakat, and Palestine-based independent journalist Dan Cohen. The week also featured musical performances by Saeed Kamjoo, Julien Ottavi, and JKPickett as part of the Howl! fall event series.
Last year, between November 25 and 27, Concordia students passed a referendum that asked students, “Do you approve of the [Concordia Students’ Union (CSU)] endorsing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel?”
The initial draft of the question included “until Israel complies with International Law and Universal Principle[s] of Human Rights,” but this section was removed by the CSU Judicial Board prior to the referendum.
According to Rami Yahia, a member of SPHR Concordia, the availability of funding from the CSU for Concordia’s BDS Week is a direct result of last year’s ‘yes’ vote.
“We had a referendum vote where all the students could participate, whereas at McGill, [the GA included just] whatever students decided to show up to that [GA], on that particular time on that particular day, [when there] was a snowstorm.”
The week also coincided with the one year anniversary of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Fall General Assembly (GA), where students voted to indefinitely postpone a motion calling on SSMU to stand in solidarity with the people of the occupied Palestinian territories. The motion was brought up in response to Operation Protective Edge, launched by the Israeli military in Summer 2014.
Later in March, another motion proposed by SPHR concerning divestment from companies profiting from the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories was defeated. Some students opposed the motion on the grounds that it was allegedly affiliated with the BDS movement.
Abdulla Daoud, another member of SPHR Concordia, explained that the SSMU motion was not concerned with standing in solidarity with the BDS movement, but rather with specifically divesting from companies.
“We know [SPHR McGill], we work closely with them. They’re very strong and passionate people. We believe that there is really no difference as far as what happened at McGill and what happened at Concordia – only as far as how the structure is,” Daoud told The Daily.
“We had a referendum vote where all the students could participate, whereas at McGill, [the GA included just] whatever students decided to show up to that [GA], on that particular time on that particular day, [when there] was a snowstorm.”
Michael McCauley, a member of SPHR McGill, said, “We had, I think, more difficulty with motivating people to come out and walk through the snow to get there. Whereas, there was more motivation from the people who were mobilizing against us, despite the fact that I really do think that there is a lot more sympathy toward [the] Palestinian cause than was reflected at that particular GA.”
In an email to The Daily, Hillel McGill president Rayna Lew argued that the BDS movement is reductive.
“BDS simply does not create an academic space for discussion on the conflict, peace, or resolution. […] The movement polarizes the issue and does not invite nuanced discussion from either side,” Lew said.
Jordan Devon, a U2 Political Science student, agreed with Lew, stating that BDS supporters fail to understand the complexities of Israeli society. Although Devon is co-president of Israel on Campus (IOC), his statement was not made on behalf of the organization. “For this fundamental reason, the BDS movement is failing to achieve its goal, particularly to inflict enough pressure on Israeli society so that its government will abolish certain policies pertaining to the Palestinians,” said Devon.
Devon expressed that it is possible to be critical of the BDS movement and the Israeli state at the same time. “Being pro-Israel or Zionist is not a monolithic identity; it is not confined to supporting the current Israeli government or the settlement program; it is not manifested through blindly defending every action undertaken by Israel,” he said.
But according to Daoud, “[BDS is] the most non-violent and peaceful way a person in North America can aid in resisting the occupation that occurs right now in the West Bank and Gaza. It’s very diplomatic, very concise, very strong, and very easy to do.”
McCauley explained that the BDS movement adopts a human rights – based approach. “There is generally a pretty broad consensus [that] BDS in Palestine […] doesn’t exist for support for political parties or support for a one- versus two-state solution.”
“So, as I see it, despite any sort of criticism that you may have of the ultimate goals of BDS, […] it’s something that you nevertheless have a responsibility to support because it’s a direct call that was made by the Palestinians themselves,” McCauley stated.

2016-02-04,McGill,Palestine,"Campaigners to bring BDS motion to upcoming SSMU General Assembly
Updated on February 5.
On February 4, a group of McGill students and student organizations, called McGill BDS Action Network, brought the global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to campus by launching a BDS campaign at McGill.
In an interview with The Daily, Laura Khoury, one of the organizers of the campaign, explained that the campaign “particularly calls on university campuses to divest from companies that profit off of the occupation of Palestine.”
“That includes any business activites that allow these companies to profit off of anything that the State of Israel uses to continue to expand its occupation and its settlements on occupied territories, which is against international law,” Khoury said.
For its first action, the campaign held a demonstration at the Y-intersection on February 4, handing out flyers to passers-by with information regarding the campaign. In addition, the demonstrators held a sign stating, “Stand against oppression, stand for justice in Palestine.”
The demonstration was also accompanied by the launch of a website, detailing the goals of the campaign.
Currently, McGill has investments in four companies which, the campaign organizers claim, directly profit from the occupation. These companies are the British private security systems corporation G4S, surveillance and reconnaissance systems provider L-3 Communications, Israel’s fourth largest commercial bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, and the real estate company RE/MAX.
“That includes any businesses that allow these companies to profit off of anything that the State of Israel uses to continue to expand its occupation and its settlements on occupied territories, which is against international law.”
According to Khoury, the campaign is also attempting to bring these investments to the attention of the McGill Board of Governors’ Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR), which could consider recommending divestment if the McGill community proves that the companies’ business activities constitute “social injury.”
Members of the campus environmental justice group Divest McGill have been attempting to appeal to CAMSR in a similar fashion since 2013, asking that McGill divest its holdings in tar sands and fossil fuel companies.
At this point, the BDS campaign is officially endorsed by many groups, including the McGill Syrian Students’ Association, McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights, Cinema Politica McGill, Midnight Kitchen, the Black Students’ Network of McGill, Divest McGill, the Union for Gender Empowerment, and McGill Students for Feminisms.
Apart from appealing to CAMSR, however, the campaigners are also planning on bringing up a BDS motion at the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter General Assembly (GA) on February 22. Two motions regarding Palestine were brought up at the two GAs in the previous academic year. The motion brought up at the Fall 2014 GA was tabled indefinitely, while the one brought up at the Winter 2015 GA was voted down.
Another organizer with the campaign differentiated the upcoming motion from last year’s motions regarding Palestine. The upcoming motion will explicitly call on SSMU to support BDS campaigns on campus, and to lobby the McGill Board of Governors to divest from corporations deemed complicit in the occupation of the Palestinian territories.
Zahra Habib, another organizer with the campaign, explained that while the motion is one of the campaign’s concerns, it is not the only concern. Habib explained that the main purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness regarding Palestine on campus.
“We created this campaign to […] raise awareness on campus about the motion, for students to both get a background and to mobilize, and to come to the SSMU GA and vote – regardless of whatever side they’re on,” Habib told The Daily.
Between now and the Winter GA, the campaign will be holding various events, including a talk on BDS and anti-Semitism by Rabbi Cantor Michael Davis on February 18, a screening of Palestinian short films by Cinema Politica on February 17, and a “Concert for Justice” on February 20.
Fuad Quaddoura, a U0 Science student and a Palestinian himself, expressed that he was glad to see students mobilizing around this issue.
“I was headed to my math class, and seeing this was an eye-opener. I was really happy, pleased. The fact that so many people – Palestinian, non-Palestinian, white, all races – are signing up for the cause is just really heartwarming,” Quaddoura told The Daily.

2016-02-22,McGill,Palestine,"McGill BDS event series sets the stage for SSMU General Assembly
Last week, the McGill BDS Action Network hosted an event series as part of its campaign leading up to the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA), which takes place today. The group’s motion at the GA asks SSMU to support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns and to recommend to McGill’s Board of Governors to divest from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
The event series, which ran from February 16 to February 20, included a panel discussion with Montreal-based activists, a talk by Rabbi Cantor Michael Davis called “The Moral Case for BDS,” and the screening of three Palestinian short films. The event series ended on Saturday with a concert and open mic event.
Laura Khoury, an organizer with McGill BDS, told The Daily that the event series was organized “to engage [students] in a discussion about the Palestinian cause and to further discuss the call from Palestinian civil society to carry out boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel until it complies with international law.”
The Montreal-based activists on the panel held on February 16 were Palestinian activist Zahia El-Masri and writer and community organizer Mostafa Henaway. The panelists spoke about the BDS movement as “a critical tool” for showing international solidarity, highlighting its importance to the Palestinian struggle.
El-Masri highlighted the significance of raising awareness, especially given the lack of mainstream knowledge about the Palestinian struggle. “What it means to be Palestinian today is to be negated the right of your identity, it’s to be negated the right of return, it’s to even be negated the right to have the collective imaginary of a Palestinianhood,” El-Masri said.
Henaway also argued that the BDS movement is imperative because “it’s coming from Palestinians themselves, and they’re demanding our solidarity in this way.”
Speaking about supporting BDS at McGill specifically, El-Masri said, “Every move that you make, every action, every time you spread the word about what’s going on, don’t underestimate it. It makes a difference.” Henaway pointed to student campaigns for McGill to divest from South African apartheid as an example, and explained that the call for BDS was initiated in Durban, South Africa at the 2001 World Conference against Racism.
“The South African delegation wanted to highlight Zionism as a form of apartheid, as a form [of] discrimination and racial inequality that the international community has to uphold as a priority in terms of Israel’s acceptance of international law,” Henaway said.
The call for BDS, he explained, was founded on “fundamental principles of universal justice – that Palestinians should have the same rights that Israeli citizens are able to have.”
“What it means to be Palestinian today is to be negated the right of your identity, it’s to be negated the right of return, it’s to even be negated the right to have the collective imaginary of a Palestinianhood.”
McGill did not divest from South African apartheid until 1985, and Henaway said that while “we look back now on history and lots of people think, ‘How could anybody support South African apartheid, one of the ugliest forms of a racist, colonial state.’ […] There was complete mainstream support for it. It was ‘a liberal democracy in a sea of barbarism in Africa,’ and it’s the same logic that many people who support Israeli apartheid use today.”
During the discussion period, a student in the audience asked the panelists to respond to an argument commonly made against BDS, which is that it negatively affects citizens of Israel.
Henaway responded, “It’s the status quo that actually hurts Israeli citizens at the moment. It’s the fact that they’re seen as supporting an occupation, it’s the fact that […] it’s mandatory for all Israelis to serve [in]the military, the fact that their state is imploding, all of this as a result of an ongoing colonial project impacts them negatively.”
“By supporting BDS, you’re only basically supporting international law,” El-Masri concluded.
Yusuf, a U1 Economics student who attended the panel discussion, told The Daily, “I found the panel very informative, and they gave me new insight into real situations […] that happen in Palestine on a daily basis. […] It was very easy [to] relate to the points they were making, especially in the context of North America.”

2016-03-21,McGill,Palestine,"Panelists emphasize solidarity between marginalized groups 
As part of the Montreal Israeli Apartheid Week event series, activists Kezia Curtis, a member of Black Lives Matter Detroit, and Brittany King, a member of the Dream Defenders, a social justice group, spoke at a panel discussion called “Black Perspectives on the Question of Palestine” held on March 17.
The panel was organized by the Black Students’ Network (BSN) and McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), and explored “transnational solidarity between the movements for justice for Black people in North America and movements for justice for Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Territories.”
“If [activists] are going to be successful in doing the work that we aim to do, then it is so important for us to engage in solidarity with other oppressed and marginalized groups.”
Curtis and King highlighted their experiences as activists working within the Black and Palestinian struggles, and emphasized the need to decolonize the mind in order for solidarity networks to thrive.
Ryan, one of the organizers of the event, told The Daily that he believes that “if [activists] are going to be successful in doing the work that we aim to do, then it is so important for us to engage in solidarity with other oppressed and marginalized groups.”
The panelists noted the historical parallels between the Palestinian and Black social justice movements, with both populations still facing state-sanctioned racism and violence.
Curtis spoke about her experiences as a Black woman travelling within Palestine. It was like “looking at Detroit in a different part of the world,” Curtis said with regards to her trip to Palestine. Curtis also spoke about how violence was experienced on a very real, day-to-day basis, particularly at the university she visited.
Curtis and King also spoke about other related issues faced by both Black people in the U.S. and Palestinians, such as gentrification, limited access to land and farming, and militarization of settler-colonial states.
Curtis further noted a crucial difference between the U.S. and Palestine which she witnessed on her trip – the outright and explicit violence, guns, weaponry, and tear gas constantly being used against Palestinians in Hebron, in contrast to the significantly less militarized nature of the violence in the U.S..
The panel also highlighted the importance of challenging anti-Black racism within solidarity movements.
“Part of […] solidarity includes critical self-reflection in order to avoid being complicit in the oppression of other groups, especially in the case of anti-Blackness.”
Ryan pointed out that “part of […] solidarity includes critical self-reflection in order to avoid being complicit in the oppression of other groups, especially in the case of anti-Blackness.”
King also stressed the need for self-reflection and critical thinking to challenge instances of global anti-Blackness. King argued that social media and mainstream media act as ways that uphold anti-Blackness. For example, King explained, the stigma that Black Muslims face in Muslim communities – a phenomenon perpetuated through social media – is evidence to this.
As a Black woman, she added, it is important for her to stand in solidarity with other oppressed people. “Anti-Blackness won’t stop unless we challenge ourselves,” King explained.
“Anti-Blackness won’t stop unless we challenge ourselves.”
In an interview with The Daily, a student who attended the panel noted, “I thought it was encouraging that [the panelists] were working on the ground in their own communities to educate people on anti-Blackness and how to decolonize a mindset that’s been so largely ingrained in society.”
King added that a critical understanding of how colonization affects all people should unite seemingly disparate justice movements. “For me, it’s just all about education,” she said. “If you see that my struggle and your struggle are the same […] that will make that solidarity more attainable.”
“If you see that my struggle and your struggle are the same […] that will make that solidarity more attainable.”
Michelle Blassou, a member of the BSN, told The Daily that the talk raised important parallels, and that “uniting around the idea that the colonial state will always be against both of us leaves a lot of work to do.”
A previous version of this article erroneously stated that Aja Monet also attended the panel. The Daily regrets the error.

2016-03-30,McGill,Palestine,"Politicide of Palestine discussed as part of Israeli Apartheid Week
As part of this year’s Montreal Israeli Apartheid Week, Nahla Abdo, a Palestinian professor of sociology at Carleton University, spoke about the need for anti-colonial, anti-imperialist feminism at a talk titled “Imperialist Feminism and Arab Women’s Struggle: The Palestinian Case,” held on March 23 at Concordia University.
Abdo’s talk focused on the Western feminist rhetoric on Palestinian women’s struggle and the push-back to this discourse by Palestinian women. Abdo also discussed the importance of using oral history as a research method to highlight the struggle of Palestinian women who are political prisoners.
Abdo introduced the concept of “politicide” as important to understanding Palestinian women’s anti-colonial struggle. She explained that politicide is a form of genocide committed against Palestinians by the state of Israel through the erasing of Palestine as a political entity and through erasing Palestinian geography – for example, Israel’s renaming of many Palestinian towns and villages with Hebrew names.
“At the heart of the [struggle against] settler colonialism is the loss of land and struggle to regain the land,” Abdo said.
She linked the politicide of Palestine with the lack of criticism of Israel in the Western world. “Such politics have gone hand in hand with an Amero-European politics of a deafening silence toward Israel’s policies,” Abdo said. “We all have, as academics, in one way or another felt the pressure on our freedom of expression when it comes to [when we] critically think and publicly speak about the Israeli state.”
“At the heart of the [struggle against] settler colonialism is the loss of land and struggle to regain the land.”
Abdo also mentioned that a result of such a a lack of an anti-colonial analysis in discussing settler-colonial states like Israel and Canada leads to the conflation of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.
“You criticize Canada left and right, but you are not to touch Israel,” she said, referring to some activists’ propensity to speak out against Canada’s policies, but their silence on Israel’s occupation of Palestine.
More specific to the topic of women’s anti-colonial struggle, Abdo spoke about “orientalist feminism,” which she defined as the essentialization of Arab and Muslim women. Orientalist feminism, said Abdo, imagines Arab and Muslim women to be under patriarchal and cultural oppression. In addition to problematizing this type of feminism, Abdo also spoke about imperialist feminism. While orientalist feminism focuses on culture, Abdo argued, imperialist feminism is a result of a political ideology.
“Imperialist feminism is a 21st-century feminism developed in response to the so-called War on Terror. [It is] the linking of resistance to colonialism [to] acts of terror; everyone who resists colonialism becomes a terrorist,” Abdo said. “[Imperialist feminism] uses women’s bodies and sexuality for ideology, for racializing and dehumanizing Palestinian freedom fighters.”
Abdo concluded her talk by saying, “While the state can erase the physical marker [of Palestinian land], they can’t erase [the Palestinian] vision and memory. Memory of the land, the home, the olive and the cypress trees, of the hills and mountains from the collective conscience of Palestinians.”
“I sometimes find that Western interpretations of people’s experience can be a colonial one, whether intended or not.”
Amal, a Concordia student present at the talk, told The Daily in an email that she disagreed with Abdo’s point that one doesn’t have to have lived an experience or be from a community to write about it.
“Very often the voices of those concerned are drowned out by Western academics because they have more opportunities to publish and discuss their work,” said Amal. “Basically, there are enough academics and writers who can give a more complete representation and analysis of an experience, and I sometimes find that Western interpretations of people’s experience can be a colonial one, whether intended or not,” she continued.

2016-05-19,McGill,Palestine,"Police harass students on McGill campus, two McGill students arrested 
On Sunday May 1, hundreds took to the streets for an anti-capitalist protest in honour of International Workers’ Day. Less than an hour into the demonstration, police officers used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowd, after a confrontation on Ste. Catherine Street escalated rapidly. Multiple arrests were made in the hours that followed, as police pursued small groups of protestors throughout the downtown area.
Anti-capitalist protesters gathered at several prearranged meeting points earlier that afternoon, forming smaller groups which coalesced into one large demonstration at the corner of University and de Maisonneuve at around 3:15 pm.
There was a heavy police presence, with dozens of vehicles gathered on nearby streets, a helicopter monitoring the area, and several officers on horseback following the demonstration closely. As protesters made their way through downtown Montreal, rows of officers in riot gear arrived to follow the procession from the sidelines, standing in front of businesses and government buildings.

The anti-capitalist demonstration was organized by the Montreal chapter of Convergence des luttes anticapitalistes (CLAC-Montreal), and attracted a diverse collection of protesters, which included a small but enthusiastic McGill contingent. In addition to the usual anti-capitalist and anti-police chants, shouts of “Free Palestine!” and “Free Kurdistan!” could be heard from the crowd.
“The only way to completely address climate change is to not only limit greenhouse gas emissions but to also tackle the social problems that make marginalized people most vulnerable to the changing climate.”
Environmental activists were also in attendance. The Daily spoke with McGill student Jed Lenetsky, a U1 Environmental Sciences student, about the intersection between anti-capitalist activism and the climate justice movement:
“The shift towards a clean energy economy must include a just transition for workers.”
“Climate justice is firmly based in intersectionality,” said Lenetsky. “The only way to completely address climate change is to not only limit greenhouse gas emissions but to also tackle the social problems that make marginalized people most vulnerable to the changing climate. Fighting for labor rights fits squarely within this mandate.”
Speaking to The Daily, Kristen Perry, a graduating McGill Environmental Sciences student, stressed that “the shift towards a clean energy economy must include a just transition for workers.”
“This means organizing for a living wage and fair working conditions,” Perry said.
The protesters marched through the streets of downtown Montreal for nearly a half hour without incident. Small amounts of tear gas were fired on at least two occasions, for reasons that remain unclear, and a number of construction pylons were knocked into the street.The overall situation remained peaceful until the crowd arrived at a police station on Ste Catherine Street.
A confrontation ensued which ended with copious amounts of tear gas fired at protesters. Police also used stun grenades to scatter the crowd.

Some protesters hurled firecrackers and coloured smoke bombs back at the officers, and a window in an adjacent building was shattered. According to CBCNews, police claim protesters began the confrontation, throwing fireworks and tear gas upon arriving at the police station. However, two activists who wished to remain anonymous told The Daily that they witnessed the incident, claiming a tear gas canister caused the damage.
“[The police] shot some tear gas, and it broke a window,” said one of the activists, speaking to The Daily in French. “But it will probably be said that it was protesters that broke the window.”
The activists also told The Daily that they had been attending a feminist conference and had decided to join the demonstration because “when you’re feminist, you’re struggling for more equality, for rights, for recognition, and when you’re anti-capitalist it’s similar. […] It’s essential not to separate the [feminist and anti-capitalist] movements.”

Following the confrontation on Ste. Catherine, small groups of protesters ran down adjoining side streets, pursued by police officers. For the rest of the afternoon, dispersed groups all over downtown Montreal tried to reunite while avoiding the police. Several were detained during this period, with the total number of arrests reported to be at least ten by various news sources, including CBCNews and The Toronto Star.
“[The police] shot some tear gas, and it broke a window. But it will probably be said that it was protesters that broke the window.”
Among those arrested were two McGill students, who preferred to remain anonymous. In an interview with The Daily, the two students said they had been walking peacefully along a downtown sidewalk when a large number of police officers arrived to disperse their group. They were pushed down an alley along with some other protesters and were eventually trapped by the police.
They were then arrested, allegedly for “participating in an illegal demonstration,” despite the fact that they had not been protesting when the police appeared. The officers did not cite any specific piece of legislation, but they still handcuffed and frisked the students, and searched through their coats and bags. Eventually, the students were released without charges. One student told The Daily that she found bruises the next day where the police had held her, and that other students with her were treated more roughly.
Meanwhile, The Daily’s reporter followed another group to Dorchester Square, where a large number of officers scattered protesters with substantial amounts of tear gas. Julie, a McGill student present at the scene, expressed outrage at what she saw as the police’s heavy-handed behaviour:
“I’m feeling frustrated that people who were trying to recover after being chased were then attacked, not only with tear gas, but then [also by] ten or twenty policemen on bikes shouting […] and chasing them […] in the middle of a park!”
She emphasized that police filled the park with tear gas without making sure that bystanders would be affected. These concerns echoed last year’s May Day demonstration, during which passers-by, including children, were teargassed as the police attempted to disperse protesters.
“[The officer] hit her in the leg and then pummelled her, and they then proceeded to hound us.”
Sean, another McGill student, told The Daily what happened when he and a few others were chased onto campus near the Otto Maass Chemistry Building by police:
“Some of the police followed the group going up University, and other officers stopped and started harassing us, and attacked one student – I think she was a student – with a bike. [The officer] hit her in the leg and then pummeled her, and they then proceeded to hound us,” he said.
“Meanwhile, I confronted [a] McGill Security [officer] about this, telling him ‘the police are attacking students on campus, it’s your responsibility to make sure this kind of thing isn’t happening’, and he said ‘the police are our partners.’”
“He said ‘the police are our partners.’”
At around 6:00 pm, roughly a hundred demonstrators gathered at Philips Square, and marched east to Place des Festivals. There, the group dispersed when police arrived, and about a half an hour later, CLAC-Montreal announced via Twitter that the demonstration was officially over.

2016-05-27,McGill,Palestine,"Demonstrators express support for BDS movement 
On Saturday May 14, the Montreal-based human rights group Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU) organized a midnight demonstration to mark the 68th anniversary of the ‘Nakba’, which translates to “the catastrophe” in Arabic. The demonstration aimed to commemorate the expulsion and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland following the 1948 Palestine War and Israel’s subsequent Declaration of Independence.
According to PAJU’s Facebook event page for the demonstration, “Palestine has been subjected to a systemic ethnic cleansing operation at the hands of the Zionist movement for the past 68 years. In a blink of an eye, Palestine was wiped off the map.”
“The Zionist movement has announced the creation of the Israeli state on Palestinian territory through the destruction and expropriation of over 500 villages and towns and the expulsion of over 750,000 Palestinians to refugee camps all over the world,” the page continued.
“Israel’s military supremacy is the spearhead of its occupation of Palestine.”
Hala Yassin, a member of PAJU, addressed the crowd in French prior to the march, condemning the federal government’s turning a blind eye to Israeli military actions against Palestinians.
“Israel’s military supremacy is the spearhead of its occupation of Palestine,” said Yassin. “It allows Israel to act with impunity. The Israeli army is proud to collaborate with arms manufacturers that brag to clients about testing its products in the field [the Gaza Strip].”
“Can you believe that? Products tested on humans, on Palestinians!” she repeated.
Around 150 people gathered outside the Mont-Royal metro station for the demonstration. Notwithstanding a heavy police presence, the demonstrators chanted “Israel terroriste, Trudeau complice!” in French, (“Terrorist Israel, Trudeau an accomplice!” in English) as they marched from Rue Saint-Denis to Rue Sainte-Catherine and looped back through Boulevard Saint-Laurent.
“Can you believe that? Products tested on humans, on Palestinians!”
“We have to remember that this movement of Zionism, the State of Israel, was not created by the Jewish people that followed the traditions of their forefathers,” said Neturei Karta rabbi David Feldman to the crowd before the march. “These were people who attempted to transform Judaism from a religion into a nationalism.”
“As Jewish people who do practice our religion, we say that that the state of Israel does not represent world Jewry,” Feldman continued. “These people do not speak in the name of our people, they’re not supported by all Jewish people, and certainly the crimes that they are committing are not condoned by Jewish religion.”
The police initially blocked the march at the intersection of Rue Sherbrooke and Rue Saint-Denis, instructing the demonstrators follow their route west of Rue Sherbrooke. After a brief confrontation, the police succumbed and demonstrators continued marching down Saint-Denis, shouting “A nous la rue!”
“As Jewish people who do practice our religion, we say that that the state of Israel does not represent world Jewry.”
The demonstrators stopped in the middle of the intersection at St. Laurent and Mont Royal, blocking off the street to hear a spokesperson for Women of Diverse Origins, Dolores Chew, speak about the importance of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement.
“BDS is what we need to struggle for,” said Chew. “For our communities and all organizations and all our institutions in our church groups, in our political parties – we must push for BDS to be adopted.”
“Israel is really afraid; this is the only thing that is going to make a difference,” Chew continued. “Women of Diverse Origins stands in support of Palestinian women, and their families ask us to take a stand and struggle and not to give up.”
“Israel is really afraid; this is the only thing that is going to make a difference.”
Montreal municipal bylaw P6 (section 2.1), requires march organizers to disclose their route prior to their event. However, Anna, a demonstration organizer, told The Daily in a Facebook message that P6 is “political repression, plain and simple.”
“They want to scare, discourage, and punish people for protesting, so [we] refuse to acknowledge and give power to such a law,” Anna said.
She went on to discuss the connection between refusing to abide by such laws and protesting the Israeli occupation. “All of our adversity is connected to the same systems of oppression and repressive audacity of authority,” she explained.
“They want to scare, discourage, and punish people for protesting, so [we] refuse to acknowledge and give power to such a law.”
Members of the Young Communist League of Canada were also present at the demonstration. Speaking to The Daily, Adrien Welsh, a representative of the League, asserted “To us it is important to denounce [the occupation], first to show our solidarity with the Palestinian people, but also to show that we are active, that we are able to do things although we are geographically far away.”
“It is important to support the resistance through such actions like this demonstration and BDS, and to demand for at least the creation of a Palestinian state, at least within the borders of ’67,” Welsh added.

2016-10-03,McGill,Palestine,"IJV will be first anti-Zionist Jewish group on campus since 2009
A McGill chapter of Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV) is launching this year, founded by two students, Anna and Sonja. IJV describes itself on its website as a “national human rights organization whose mandate is to promote a just resolution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine through the application of international law and respect for the human rights of all parties.”
In an email to The Daily, Anna explained that IJV McGill’s main goals are to “motivate critical Jewish students to gain awareness of the Israeli occupation and to bring this awareness to the broader campus community.” The group also aims to work with and support the McGill Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) and McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) movements through political campaigns and education.
The organization will further these goals through “speaker events, film screenings, and popular education on differences between Judaism and political Zionism,” Anna added.
McGill BDS expressed their support for IJV in an email to The Daily, saying that IJV’s message is “especially important in terms of increasing the visibility of anti-Zionist Jewish voices and alternative perspectives in the debate surrounding BDS.”
However, the pro-Palestine movement on campus may be hampered by the recent Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) justice board ruling concerning BDS.
In June, the justice board ruled that the BDS motion brought before SSMU’s Winter 2016 general assembly was unconstitutional, as it would require SSMU to adopt a platform against a specific country. This would allegedly violate SSMU’s equity policy.
When asked about the impact this ruling might have on IJV McGill, Anna cited the fact that the decision has not been ratified by SSMU, which makes it non-binding. She added the group will play a unique role at McGill as the first “anti-Zionist Jewish group” on campus since 2009. It will provide space for Jewish students to encounter a set of perspectives which are often marginalized in Jewish communities.
Anna explained that she believes IJV is important at McGill because “it remains a taboo for Jewish students to engage openly in pro-Palestinian solidarity work, [and] IJV seeks to challenge this. […] Many [non/anti-Zionist Jews in North America] find themselves unable to be open about their views with parents, communities or even their best friends.”
Anna hopes to “demystify,” in her words, the conflation between Jewishness and support for Israel. “IJV McGill will strive to celebrate diasporic Judaism and Jewish culture separately from Zionism.”
“It remains a taboo for Jewish students to engage openly in pro-Palestinian solidarity work, [and] IJV seeks to challenge this. […] Many [non/anti-Zionist Jews in North America] find themselves unable to be open about their views with parents, communities or even their best friends.”
This message is fully supported by the McGill-based Jewish political discussion podcast TREYF.
TREYF’s hosts, Sam Bick and David Zinman, advocate for the celebration of the rich Jewish culture that exists beyond Israel. They believe that many young Jewish people in North America are searching for a voice as they articulate their views on Zionism, and that McGill’s IJV chapter will provide them with a crucial space to discuss anti-colonial ideas.
A spokesperson for the Jewish student centre Chabad for McGill said that they were “glad that McGill affords students the opportunity to form clubs and have a voice,” especially if that view reflects the pluralism of a free society. The spokesperson declined to comment directly on IJV, since they were unfamiliar with the organization, but stated that Chabad had no issue with any student club, “as long as it respectfully follows [McGill’s] rules for clubs.”
A spokesperson for Israel on Campus echoed Chabad’s views on student diversity but voiced concerns over another club pushing for BDS. Israel on Campus feels BDS has “ostracized and led to the harassment of Jewish, Israeli, and pro-Israel students.”
“IJV McGill will strive to celebrate diasporic Judaism and Jewish culture separately from Zionism.”
Scott Weinstein, a member of IJV’s Montreal chapter, told The Daily in an email that “we are excited about working with the IJV chapter at McGill, which will serve an important role in educating McGill students about the realities on the ground in Israel-Palestine.”
“Jewish groups on campus have typically offered blind support for Israel’s behaviour,” he continued. “It will be refreshing to have a Jewish group on campus that promotes an honest and ethical discussion about what’s occurring in Israel-Palestine.”

2016-10-18,McGill,Palestine,"Fortier discusses divestment, student activism, mental health, and more
On October 4, Principal Suzanne Fortier and Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens sat down with members of the campus media to answer their questions.
The McGill Tribune (MT): You’ve just received a Gold rating for sustainability, according to the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS). In light of this, is divestment from fossil fuels something that the administration or the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) will be considering?
Suzanne Fortier (SF): Certainly sustainability is an area [to which] we are paying a lot of attention. We have an office of sustainability, the Board of Governors now has as part of its mandate a stewardship of our sustainability initiatives on campus, and we’re going to focus both on how we ourselves reduce our footprint in our own campuses, on the research side we’re made major investments, and also on […] teaching and learning. We’ve made an investment of ten millions to act as a seed fund for the very large initiative of sustainability.
The McGill Daily (MD): Over the past couple months, we’ve seen Indigenous people from the Standing Rock Sioux community protest the Dakota Access Pipeline project, which threatens their fresh water supply. $27 million from McGill’s endowment is invested in companies which are profiting from this pipeline. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities near Canada’s tar sands report unusually high levels of cancers and autoimmune diseases. If this doesn’t constitute “grave social harm” on the part of fossil fuel companies, what does?
SF: The question of […] social harm is not a simple one in the case of fossil fuels. There are very negative impacts of fossil fuels and some that have been positive. […] I was reading recently that some members of the First Nations are very much opposed to the pipelines, some are in favour. […] It’s a topic on which there’s a lot of difference of opinion, even within First Nations communities, so I would feel out of place in speaking on behalf of McGill.
“There are very negative impacts of fossil fuels and some that have been positive.”
Le Délit (LD): On the topic of divestment and student activism, are you concerned that there might be a growing divide between the administration and a certain part of the student body, particularly student activists?
SF: In a democratic community, there are differences of opinion, always, and what is important for us as an institution is making sure different opinions are expressed freely, without fear, […] and that as a community we can move forward in […] constructive ways. […] I think that both the administration and our governance bodies have […] listened to all these topics with great seriousness and respect. They agree as to where we need to be, not necessarily on the path and the specific actions to take. But […] some of the actions we’re taking now are a direct result of […] the advocacy around topics like sustainability.
“I think that both the administration and our governance bodies have […] listened to all these topics with great seriousness and respect.”
The Bull & Bear (BB): What do you think the role of the Principal’s office is on the question of student activism?
SF: When it comes to […] political topics, my role there is to keep on our campus an environment where different views can be expressed. Freedom of speech is a value that we protect. Respect of diversity, respect of different people’s opinion, that people feel safe–that’s part of my role. But it is not my role to express my political view on behalf of the community, because those views are diverse, and I must respect that.
BB: In that case, what justification could you give for the email sent by your office last spring disavowing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement?
SF: BDS is a good example. There were people […] who put pressure on me to come out with a view, and I did not, initially, because I respected the government of the student body. […] There is a part of [BDS] that is very closely linked to our mission, and the mission of a university [is] to stand up and make sure […] we don’t cut our ties with any academic institution or scholars no matter where they live, and what political situation they’re in. […] I was very careful […] to make clear that [the email] was not representing the views of the whole university.
“But it is not my role to express my political view on behalf of the community, because those views are diverse, and I must respect that.”
MD: Many of the people behind the BDS motion have origins in Palestine, so these are people who are personally affected by the illegal occupation of that region, which they would say McGill is tacitly supporting by investing in companies that profit from it. In light of this, how would you respond to students who perhaps feel that the email used the language of freedom of speech to actually silence the views of marginalized students?
SF: I would not share that opinion. I think we were very clear about a statement that was close to our mission as a university. As I said, the larger question, which is, I think, part of the BDS vote, is a very complex, […] highly political issue, and I would not […] make a statement about that situation. […] I’m not an expert at all in Middle East politics, […] but where I feel I can speak is when it is closely related to our academic mission. […] All the universities in Canada had a joint statement regarding the situation in Turkey this summer when […] many academics were fired and so on. […] But you will not see Universities Canada […] expressing opinions regarding political situations in the world.
MD: How would you respond to the allegation that it was a political gesture to choose to respond to the BDS motion, as opposed to other SSMU motions?
SF: [The motion] was problematic for SSMU itself and I think afterwards they did revisit the wisdom of putting [forward] this motion. So it is not a motion that was, as most motions are, very closely related to life on campus, to issues of our university. It was in the political sphere.
MT: Supposedly we’re seeing a streamlining of the mental health services this year, but what will be done about long wait times and lack of space for students seeking help?
Ollivier Dyens (OD): We’re working on a mental health and wellness [initiative] that should come to Senate in the fall. […] Not every student that comes to Mental Health or Counselling or Health Services needs to see a psychiatrist right away, so it will be a process where students will […] get services very quickly. […] And for those who have more fundamental issues, then we’ll free up time from our psychiatrists to actually deal with these things. […] This step-care approach has worked in other universities.
“So it is not a motion that was, as most motions are, very closely related to life on campus, to issues of our university. It was in the political sphere.”
LD (in French): What is the current state of French language and culture at McGill, and what could be done to promote French at McGill–particularly to ensure that international students learn French when they come here?
SF (in French): I believe currently more than 65% of students on our campus can express themselves in French. […] We have many courses in French, and we’ll open as many classes as are necessary so that all students can learn French if they wish. We promote French a lot, for example through the site ‘Decouvrir le French side de McGill.’ […] We also promote cultural events in Montreal […] and throughout Quebec. […] So we’re doing a lot. […] There’s been an enormous improvement in the state of French language and culture in the past few years, and we’ll continue in this vein, because McGill is an increasingly global university that remains anchored in Quebec culture.
OD (in French): We would love for all McGill students to speak French and English perfectly when they graduate. […] We would like for students to have the choice of whether or not to stay [and find work] in Quebec, and it’s not always the case.
BB: You’ve mentioned that one of your priorities is to ensure that McGill’s brand image is very strong in Quebec. What has been done in this regard, and what are the next steps?
SF: We do a lot of work in external relations with the Montreal community, we put a lot of emphasis on the francophone leaders in the community. […] We try as much as possible to bring people from the community to our campus, so that they can see McGill, because […] unfortunately there are still people who think of McGill as […] an anglophone fortress until they come to campus. They still have this very old image, which is not at all what McGill is today. […] We know that we have to constantly do more to be present visibly in the community.
“There’s been an enormous improvement in the state of French language and culture in the past few years […]”
MD: What is being done concretely at the upper administrative level to improve hiring equity at McGill?
SF: Pools of possible candidates, particularly for certain types of positions, like professors, are extremely small. […] If you look at Aboriginal, visible minorities, people with physical disabilities, [universities] tend to actually compete against one another. But on women, […] I believe its 45 per cent of new assistant professors are female, so we are close to parity. […] We also have equity training with our hiring processes, so that is happening as well.
MD: In the spring, a prospective donor decided not to donate to McGill due to our ongoing failure to divest from fossil fuels, and research has shown that the University has effectively lost tens of millions of dollars over the past three years by not divesting. In light of this, how is not divesting a financially viable option for us in the long term?
“Unfortunately there are still people who think of McGill as […] an anglophone fortress until they come to campus.”
SF: I’m not sure I’m going to answer that question. […] We don’t accept gifts on the basis of political views. When our donors make gifts to our universities, the discussion is about […] what are their goals in contributing. […] We’ve refused gifts, because either it wasn’t in line with our values or […] we knew that we would not be able to deliver. […] We’ve lived through a very tumultuous market. […] We are not active managers of the endowment. We […] work with managers from outside the university. […] Our endowment has been fairly healthy overall. […] We’ve done a good job for us.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. A shorter version was published in The McGill Daily’s print edition on Monday, October 17.

2016-11-14,McGill,Palestine,"Wide variety of views and ideologies expressed at Anonymous protest
On the evening of Saturday, November 5, roughly two hundred people gathered in Victoria Square for Montreal’s Million Mask March. Ostensibly organized by the decentralized global hacktivist group Anonymous, the annual march has taken place in cities around the world since 2013.
Its date coincides with Guy Fawkes Day, and protesters typically wear the stylized Guy Fawkes mask, which has become an emblem of Anonymous since the 2006 film V for Vendetta associated the mask with political protest in the public consciousness.
Gathered around a statue of Queen Victoria, the base of which had been covered in banners and placards for the occasion, those attending the protest chatted and chanted the occasional slogan. Half a dozen police officers watched from across a street, but did not intervene.
A wide array of political ideologies and causes were represented, with placards denouncing rape culture, the Dakota Access Pipeline, state surveillance, colonialism in Palestine, censorship, and capitalism, to name a few.
Many of the protestors who spoke to The Daily did not express affiliation with any specific political ideology, but rather expressed generalized frustration with aspects of society which they perceived as unjust or corrupt. Most protesters seemed to fall on the left of the political spectrum, though with varying degrees of radicalism and detailed analysis.
One demonstrator, however, declared support for the right-wing nationalist regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and expressed profoundly anti-Semitic views in a brief interview with The Daily.
A wide array of political ideologies and causes were represented, with placards denouncing rape culture, the Dakota Access Pipeline, state surveillance, colonialism in Palestine, censorship, and capitalism, to name a few.
This disparity of beliefs and political orientations is seemingly a function of Anonymous’s decentralized structure – the hacktivist collective has no hierarchy of leadership and no well-defined ideology, beyond a broad opposition to censorship.
Individuals identifying with the group have launched cyberattacks against a slew of targets, from the governments of the United States and Israel, to Daesh (also known as ISIS), to video game companies, to financial corporations like Visa and MasterCard, to Quebec nationalism, to the Westboro Baptist Church.
Speaking to The Daily, a protester who identified himself only as Francis addressed the drawbacks of such a broad and decentralized movement.
“Some groups, probably on the right, could try and get a piece of the cake,” he admitted in French. “Obviously everyone knows who those people are, everyone knows they’re not legitimate, and they’re not the real ones – if I can say that. The real ones are always for rights, […] but it’s true that there are right-wing groups that often do really serious things under the mask of Anonymous. And obviously people who are in the know understand that it’s not us, the comrades, who do that.”
When asked what issues Anonymous addresses that are the most important to him personally, Francis, replied “human rights, […] the media that lies to us, […] the police services of many cities – especially Montreal – but especially poverty, in my opinion.”
What could Anonymous do to effect change on these issues, as opposed to legal action through mainstream political channels? According to Francis, the value of their work lies largely in raising awareness among the general population.
“The real ones are always for rights, […] but it’s true that there are right-wing groups that often do really serious things under the mask of Anonymous. And obviously people who are in the know understand that it’s not us, the comrades, who do that.”
“Raising awareness, and if ever there’s no visibility, doing concrete actions […] but it’s mostly informing people,” he said. “For example, if there was an organisation known for causing poverty, […] Anonymous might attack their servers, and crash their site, which […] would make people aware of the subject.”
The message of the Million Mask March, he said, was to tell the world “we’re here, we’ll always be here, and we don’t forget.”
The crowd gathered in Square Victoria, in addition to its diversity of political opinions and causes, comprised a variety of ages, ethnicities, and genders.
Speaking to The Daily, Flavie and Charlotte said they were frustrated by the prevailing climate of conservatism at their private high school, and had decided to attend the march out of a strong sense that Canadian society is profoundly flawed, and that “it’s not by doing nothing that these things will change.”
After some brief speeches, the protesters watched a video tribute to the late Jean Leger, a local anti-pipeline activist who recently committed suicide. Following this, they took to the streets, chanting various slogans from the classic – “Whose streets? Our streets!” – to the eclectic – “Killuminati!” and “Fuck the New World Order!”
The protest wound through the streets of the financial district, the lower Plateau, and Old Port, stopping at sites deemed emblematic of state violence and corruption: the Palais de Justice, the United States consulate, and the headquarters of the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
“Whose streets? Our streets!” – to the eclectic – “Killuminati!” and “Fuck the New World Order!”
Police officers on bicycles remained just ahead of the crowd, with several police vehicles following it, but no substantive confrontation occurred between protesters and law enforcement. The event ended peacefully outside the Palais de Justice, with organizers urging people to meet on November 5, 2017, for the next Million Mask March.

2016-11-14,McGill,Palestine,"Protesters take issue with resemblance of art installation to Apartheid Wall
On Wednesday, November 9, an Artists 4 Israel event on Lower Field of campus organized by Chabad McGill attracted protesters who denounced what they perceived to be the event’s insensitive concept and erasure of Palestinian voices.
In an event which has subsequently been removed from Facebook, members of the organization Artists 4 Israel erected a temporary wall on Lower Field, decorated it with Canadian and Israeli flags, and the word ‘peace’ in Hebrew and English, and invited passers-by to add their own graffiti to the installation.
They also displayed banners listing statements about Israel, and distributed free refreshments and t-shirts. Initially, Palestinian people, along with any Palestinian flags or symbols, were entirely absent from the event.
Soon however, the installation began to attract opposition. A small crowd of protesters gathered on Lower Field, carrying banners and placards which denounced Israel’s ongoing violence against Palestinian people, and appropriation of Palestinian land. The demonstrators spread out in a line, standing in front of the Artists 4 Israel installation.
Speaking to The Daily at the protest, George Ghabrial, a member of McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR), explained what prompted him and other students to protest the event.
“Me and a couple friends were [at] the Y [intersection], we were all going to class, and we saw this structure […] and then we saw an Israeli flag. […] We went up to some of these student organizers, asked them what was going on, they said it was an event called ‘Artists 4 Israel,’” he explained.
“So SPHR […] said that we should do something – there’s no representation of Palestine, there’s no mention of Palestine, there’s no […] mention of the occupation,” he continued. “It’s an implicitly political event that does not make explicit the occupation of Palestine. […] So we went and got our banners […] and came down to Lower Field.”
“On the surface, it’s supposed to be apolitical,” Ghabrial explained. “I don’t know very much about Chabad as an organization, but I’d say that the event is very normalizing about the occupation. […] And there’s a very strong connotation about who the antagonizers to peace are.”
A member of Artists 4 Israel spoke with The Daily about the intended purpose of the event.
“Artists 4 Israel was brought here by Chabad, Stand With Us, Size Doesn’t Matter and AEπ and […] Hasbara Fellowships, in order to paint a mural about peace and coexistence, and try to bridge all the […] diverse cultures that are here together, and of course express their pride in their own Jewish heritage and sense of Israel with that larger culture of the campus.”
When asked about the response to the protest, he said: “Instead of their protest […] they’ve all been offered the opportunity to spray-paint with us and to have shirts made, the same way the entire student body has been allowed. That they chose to separate themselves and segregate themselves from an event that’s supposed to be about inclusiveness […] I think speaks for itself as to what their true intentions are. We would have loved them to be part of it.”
In a comment sent to The Daily by email, however, Julie, a member of Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions (BDS) McGill said that she had been present at the protest for more than an hour, and had never been invited to write on the installation.
The protesters partly took issue with the statements about Israel on display beside the art installation, which portrayed the nation as a place of tolerance and equality. One section, in particular, alleged that non-Jewish Israelis “enjoy equal rights and freedoms.” In fact, Israel has drawn criticism from minority voices internally, and from the international community for the systemic discrimination that many non-Jewish citizens face.
However, event organizer, Eva Chorna, objected to this characterization, saying, “To have that [statement] on the board I think is very representative of the essence that is Israel, because if there is one country that understands what it’s like to be a refugee, I think it’s Israel.”
“Israel isn’t a perfect society,” she continued, “as no society is, but there are so many instances where they try to be inclusive towards the Palestinians, towards the Israeli Arabs in society, towards all the different religions.”
However, protesters also took issue with the concept of the installation.
“The board itself resembles the Apartheid Wall that runs in the West Bank and restricts access to medical resources and water supplies of Palestinians that live there,” said Julie in her email to The Daily. “The idea of graffiti-ing the ‘canvas’ mocks and appropriates the forms of Palestinian resistance that appear on the Apartheid Wall.”
“Furthermore, the ‘graffiti’ displayed the word peace next to the Israeli flag alongside the Canadian flag as well as the McGill Martlet, which completely disregards the settler-colonial history tied to all three of these,” she continued.
She added that she “was asked to move multiple times.” She was also “asked to leave because they claimed this art (that resembled the Apartheid Wall with flags of Israel, Canada, and the McGill martlet) was not political.”

2016-11-14,McGill,Palestine,"“Palestine and Feminist Paradigms” lecture critiques feminist canon 
On Thursday, November 10, approximately eighty people gathered in Morrice Hall 017 for a lecture by Rabab Abdulhadi, professor of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University (SFSU).
Adulhadi’s lecture, “Revising the Narrative, Critiquing the Canon: Palestine and Feminist Paradigms,” challenged the homogenization and dehumanization of Arab men and women in the women’s studies canon. Her lecture also contested feminist paradigms that subscribe to the colonial mission of “saving brown women from brown men” and fail to acknowledge the agency and voice of Palestinian women.
Abdulhadi began her talk by discussing instances when Palestinian women’s voices and agency were overlooked or misunderstood by women who have more power. For example, she spoke about a self-avowed feminist fashion house that staged a photo shoot for its summer catalogue in front of the Israeli-West Bank Separation wall in 2004, with the supposed aim of jarring the Israeli state with this image of suffering and despair. Abdulhadi shared a story wherein a chief executive of the company, an Israeli woman, is asked by Umm Muhammad, a Palestinian woman passing by, to join her at a sit-in and call for the wall to be torn down, instead of using the Palestinian’s suffering as a backdrop for her photoshoot. The Israeli woman disregards this invite and says of Umm Muhammad, “She’s too full of hurt, she cannot listen.”
Abdulhadi challenged the audience to question which of these women would be acknowledged as a feminist in the mainstream women studies canon – the “self-avowed feminist” or “the woman who invites those who colonized her land and her life to join her sit-in.”
“Sisterhood is neither powerful, nor global, if it is not on the basis of principled solidarity,” Abdulhadi said, emphasizing multiple times that what matters in any social justice movement is “the indivisibility of justice,” making issues of gender equality, queer rights, and the liberation of Palestine part of the same project.
Abdulhadi also spoke optimistically in her lecture about an increasing show of solidarity from Jewish communities for the Palestinian liberation movement. She explained that, historically, Zionism has always been “a contested narrative” in Jewish communities around the world.
“Sisterhood is neither powerful, nor global, if it is not on the basis of principled solidarity.”
“The Zionist settler-colonial project in Palestine, which claims to speak for the Jews, actually does not,” she said, “and increasingly today, more and more Jews are coming out and saying, ‘not in my name.’”
“I thought [Abdulhadi’s] recognition of anti-Zionist Jewish voices in her talk was really important,” said Anna Ty, a U3 Anthropology and Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies student who attended the lecture, in an interview with The Daily.
For Abdulhadi, critiquing hegemonic narratives is essential to academic work. In an interview with The Daily, she explained that activists in academia who are “speaking truth to power” are doing their job.
However, because of her scholarship and activism, Abdulhadi has been the target of fear tactics and attacks by Zionist groups, like Canary Mission and Campus Watch, for several years. Canary Mission and Campus Watch are websites that profile and personally target activists working for justice in Palestine.
“I thought [Abdulhadi’s] recognition of anti-Zionist Jewish voices in her talk was really important.”
Posters featuring cartoon portraits of Abdulhadi were posted around the SFSU campus earlier this year, targeting her with defamatory charges.
“They want to scare us out of business,” Abdulhadi told The Daily, describing the coordinated attacks of such groups as “cyberbullying” and “incitement of violence.”
“Justice for Palestine is not just a project for the Palestinians,” she told the audience. “Justice for Palestine is a project for everybody who seeks justice.”
A U3 Economics student in attendance, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily that this was what they found to be the most interesting part of the lecture. “The thing that stood out to me the most was her idea [of] how you can’t really separate the different issues within the anti-colonial struggle,” the student said.
“Justice for Palestine is a project for everybody who seeks justice.”
Abdulhadi concluded her lecture on this note as well, by explaining that Israel’s settler-colonial project implicates not just Israelis and Palestinians, but rather “every single person who lives anywhere in the world whose [government’s] policies are making it possible for Israel to continue oppressing Palestinians, to continue stealing land.”
“Everybody is invested in either being part of the problem, or in being part of the solution. And that goes for every struggle, not just for Palestine,” Abdulhadi concluded.

2016-11-21,McGill,Palestine,"IJV McGill holds first event on the creation of a modern Jewish nation
Independent Jewish Voices (IJV)’s McGill chapter hosted their first lecture event on Monday, November 14. The club invited Yakov M. Rabkin, professor of history at l’Université de Montréal, to talk about his book “What is Modern Israel?” which was released earlier this year.
Rabkin began his talk by explaining the relationship between Zionism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Semitism. In his book, he traces the birth of Zionism, which emerged at the end of the 19th century as a reaction to several instances of anti-Jewish violence in Europe and the onset of writings by German intellectuals such as Theodor Herzl.
He discussed the exile and massive migration of Jews from Central and Eastern Europe due to religious and political discrimination that led to a forced settlement in Palestine.
“There is a very important transition that happened with the concept of anti-Semitism,” explained Rabkin. “A hundred years ago, if you thought Jews belonged to a different state, you were an anti-Semite, but now if you deny it, then you are an anti-Semite.”
He said he believes it is important to distinguish between racial and religious anti-Semitism in order to better understand the frameworks in which Israeli sentiment function.
“Religious anti-Semitism offers a way out by means of conversion,” he explained, “however, racial anti-Semitism offers no escape as such.”
This distinction ultimately postulates the existence of a Jewish race and a nation-state propagated within a colonial setting , according to Rabkin.
In his book, Rabkin also discusses the role of Soviet Jews in constituting the Jewish nationality.
“The Soviet Jews [when they settled in Palestine] took with them not only Russian songs and Russian culture, but they took with them the concept that the world hates us,” he said.
He went on to shed light on the influence of Jerusalem-based think tanks that have been working for several decades to make Israel central to Jewish identity.
“This agenda has succeeded for a large majority of secular Jews through programs like birthright,” he said. “Israel has become a residual identity for Jews even if they have never been to Israel or don’t speak a word of Hebrew.”
He concluded his talk by analyzing why organizations like IJV disturb Zionist voices.
“People who equate Zionism to Judaism become very sensitive to criticism since religion is supposed to be private,” Rabkin explained. “The concept of anti-Semitism has become a tool by which any sort of Zionist criticism is silenced, but criticism of Israel does not necessarily have to be anti-Semitic.”
The talk was followed by a question and answer period where several students, professors, and members of the Montreal community shared their experiences of going to Jewish day school, practicing Judaism, and what Zionism means in the context of Judaism as a religion.
In an interview with The Daily, the AUS Equity Commissioner who attended the event, spoke about the importance of solidarity with pro-Palestine Jewish voices on campus.
“I came here because solidarity is important to me, and I know that there are wonderful, wonderful Jewish people on campus that are pro-Palestine,” he said. “So I’m just here to show my support and solidarity and because IJV is new to McGill, so I want to be part of that.”
A co-founder of IJV McGill, Anna, spoke to The Daily about her hope of establishing a community of diverse Jewish voices on campus through their group.
“Events like this […] speak to Jewish voices that otherwise don’t have a place to go or to feel like their story is being validated,” she said. “There is clearly an empty seat in the Jewish auditorium that is now being filled.”

2017-03-13,McGill,Palestine,"The VP University Affairs plays a pivotal role in student advocacy, sitting on Senate and representing SSMU and its constituents to the McGill administration. This coming year will see some responsibilities removed from the University Affairs portfolio, such as mental health and student services, leaving the VP University Affairs to oversee the SSMU Library Improvement Fund, work with student senators on advocacy projects, oversee student research initiatives, and implement equity initiatives.

Alexander Dow is currently an engineering senator on SSMU Council. Before that he served as the Budget Director for the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), Blues Pub Manager, Student Space Fund Commissioner, VP Public Relations for EUS Junior Council, and VP Comms and Sports for MORE housing. He told The Daily that in his time at McGill he has been consistently “working with students or working with admin.” He has “seen a lot of students hurt” and “screwed over” by admin. He says his main goal is to help students deal with the bureaucracy of the university. He values teamwork and expresses a commitment to helping students on an individual basis. He has the trust and support of the EUS and hopes to bring some of their concerns to the SSMU Council.
He stressed that if elected he is not committed to introducing any new policy. Instead he wants to “cement what already exists” and lift up side projects that have fallen by the wayside. In particular, he supports the movement to create an Indigenous studies major, as well as institute a fall reading week. He is currently working to sway the opinion of the Engineering faculty on this issue. He has limited experience with equity and mental health and would take a back seat on issues of that nature if elected, emphasizing that he would use his privilege to advance the agendas of marginalized communities on campus.
Dow likes the apolitical nature of EUS, however, he understands the need for SSMU to be more vocal on political issues. He “draws the line in taking political stances when [SSMU] starts excluding other student groups.” Dow says that while he “grieves for Palestine […] you can’t just openly target an entire community on campus, namely the Jewish and Israeli communities.” However, Dow says that he is good at working with others despite political differences. With regard to David Aird, Dow found out about his resignation five days beforehand. He thinks that the same is true for the other SSMU Execs and does not condone the negative feedback they have received in the past couple of weeks. He aims to work with campus groups such as SACOMSS to create and adopt a sexual assault policy within SSMU, but was unclear on what the specifics of this policy would be.

Oke has held multiple roles in the Black Students’ Network (BSN) over the years, serving not only as the President of the Network, but also as an External and Political Coordinator. Working as part of the Network displays a commitment to organizing and advocacy that VP UAs should have, she says.
Currently, Oke works as VP Floor Fellows of the Association of McGill University Support Employees (AMUSE). She was part of the AMUSE bargaining team which negotiated with the administration to give Floor Fellows salaries, and cites the experience as an example of her adamantly advocating for student’s rights when dealing with the administration.
Additionally, as part of the proposed MUNACA-AMUSE merger, Oke was involved in writing new bylaws for the proposal, demonstrating experience in policy development, and cites her training as a Floor Fellow as being conducive to working in University Affairs, having received more than seventy hours of training as a result, learning active listening, equitable community building, and first response to crises.
Her overall platform prioritizes accountability and campus outreach, especially in a time where SSMU feels incredibly disjointed from the student body. Oke wants to create specific student positions to perform outreach initiatives to campus groups that are not formally part of the Society, saying that “in her experience, active in-person outreach is an effective way of keeping in touch with realities on campus.”
In regards to the Library Improvement Fund, Oke wants to foster healthier spaces in McGill’s libraries, adding visual and nonvisual guides in the libraries to remind students that while studying is important, “there are small actions students can take to mitigate the negative effects of many studying practices.” Oke also wants to install “happy lights” to combat Seasonal Affective disorder (SAD) during midterms and finals.
Oke plans to build on the current VP UA’s “Know your Rights” campaign, which she feels doesn’t give students the option to ask for more “tailored or relevant information.” Oke also feels that SSMU should be doing more to make student services more accessible, and intends to meet demands to improve said services by working with first years’ like in a focus group, letting them discover McGill services and subsequently SSMU officers learning about their experiences and how they can be improved upon.
Oke’s work with AMUSE, as well as her experience as a Floor Fellow and as part of the BSN make her a prime candidate for this position. The VP University Affairs portfolio requires direct relations with the administration, which Oke also has experience in bargaining on behalf of AMUSE at the level of the administration. Her initiative to reach out to more student groups in a more organized fashion would be a welcome adjustment considering many student groups feel currently alienated from the SSMU.
While Dow has a background in student politics with his work in EUS, his limited experience with equity would be a considerable disadvantage in a position which requires heavy knowledge and experience of both these issues. His stance on political issues is also disheartening, given that the VP University Affairs is the only executive other than the President who would advocate for students regarding political issues at the University level.

2017-05-03,McGill,Palestine,"One arrest, several injuries after violent altercation with police 
On Monday May 1, several hundred people gathered in Phillips Square to participate in a May Day protest through Montreal’s Golden Square Mile. This year’s demonstration was the tenth annual May Day march organized by the Convergence des Luttes Anticapitalistes (CLAC), a Montreal group committed to opposing capitalism through direct action.
Unlike other demonstrations held concurrently around the city, including a large union march in Côte-des-Neiges, the CLAC’s event was explicitly anti-capitalist. Most prominently, the Revolutionary Communist Party (PCR) and Revolutionary Student Movement (RSM) were in attendance, and handed out red flags symbolic of the communist movement.
Contingents from across Montreal and Quebec assembled to hear speeches from organizers prior to the march at 6PM. One speech addressed the intersections of capitalism, imperialism, and racism:
“People from the global south have paid the highest price of global capitalisms and imperialisms expansion, falling victim to not just the occupation in Iraq, not just the occupation of Palestine, not just what’s happening in occupied Kurdistan, not what’s happening in Yemen, and also now Syria.”
“When [immigrants] come here they’re met with racism and xenophobia to ensure that migrants and immigrants remain exploited simply for the needs of capital,” continued the above organizer. “Today, immigrant workers are not only just fighting for their dignity but they’re fighting against an entire system that pins them unfortunately with the greatest burden and social cost for capital’s interest for continued profit and for continued destruction of this planet.”
“Today, immigrant workers are not only just fighting for their dignity but they’re fighting against an entire system that pins them unfortunately with the greatest burden and social cost for capital’s interest for continued profit and for continued destruction of this planet.”
McGill Against Austerity (MAA) was one of the many groups to participate in this year’s march, with a contingent of approximately a dozen students. The Daily spoke to a member of MAA who chose to remain anonymous.
“Being an economics student, I see how capitalism is made to look attractive, and I […] read a lot of other scholarship that really disagrees,” she said. “I feel that especially right now in the current [political climate] with […] head of states being right-wing, nationalist, and the rise of religious intolerance.”
“Where I come from, May Day is a recognized formal holiday. […] People openly talk about the history of May Day in the newspaper,” she continued, explaining that she referred to her Bangladeshi heritage. “I found it very surprising that Canada has a very different labour day and it’s not May Day. Even in America it’s called loyalty day which is weird. […] I find it strange that North America is so uncomfortable with the actual history of May Day. And that’s kind of another reason why I [am here] today: […] because I feel very strongly about workers’ rights and I feel it absurd that North America tries to distract people from a significant point in history.”
Another member of MAA who participated in the march, Kyle Shaw, spoke to The Daily about the event’s heavy police presence.
“As always, [the police presence] is excessive, but it’s sort of in the nature of these demonstrations,” said Shaw. “That’s because fascism doesn’t quite conflict [with] or contradict capitalism as thoroughly as communism or other anti-capitalist ideologies. May Day demonstrations are always the first to get cracked down on and the most brutally, let’s say relative to fascist demonstrations which often get protected by the police, whether here in Montreal or across the United States.”
“May Day demonstrations are always the first to get cracked down on and the most brutally, let’s say relative to fascist demonstrations which often get protected by the police, whether here in Montreal or across the United States.”
At around 6:30 p.m., the PCR  set off flares to mark the start of the march. They initially led the crowd east along Saint Catherine Street, before circling back towards the downtown core chanting anti-capitalist slogans and flanked by dozens of police officers.
As the crowd made its way through the Golden Square Mile, the Daily interviewed Nathan McDonell, a member of Rojava Solidarity Montreal.
“We’re here because we want to change the world and we’re inspired by […] the Kurdish movement in the Middle East and in particular the social revolution happening in Rojava which is in the northern part of Syria,” said McDonell. “It’s an incredible society based on direct democracy, ethnic harmony, women’s empowerment, and going beyond the state and capitalism, and it’s an example for all of us to be inspired by. It’s in such a delicate situation […] surrounded by the Syrian civil war, [Turkish attacks], ISIS […] so it really needs our international solidarity [and] it’s important for us to be here to show that.”
Another member of Rojava Solidarity Montreal, wishing to remain anonymous, also emphasized the importance of mobilizing support internationally.
“I am originally Kurdish from east Turkey,” he said. “The people who are here, they are the voice of the people right now under the occupation of Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. […] I believe it is a very important issue, bringing their voices to the world. I see these people around here, and it’s making me so happy as a [Kurdish] individual and Canadian second.”
Roughly half an hour into the march, a brief confrontation occurred between police officers  and a small subsection of protesters. The crowd had been moving west along René-Lévesque Boulevard when they encountered a cordon of police officers from the Sureté du Québec (SQ) in full riot gear, who appear to have been guarding a TD bank building. A few protesters began throwing projectiles at the police, consisting mainly of smoke bombs and rocks. In response, a group of officers attacked the individuals involved with batons and tear gas, arresting at least one person and violently dispersing the rest.
An anonymous protester who was injured in the incident described their experience in a message to The Daily.
“The cops charged on us and started hitting people with their batons,” they wrote. “I was hit several times and a bone in my arm was fractured. One of my comrades was hit on the head. They pushed us very hard, a lot of people were thrown to the ground and almost trampled in the commotion. As I was trying to get away, a cop tripped me up and I fell onto a staircase.”
“The cops charged on us and started hitting people with their batons […] I was hit several times and a bone in my arm was fractured. One of my comrades was hit on the head. They pushed us very hard, a lot of people were thrown to the ground and almost trampled in the commotion.”
Following the confrontation, the protest was temporarily scattered into several small parties, most of which eventually regrouped on McGill College Avenue. They were soon joined by another large group of CLAC supporters that had assembled at the Frontenac metro station, and had marched downtown from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. The demonstration then continued without further incident, counting close to a thousand members.
Last year’s May Day was dispersed after a police station window on Saint Catherine street was smashed. The police used stun guns and copious amounts of tear gas in response, violently scattering the crowd. This year, police cordons were preemptively set up whenever the march approached a police station, but the march consistently changed course to avoid them, and no major stand-offs took place.
Indeed, apart from the altercation on René-Lévesque, police intervention was considered relatively minimal this year. Protesters marched for approximately two and a half hours despite heavy rain, before entering the metro at Place des Arts and dispersing peacefully after some exuberant cheering inside the station.
Connor Spencer, VP External of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), and a member of MAA, spoke with The Daily about the importance of May Day and its relevance to McGill students.
“The austerity measures that the province is facing right now specifically target bodies that are already in precarious positions and makes profit off of them,” said Spencer. “So, today being May Day, […] this is kind of a day to reflect on what we’ve been able to accomplish but also look forward in the future at what we still have to accomplish. The biggest one of which is fighting the austerity measures that the police are complicit in.”
“This is kind of a day to reflect on what we’ve been able to accomplish but also look forward in the future at what we still have to accomplish. The biggest one of which is fighting the austerity measures that the police are complicit in.”
“It’s a McGill issue as well,” Spencer continued. “It’s so often that we think we live in this bubble that separates us from the rest of Quebec, when the things that these people are protesting right now and that we’re on the street protesting is something that affects McGill students directly.”

2017-09-02,McGill,Palestine,"The NDP leadership race, flooding in South Asia, and Indigenous resistance from Peru to Palestine
The New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) is holding its leadership elections between October 1-15, 2017. The party is selecting a leader to replace Tom Mulcair, and challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party and Andrew Scheer of the Conservative Party. Over the summer, the race has narrowed down to four candidates: Niki Ashton, Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Churchill, Manitoba; Charlie Angus, MPP for Timmins, Ontario; Guy Caron, MPP for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques, Quebec; and Jagmeet Singh, MPP for Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Ontario.
The race has largely focused on how to win back the support that was won in the 2011 federal election, and subsequently lost to the Liberals in 2015. A huge portion of that loss was suffered in Quebec, where Tom Mulcair’s opposition to Liberal Bill 62 was perceived negatively. Bill 62 is a bill put forward by the Provincial Liberals of Quebec to ban the wearing of face coverings by governmental employees in the province. The bill has been widely described as Islamophobic, as it would target Muslim women who wear the burqa or the niqab.
As the race moves into Quebec the only Quebecois candidate, Caron, has announced his support of the bill. Ashton initially suggested that she too supports it, later tempering her statement after receiving substantial criticism from her base. Angus, meanwhile, has stated that the matter must go to the courts, and that the government cannot infringe upon religious freedoms. Singh, who is Sikh and wears a turban, has not yet commented on the issue.
Polls in Quebec show a massive loss of interest in the NDP, with 68 per cent of the population describing themselves as “not interested” in a poll conducted by Léger. However, debates over religious freedoms are often explosive in Quebec, and the candidate who impresses the most in the province could generate considerable support for the party nationally.

On August 23 in Jubbet al-Dhib, a village in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian children ready to attend their first day of school were shocked to find the building demolished. The six-classroom school had been razed to the ground by Israeli military forces the night before, leaving volunteers and teachers scrambling to construct makeshift classrooms for the 64 students. A temporary tent to accommodate the children was pitched to replace the caravan school, which was donated by European Union humanitarian organizations.
In defiance of the destruction, students peacefully protested by singing the national anthem before returning home with new school backpacks.
The building and all school materials had been confiscated and/or demolished by Israeli forces on the grounds that no permit had been issued for the construction of the school. Reports claim local residents threw rocks at the soldiers in protest, while the soldiers used tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets to clear the area.
The school itself had been a step forward for Palestinian children in Jubbet al-Dhib in terms of gaining easier access to education. Jubbet al-Dhib is located in Area C of the West Bank, and is under the complete control of Israeli forces, which makes obtaining a permit for opening a Palestinian school almost impossible. The next closest Palestinian school to the village in question is an hour’s walk away over dangerous mountain terrain.
This incident is not an anomaly, but rather one demolition among 92 others this year alone conducted by Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank, despite widespread international condemnation.

Indigenous leaders in Peru have issued an official statement condemning the government for not adhering to laws regarding issues that affect the Indigenous population. Peru’s government is currently negotiating with Frontera Energy, an oil-based Canadian energy firm, on renewing a 30-year contract.
The leaders, who represent more than 100 Indigenous communities, referenced a law passed in 2011 that requires the government to consult these communities before implementing decisions that might impact their territories. However, Ángela Acevedo, the Director of Indigenous Peoples Rights at Peru’s Vice Ministry of Intercultural Affairs argues that while the law is in effect, the state still “takes the final decision.”
The Indigenous leaders, meanwhile, consider the negotiations an unlawful violation of their rights. To protest the government’s action, the Indigenous communities are threatening to prevent the oil firms from accessing their land if a valid consultation with the communities does not take place.
Added to the tribal rights issue is the concern over oil spills in the region. The United Nations special rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes stressed the importance of dealing with the existing environmental hazards before issuing any new deals or contracts that may further exacerbate the issue. Additionally, the rapporteur emphasized that the Indigenous peoples’ concerns should be included when making decisions such as these, because oil spills have been proven to contaminate water to a point that can cause poisoning and death.

As of August 28th, an especially aggressive flood has hit South Asia, causing major infrastructural damage and the deaths of approximately 1200 Indian, Nepali, and Bangladeshi citizens. The storm is said to have affected around 40 million people in the region already, and the situation is quickly exacerbating to an unprecedented level. While some loss brought about by the monsoon season in South Asia is expected, scientists say this level of damage is unnatural—it is the direct result of climate change. The extreme weather has deprived some villages in India of basic resources such as food and water, destroyed more than half a million homes in Nepal, and submerged approximately a third of Bangladeshi land. The relief efforts will require upwards of 100 million USD. The government of India has already pledged 78 million USD for the heavily affected Bihar state alone.

2017-10-02,McGill,Palestine,"Transparency of Board of Directors and constitutionality of BDS questioned 
On September 28, the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Legislative Council convened for a meeting. Council heard presentations from the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ), and from the McGill Office of Sustainability regarding a bike centre project that is part of the climate action plan. The meeting was followed by an extensive question period which focused on the constitutionality of the Board of Directors’ (BoD) recent decision regarding the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
The Board of Directors is the highest governing body within SSMU and is responsible for running the business affairs of the society and ratifying certain political decisions. The constitutionality of the Board has recently been called into question because there are only three SSMU Execs currently serving, which is one too few, and eight members at large, which is four too many.
BDS is a pro-Palestinian movement that works to eliminate international support for Israel in its continued occupation and oppression of Palestine. BDS McGill is an on-campus branch of the movement that fights for the university to boycott, divest from and put sanctions on Israel.
During question period, Councillor Vithushon Thayalan addressed a potential conflict of interest in the BoD’s ratification of the BDS reference. The reference declaring BDS unconstitutional was first issued in 2016 by the SSMU Judicial board. The board ruled that BDS violated the SSMU Equity Policy. At the time, current SSMU President Muna Tojiboeva, served as one of the three judges who was assigned to the case. Tojiboeva currently sits on the BoD, which almost unanimously ratified the BDS decision September 2017.
According to SSMU’s conflict of interest policy, councillors with a conflict of interest must abstain from voting “on matters materially connected with their employment at the Society.” Failure to comply may result in a temporary suspension, a formal apology, or removal from the office.
When asked why she did not abstain from voting on the constitutionality of BDS, Tojiboeva answered, “I don’t have a personal conflict of interest because I don’t derive any personal interest from the [BDS] decision, I also don’t derive any financial gains from the decision.”
Referring to the same BoD meeting, SSMU VP External Connor Spencer asked Tojiboeva whether the Council can expect a report from the BoD on the BDS ratification. While such a statement has apparently not been prepared, Tojiboeva told Council that the meeting’s minutes addressing the ratification were already available online. However, a student present at the meeting confirmed that the last available meeting minutes were from April 2017, and thus that the minutes regarding the BDS decision were still unpublicized.
In response, SSMU’s General Manager, Ryan Hughes, pointed to some technical difficulties in transferring from SSMU’s old website to its new one. While the soft launch of the new website is scheduled for next week, Hughes explained that the minutes would still “not necessarily be available to the public.”
When reminded by SSMU VP Internal Affairs Maya Koparkar that the BoD must publicize minutes as well as report to council on all BoD decisions (per section 1.7 of the SSMU constitution), Tojiboeva answered, “I was unaware that a report needed to be made in terms of our presentation to Council.”
“I was unaware that a report needed to be made in terms of our presentation to Council.”
Further into question period, SSMU VP Finance Arisha Khan asked Tojiboeva why the SSMU Speaker has not presided over BoD meetings. While the Speaker may not vote or be counted towards quorum, section 11.6 of the SSMU Constitution requires them to preside over all BoD, General Assembly (GA), and Legislative Council meetings.
In response, Tojiboeva claimed that the Speaker no longer facilitates BoD meetings since the Constitution was amended in March 2017. The amendments in question allow President Tojiboeva to chair the BoD instead of the Speaker, while retaining voting and quorum rights.
An audience member questioned the validity of amendments, however, pointing out that “[the] Winter GA didn’t reach quorum, so the constitutional amendments couldn’t have been made.”
“[the] Winter GA didn’t reach quorum, so the constitutional amendments couldn’t have been made.”
Tojiboeva then clarified that the amendments were ratified through an electronic vote after the GA. However, the documents regarding the motion are not available on elections SSMU. Neither is the BoD resolution book, which has not been updated since 2016. The question of the resolution book was brought up during the last BoD meeting, according to Khan.
While Tojiboeva recognized the concerns regarding the unpublicized documents, she did not provide a clear timeline on when the resolution book would be updated.
“I think that’s a very valid concern and we should address this seriously. In terms of the timeline […] I would like to inquire my secretary general who would most likely be addressing the issue […] because […] in terms of my own capacities as President, I would not be able to address this immediately on my own time.”
A motion to appoint SSMU VP Student Life Jemark Earle to the BoD was passed, effective immediately. In order to maintain the requisite 12 member composition on the BoD, one member-at-large will resign from their position. The resignation is to be decided at the next BoD meeting.
“The approval of the VP Student Life is immediately necessary to have a functioning BoD,” said Koparkar. At the time of the BDS ratification, the BoD was composed of three SSMU executives and nine members-at-large instead of the required four executives, four members at large, and four councillors. The constitutionality of the BDS decision has been contested due to the composition of the BoD.

2017-11-20,McGill,Palestine,"Thousands mobilize in downtown Montreal
On Sunday November 12, thousands of people gathered in solidarity to protest racism and hatred. The demonstration was organized by several groups who published an online call to action, denouncing Islamophobia, colonialism, sexism and transphobia. This call was subsequently signed by over 168 students, community members, and activist organizations.
The McGill contingent convened at the Roddick gates and walked down Avenue McGill College to Rue Sainte Catherine where they joined the Concordia contingent. The two groups then marched east on Sainte Catherine, about fifty individuals taking up the street and chanting phrases such as “A qui la rue? A nous la rue!” and “Refugees in, racists out!”
The Daily talked with an anonymous demonstrator from McGill BDS who spoke about how important demonstrating solidarity is for groups that advocate for marginalized peoples everyday.
“I think it’s really good that everyone can unite in one time and place and see that solidarity because it’s what keeps us going at the end of the day,” they continued. “It’s also [important] to remind people that Palestine is an ongoing issue and that we can’t forget [about] it in our struggles.
“Right now, the global political climate more than ever needs us to stand against all kinds of fascisms and racisms” they said. “We see or we think of Canada as this liberal paradise and that’s kind of it’s issue. In its liberalism it’s racist, it’s sexist, it funds war regimes […] so more than ever we need to not fall for that.”
“We see or we think of Canada as this liberal paradise and that’s kind of it’s issue. In its liberalism it’s racist, it’s sexist, it funds war regimes.”
Most of the bystanders were supportive of the protest, with some people honking their horns in solidarity. However, on Sainte Catherine and rue Aylmer, a disgruntled driver had an aggressive exchange with a protester and drove into the back of their bike, nearly hitting the individual.
“She sped up to try and pass them but really misjudged how much space there was and hit his bike” said SSMU VP External Connor Spencer. “Then [she] got out of her car and yelled at him for not taking up just one part of the street, which is not a thing.”
Protesters and bystanders gathered around the car and confronted the woman for the dangerous situation she had created, some people threatening her with calling the police. No one was harmed.
On Jeanne Mance the group met up with the Milton Parc community contingent. Sascha Astles, a representative from the community, spoke to the Daily about why she was out marching. “My family has been victimized […] I’m in an interracial relationship, I have five kids, they’ve all felt and been targeted at certain times and just bullied, really nonsensical stuff that saddens me more than angers me because I would hope at this point in our evolution that we would be beyond that.”
These contingents joined with the larger demonstration at Place Émilie Gamelin at 2 PM, where thousands of individuals had already gathered and were preparing to begin the march. There were many different factions, all joining together to protest racism and hatred. For a Montreal protest there was a relatively low police presence, and little to no violence over the course of the three hour long demonstration.
In an interview with the Daily, Mariana Sosa, a social work student at McGill, talked about her reasons for protesting, and the issue of complacency.
“Honestly, if not me then who? It’s my job as a future social worker and a human being on this planet to go out and make noise for the people [who] can’t be here for any reason” she said. “I think this is the perfect place to make as much noise as possible for an intersection of problems that are happening in the world and in this city particularly.”
“There’s a lot of people out here, more than I was expecting, to be honest, because I feel like, when it comes to protests, a lot of people are complacent and they let other people take the brunt of it, but I’m really happy to see such an amazing turnout.”
One of the organizations that signed onto the broad call of action for the march was the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ). There were a number of representatives from the Association marching, and the Daily spoke with one individual who wished to remain anonymous.
“The association […] strongly condemns racism, Islamophobia, and any forms of oppression towards visible minorities, whether it is due to their race, ethnicity, their sexual orientation. We strongly stand against it and we believe that through the grassroots we are able to [make] changes in our community and our society. So we’re here, we mobilized, we’re here to show support with marginalized people, with all these groups that have endorsed this march, and to just stand against oppression, stand against racism, stand against hatred.”
They went on to discuss the issue of oppression and marginalization in Palestine, clarifying that these were his personal views and that AVEQ has no formal stance.
“I’m a Palestinian, and I identify a lot with the cause of Palestinian people. […] I believe that what’s going on in Palestine is one of the greatest tragedies. We’re looking at oppression at different […] levels whether it is [of] the Palestinians living in 1948 Palestine […] or whether it is in the West Bank and Gaza, […] whether it is that universities are underfunded, or whether it is racist policies when it comes to what some people would call, groups such as Amnesty call, the ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem. […] We’re looking also at the disproportionate use of force in Gaza which is based out of racism and out of supremacy.
“We believe there’s a global structure of racism built out of white supremacy, built out of dominance of a certain class over another, […] whether it is oppression of Palestinians, or whether it is here in Canada where discriminated groups are oppressed by the privileged class, by privileged people.”
“We believe there’s a global structure of racism built out of white supremacy, built out of dominance of a certain class over another.”
The march continued north on Berri, then turned west on Cherrier, then south on Saint Denis. The protestors marched west again on Sherbrooke. They continued west past McGill University, where some protesters shouted chants addressing the university’s administration.
The march continued south on Peel and ended just before 5 PM at Dorchester Square.

2018-01-29,McGill,Palestine,"Open forum discusses respect, inclusion, and free speech
On December 4, 2017, the Principal’s Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life emailed a survey to McGill community members requesting their opinion on values of respect, inclusion, and free speech on campus.
Created as a support line for people who have experienced, or are experiencing, exclusion or discrimination on campus, the task force itself is made up of people from varying roles and positions on campus, consisting of two co-chairs, both professors at McGill; one undergraduate student from the downtown campus, one undergraduate student from Macdonald Campus, one graduate student, two additional faculty members and two staff members. No members are directly tied with the university’s administration. The survey was available from December 4 to 7.
A majority of the survey’s questions focused on the concept of free speech, while others constituted inquiries into possible instances of discrimination and exclusion on campus. The survey’s choice of language sparked some criticism, mainly as a result of its focus on issues of freedom of speech with only a few questions about inclusiveness, despite the task force’s mandate.
In addition to the survey, as part of the consultative process, five closed-door focus groups around different themes of inclusion were organized, occurring between January 17 and 29: Teaching & Learning, Social Spaces, Graduate Student Life, Residence Life, and an open-themed discussion. Each one was composed of twenty students, lasting for 90 minutes. As of publication, four have been held (all expect Residence Life).
The University held an Open Forum on Campus Culture Wednesday, January 24 in Leacock 232. McGill staff chose not to moderate the forum beyond requesting people’s definition of the theme of the focus group, discussing inclusion or exclusion experienced in that space, and requesting that the participants concentrate on discussion rather than debate.
The night’s exchange revolved around whether or not the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement had a place (or simply a right) on campus. Laila Parsons, a professor specializing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at McGill, spoke about her views on the movement’s legitimacy.
“If the upper administration wants students themselves to engage in respectful and inclusive dialogue in a genuine way, then it needs to itself practice what it preaches,” she asserted. “It needs to respect the right of students to mobilize around the BDS movement, without picking those students out from all other activist groups on campus for special condemnation.”
“It needs to respect the right of students to mobilize around the BDS movement, without picking those students out from all other activist groups on campus for special condemnation.”
She also reproached Principal Suzanne Fortier’s February 2016 statement condemning the BDS movement after the SSMU motion to endorse the movement failed to be ratified. Parsons referred to the Principal’s statement as “bullying,” “intrusive,” the “opposite of respect and inclusion,” and “exacerbat[ing] tension rather than reduc[ing] it.”
Shanice Yarde, the Equity Advisor with McGill’s Social Equity and Diversity Education (SEDE) office, acknowledged the value of the task force and the hotline, but brought up important questions about the priorities and driving motives of the task force; this worry seemed to be common among many students.
One student, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to The Daily.
“I question the extent of which the university genuinely values free speech,” they said, “considering that, in my time at McGill, the only times the admin stepped in about student voices had to do with activism that related to Palestine. Similar responses were not expressed when, for instance, an association at McGill hosted a transphobic discussion by noted pushers of hateful propaganda. Nor was there much concern or action against students who drunkenly paraded around campus with misogynist messages on their clothes.”
“Does McGill value free speech without qualification, or only on specific issues that might upset their donors?” they concluded.
During discussion, there were a few instances of students arguing for the free roaming of ideas. These students were arguing for the need to defend “free speech” even when other students’ might feel that their sense of safety was put in jeopardy by such speech, a theme many religious minorities, queer, and racialized students feel conflates freedom of speech and freedom to discriminate with one’s speech.
Another student who chose to speak with The Daily anonymously said: “It was a nice experience, people who would normally not sit together had a chance to have some debates. The board of volunteers took many notes. Unfortunately, like most commission, I seriously doubt there will be any concrete implementations of the suggestions made to the administration. In other words, such a committee with no authority does not help me believe in a better future at McGill.”
“It was a nice experience, people who would normally not sit together had a chance to have some debates.”
Proposals brought up during the forum included: having more face-to-face debates from opposing sides on controversial issues, implementing a binding process to make syllabi fit a required diversity clause to ensure racial and gender diversity in syllabi sources, increased support to the SEDE office, greater inclusion of student input on tenure-track applications, and representation of student perspectives in tenure-track application committees.
The task force is expected to deliver a final report and submit its recommendations to Principal Fortier by April 27, 2018, to be made public shortly thereafter and formally presented at the May 16, 2018 meeting of Senate, where the initiatives findings on inclusivity and respect will be given the opportunity to shape future policies at McGill.
Group submissions are being welcomed by the task force until January 31, 2018 at principals.taskforce@mcgill.ca as Word or PDF documents not exceeding two pages. At any time, any individual can also send the task comments or suggestions by email to the same email.

2018-02-26,McGill,Palestine,"David Heap discusses breaking the blockade on Gaza
On February 20, McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestine Human Rights (SPHR) hosted David Heap, a community-based activist for peace and human rights, and media coordinator of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), a self-described “grassroots people-to-people solidarity movement composed of campaigns and initiatives from all over the world working together to end the blockade of Gaza.” Heap discussed the important role the FFC plays in defying the illegal blockade of Gaza, detailing how the movement raises international solidarity with Gazans who experience the ongoing siege from the Israeli occupation. The FFC also provides a platform for international civil societies to mobilize and discuss the Gaza situation. Several missions organized by the FFC attempted to reach the shores of Gaza to distribute much-needed supplies to Gazan residents; however, all were either stopped or assaulted by the occupation’s navy.
Missions to break the siege did not begin with the FFC, but with the Free Gaza Movement. Heap clarified: “two voyages in [August and October] 2008 sailed to and from Gaza and brought medical supplies without any security risks, and without any harm to anyone.” But when the occupation’s military carried out operation “Cast Lead” from December 2008 to January 2009, Heap explained, “free Gaza voyages arriving during the operation came under attack, […] the navy began shooting and ramming boats, and it became very difficult and dangerous.”
The Israeli occupation is responsible for putting activists in danger, Heap stressed. “The only thing that makes [the voyages] difficult is the occupier’s violence.” This hostility is exemplified in the FCC’s first voyage in 2010, organized by the Free Gaza Movement and the Turkish Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH). Of the six ships sailing to Gaza, “the largest, the Mavi Marmara, was attacked and boarded in international waters by the occupation’s commandos, killing nine activists and injuring several others,” stated Heap. The attack received extensive media attention generating an international public outcry, and caused the occupation to temporarily ease the blockade on Gaza.
Heap then described Israeli tactics to intercept humanitarian boats en route to Gaza. “Before we encountered the occupation’s navy, we lost contact with satellite radio […] the satellite phones all got blocked. This is in itself an admission of guilt, the occupiers are saying they’re about to do something they don’t want the world to see, so they have to cut off all channels of communication to control the narrative. They boarded with armed commandos, but we are committed to non-violent resistance. They are not committed to nonviolence.”
Heap was detained along with the other activists present onboard, spending six days in jail.
Heap explained that “typically flotilla participants are deported after 24 to 48 hours because it’s a media liability to keep [Western] internationals in prison.”
 
“Before we encountered the occupation’s navy, […] the satellite phones all got blocked. This is in itself an admission of guilt, the occupiers are saying they’re about to do something they don’t want the world to see.”
 
Heap went on to say that the most important thing was that “we were not forgotten, [however] the dangers for the Palestinians in Gaza [are] being forgotten. If nothing else, these actions serve to remind the world that they are not forgotten. They may be forgotten by the governments of the world, but they are not forgotten by the people of the world.” With this, Heap underlined one of the main goals of the flotilla, “this is one of the reasons to sail, it reminds a captive people that they in their international prison are not forgotten.”
He also reminded the attendees that the “blockade itself remains illegal under international law […] the special Rapporteur for Human Rights in September 2011 said that there is no way the blockade of Gaza could be legal because it deprives a civilian population from the right of freedom of movement […] which is considered collective punishment under International Law and the Geneva Conventions, guaranteeing the freedom of movement for all people within their state.”
Heap then described the Estelle Flotilla in 2012 which stopped at various European ports, raising awareness in the cities. He explained, “we learned in that case about the importance of the pre-voyage. The last part of the voyage can be predictable when we’re intercepted by the occupier’s navy. When we meet people in a European communities we have an impact on that community.”
An alternative tactic to the flotillas was the Gaza’s Ark campaign from 2012-2015, which sought to challenge the blockade from the inside out. Heap explained, “Gaza’s Ark was a project to sail from inside Gaza out, to emphasize the fact that it’s not about us bringing stuff to Gaza, it’s about freedom of movement for Palestinians in Gaza.” Heap and his colleagues would “rebuild a fishing boat in Gaza, buy trade goods from Palestinians who wanted to trade with the world, and sail out to challenge the blockade. [We were] demanding freedom of movement and freedom of commerce […] and the project sold about $25,000 worth of export goods.”
The Gaza’s Ark campaign addressed the plight of Gaza’s fishermen, who “since 2012 and in fact earlier, suffered from the occupier pushing back the very narrow band of waters where Palestinians are allowed to fish. Sometimes it’s six nautical miles, sometimes it’s as little as four nautical miles. Keep in mind that any other coastal people in the world has a minimum of 12 nautical miles of territorial waters and normally a 20 nautical mile economic zone.” Heap stated “many end up in the occupation’s prisons for the crime of fishing. For the crime of trying to feed their families.”
Heap went on to express his support for the Women’s Flotilla which sailed in 2016 that “underlined the aspects of the blockade which particularly affect women […] and the role women play in the resistance and the survival of their societies.”
George Ghabrial, a member of SPHR, said “it’s important to remind the McGill community at large that [the struggle for Palestinian liberation] is bigger than just McGill or a campus. We have a room full of people who are relatively aware of the issue today thinking about the occupation of Gaza. It inspires people to think a little bit differently and maybe empowers them to take action in different ways they hadn’t done so before in their communities and in that way spread more internationally.”
Regarding future flotilla plans, Heap stated that “this year, we’re planning a sail called ‘A Just Future for Palestine’ and the flotilla will be called ‘Al Awdah’ [The Return] with representatives from all over Europe, Malaysia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States as well as several [representatives from] international organizations. We need to continue to spread the international nature of this. The purpose is to break the media blockade and to reach people with the story of what’s happening in Gaza.”
 
“It inspires people to think a little bit differently and maybe empowers them to take action in different ways […] and in that way spread more internationally.”

2018-02-26,McGill,Palestine,"Rally participants discuss systemic incarceration of child prisoners
On Sunday, February 18, around 50 people gathered to protest against the trial of Ahed Tamimi and the treatment of other Palestinian political prisoners at Norman Bethune Square. The rally was organized by Solidarité pour les droits humains des Palestiniennes et Palestiniens in coalition with five other groups as part of Free the Tamimis Global Day of Action, an international campaign organized in response to the arrest and detainment of the 17-year-old activist, Ahed Tamimi. The ongoing imprisonment of the Tamimi family has sparked public outrage, in response to the military court’s ruling last month to keep Tamimi and her mother in custody during closed-door trials.They, allegedly, do not have a clear timeline. Various speakers at the event denounced the prosecution of child prisoners, as participants held banners reading “End apartheid,” and “Stand with Gaza.” Two police vehicles were present at the rally.
“Israel does not differentiate between the child, the elderly, the women,” said Omar Ben Ali, a speaker and Palestinian refugee participating in the event. “In the eyes of the Israeli occupation, every Palestinian is an enemy. Every Palestinian must be punished.”
Ben Ali, who is from the Jenin region of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is currently stateless because of the Canadian government’s refusal to recognize his claimed refugee status.
Ben Ali emphasized that the Ahed Tamimi case is not an isolated incident, as all Palestinians under occupation, including his wife and children in Palestine, are at risk of violence.
“When I see Ahed al-Tamimi, I see five daughters of mine”, said Ben Ali. “Every second, I have a fear that my daughter will be subjected to what Ahed al-Tamimi is subjected to. Not just my daughters, but […] all Palestinian children.”
According to the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, approximately 700 children are put on trial in military courts each year. Recent cases include the detainment of Abdel-Raouf al-Bilawi and Razan Abu Sal, two 13-year-olds, who were sentenced to four months in prison in January this year for throwing stones at occupation forces. They are reportedly the youngest Palestinian prisoners to date, and the youngest prisoners in the world.
Both al-Bilawi and Abu Sal live in the occupied West Bank, like the Tamimi family members, where Human Rights Watch have documented multiple cases of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) being physically abusive, and where the Tel Aviv based Haaretz has reported on allegations of IDF officers purposefully disabling Palestinian youth.
“With Ahed Tamimi we have a young person who happened to be born Palestinian, who happened to be born into occupation of her land, who happened to be born into the resistance struggle of her people for freedom and justice,” said Dolores Chew, another speaker at the event told the audience.
In Israel, there are two distinct legal systems in operation: the civilian legal system applied to Israeli citizens and a military court system applied to the Palestinian population.
According to the prisoners rights group Addameer, there are currently 350 Palestinian children in Israeli detention. According to a study published on October 2017 by Israeli rights groups HaMoked and B’tselem, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) incarcerates Palestinian youth under harsh conditions, such as night interrogations without the presence of a guardian or a legal counsellor. The report states that 91 per cent of interviewed minors were arrested at night, and minors were not made aware of their right to remain silent, or their rights to counsel. Such detainment is unlawful: Israeli law prohibits night interrogations.
Moreover, Israel, as a signatory of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, is obliged to uphold international juvenile justice standards which mandates that “[t]he arrest, detention, or imprisonment of a child […] shall be used only as a measure of last resort.”
Chew noted that while minors are unlawfully arrested and interrogated, “soldiers […] have authority from the Israeli state to invade homes regularly, vandalize the contents, destroy food, terrorize children asleep in their beds and shoot them in the head. All this with absolute impunity.”
A report published by Breaking the Silence, a non governmental organization (NGO) run by former Israeli soldiers, mentioned the discretion given to soldiers to open-fire and identify targets, which led to massive casualties of unarmed Palestinians.
“It is the Israeli state declaring ‘we can do this to you and get away with it’,” said Chew.
“With Ahed Tamimi we have a young person who happened to be born Palestinian, who happened to be born into occupation of her land, who happened to be born into the resistance struggle of her people for freedom and justice”
This state-sponsored military campaign on Gaza operates in areas which are legally under Palestinian authority. Most of the attacks perpetuate the persecution of Palestinian children in villages within the West Bank.
The Palestinian West Bank is currently separated into three administrative divisions: Areas A, B, and C. Each division operates under varied levels of civil control by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israeli occupation forces. Areas A and B comprise respectively of only 18 and 22 percent of the West Bank, and are supposed to be administered under the PA. The remaining 60 per cent, Area C, is occupied by Israeli forces, and is considered to be illegally administered under international law. Nabi Saleh, the village where the Tamimi family resides, is part of the former division under PA control. However, the Israeli state maintains de facto authority and governance through raids conducted by Israeli soldiers to arrest and detain Palestinians. Chew stated that Palestinians under the occupation have the right to resist these actions.
“The […] Zionist state of Israel flagrantly violates international law,” she said. “The occupation of Palestine is the longest military occupation in modern history. Under international law, people under occupation have a right to resist. Therefore what Ahed and other Palestinians do to resist occupation is their legitimate right under international law.”
*Anna, a Palestinian student present at the rally told the Daily in an interview, “International law grants Tamimi, and many other Palestinian activists placed under PA division control the right to legally resist the presence of Israeli soldiers […] on their land. It is important to distinguish ‘aggression’ from ‘legal resistance against colonialism.’”
According to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314, the definition of aggression does not “prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom, and independence […] particularly [of] peoples under colonials and racist regimes […] nor the right of these peoples to struggle to that end and to seek and receive support.” Moreover, the UN has recognised the right for occupied populations to use legitimate armed force to see “liberation from colonial and foreign domination” in numerous occasions.
“The Israeli occupation of Palestine is illegal, and has always been colonial,” said Anna, referring to the Israeli state’s decision not to withdraw from Palestine in 1967 despite a unanimous decree of the UN Security Council to adopt Resolution 242, which called for the “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied.”
Under international law, people under occupation have a right to resist. Therefore what Ahed and other Palestinians do to resist occupation is their legitimate right under international law.”
“As Western governments are supporting the Israeli occupation, what will become of us?” asked Ali. Ali claimed refugee status on arrival in Canada almost ten years ago, a status which has been denied despite being unable to return to Palestine due to the occupation. He subsequently applied for immigration status under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, but that however was too refused.
One of the speakers, Andrew Welsh pointed out that Canada currently does not recognize the existence of a Palestinian state.
“It is not a coincidence that in 2016, the Trudeau government passed a motion condemning the BDS [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions] movement,” said Welsh.
In February 2016, Canada’s Parliament passed a motion condemning the BDS movement, a grassroots movement seeking a peaceful resolution to the Israeli occupation.
“We need to be in solidarity, with those that are fed up,” said Welsh in French. “Fed up by the lies of the government, that claims to have no money to finance the creation of jobs, but has the money to build new weapons. Canada is going to increase its military budget by 70 percent. A part of this budget will go in the support of the Zionist occupation of Palestine.”
Anna explained in an interview to The Daily how the extent of apathy of Palestinian human rights is reflected in the international responses towards cases like Tamimi’s.
Anna stated that the content and amount of information, or lack thereof, published in Western news sources such as the New York Times and Newsweek further reflects the inaction of the international community.
She explained how, for example, Tamimi’s trial was postponed from January 31 to February 6 and finally to February 13, but “Western news sources have, for the most part, refrained from publishing the news of this postponement.” Anna illustrated her point by noting how an article published by the New York Times (NYT) on February 4 regarding the change of date of the trial was taken down.
In an article published in December 22, 2017, the NYT included the perspectives of several Israeli figures, such as Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute, a Jewish research and education institute, who stated that “when you see yourself as under permanent siege, your greatest fear is the loss of deterrence.” However, Anna told the Daily that this statement does not reflect the experiences of Palestinians because “Israeli occupation forces control the movement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank, and Palestinians are thus the people under siege.”
“For those of us living at a great physical distance from Palestine where we don’t experience the heel of a military boot on our necks,” stated Chew, “it might have seemed that things were relatively quiet, relatively peaceful but the […] [Israeli airstrikes] on Gaza just a few hours ago are a reminder that this is a state of continuing war and civilians including children are the targets.”
On the day of the rally, the Israeli military carried out multiple strikes overnight in the Gaza strip, killing two Palestinians in an Israeli tank fire. The same day, two Palestinian teenagers were killed near Rafah, the southern region of the border, for approaching the border in an allegedly “suspicious manner.”
“We need to make people aware that even when Palestine drops out of the news for us over here, Palestinian people have to live the daily indignities of occupation,” continued Chew.
“You are the ones who have to stand for the Palestinians,” continued Ali, echoing Chew’s words and stressing the importance of international solidarity. “Because even Palestine’s children no longer trust in these [Western] governments.”
“Palestine’s children only call for the people, those who are free all over the world,” said Chew, quoting resistance movements such as “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS),” which have been “called for by the people of Palestine.”
“We need to make people aware that even when Palestine drops out of the news for us over here, Palestinian people have to live the daily indignities of occupation”
BDS was formally nominated for the a Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian parliamentarian Bjornar Moxnes, backed by the support of his party, the Rødt (Red) Party. BDS is currently active in Montreal among other resistance groups such as Tadamon, an organization in support of Palestinian human rights.
“We must continue the pressure, there is an end in sight. […] Ahed, we send you our love and deepest solidarity,” concluded Chew.

2018-03-26,McGill,Palestine,"SPHR organizes discussion on contemporary colonialism
On Tuesday March 20, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill hosted a workshop comparing the contemporary colonialisms of Tibet and Palestine, presented by Khando Langri, a Tibetan-Canadian member of SPHR McGill and an activist for the liberation of Tibet. The workshop was held in conjunction with other events as part of Israeli Apartheid Week in Montreal.
Langri began the presentation by explaining the need to recognize Palestine and Canada as both occupied territories.
“In order to resist colonization abroad, we must first address how we are complicit in the continuous colonial process in Montreal,” explained Langri.
She established that although there is a “universal perception within university settings that we have entered the age of postcolonialism […] colonialism is not only alive but is thriving in the modern age” as exemplified by the occupation of both Palestine and Tibet.
The NGO Freedom House, which according to its website is “an annual comparative assessment of political rights and civil liberties,” ranks the political rights and civils rights of the occupied territory of Tibet at -2/40 and 3/60, those of the occupied West Bank at 6/40 and 24/60, and those for the occupied Gaza Strip at 3/40 and 9/60, respectively. In comparison, Canada is ranked at 40/40 for its political rights and 59/60 for its civil rights.
Portrayal of child prisoners
Langri compared the occupations of Tibet and Palestine first in terms of child prisoners held in both regions. The eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a “high reincarnate Lama,” an important religious leader in Tibet, was recognized by the Dalai Lama on May 15, 1995 and was subsequently rejected by the Chinese government which “abducted both [the Panchen Lama] and his family,” explained Langri. Neither him nor his family have been heard of or seen since and no charges have been exposed nor have any trials have been held.
“[The Panchen Lama] was […] removed from Canada’s list of prisoners last year” which is a list of different prisoners compiled by Canada used in order to lobby against certain countries, stated Langri. “The list that was […] for China […] omitted the Panchen Lama so clearly China’s winning here since [Canada doesn’t] remember him anymore.”
This example was juxtaposed with the situation of Ahed Tamimi, a sixteen-year old child prisoner facing eight months in prison after slapping an Israeli soldier who trespassed onto her home in the occupied West Bank, and consequently is being tried in an Israeli military court.
“Because Tammi is portrayed as an adult in mass media and […] the Panchen Lama’s identity as a tuku […] a high reincarnate Lama […] are the forefront of any discussion involving these two people they are not allowed to exist as children in the popular psyche,” elaborated Langri.
“It’s important to talk about them even if they’re politicized so we can’t let the fact that […] many are perceived as being […] very controversial figure[s] […] to stop us from talking about them because this politicization does not [take away from] their childhood.”
Ecology of occupied land
Langri also discussed the concept of China’s “greenwashing” of the occupation in Tibet. Greenwashing is “the act of packaging something to make it seem eco-friendly and thus more acceptable to mainstream media,” she explained. This concept is part of China’s “Ecological Migration Scheme” which displaces Tibetan nomadic families and relocates them to “ghettos called ‘Socialist New Villages’.” These nomadic inhabitants do not have skills for the labor market, are not offered education, and face an increased living cost, Langri explained.
“What’s ironic is that […] the Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N. has recognized the role that pastoralists play in preserving the environment so in terms of Tibet the nomads […] were very crucial in maintaining […] soil carbon because the animal’s waste added nutrients to the soil […] maintaining fertility and also the hooves would aerate the soil by pressing in seeds and trampling dead plants.”
This concept of ecological manifestation of colonialist occupation is also present in Palestine. Langri used the example of the establishment of the “South Africa Forest,” a tree-planting initiative by the Jewish National Fund in the destroyed Palestinian village of Lubya published in article by Heidi Grunebaum.
“By using nature against indigenous people we can […] erase their narratives,” said Langri.
“Changing the land [of native peoples] physically […] translates into […] [a change in the] conception of national homelands.”
Apoliticism of traditional symbols
Langri explained how “we as a consumer culture really enjoy indigenous aesthetics but that means on the one hand as we consume them we render them apolitical.” She explained how in the case of Tibet, “Tibetan struggles [are] consistently erased from news struggles and has been substituted with this fascination for the Dalai Lama [the spiritual leader of Tibet] as a media personality.”
“As a society we are charmed by him but we don’t want to engage in Tibetan issues because they’re not very savory.”
For example, the use of Tibetan prayer flags, flags which contain mantras which are believed to blow in the wind and spread compassion and peace and the usage of the keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism and protest against Israeli occupation, as decoration and fashionable pieces is testament to a “love for Tibetan and Palestinian aesthetics but [a lack of] […] love for the people themselves.”
Tourism as a “tool of occupation”
In terms of tourism, Langri discussed how “tourism is in fact the tool of occupation.” She explained how in the case of Palestine, Birthright trips to Israel which are offered to Jewish young adults ages 18-32 “erase all traces of the land’s original […] inhabitants.” These trips represent an “unequal spreading of […] touristic resources” because Palestinian refugees cannot return to their homeland in the regions of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s prevention of Palestinians from returning to their homeland is parallel to China’s prohibition of movement for Tibetans even though China advocates for tourism within Tibet. All Tibetan passports have been confiscated by the Chinese government and only government-affiliated individuals are offered “semi-official public affairs passports,” Langri explained. Additionally, traditional Tibetan “sky burials,” a religious and sacred Tibetan custom, are being advertised as a tourist attraction and are being photographed and recorded.
Mobilization
Anna* a student who attended the workshop explained that “Tibet has now officially stopped requesting to be an independent nation and now wants […] political recognition […] these rights are inscribed in the Chinese constitutions and so it’s simply asking that China now respect these rights to autonomy […] but they’re not [upholding these rights] […] [and] in fact nothing is really being respected on paper.”
“That’s […] the political way that we could mobilize,” Anna continued. “Canada for example hasn’t taken a stance […] with regards to recognizing Tibet’s desire to […] have these autonomy rights respected and that’s something that the [Canada Tibet Committee] tries to do […] to [get] the Canadian government to take a stance.”

2018-11-19,McGill,Palestine,"International news for the week of Nov. 19
Ceasefire in Gaza 
On November 11, seven Palestinians in Gaza were killed by an Israeli special forces operation. This was the latest event in the violent, decades-long occupation of Gaza by Israel, though there had been a ceasefire since 2014, with Israel easing up its siege and allowing money and fuel to be sent over the border. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader, said on November 13 that if Israel “stops its aggression,” it would be possible to return to the ceasefire understanding of before. Even with the ceasefire, Gazans still live in unfair and inhumane conditions.
On November 14, an agreement was reached between the Palestinian and Israeli governments with the help of the deal brokered by Egyptian officials. Egypt has also been engaged in blockades against Gaza, restricting movement at the border between Egypt and Palestine. This deal, which was agreed upon in order to avoid the possibility of war, has reportedly already decreased violence in the region. The possibility of peace seemed to be in jeopardy after Israel’s covert mission, but Haniyeh has stated that “[Hamas] will respect this declaration as long as the Zionist enemy respects it.” Yahya Sinwar, another leader of Hamas, has said that he would also like to avoid war. “Through war, we achieve nothing,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also wishes to avoid war, as evidenced by his agreement to the deal. Gideon Levy, an editor at Al Jazeera, commented that while “both parties are not interested in war, [neither are] doing enough to prevent one.”
UK and EU Reach Deal
British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a Brexit deal this past Tuesday November 13, calling an emergency Cabinet meeting. Since the 2016 referendum, where over 50 per cent of UK citizens voted in favour of leaving the EU, there have been extensive deliberations on how Britain can and should exit the European Union.
May’s deal includes details of the 21-month withdrawal and transition period, the new rights and commitments of EU and UK citizens, as well as the the sum of money to be paid to the EU. On November 14, the deal was approved by Cabinet, but not without opposition. Since an agreement was reached, two Cabinet ministers and numerous junior ministers have resigned, and Prime Minister May has received several letters of non-confidence. If May is presented with 48 letters, a vote to oust her as leader and Prime-Minister could be held.
The deal will be up for EU approval at the emergency summit to be held on November 25. If passed, the current deal will be voted on within the UK Parliament. If Parliament does not back the deal, the government has 21 days to produce a new deal, or face following re-negotiations, or even hold a general election. If Parliament votes in favour of the deal, the EU will produce an official Withdrawal Bill which will have to go through a number of stages of approval at the EU ahead of the withdrawal, which will occur on March 29 2019.

Conflict in Cameroon Escalates 
Dozens have been killed in Cameroon this past week as fighting increases between Cameroon militia and separatist rebels. The increase in casualties on both sides follows the October re-election of President Paul Biya for a seventh term. Biya is the oldest leader in sub-Saharan Africa; he has ruled Cameroon for almost 40 years.
The conflict stems from a divide in the predominantly French-speaking nation between Anglophone separatists and government forces. The then-German protectorate of Kamerun was split between France and England by the League of Nations in 1919, causing the current language divide. Following a referendum in 1972, French and English speaking territories came together to form the United Republic of Cameroon.
Separatist rebels seek the creation of an independent, English-speaking state called “Ambazonia.” Separatists have targeted English-speaking areas that conform to the Cameroonian national identity, including kidnappings and violence in Western Cameroon. However, it is often unclear who is behind the violence. To stifle the rebels, army forces have actively killed, kidnapped, and targeted villages. Strict and enforced curfews have been imposed in English-speaking zones to limit separatist activities after dark. Reports indicate that more than half of the English-speaking city of Bamenda have fled their homes, with schools closing, and roads remaining unsafe. The crisis has forced civilians to flee Anglophone regions for French-speaking ones, or to neighbouring Nigeria.

2019-02-03,McGill,Palestine,"Arts Undergraduate Society Council Votes on Summer Course in Israel
On Wednesday, January 30, approximately 30 members of the McGill community attended the AUS biweekly Legislative Council. This spike in attendance was spurred by the proposed creation of POLI 339, a summer course to take place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The meeting lasted from 6 pm until around 9 pm. The majority of the meeting was spent discussing POLI 339. A motion was scheduled to approve the participant fee of $1,000 associated with the course. 
Those in favour of the course, by and large, argued that the course was an “academic opportunity.” Some argued that this “exclusively procedural” vote was being turned into a “proxy vote” for debates concerning Palestine. It was argued that voting against this fee would be hypocritical since the AUS Legislative Council had voted in favour of a course to take place in Italy. 
Those opposed to POLI 339 reasoned that the motion was political; by approving the fee, AUS would be endorsing the course, they argued. They maintained it was wrong to endorse POLI 339 because Israel participates in ongoing settler-colonialism through its occupation of Palestine. Many opponents said the vote was not a proxy vote; rather, it was about students of all backgrounds being able to access the course. Opponents argued that students holding certain passports, students of Palestinian descent, and/or students involved in pro-Palestinian activism could be detained at the Israeli border, as in the case of American student Lara Alqasem who was detained for two weeks in an Israeli border detention facility. Endorsing such a course would create unequal opportunities for McGill students based on nationality, race, ethnicity, and political opinion, according to the dissenters of POLI 339.
Endorsing such a course would create unequal opportunities for McGill students based on nationality, race, ethnicity, and political opinion, according to the dissenters of POLI 339.
In a statement following the vote, McGill Students in Solidarity with Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) has alleged that “many students who spoke against this program [were poorly treated].” Students who spoke against the motion were allegedly filmed by other members of the gallery. Additionally, a representative from World Islamic & Middle Eastern Studies Student Association’s (WIMESSA) point of personal privilege was repeatedly and harshly dismissed by the speaker. The point of personal privilege was about the emotional discomfort of Palestinian students at the candid discussion of villages from which their families were expelled. According to Robert’s Rules of Orders, which govern AUS Legislative Council meetings, points of personal privilege relate to matters that may affect an individual’s comfort or safety. A number of other points of personal privilege were addressed before the representative to WIMESSA’s point was rejected.
The Legislative Council voted for a confidential vote. All gallery members were asked to leave and representatives voted on ballots rather than by raising their placards. 
According to anonymous sources, the vote was 13 for, 14 against, and four abstentions. After the vote, the rest of the agenda was tabled to the next meeting. 
SPHR hailed the vote as a “victory,” while supporters of the motion were heard discussing ways to bring the motion to higher governing bodies.

2019-02-17,McGill,Palestine,"On January 30, during AUS’ biweekly Legislative Council, members discussed POLI 339. POLI 339 is a proposed summer course for McGill students that would take place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As mandated by provincial law, any course with additional fees must be approved by a student body. The $1000 fee for POLI 339, to be paid by each student in the course, was subject to lengthy debate. Those in favour argued that it was an “academic opportunity,” while those opposed argued that this “academic opportunity” discriminated against Palestinian students, Arab students, and students who oppose the Israeli occupation of Palestine, as they could be denied entry at the border and detained by Israeli officials. Ultimately, in a confidential vote, 14 AUS representatives voted against the course, 13 voted in favour, and nine abstained.
On February 12, AUS issued a statement via email claiming that “necessary information” was not provided or present at the council meeting of January 30. Due to the “time-sensitive” deadline for the course approval, “the decision was brought to the Executive Committee [Exec]” rather than back to council. The Exec voted in favour of the course by a slim majority. According to anonymous sources, four members of the Exec voted to overturn Legislative Council’s vote, two against, and four abstained. Arts Representatives also participated in this vote on the basis that they are paid as though they are Executives, a depart from standard procedure. Senators are also paid as though they are Executives, but they did not have a vote.
From comments made at the February 14 AUS Legislative Council, it seemed that the Arts Representatives all voted to overturn the original decision.  Sources suggest that former VP Internal Billy Kawasaki also voted in favour of overturning the Legislative Council vote. He has since resigned. At Legislative Council on February 14, AUS President Maria Thomas suggested that he resigned after feeling pressured to vote a certain way. 
The internal proceedings of the Executive vote are unclear, as they happened last minute via Facebook and Slack. Executives gave contradictory reports of their conversations when questioned during the February 14 Council meeting . While there was debate over the constitutionality of publishing Slack and Facebook communications as though they were minutes, the discussion was inconclusive. 
It was implied that Arts Representative Andrew Figueiredo, the initial motioner of POLI 339, put pressure on the Exec to overturn Legislative Council’s vote. Figueiredo admitted to having sent a member of the Exec messages asking, “is there anything I can do to get you to vote yes?” He was asked if he intended to resign by Bee Khaleeli, a member of the gallery. He said he was not.
The Secretary General, a neutral third-party observer charged with maintaining the accountability of AUS, has launched an investigation into how the Exec handled the situation. As a result, the Exec’s vote has been suspended. At Legislative Council, AUS President Maria Thomas said that the Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning (DPSLL)) had said that they would cease action if SSMU agreed. SSMU President Tre Mansdoerfer stated that SSMU would take measures to stop action based on the Exec’s vote in favour of POLI 339 as long as the DPSLL agreed. Neither SSMU nor the DPSLL has yet confirmed that they are halting action taken by the AUS Exec.
On Saturday, AUS posted a statement from the Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General on their Facebook page. The statement said that the Secretary General had been receiving information requests regarding the Exec’s vote and related Facebook chats. They went on to say that Facebook messages are not confidential according to AUS’ constitution. At Legislative Council, some said that the vote was confidential, while others said they were not aware of any such decision. According to the statement, the Secretary General concluded that the Exec did not conduct such a vote, and thus the meeting notes “are deemed public.”
According to various sources, there is mounting pressure on AUS to release screenshots of Facebook messages and Slack conversations related to the vote. The Secretary General’s statement suggests that there is no constitutional basis to not do so.

2019-04-13,McGill,Palestine,"“Occupation is a Crime; Cancel POLI 339”
On Wednesday, April 10 at around 1:30 PM, students staged a sit-in at the James Administration Building, protesting McGill’s decision to offer POLI 339. The political science course is slated to take place this summer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose Mount Scopus campus is situated on illegally-obtained Palestinian land in East Jerusalem and is in violation of international law, as per Resolution 446 of the UN Security Council. The demonstration came after a related petition was published and circulated online. At the time of this article’s publication, the petition had 359 student signatures and 14 signatures from professors. Both the petition and the protest on Wednesday outlined the ways in which McGill University has violated student democracy, is putting students at risk, and is actively “ignoring the ethical and violent ramifications of its decisions to operate, fund and promote numerous exchanges with Israeli institutions.”
The Sit-In
Shortly after the demonstration began, Interim Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Fabrice Labeau came to address the protesters. He told students that he had not read the email that had been sent to him regarding the demands of the petition, and mentioned official procedure a number of times to state why the course could not be cancelled. In an earlier account provided by the petition, it is stated that “Fabrice Labeau claimed there was no precedent for reversing a course fee approval.” (It is relevant to note that courses have been cancelled at McGill for various reasons before, and that there are channels to do so within official procedure.) The approval that Interim Deputy Provost Labeau referred to was deemed invalid by the Secretary-General of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS). Protesters then stated to Interim Deputy Provost Labeau, as well as Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) Christopher Manfredi, that if they had not read their email, it was evident the administration ultimately did not care about student concerns or democracy.
The protesters then began chants, such as “Israel is an apartheid state; 339 discriminates,” “occupation is a crime; cancel POLI 339,” “are we mad, yes you bet; Suzi can you hear us yet?” and “occupation isn’t funny; students over donor money.” The sit-in blocked the front door to the James Administration Building, causing administrators to have to use an alternate entrance. At this entrance, protesters simulated Israeli checkpoints to show administrators the discrimination and harassment Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim students would face at the Israeli border if they enrolled in POLI 339. This detainment and harassment at the Israeli border is well-documented, with numerous cases of activists being detained, as well as marginalized folks without a history of activism. In some instances, these concerns continue even after initially being granted entrance into the country.
As of now, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), Omar Shakir, is in the process of appealing the decision of the Israeli government to revoke his work permit and expel him from Israel. Shakir had previously been denied a work permit in 2016, but was eventually granted one two months later following international criticism. However, the government has used legislation passed in 2017 (the same legislation often used to deny activists entry into Israel) to provide a reason for his expulsion, accusing Shakir of promoting boycotts against the state. Throughout his tenure, Shakir has only promoted the official stance of HRW – “that businesses should halt their activities in illegal West Bank settlements” because they violate Palestinian human rights. Prior to the shutting down of the US consulate in Jerusalem and subsequently its website, the official consulate website stated that people who appear of “Arab, Middle Eastern, or Muslim origin […] may face additional, often time-consuming, and probing questioning by immigration and border authorities, or may even be denied entry into Israel or the West Bank.”
In addition to the sit-in, protesters handed out flyers to passersby, detailing the discriminatory treatment marginalized students would face at the border, the illegal occupation of Palestinian land by the Mount Scopus campus, and the donors to this course: the Gerald Schwartz & Heather Reisman Foundation, “[who] have funded scholarships for non-Israelis who enlist in the [Israeli] military.” The petition then argues that “[POLI 339] is therefore intellectually dishonest, because the source of its funding is strongly tied to the violent Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territories”. This has been described in detail by Amnesty International.
While a few people attempted to break through the protesters’ sit-in and disturb them, the students maintained their ground, and the demonstration continued. The protest went on until 5:30 PM, at which point the group disbanded.
Student Concerns
One student emphasized her concerns with the course, stating, “Israel has a well-documented history of discriminating against people of colour. [Incoming travellers have repeatedly] been detained for long hours [and] interrogated.” She went on to say, “this is McGill putting their students’ […] safety at risk. We had the student democratic results for the AUS council show that we didn’t want to fund this course, but McGill [is] still going to promote and fund the course.”
Another student echoed these concerns, saying, “[we] also need to talk about the professors who will be teaching this course: Professor Richard Schultz and Professor Harold Waller. They’re in their last years of teaching at McGill, […] and if you look through what happened in the AUS apology email and all of the information they gave us, you see an email Harold Waller sent to Maria Thomas, who’s the president of AUS, and it’s very pressuring. She even says explicitly [that she] felt pressured by that email.” The student then asked, “how did they know about these FIO [Frais Institutionnels Obligatoires (mandatory fees)] by-laws? […] On top of the fact that this is complicity in ethnic cleansing and occupation, […] you have these professors who are trying to get this to happen in ways that are not democratic and not facing any repercussions for that.”
There were also specific concerns relating to Professor Waller, with one student stating, “in his course on Israel, he has never once mentioned Palestine, which you can see on the syllabus. […] How can you teach a course on domestic Israeli politics if you don’t mention Palestine? I think that’s really key – the issue is that these professors don’t have good intentions to begin with; they’re trying to game the system, and that’s a problem.” The course in question taught by Professor Waller, POLI 437 (Politics in Israel) – as of the Fall 2017 syllabus – has a lecture on minority politics, referencing the Arab population in Israel, but not a specific lecture on Palestine.
Another activist spoke about McGill’s past and ongoing complicity in the occupation of Palestine and its continued silencing of student activists, stating, “student activists have been met with silence, co-opting of struggles, and active pushback. We refuse to continue to remain silent and inactive.”
The petition is still active and circulating, and it can be found here. Students ultimately hope to have the course cancelled, demanding “McGill University show that it values justice, international law, and its students’ safety as much as it values academic freedom by immediately cancelling this year’s POLI 339 summer course and thereby respecting the decision made by the student councillors of the AUS council.”

2019-10-21,McGill,Palestine,"SPHR Holds Its First General Meeting of the Year
Students gathered for the McGill Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) general meeting on September 26. SPHR was founded in 1999, and has been intermittently active on campus since its inception. SPHR is a non-profit, student-based organization that advocates for Palestinian people’s rights, in defiance of human rights violations, discrimination, racism, misrepresentation, and misinformation. 
SPHR’s Internal Organization
SPHR follows a non-hierarchical structure with no formal positions, allowing members to have transient roles throughout the year.
One of the topics discussed in the general meeting was the introduction of three working groups. The first working group plans to focus on campaigning, political action, solidarity work, outreach to other on-campus social justice groups, and student mobilization to support the Palestinian cause. A second working group will be in charge of materials and journalism, in terms of making leaflets, pamphlets, writing articles, and maintaining social media presence. The final working group will organize events, such as movie screenings, workshops, cultural nights, and hummus sales, in addition to booking rooms and contacting guest speakers. Students will be allowed to take part in the organization’s activities with varying levels of commitment.
A new administrative board will also handle SSMU paperwork and communication with the Quebec Public Interest and Research Group (QPIRG). Regular internal meetings are to be held, where feedback is exchanged in order to reach “consensus-based agreements,” according to the general meeting’s conductor.
SPHR’s Presence on Campus
SPHR has been widely active on campus. In the 2015-16 academic year, it urged McGill to endorse the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, mainly focusing on boycotting and divesting from companies complicit in the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Motion Regarding Support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, put forth by the McGill BDS Action Network, was approved in the 2016 Winter General Assembly (GA) by secret ballot, with 512 votes for the motion, 357 opposed, and 14 abstentions. However, in the following online ratification process – which is unique to McGill’s procedures – the motion failed, with 53.3 per cent of students voting against it, 40.1 per cent in favour, and 6.6 per cent abstaining. There were 5,286 voters in total, which was 25.1 per cent of the electorate at the time.
Following the online ratification process in 2016, a petitioner “brought forward a reference question which [sought] to declare the BDS Motion, and similar motions, incompatible with SSMU’s by-laws, internal regulations, and legal structure more generally,” per a SSMU Judicial Board (JBoard) ruling on BDS. In 2017, BDS as a whole was then officially ruled problematic and unconstitutional by SSMU JBoard, preventing any BDS motion from being introduced by a student-run organization or endorsed by SSMU. After the JBoard rules on a case, it must be ratified by SSMU’s Board of Directors (BoD), where, in 2017, 11 out of 12 directors voted to ratify the JBoard’s decision. However, there were concerns from students that the process itself was unethical – at that time, only three SSMU executives were serving on the BoD, where four are required. Further, one legislative councillor noted that the SSMU President at the time of ratification, Muna Tojiboeva, seemed to have a conflict of interest. Tojiboeva sat on SSMU’s JBoard in 2016 when the petition was considered unconstitutional, and then voted to approve the JBoard’s ruling as a director on the BoD.
SPHR’s Presence On Campus in 2019
SPHR’s biggest campaign of 2019 was the campaign against POLI 339, which urged McGill to cancel an externally-funded, one-off exchange course with the Hebrew University in East Jerusalem about comparative Canadian and Israeli politics. The Hebrew University in East Jerusalem is on occupied Palestinian land and is in violation of international law as per Resolution 446 of the UN Security Council. SPHR members and non-members blocked and “occupied” the entrance of the James Administration building on the downtown campus and were met with hostility and ambivalence from the staff. According to one SPHR member, this campaign was a “wake-up call” to many McGill students about the struggle against Israeli colonialism and imperialism.
Community and Cultural Events
With regards to their work with other campus groups, SPHR has collaborated and worked with the Muslim Students’ Association, the McGill Syrian Students’ Association, the African Studies Students’ Association of McGill, and Independent Jewish Voices McGill – among other campus groups – to organize different events throughout the year, including a vigil for victims of the Christchurch massacre last year. During the general meeting, speakers stressed the importance of collaborating with other solidarity organizations on campus.
Cultural activities are an important aspect of SPHR’s presence on campus. According to one member, SPHR serves as a community to come back to, reflect on, and grow from. “I think that is one of its accomplishments that almost happens indirectly,” they said. “It gives you friends [and] a face to the global Palestinian rights movements that are also working with you.” Among their most popular cultural activities are homemade hummus sales, hosted in McConnell and Leacock and famous for selling out in less than a couple of hours. Along with traditionally-Palestinian hummus, students also distribute leaflets about the organization’s mission at these sales. They remind students that Palestinian existence is more than a mere political struggle and that they have deep-rooted traditions and culture, all the while “promot[ing] and protect[ing] Palestinian human rights, both locally and internationally.” 
Education and Safety with SPHR
SPHR also hosts and conducts educational workshops about a wide range of topics, including – but not limited to – the ongoing political situation in Palestine, Palestinian citizens living in Israel, ethnic cleansing, colonialism, and imperialism. They also provide workshops on pink– and green-washing tactics in Israel, as well as strategies the Israeli government uses to deny entry to activists.
Cybersecurity workshops are also hosted to emphasize the importance of maintaining anonymity as student activists. SPHR members consider anonymity to be of paramount significance. In recent years, Israeli border authorities have been relying on a blacklist website that exposes pro-Palestine and BDS activists’ full names and pictures as a means of denying entry. Students and professors are included on this website, and finding one’s picture and full name on a blacklist website through a simple Google search is harmful for school, university, or job applications, and especially dangerous for Palestinian citizens living in Palestine or visiting family. To that end, anonymity is always embedded into any event, action, and political campaign.
This Year’s Goals 
The general meeting concluded with a summary of SPHR’s goals for the coming academic year, which include organizing more direct action on campus, maintaining an active social media presence, and increasing production of leaflets, pamphlets, and banners regarding the ongoing situation in Palestine.
Students of all backgrounds can get involved with SPHR without becoming official members of the organization, or they can join the organization’s working and administrative groups. SPHR also maintains a social media presence on Facebook and Instagram, where constant political updates are posted and public events are announced. This month, SPHR will be hosting a Palestine 101 workshop on October 10, a movie night by a Palestinian filmmaker on October 11, and a workshop about pinkwashing on October 18 in collaboration with Queer History Month.
Correction: The print version of the article stated that the movie night would take place on October 17, but it was rescheduled for October 11. The Daily regrets this error.

2019-10-29,McGill,Palestine,"Coalition of Student Groups Drop Banner during McGill Open House
As approximately 7,000 prospective students and their parents arrived on campus for McGill’s Open House, a banner was dropped from the Leacock roof at 11:52 a.m., on October 20. Held in place by dozens of ballons, the banner read, “MCGILL INVESTS IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS + APARTHEID,” protesting McGill’s complicity in the climate crisis. Though the banner blew back onto the roof soon after it was dropped, it was readjusted later in the day, and remained on display until dark. It is unclear when the banner was finally taken down by security – a stark contrast to the quick removal of the “CHANGE THE NAME” banner dropped earlier this year.
“As a historically colonial institution, founded on slave trade money, you would think that McGill would make a greater effort to disentangle itself from being complicit in further infringements of both social and climate justice.” –Speech given by coalition of student groups
Later that day, beginning at 1:00 p.m., a coalition of student groups gathered in front of the Arts Building, surrounding the site of James McGill’s reinterment. The coalition, which included members of the BSN, ISA, SPHR and was organized by C-JAM, held hands and circled the monument, displaying a banner reading “Here Lies James McGill, A Racist Slaveowner.” As prospective students passed the demonstration, they continuously repeated a speech speaking to the University’s “complicity in global conflicts for profit,” highlighting their investments in militarized weapons and real estate in occupied Palestine, as well as in the oil, gas, mining, and extraction industries. Interspersed between the speeches were chants of “divest now,” “free Palestine,” and “that’s bullshit, get off it, this land is not for profit.’’
“As prospective students, you have a right to know how McGill spends your tuition money. McGill claims to be working towards sustainability but is funding climate destruction, they claim neutrality while being complicit in conflicts around the world.” –Speech given by coalition of student groups
According to student security facilitators Meg and Lucy, a member of McGill security was present for the entirety of the demonstration, but did not approach the students. The Event Coordinator for McGill’s Open House approached and questioned the students, inquiring about the motivations behind the demonstration and why they were protesting instead of “engaging directly with the administration.”
“McGill directly finances the exploitation of natural resources and the ongoing climate crisis, and maintains complicity in global conflicts for profit.” –Speech given by coalition of student groups
The weekend’s demonstrations were followed by a chalk and paint campaign run by McGill’s chapter of Greenpeace, covering the steps in front of the James Administration Building early on the morning of October 21. According to a press release by the chapter, the campaign was to “raise awareness on the intersectionality of the climate crisis,” timed to “greet the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR) at their meeting on the Senate Resolution for the Divestment from Fossil Fuels.”
Students who wish to learn more about where their tuition money is spent, and how McGill is implicated by its investments can visit mcgillinvests.in.

2020-02-26,McGill,Palestine,"IJV, SPHR, and Suzanne Weiss Call for Open Discussion on Campus
Ahead of Suzanne Weiss’ talk at Concordia, members of SPHR and IJV, as well as Weiss herself, gathered outside of the James Administration building on Monday, February 17, to call for open and free discussion of Israel-Palestine on McGill campus. Surrounded by students holding a banner that read “STAND AGAINST OPPRESSION – STAND FOR JUSTICE IN PALESTINE,” Weiss read aloud a letter addressed to Deputy Provost of Student Life and Learning Fabrice Labeau. Her speech referenced Labeau’s letter to the McGill community on December 2, 2019, and raised concerns with the “irresponsible accusations of antisemitism” following the campus debate regarding free propaganda trips to Israel. “I find no evidence of antisemitism here. What I see is a passionate debate on the politics of Israel-Palestine,” Weiss said, voicing her “alarm” with the “unfounded charges of antisemitism.” Weiss added that the suppression of these discussions “put[s] Jewish people at risk by weakening our ability to focus on genuine acts of antisemitism,” and leaves Palestinians to “face an implacable attempt to silence them entirely.” 
Organizers with both IJV and SPHR also denounced the administration’s “attempts to stifle student activists” on campus. Speaking to the debate around the free trips, they criticized Labeau’s presentation of Jewish students as a “monolith” and his “conflation of anti-Zionism as antisemitism,” highlighting Labeau’s call for “ensuring respectful debate on campus.” Both spoke to the common ground that Palestinians and Canadian Indigenous peoples share in their “vibrant fights against settler-colonialism,” emphasizing the need for solidarity and the prevention of “willful ignorance” on campus.
After directing their words towards the James Administration building, members of SPHR and IJV presented Weiss with a keffiyeh from Palestine. Followed by both groups and attendants of the demonstration, Weiss entered the lobby to present Labeau with a physical copy of her letter. While the group waited, chants of “Solidarité avec la Palestine” continued. Eventually, Labeau’s secretary agreed to see Weiss, but only if the rest of the gathered students left the building and waited outside. Initially, security refused to let anyone besides Weiss remain in the building, and IJV and SPHR had to request multiple times that one person stay to assist her, as she is hard of hearing. Though Weiss was originally told she would be able to meet with Labeau in his office, she instead was met by his secretary and communications coordinator, and was not allowed past the lobby.
Weiss was successful in delivering the letter, and although she did not get to hand it to Labeau personally, she affirmed that she made her feelings clear to the administration. She exited the building back into the Community Square to cheers from the demonstrators. As the group dispersed, Weiss thanked the gathered students for attending, commending their efforts to fight for the rights of Palestinians and Indigenous peoples of Canada.

2020-02-26,McGill,Palestine,"On February 18, Holocaust survivor and social activist Suzanne Weiss spoke at Concordia University about her life, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Islamophobia, and the climate crisis.
“Back in 1942, Adolf Hitler marked me down for death. I was only one year old. Why did Hitler want to kill me?’’ Weiss started her speech by recalling the first time her life was at risk. Born into a Jewish family in Paris in Nazi-occupied France, she answered the question herself: “Because he was a racist, a white supremacist.”
It took her several decades to find out how she was saved: “There was a civilian resistance which obstructed the Nazi rule and provided refuge for thousands of Jews, including me,” she told the attendees, adding, “It was also a multitude of individuals who helped [in various ways]. A multitude of small individual acts of courage and kindness forged a chain of solidarity across the country, which helped defeat the Nazis.” Her parents did not survive – Weiss’ mother was deported to Auschwitz, while her father died of war wounds, leaving her an orphan.
After the liberation of France, at age nine she was adopted by a Jewish American family in New York. Her stepfather had a narrow view of women, believing their destiny was to “find a mate, marry, and take care of [their] husband and household and their children.” She rejected this stereotype, and at age 17, she left home and took refuge with a girlfriend. Weiss recalled, “It was illegal for a girl of my age to leave home without permission. My parents had me arrested and charged my girlfriend’s mother for influencing me to be a lesbian!”
Weiss has recently published a memoir, Holocaust to Resistance, My Journey. Abigail B. Bakan, a professor of social justice education at the University of Toronto, has called it “a page-turning narrative about her remarkable life of survival, resistance and solidarity,” asking “everyone who wants to change the world” to read the book.
At the age of 17, Weiss became a social activist. She has engaged with the Black Power movement, the women’s liberation movement, the Labor Union Movement, and the Cuban Revolution. She also became an advocate for peace during the Vietnam War and a justice supporter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Weiss said “The mass movements of those years profoundly changed society. All the different movements were allied and had a collective impact. Today, we call it intersectionalism.”
The event was organized by the Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV), a grassroots organization grounded in Jewish tradition that opposes all forms of racism and advocates for justice and peace in Israel-Palestine. IJV has active branches at Concordia and McGill.
Weiss believes that Israeli Jewish people and Palestinians are both victims: “The victims of one great historic injustice, the Jews, themselves became the agents of an inflicting injustice on an indigenous innocent population, the Palestinians.” She added that Palestinians have found allies among Indigenous peoples of Canada, whose land was stolen through a similar process of colonialism. In Weiss’ words, “Palestinians and natives of Turtle Island, they have been both colonized and subjected to ethnic cleansing.”
Drawing a parallel with the apartheid regime in South Africa, Weiss reminded attendees how the racist system in South Africa collapsed: “a global boycott contributed to the non-violent outcome, an agreement seeking racial justice and reconciliation.” Similarly, she said, we need to achieve peace and justice in Palestine through nonviolent methods of persuasion, boycott, divestment, and sanctions, or BDS.
She expressed her deep concern about a new rise of antisemitism, a hatred of Jewish people, but she emphasized, “Antisemitism is not caused by Palestinians. Hatred of Jews is a form of racism, deeply rooted in European society and closely linked to white supremacy. We need to reject racism.”
Weiss noted the importance of defining antisemitism properly. On January 28, 2020, a motion to have Montreal adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism was withdrawn when Montreal mayor Valérie Plante proposed to further study the matter. Weiss summarized this as, “The city of Montreal was asked to officially state that antisemitism means undue criticism of Israel. The city council said no! Well done!” In contrast to the IHRA definition, IJV defines antisemitism as hostility, prejudice, or discrimination against Jewish people because they are Jewish people, stating that the vital battle against antisemitism is undermined whenever opposition to Israeli government policies is automatically branded as antisemitic.
Weiss emphasized the catastrophic risk of racism in view of the climate crisis, saying, “The victims of the climate crisis are mostly people of colour in the Global South. The racists have an answer: build walls, keep them out. If racism and climate barbarism triumph, they will infect and poison every aspect of our lives and destroy our world.” The phrase “climate barbarism” was coined by Canadian author, social activist, and filmmaker Naomi Klein, to refer to the combination of white supremacist violence and vicious anti-immigrant actions.
When asked about her view on Islamophobia, Weiss replied, “The Muslims helped us in France […] They gave us garments and all kinds of help. […] The move against the Muslims now in this society is part of white supremacy.” She stated that Muslims are being targeted just like Jewish people, people of colour and immigrants, arguing, it is important to unite against white supremacy rather than turning against each other.
IJV Canada will be co-hosting an event with SPHR McGill on February 25, where anti-occupation activist Zohar Chamberlain Regev will speak on her work with Freedom Flotilla Coalition and the 2020 Gaza Freedom Flotilla. IJV will also co-organize a movie and pizza night on February 26 at McGill, screening Junction 48, an award-winning movie about young Palestinians in the city of Lod.

2021-03-15,McGill,Palestine,"Policy passed to the Board of Directors to be ratified
On Tuesday, February 16, SSMU held its Winter 2021 General Assembly. Remarkably, the GA reached its quorum of 350 people and, for part of the meeting, held official GA status, meaning that any votes during those portions of the meeting would be binding. The most time consuming topic of discussion was the Motion Regarding the Adoption of the Divest for Human Rights Policy, which was submitted by petition. The motion sought to “expand the SSMU’s commitment to leadership on matters of social justice and human rights by establishing” a campaign urging McGill to divest from companies “which enable and profit from multiple forms of systemic violence, including settler-colonial land theft, environmental destruction, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.” The corporations listed in the appendix of the motion are TC Energy Corporation (and therefore the Coastal GasLink Pipeline), Lockheed Martin, Re/Max, Oshkosh Corporation, Puma, Foot Locker, Nordstrom, and Kohl’s. 
The motion generated much discussion from attendees of the General Assembly, both in favour of and against its contents. Most controversial was the topic of divestment from Re/Max, which the motions states “sells real estate in illegal Israeli settlements on stolen Palestinian land, thereby facilitating and profiting from the transfer of Israeli settlers into occupied Palestinian territory by the Israeli government,” and Oshkosh Corporation, “whose vehicles are used to transport the soldiers and weapons of the Israeli military.” Discussion lasted for approximately two and half hours. Though the motion focused on military activity and the corporations’ operations on Palestinian land, much of the discussion centred concerns that a divestment campaign would lead to an increase in antisemitism on campus, due to a belief that the motion specifically targeted Israel. Multiple attendees, including VP University Affairs Brooklyn Frizzle, responded by explaining that the motion targeted specific corporations and not nations as a whole. 
The assembly moved to vote on the motion at approximately 9:00 p.m. EST. At this time, a number of participants left the GA, therefore causing the loss of quorum and turning the assembly into a consultative forum, meaning that votes would not be binding and the motion would have to be passed to the Legislative Council. Upon voting, the motion passed and was tabled to be discussed at the following week’s Legislative Council meeting. 
During the February 25 Legislative Council meeting, the motion was presented by VP External Ayo Ogunremi, who explained that the motion is intended to expand SSMU’s commitment to social justice and human rights by participating in divestment campaigns concerning several companies in which McGill is invested. He also noted that the “significant” amount of interest which students showed in the motion was important for SSMU representatives to consider while voting on the motion. 
Following Ogunremi’s introduction was a question period, which began with Management Representative Noah Gundermann asking movers of the motion to identify who they consulted in creating the motion. Maya Garfinkel, who moved the motion by petition, responded that the motion’s creators began their consultations by discussing with students, SSMU representatives, and student organizations such as Divest McGill and Climate Justice Action McGill (CJAM). Ogunremi added that the “Consultations Completed” section of the motion specifies that consultations were conducted with SSMU’s Governance Manager, President, and Communications Manager. He also stated that the motion had been reviewed and endorsed by SSMU’s Student Equity Committee.
Gundermann further questioned Ogunremi and Garfinkel, asking whether members of McGill administration or human rights experts had been consulted on the motion. According to Ogunremi, no McGill administrators were consulted, and though there was no “direct consultation” with human rights experts, sources and testimony from such experts are cited within the motion. Garfinkel claimed that there is precedent for approving similar policies despite a lack of consultation with McGill administration or human rights experts: the “Motion Regarding a Policy on Harmful Military Technology” had been passed at the Legislative Council just two weeks prior, without movers being questioned about such consultations, she pointed out. 
The debate period for the motion began with a pre-recorded statement from a student. The speaker asserted that the motion “creates a false and misleading parallel between the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict and human rights concerns worldwide.” They claimed that the other countries mentioned in the motion are “incomparable” to Israel, and characterized the “anti-Zionist elements” of the clauses concerning Israel as antisemitic. The student further argued that the motion was associated with the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement, making it a “fundamental violation of SSMU’s commitment to leadership in matters of human rights and social justice.” They speculated that the adoption of the motion would “jeopardize the safety and well-being of students,” claiming that Jewish students on campus saw an increase in antisemitism “following the many anti-Israel occurrences at McGill.”
Members of the Legislative Council expressed concern over the motion’s political content. Medical Representative Benson Wan explained that he felt the motion violated the Medical Student Society’s (MSS) Policy on General Council Positions and Press Releases, which holds that MSS representatives must survey members of the MSS via referendum or general assembly before taking political positions. Arts Representative Libby Williamson claimed that she had spoken to many constituents who felt that SSMU was neglecting student concerns by focusing on political issues. Additionally, Williamson characterized the motion as controversial, and claimed that divestment from Israel is unjustified: “the clauses that focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict attempt to create parallels between Israel and Palestine and other human rights concerns worldwide. [These parallels] do not exist and are harmful to imply.” Similarly, Dentistry Representative Tom Lee claimed that his constituents were largely opposed to the motion, on the grounds that it “disproportionately focuses on Israeli-Palestinian conflicts,” and may set a precedent for SSMU supporting the BDS movement. 
However, Frizzle claimed that they had never seen students with a higher level of engagement or interest than in the passage of this motion. “As democratic representatives, our mandate is clear: this is a policy represented by the membership […] I believe it is our responsibility as councillors not to be swayed by what I see as misinformation.” Likewise, Ogunremi described student interest in the motion as “extraordinary,” and said that SSMU executives have a responsibility to support marginalized communities from across the world. Member of the gallery Simone Bobrow expressed frustration with the claim that the motion was irrelevant to student concerns, saying that Palestinian students “have faced discrimination on campus as a result of [the Israel-Palestine] conflict.”
Councillor Gundermann also expressed opposition to the motion. He claimed that SSMU has no reason to divest from Lockheed-Martin – which the motion identifies as “the developer of weapons […] that has been used in violent conflicts in over 15 countries –” because the purchase of weapons should be “in the hands of governments.” He also took issue with divestment from the Oshkosh corporation, claiming that Oshkosh has been “internationally recognized as ethical,” and ultimately characterized the motion as “misleading and biased.” 
Supporters of the motion argued that it was not intended to perpetuate antisemitism or single out the state of Israel. Mover Noah Fisher said that the motion should not be interpreted as denouncing the state of Israel as a whole, as it only focuses on Re/max’s use of occupied Palestinian territory and not the entire state. “I find it insulting to suggest that the main way to oppose [antisemitism] is to fight individuals who are simply trying to end an occupation. I can guarantee that most of the instances of antisemitism that I’ve experienced, if not all of them, have not involved individuals trying to end an occupation,” he said, explaining that opposing human rights efforts would not help to combat antisemitism on campus. Similarly, Frizzle noted that the motion does not contain references to any individual nation, nor to Israeli corporations. Member of the gallery Ghida Malawi pointed out that the motion has no affiliation with BDS, and expressed frustration that councillors were conflating BDS with antisemitism. She also asked why councillors were claiming that Israel had been singled out, when human rights violations in other countries were also cited in the motion.
Garfinkel also spoke about her experiences with antisemitism: “As a Jewish student, the antisemitism that I’m concerned about is not coming from movements like [the motion and BDS].” She also said that “criticizing the occupation [of Palestine] is not the same as criticizing Israel’s right to exist.” She characterized some councillor’s treatments of the motion as insulting, and asked, “What claim for Palestinian human rights would this legislative council not take issue with?”
Clubs Representative Hussain Awan further expressed support for the motion, and said that he had been “dumbfounded” by some criticisms of the motion. He argued that portraying movers of the motion as “closeted BDS activists” was “wild speculation,” and further explained that he had seen much student interest in the many human rights issues addressed by the motion. 
After about one and a half hours of discussion, the motion was put to a vote. With 21 members in favor of the motion, 5 opposed, and 3 abstaining, the motion was passed.
A previous edition of this article erroneously stated that the policy had been adopted – in fact, the policy had not been adopted, but rather moved to the SSMU Board of Directors to be ratified. Additionally, the motion linked in the article was not the motion presented to Legislative Council, but rather an older version of the motion. The Daily regrets this error.

2021-11-15,McGill,Palestine,"Despite the rain and cold on Friday, November 12, students and activists gathered at the Roddick Gates in a rally concluding BDS (Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions) Week, hosted by the McGill and Concordia chapters of Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR). Demonstrators spoke about the ongoing occupation of Palestine, chanting, “Free, free Palestine.”
Organizers from Palestinian and Jewish Unity (PAJU) distributed pamphlets detailing the purpose of the BDS Movement. “Resist the systemic inequality and discrimination of Israel Apartheid,” the cover read, alongside the slogan “Boycottons Israël!” The BDS Movement aims to put financial pressure on corporations involved in the occupation of Palestine.
Sabine Friesinger, who was president of the Concordia Student Union when Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, was invited to speak at the university in 2001, attended the rally. “Public institutions should be held accountable for their [financial] ties, and if they have ties with apartheid regimes like Israel, they should cut those ties in solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she said.

2021-11-15,McGill,Palestine,"From November 8 through November 13, Students in Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill and SPHR Concordia hosted a series of events for Boycott, Divestments, and Sanctions (BDS) week. 
The week’s events started on Monday evening, with a screening and discussion of the film Grey, Black and Blue by Karam Abu Ali. The screening was held at J.A. de Sève Cinema at Concordia University. 
The following evening, organizers from SPHR McGill, SPHR Concordia, and Palestine Youth Movement led a “Palestine and BDS 101” workshop at Concordia University. Presenters organized the workshop into four sections: (1) defining concepts, (2) the region’s history, (3) contemporary oppression of Palestinian people, and (4) forms of resistance. Attendees were encouraged to ask questions, share ideas, and learn from one another. 
In defining concepts, presenters highlighted the importance of looking at Palestine through a conceptual framework. Specifically, they emphasized that individual atrocities must be examined as part of the larger system of settler colonialism, occupation, and apartheid. Presenters further outlined the importance of language in discussing Palestine – terms like “conflict” and “occupation” used in discussion fail to recognize the unequal distribution of power between Palestine and Israel. Describing Israel’s violence as an act of “ethnic cleansing” and “settler colonialism” is more appropriate, according to presenters. 
Presenters also discussed historical and contemporary definitions of “Zionism,” highlighting the ways in which the ideology is inextricably linked with settler colonialism. In the creation of Israel in the late 1940s, presenters said, evidence of imperialist efforts to select land show a clear intention to dislocate Arab people. They highlighted that this is in line with settler colonialism’s logic of elimination (via confrontation, carceration, and assimilation), which ultimately dispossesses Indigenous people of their lands. 
Presenters then dived into Palestine’s history, starting with the 1947 Partition Plan, which called for the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, and the 1948 Plan Dalet which outlined a plan for the ethnic cleansing of Arab people in the region. Nakba Day in 1948 was then discussed, the day that the state of Israel declared their so-called independence. The “nakba,” Arabic for catastrophe, refers to the consequent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the land and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages, as outlined by presenters. They pointed to a clear difference in the Israeli narrative vs. the Palestinian narrative that resulted from the state’s creation; the former frames the events as a civil war that resulted in independence, while the latter views the events as catastrophic nakba that resulted in ethnic cleansing. Discussion was also prompted by attendees concerning the importance of seeing Nakba not as a historical event, but recognizing that settler colonialism in Palestine is an ongoing process; the nakba continues to this day. The presenters then outlined the 1967 war between Israel and neighbouring states, the subsequent Intifadas, and the Oslo Accords. 
Next, presenters delved into the contemporary systems today used to stifle Palestinian voices and threaten their livelihood. Apartheid, which describes a system of racial dicrimination, is used in the state of Israel to deny Palestianians of many rights. Presenters highlighted the use of checkpoints, which impose control over Palestinian movement; settlements, through which Palestinians are violently expelled in favor of new development; the Separation Wall, which cuts through Palestinian communities; and incarceration, which targets specific individuals and systematically denies them of autonomy. 
Lastly, presenters outlined forms of resistance to the Israeli settler-state, primarily the BDS movement. Part of a long heritage of non-violent Palestinian resistance, the BDS movement is borrowed from the South African model of the ‘80s and ‘90s. Presenters also highlighted the importance of academic boycotts, which for students means boycotting university exchanges, relationships, and joint research with Israeli institutions. Next, McGill’s investment in the Israeli state was discussed, specifically its investment in RE/MAX and Oshkosh, its memorandum of understanding with Technion, and its exchange programs with four Israeli universities. Pro-Palestine activism at McGill is often met with resistance and roadblocks. Notably, last winter the proposed Motion Regarding the Adoption of the Divest for Human Rights Policy was very divisive within SSMU; many were reluctant to pass the motion, seeing as it outlined divestment from many companies profiting from Palestine’s occupation. In a legislative council meeting discussing the motion, it was implied that SSMU cannot support BDS as it is allegedly a “fundamental violation of SSMU’s commitment to leadership in matters of human rights and social justice.” After the presentation, attendees were invited to ask questions and participate in discussion. 
On Wednesday, organizers hosted an event at Abo hadi Restaurant. Attendees were invited to eat Palestinian food,  listen to Palestinian music,  dance, and socialize free of charge. The week concluded with the “Students Speak-out for Palestine” event; see page seven for coverage of this demonstration.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Separation Wall separated the East and West Bank. The article has been updated to be more accurate.

2022-03-28,McGill,Palestine,"Students rally outside James Administration for Palestine Solidarity Policy
On March 25, students gathered in front of the James Administration Building in response to a Media Relations Office (MRO) email sent by Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau on March 24 titled “SSMU referendum outcome.” In the announcement, Labeau expressed disappointment in the adoption of the Palestine Solidarity Policy and threatened to dissolve the university’s Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU). In a written press release, rally organizers expressed that “we cannot stay silent while the McGill administration attempts to blackmail our student union, and crush the democratic will of our student body!”
At the rally, calls for “Free, free, Palestine!,” “No peace on stolen land,” and “the students, united, will never be divided” bounced off the exterior walls of the James Administration Building, echoing through campus. Attendees waved Palestinian flags, while one individual mounted the scaffolding in front of the building’s entrance to lead the crowd in chants. Multiple speakers delivered speeches to the crowd, celebrating the passing of the Palestine Solidarity Policy, shaming the university, and encouraging SSMU to stand its ground. 
The Palestine Solidarity Policy was passed in the most recent SSMU referendum, announced March 21. The policy mandates that SSMU boycott corporations complicit in settler-colonial apartheid against Palestinians and advocate for the university to do the same, that SSMU campaign for the university to publicly condemn Canary Mission and other surveillance or smear campaigns against Palestinian and pro-Palestinian students, and that SSMU form a Palestine Solidarity Comittee, among other points. The referendum received a 71.4 per cent “yes” vote, meaning it was passed with a supermajority. 
“It’s the first initiative to actually represent and make Palestinian activists and their allies feel seen and supported on campus,” commented Erin*, an SPHR member, on the policy. They continued to tell the Daily that it’s the bare minimum that Palestinian activists are emboldened to “advocate without fear of repurcussions, fear of falling to a smear campaign, or just being blatantly doxxed.” 
In the MRO announcement, Labeau claimed that the policy echoes the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. He continued to characterize it “as an initiative that can only bring more division to our community,” arguing that the policy will “create excessive polarization in our community, encourage a culture of ostracization and disrespect due to students’ identity,” and is “in contradiction with the university’s values of inclusion, diversity, and respect.” 
“I’d like to draw attention back to our policy and ask where exactly in that policy do we threaten Jewish identity,” Erin commented, “where we promote discrimination, and how sanctioning [and] divesting from companies complicit in settler colonialism is going to affect students on campus.”
Furthermore, Labeau claimed that the initiatives described in the policy are “in contradiction with the principles expressed by SSMU in its own constitution.” He explained that he had communicated this to SSMU leadership and “advised them to take prompt and appropriate remedial action.” At the March 24 Legislative Council meeting, SSMU President Darshan Daryanani, who was unable to attend live, shared a message with the council explaining that Labeau had sent him a Notice of Default on March 22 in regard to the MoA. According to article 12.2 of the MoA, in the event of such a default, the defaulting party has 30 working days to “remedy such default.” 
In his notice, Labeau allegedly claimed that “in no way can such a policy be considered to ‘facilitate communication and interaction between all students from all McGill communities’ or to ‘act in the best interests of [SSMU’s] Members as a whole.’ It will also clearly lead to discrimination based on characteristics such as race, national or ethnic origin, and religion.” Daryanani commented that “[SSMU] requires a certain degree of autonomy to effectively carry out our roles, and we fear that the statement made by McGill University severely encroaches on this ability.” 
“Democracy that McGill has championed so much ends where discourse that challenges the administration begins,” said Erin. “That’s such a fucked up, fragile demonstration of democracy […] it reveals that McGill does not actually champion democracy, but only extends it to narratives that don’t threaten its position,” they continued.
In the MRO, Labeau further communicated that if SSMU leadership fails to “take prompt and appropriate remedial action […] the University will terminate this Memorandum of Agreement.” Daryanani comments that the threat to terminate the MoA is of “particular concern.” The MoA allows SSMU to work alongside the university on many matters, namely the assessment and collection of fees from students and the operation of university accounts for such fees. Essentially, the termination of the MoA would prevent SSMU from receiving the fees that it currently solicits. 
“Anything that can actually bring some form of representation to Palestinians is deemed as controversial […] it’s ridiculous,” says Erin. According to them, the terms outlined in the policy are necessary, “and for McGill to condemn that […] and for that to be conflated with antisemitism, [it is] very clear on McGill’s part that it’s willing to do absolutely nothing for Palestinian students on campus.”

2022-04-04,McGill,Palestine,"Canadian universities see “renewed momentum” in pro-Palestine activism
Over the past month, student unions at a handful of major Canadian universities have established pro-Palestine policies, often to the chagrin of university administrators. While such policies are passed in student-led, democratic forums, administrators at these universities have attempted to intervene in student affairs on the grounds that advocating for divestment from companies complicit in Israeli apartheid will lead to divisiveness and discrimination within university communities. In light of this, the Daily examined administrators’ responses to pro-Palestine policies recently passed in student unions at McGill, the University of Toronto (UofT), and the University of British Columbia (UBC).
The history of pro-Palestine policies within SSMU is a tumultuous one: in the Winter 2016 General Assembly (GA), a motion mandating SSMU’s support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement was passed in the initial round of voting, only to fail the subsequent online ratification process. Following the nullification of this motion, an anonymous student filed a Judicial Board (JBoard) petition inquiring into its constitutionality; in May of 2016, the JBoard came to the unanimous decision that “all motions which compel SSMU to actively campaign against specific countries are unconstitutional” – including motions in support of BDS. Despite this, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill has continued to campaign for divestment from corporations complicit in settler-colonial apartheid against Palestinians; the passage of the Palestine Solidarity Policy (PSP) in SSMU’s Winter 2022 Referendum was to be their latest victory.
The Policy had initially been absent from the referendum ballot following a notice from Elections SSMU that the JBoard issued an interim order prohibiting the PSP from being placed on the ballot “until such time a legal determination [could] be made,” per a March 13 email sent from Elections SSMU to Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights McGill (SPHR). The following afternoon, Elections SSMU issued a statement explaining that the referendum ballot was “declared faulty and incomplete” – when the ballot was re-issued on Tuesday, March 15, the PSP was present, and later passed with 71.1 per cent of votes in favour.
The PSP, which SPHR described as “historic,” outlines nine action items, including the mandates that: 1) SSMU campaign for McGill to condemn Canary Mission and other surveillance campaigns against Palestinian and pro-Palestine students; 2) SSMU boycott “corporations and institutions complicit in settler-colonial apartheid against Palestinians,” and advocate for McGill to do so as well; and 3) SSMU establish a Palestine Solidarity Committee. In their statement regarding the passage of the PSP, SPHR observed that “Time and time again, [Palestinian students’] activism has been met with censorship, blacklisting, and repression from an openly hostile McGill Administration” over the past two decades of pro-Palestine advocacy at McGill. 
As if on cue, the PSP was met with strong opposition from McGill Administration just three days later: on Thursday, March 24, Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau issued an email with the subject line “SSMU referendum outcome” via the Media Relations Office (MRO). Labeau expressed disappointment in the policy – which he said “calls for several actions that echo key tenets” of the BDS Movement, although the PSP makes no mention of BDS – referencing the recent development of the “Initiative to Prevent Anti-Semitism [sic] and Islamophobia.”  He continued that initiatives like the PSP “create excessive polarization in our community” and are “in contradiction with the principles expressed by SSMU in its own constitution.” The Daily asked the MRO whether Labeau had any student testimonials or data verifying the claim that the PSP would divide the McGill community; the university did not provide evidence substantiating this claim. In response to the Daily’s inquiry as to which specific part of the SSMU constitution was violated, McGill merely repeated that initiatives like the PSP are “in contradiction with the principles expressed by SSMU in its own constitution.”
Labeau also said that the university had “communicated [his] concerns to the SSMU leadership and advised them to take […] remedial action,” and divulged that the university is prepared to terminate its Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with SSMU. According to Article 12 of the MoA, the University may default the MoA “when the Association [i.e., SSMU] violates its constitution;” SSMU would be given 30 working days to remedy the default in the event of this happening. However, 2019-2020 SSMU President Bryan Buraga emailed SSMU Directors, Councillors, and Executives just under two hours after Labeau sent his MRO to explain that a default would not enable the university to “unilaterally dissolve the SSMU.” Buraga pointed out that in accordance with Article 12.3 of the MoA, SSMU could dispute arbitration within 90 days of receiving notice of the default. Furthermore, Articles 13.2 and 13.3 of the MoA and Sections 53 and 55 of the Act respecting the accreditation and financing of students’ associations mandate McGill to collect and distribute SSMU funds – termination of the MoA would make SSMU’s financial processes more cumbersome, but would not pose an existential threat to the Society, per Buraga.
According to current SSMU President Darshan Daryanani, McGill did not communicate its disapproval of the Policy prior to providing the Notice of Default: “The McGill Administration failed to engage with the SSMU with more consideration for the democratic and constitutional values of the Society,” Daryanani wrote in an email to the Daily. The statement sent to the Daily by the MRO says that the university “has communicated [its] concerns to the SSMU leadership,” but does not specify whether the university reached out to SSMU regarding the PSP prior to threatening a notice of default. Per Daryanani, Labeau’s Notice of Default states that “in no way can [the PSP] be considered to ‘facilitate communication and interaction between all students from all McGill communities’ or to ‘act in the best interests of [SSMUʼs] Members as a whole.’ It will also clearly lead to discrimination based on characteristics such as race, national or ethnic origin, and religion.” Daryanani does not appear to believe that the PSP violates SSMU’s Constitution, writing that it is the constitutional obligation of student representatives “to uphold matters of human rights, environmental protection and social justice.”
During the March 24 Legislative Council meeting, Councillors passed the “Motion Regarding Statement by SSMU in Response to MRO 2022-03-24,” which mandates SSMU to draft a public response to Labeau’s MRO as swiftly as possible. Arts Representative Yara Coussa, who told the Daily she is advocating for SSMU to contest the Notice of Default, is leading this initiative. Daryanani said that SSMU’s response is set to be released on April 5, pending approval from SSMU’s legal counsel.
The University of Toronto Students’ Union (UTSU) has likewise had its controversies surrounding pro-BDS initiatives. In July of 2015, the UTSU Board of Directors (BoD) voted against the formation of a BDS committee, as reported in The Varsity. More recently, on February 16, the UTSU approved a motion to divest from firms complicit in the occupation of Palestinian territory following a lengthy and heated debate. Afterwards, the UTSU released a statement affirming that they would support Palestinian students “in a manner that unequivocally condemns anti-Semitism [sic], Islamophobia, and systemic oppression in all its forms.” According to this statement, the Special General Meeting wherein the motion was passed was meant to clear up “what precisely was meant by the terms used in the motion,” but there was not an opportunity to do so – as such, how the motion will impact UofT students remains to be seen.
On February 16, the University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU)  voted to reject recommendations made by UofT’s Complaint and Resolution Council for Student Societies (CRCSS) regarding the Union’s BDS caucus. In February of 2021, the CRCSS reviewed the caucus due to allegations of antisemitism and found that it violated the Union’s Anti-Discrimination Policy “on the grounds of discrimination based on nationality.” In a statement to the Daily, the UTGSU wrote that it “believes that the caucus is not discriminatory, but rather that it calls for equity through activism to support Palestinians who are facing oppression.” Furthermore, the Union contends that the CRCSS itself is undemocratic, writing that it was created “to infringe upon student union autonomy without the consent of the UTGSU.”
In response to the UTGSU’s rejection of the CRCSS recommendations, UofT decided to withhold student fees allocated to the BDS caucus – $10,918 total, according to a news article which UofT sent the Daily. Per the UTGSU, the consequences of withholding these fees will likely not be felt until the summer semester, but “it sets a dangerous precedent […] for universities to overrule democratically-decided student union decisions that they don’t like.” The UTGSU is working to strengthen solidarity among student unions, and encouraged McGill’s student unions to join the Global Student Government coalition in its email to the Daily. “A divided student movement makes it easier for university administrations to infringe upon student union autonomy and weaken the student voice. We cannot afford to be isolationist,” the Union explained.
On March 23, the Alma Mater Society (AMS) Council voted “yes” to a motion mandating the Council to “urge [UBC] to divest from companies involved in or complicit in human rights violations against Palestinians.” AMS declined to respond to the Daily’s request for comment; the Daily also reached out to the UBC chapter of SPHR, but did not receive a response.
In an email statement to the Daily, UBC wrote that the university “does not invest directly in individual stocks or companies,” instead investing in “pooled funds and external fund managers” in accordance with principles “based on the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment.” However, the statement continues to explain that “the aggregate exposure of the Endowment Portfolio to the names cited in the motion on the UN database was approximately $43,000, or 0.002% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Including the full list of companies cited in the motion, the Endowment’s aggregate exposure was less than 0.05%, or approximately $1 million.” As of writing, UBC has not attempted to intervene in the AMS decision; the university did not express any intention to interfere with the Society in its statement to the Daily.
Michael Bueckert, Vice President at Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME), wrote that there has been a “renewed momentum” in pro-Palestine activism on university campuses within the last year, pointing to the policies recently passed at McGill, Concordia, UofT, and UBC. Universities have historically repressed pro-Palestine activism, per Bueckert – for example, when Israeli Apartheid Week was brand new, administrators “bann[ed] event posters and [shut] down organizers.” Bueckert explained that such repression had seemed to subside, but there has recently been increased interference in student activism – “with a resurgence of activism, it’s not surprising to see a new wave of efforts to shut it down,” he observed.
Communications Lead for Independent Jewish Voices, Aaron Lakoff, echoed these concerns in an interview with the Daily. “It’s absolutely abhorrent when university administrations take these kinds of punitive actions,” Lakoff said, adding that universities should be celebrating vibrant student democracies and the presence of anti-racist movements on their campuses. Of McGill and UofT’s response to pro-Palestine activism on their respective campuses, Lakoff remarked, “Who is the one guilty of the divisive atmosphere when you are threatening a democratic student body and democratically-made decisions?”
Still, Bueckert and Lakoff both emphasized that students have an important role to play in anti-racist and anti-apartheid efforts. In 1985, McGill divested from its holdings in apartheid South Africa in response to student pressure; per Bueckert, student initiatives at the time included “establishing apartheid-free zones, protesting speeches by ambassadors, and implementing general anti-apartheid policies” on McGill’s campus. Likewise, Lakoff pointed out that institutions like McGill are often complicit in Israeli apartheid due to their investments in companies which profit on occupied Palestinian land – as such, “students should never underestimate the powerful and important role they can play in terms of bringing down apartheid.”
Lakoff, who is himself Jewish, said that alleging motions such as the PSP are antisemitic “ignores the fact that there are Jews all around the world […] who are standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people.” He also pointed out that universities should make an effort to protect Palestinian students from racism: if universities want to create a culture of inclusion, respect, and safety, they must consider “the safety of people of colour and Palestinian students who are attending a university that is complicit in their own people’s dispossession and complicit in apartheid.” 
Bueckert and Lakoff also expressed concern for the well-being of student democracies at the hands of administrators willing to interfere in student politics. “The fact that universities are using [financial] threats specifically to try to shut down anti-racist organizing is appalling,” Bueckert wrote, describing UofT and McGill’s behaviour as “anti-democratic and heavy-handed.” Similarly, Lakoff characterized these universities’ punitive actions as “abhorrent,” adding that these actions are “threats against student democracy and threats against the wellbeing of students and campus life.”
The Daily inquired as to why McGill chose to default its MoA with SSMU as opposed to another course of action; the university did not address this question in its statement to the Daily. Additionally, the Daily asked what Labeau feels would be an appropriate way to “address serious and important questions” such as the PSP – the university’s response only reiterates that “robust debate is key to what we do and who we are as a University.” 
Affairs related to the PSP are still developing as SSMU prepares its response to the Notice of Default; the Daily will continue to follow this story.

2022-09-19,McGill,Palestine,"Activists criticize donor for “sportswashing” Israeli colonialism
On August 31, McGill announced the establishment of a new sports science institute, made possible with a large gift from a wealthy donor – “$29-million donation is largest-ever gift to a faculty of education in Canada,” the subheading of the press release boasted. Indeed, Sylvan Adams – the billionaire behind the eponymous Sylvan Adams Sports Science Institute (SASSI) – has spent millions of dollars on educational ventures in Israel and Canada over the past several years. In 2017, Adams funded a similar institute for Tel Aviv University (TAU): the Sylvan Adams Sports Institute. Both establishments tout innovative approaches to sports science, focusing on the study of “optimal health, rather than disease” and seeking to improve the performance of elite athletes. Researchers from McGill and TAU will partner with one another in collaborative research efforts.
However, pro-Palestine activists were quick to point out Adams’ history of supporting and financing pro-Israel initiatives. During a university-led event announcing the establishment of the SASSI, writer and pro-Palestine activist Yves Engler interrupted a speech by Principal Suzanne Fortier to denounce the university’s continued suppression of pro-Palestine activism on campus: “Madame Fortier, do McGill students have the right to oppose Israel killing Palestinian children? Do they have the right to oppose Israeli colonialism and apartheid?” He went on to reference the Palestine Solidarity Policy, the passage of which prompted Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau to threaten termination of SSMU’s Memorandum of Agreement with McGill in May; ultimately, SSMU’s Board of Directors decided against ratifying the policy, and it was not adopted by the Society. Engler’s video of his interruption – which has accumulated more than 100,000 views on Twitter – ends with shaky footage of attendees averting their gaze as he is escorted out, yelling, “Free Palestine! […] You’re complicit in Israeli colonialism and violence!” As of writing, the university has not publicly acknowledged or responded to Engler’s comments.
In a phone interview with the Daily, Engler explained that interrupting the funding announcement was both an attempt to attract media attention to McGill’s complicity in Israeli apartheid, and a way of demonstrating solidarity with Palestinians and pro-Palestine activists. According to Engler, media outlets present at the announcement ignored his interruption, highlighting that The Montreal Gazette’s coverage of the announcement wholly neglected to mention his comments at the event. Still, Engler succeeded in raising awareness of the university’s response to the Palestine Solidarity Policy and Adams’ pro-Israel involvement via social media, which he believes is an important consequence of interruptions like his: “You get a message out there, but also you’re trying to have a sense of, like, there is a resistance, right? […] We don’t just allow these people in power to just get away with whatever they want to get away with.” 
In a September 1 blog post, Engler took issue with Adams funding the institute, writing that Adams has “plowed tens of millions of dollars into various sports and cultural initiatives explicitly designed to whitewash Israeli apartheid and violence.” For example, Adams organized Madonna’s Eurovision performance in Israel and helped fund a soccer tournament so that soccer superstar Lionel Messi could make an appearance in Tel Aviv. Engler told the Daily that these initiatives are “designed to basically whitewash Israeli colonialism.” Adams himself has admitted that he sees sporting events as opportunities to bolster support for Israel among those who are “generally apolitical,” and although he has described himself as Israel’s “self-appointed ambassador at large,” he claims that the work he does is not political. Engler also expressed concern over McGill’s readiness to please influential donors, remarking that universities will oppose any attempt at “meddling” in their financial investments, as has been the case with McGill’s refusal to divest from fossil fuels and its reluctance to divest from South African companies. Although universities may put on a “liberal facade” or “talk a decent game on the climate crisis,” university administrations tend to be conservative bodies that cater to fundraisers, he claimed. To illustrate this point, Engler brought up his own experience within the Concordia Student Union 20 years ago: when students protested an event where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to make a speech, the university had to “get the student activists in line, because there were donors threatening to withdraw their funds,” per Engler. 
The McGill chapter of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) shared this sentiment: in a written statement sent to the Daily, they described the announcement of SASSI as “sportswashing,” a method of distracting from a country’s human rights offenses by drawing attention to sports enterprises. A journalist from The Times of Israel asked Adams about sportswashing in a 2019 interview, to which he Adams replied that “Haters gonna hate” and explained that he feels he is showing “the real Israel.” SPHR also pointed to a handful of interviews where Adams denied Israeli apartheid, characterizing Israel as a peaceful country despite the fact that Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have found that Israel is committing apartheid against Palestinians. The statement also alluded to the university’s response to the Palestine Solidarity Policy as an example of McGill’s typical response to “students’ activism against Israeli settler colonial apartheid,” writing that McGill “runs to appease its donors while giving a big middle finger to its students.”
In an email to the Daily, McGill’s Media Relations Office (MRO) emphasized the need for respect, empathy, and inclusion when debating on campus. “Robust debate is key to what we do and who we are as a University. However, such debate cannot be carried out at the expense of respect and inclusion,” the statement continued – almost a word-for-word reiteration of what Labeau wrote in his May 24 email regarding the Palestine Solidarity Policy. The MRO email concluded by inviting students to participate in the events and activities recommended in the Initiative Against Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism (IAIAS) report; while the iaias@mcgill.ca email address is open for students to submit feedback, the statement did not specify whether this email would be an appropriate forum through which to present feedback regarding the SASSI.
When asked how he believed students should express opposition to the establishment of the SASSI, Engler said, “I think the most important thing is to protest, and what the actual mechanism of that protest is, is less important.” He added that increasing pressure from activist groups from outside the university would be key to furthering pro-Palestine messages on campus. SPHR indicated that a response from their organization is forthcoming: “rest assured that this initiative will not be left unanswered. Keep your eyes peeled because once again SPHR will not back down.”

2023-04-03,McGill,Palestine,"Students protest McGill’s ties to SASSI, among other initiatives
On Friday, March 24, students gathered on McGill’s campus for a rally against the university’s financial and academic ties to Israel. Organized by Students for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) McGill, the rally was the last in a series of events put on by SPHR McGill and other pro-Palestine groups for Montreal’s Israeli Apartheid Week. Activists from SPHR McGill, SPHR Concordia, and the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) spoke to the crowd and led students in chants of “free free Palestine,” “occupation isn’t funny, students over donor money,” and more.
Speakers drew attention to the Sylvan Adams Sports Science Institute (SASSI) project – made possible by the $29 million dollar donation of Sylvan Adams, an Israeli-Canadian billionaire and self-described “ambassador-at-large for the State of Israel.” 
“This initiative, painted as a commitment to the advancement of sports performance through academic research, constitutes a highly politicized attempt to systemically normalize colonial Zionist institutions,” said a speaker from SPHR McGill. 
The speaker pointed to the SASSI project as an instance of “sportswashing” – the practice of an individual, company, or government funding or organizing sports to improve their reputation. They also condemned the planned collaboration between McGill and Tel Aviv University over SASSI, citing Tel Aviv University’s ties to Israeli weapons manufacturers and influence in shaping Israeli policy.
“We will not stand for collaboration with the university that is a core participant in Israel’s occupation mechanism,” said the speaker. “How can we trust that our administration will feel comfortable taking stances against Israel and for the Palestinian people? How can we believe that it will not impede on student activism against Israeli apartheid when it’s receiving $29 million from someone whose explicit and proclaimed objective is to paint Israel as peaceful?”
Multiple speakers drew attention to last years’ Palestine Solidarity Policy – which earned a 71 per cent “yes” vote in a SSMU referendum and over which McGill’s administration threatened to withdraw funding from SSMU. Speakers also called on McGill students to pressure the university to divest from Israeli companies, referencing the successful student movement for divestment from South African apartheid in the 1980s as a precedent.  
“The PYM calls on the students at McGill University today to continue their fight against the administration and to continue advancing the struggle for Palestinian liberation,” said another speaker. “The divestment that happened in 1987 […] was only possible because students organized, because they got together. They collectively got together to organize and pressure the administration. And we will do the same.”
“We need to ask ourselves what allowed the occupation […] to enact this violence from 1948 to 2023 with complete impunity,” said the speaker. “It’s because of the imperial allies, like Canada and the US, who bankroll the settlements and prop up the Zionist entities. From our pension funds, to our banks, to our schools, to our libraries, bookstores, and charities, every single industry in Canada is complicit in the occupation […] McGill University is one of the many Canadian institutions that is actively normalizing and upholding the occupation’s war crimes.”
“I wish McGill would actually listen to the students rather than just think about money only – because money isn’t our future,” said Zeyna, a U0 student at McGill, to the Daily. “It’s just really unfortunate to see a big institution, in a country that prides itself on being democratic and pro-freedom, choose money over the lives of people.”
The rally marked the end of SPHR McGill’s Israeli Apartheid Week events, which included a film screening, a “Palestine 101” workshop in partnership with the PYM, and a talk by ex-Google employee Ariel Koren entitled “No Tech for Apartheid.”
“We really focus on the education aspect,” said a representative of SPHR McGill to the Daily, “but also at the same time really mobilizing and showing Palestinians on campus that we are here for them and that the fight is not over. We’re not stopping even if McGill is standing in our way. […] We’re here. We’re not going anywhere. We’re still as strong as we were last year with the Palestine Solidarity Policy. We’re not losing momentum.”
The representative encouraged concerned students to look out for SHPR tabling on campus and possible upcoming petitions against the SASSI project. They said students can get involved with SPHR by sharing their contact information in-person at tabling sessions and by following SPHR McGill on Instagram @sphrmcgill, where they post about events. Future events include a film screening and iftars for Ramadan. 
“Even if you don’t feel educated enough about the issue, please, come reach out to us,” said the SPHR representative. “We are more than happy to talk about it, really. One of the biggest myths about the genocide of Palestinians is that it’s a complicated issue. It’s really not. Come talk to us. We’re here. We also want a diversity of voices and opinions in the group. So it doesn’t matter if you’re Arab, it doesn’t matter if you’re Palestinian. There is a space for you here and we welcome you and we want you around.”
