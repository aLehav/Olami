2009-02-12,AU,study,"Expansion of AU's national prominence and improvements in alumni relations are extremely important to the university's continued growth, President Neil Kerwin said during a Kennedy Political Union event Monday.
""We need to find ways to engage alumni in the light of the university, we need to serve their needs as they progress through life, needs for career assistance, needs for lifelong learning,"" he said. ""We simply need to increase the outreach that we undertake with our alumni.""
Kerwin has been president of AU since 2005 and has been closely involved with the university since he first graduated from AU in 1971. Before his presidency, Kerwin served as the dean of the School of Public Affairs and then as the university's provost until he took over the presidency from Ben Ladner.
Kerwin discussed the need for AU to improve its reputation.
""We need professional approaches to telling this institution's story,"" he said. ""We need to make sure that when people hear the name American University they don't ask 'Gee, where is that?'""
In an effort to better market AU to the community at-large, the university is in the process of completing comprehensive market research and study. When the study is completed, AU will roll out a new marketing campaign, with the university's Web site as its centerpiece, Kerwin said.
""It will certainly have as its anchor the new Web site, which we expect to launch in March,"" he said. ""The Web is the future and a lot of the marketing we do will be fundamentally linked to that capacity.""
Kerwin said he has an optimistic vision for AU, despite the economic difficulties many universities currently face. He described the current economic crisis as extremely dangerous and worrisome, but maintained that the university was in good financial standing.
""I'm very proud of the financial condition that we find ourselves in today,"" he said. ""I'm very pleased that we have been able to develop the kind of reserves that allow us to say with confidence that this is not an institution that is confronting freezes in either hiring or salary.""
AU is financially stable, partly because 81 percent of the university's annual budget is paid through student tuition dollars while only half of one percent - totaling $2 million - comes from the schools endowment funds, The Eagle previously reported.
AU has dealt with criticism in the past for its small endowment, but it has been a benefit during this difficult economic time, during which students will continue to pay tuition costs, The Eagle previously reported. Other colleges have lost millions of dollars as their investments have decreased in value along with the global stock markets.
The night before this event, Kerwin attended an informal question-and-answer session with students in the McDowell Formal Lounge. 
Following Kerwin's speech, he took questions for an hour. Students took the opportunity to confront Kerwin with what they viewed as AU's faults. 
One student, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences' Audio Technology program, told Kerwin the program was ""embarrassing at best"" and that it was unfair for him to have to pay full tuition.
Another student discussed how SPA advisers had not helped her when she transferred from the Washington Mentorship Program. The student, who became emotional at times, said poor communication caused her to have to spend an extra semester at AU.
Throughout the speech and subsequent question and answer session, Kerwin acknowledged that the university had faults and said he hoped many would be fixed in the near future.
""You'll see during the next couple of years a serious effort to remove some of the inefficiencies, some of the frustrations that you've [students] told us about,"" he said. ""We know that making your life as simple as we can with administrative services is critically important, so that you can devote the time and attention you need to develop as scholars and people.""

2009-03-05,AU,study,"On Feb. 26, AU Abroad sent an e-mail to students to unveil its two newest programs - both of which are in India. Students now have the opportunity to study at Fergusson College in Pune or at Manipal University in Manipal. 
With more than 1,500 different recognized dialects and 24 official languages, India is the most multicultural country in the world - a fact many foreigners may find daunting, according to Ethan Merritt, an AU Abroad adviser. 
""I have never been more overwhelmed in travels abroad than when I spent time in Delhi,"" he said. ""Thousands of people are all around you, all speaking different languages and going different places.""
But after recently returning from India, Merritt and AU Abroad Director Sara Dumont said they found this high-scale diversity to be the most beautiful part of the country.
""What you get in India is a sense of what diversity really means,"" Dumont said. ""You could travel 50 miles in any direction and be in a totally different culture than where before. That's what makes it so important for Americans to be able to study there.""
Pune's Fergusson College is east of Mumbai, according to Merritt. Pune is small city compared to Mumbai, but it is known for its reputation as a young, vibrant cultural hub, housing multiple universities and India's National Film Archives and Institute.
Pune is not considered a tourist destination, according to Merritt. The Alliance for Global Education runs Fergusson's program. The Alliance is trying to limit the amount of students involved to 20, according to Dumont. Abroad students at Fergusson will live in homestays with a family, and have the option to be as involved with the family as they would like.
The second abroad program in India is held at Manipal University - one of the country's top five universities, Dumont said.
The world-renowned university is very international, and boasts degree-seeking students from more than 50 different countries. While Manipal is known for its medical and engineering curriculums, the university's Cultural Studies, Communications and International Politics departments run the study abroad program - a perfect fit for AU students, Merritt said. Manipal has a tropical climate, and is miles away from the beach. Its campus has a thriving community feel where all students and most faculty live on campus.
The two new India programs fill a void in AU Abroad, Dumont said.

2009-03-05,AU,study,"Though some colleges have begun creating three-year bachelor's degree programs in an effort to save students money, there has not been a huge amount of interest in the possibility of similar programs at AU.
A majority of undergraduate programs at U.S. universities are meant to be completed in four years, but with the economy now in a recession, the three-year bachelor's degree might soon become viewed as a widespread option for cutting costs, according to USA Today.
Marla Boren, senior academic counselor in AU's College of Arts and Sciences, said AU offers several combined bachelor's and master's degree programs that reduce the total amount of time a student is in school. Boren has not yet seen an increase in the number of students interested in graduating early, but the recession may change this, she said.
Jesse Boeding, director of undergraduate programs in the Kogod School of Business, said some students save money by graduating early in order to stop paying tuition and enter the workforce sooner.
""Whether you stay four years or three years, you're going to have to pay for the credits in some way,"" she said. ""But all of the overhead expenses of room and board and travel expenses and things like that are mitigated by re-sequencing your coursework."" 
The amount of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate credits students now come into college with have made it fairly common for them to be a semester or two ahead. Boeding said she knows of approximately 10 Kogod students who currently plan to graduate early.
Ryan Kim, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, said he will be graduating this December to save money and get a head start on graduate school. He left high school two years early to attend De Anza Community College in Cupertino, Calif., before he transferred to AU. 
""I am concerned with not getting the full 'college experience,' but hopefully attending grad school will help to offset those concerns,"" Kim said in an e-mail. 
Early graduation might interfere with study abroad or internship opportunities. Therefore, students must make tradeoffs and decide which aspects of their college career are most important to them. 
Kristen Velit, a freshman in CAS, said she would only consider the possibility of an early graduation if she could still study abroad.
""I don't think missing the [typical college experience] would be that much of a disadvantage, but I really want to go abroad and if I wasn't able to because I was going to be graduating early, that would be a disadvantage that would overshadow it,"" she said. 
Studying abroad, being involved on campus and being able to explore different disciplines through a minor or second major can provide advantages in the job market that students who graduate early may not be able to take advantage of, Boeding said. 
""I think the primary [disadvantage] is sometimes students rush through school and it becomes a check-the-box mentality,"" she said. 
Karim Abdallah, a freshman in Kogod, said he thinks it is a smarter idea to stay in school for the entire four years.
""Well, seeing how the workforce is going these days, it's better to stay in school until the crisis is over,"" he said.
In the near future, AU is unlikely to instate any undergraduate programs specifically designed to be completed in three years, Boeding said. Since the university is an accredited institution, it cannot cut down the number of credits in its bachelor's degrees to make them three-year programs. 
""I think that AU has a structure that allows students to graduate early if they want to,"" Boeding said.

2009-04-09,AU,study,"Many AU students praised President Barack Obama's recent promise to ease tense relations between Cuba and the United States.
Obama announced last week that he is searching for a ""new strategy"" for the United States to use in its relations with Cuba, especially regarding travel and trade, according to The Washington Post. He will likely reduce restrictions on Americans' ability to travel to Cuba before the mid-April Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago.
""I think it's definitely a good step forward in foreign policy, and not just in travel issues,"" said Taline Kevonian, a second year graduate student in the School of International Service.
While many Americans enter Cuba through Mexico or Canada, many more will likely visit the island if restrictions are loosened, she said.
""A lot of straight-edge people don't want to go through Mexico or Canada because the government says it is illegal,"" Kevonian said. ""But they will say, 'OK, the government isn't against Cuba, so I can go [if restrictions are lifted].'""
Katie Shankle, a junior in SIS, said she definitely opposes the embargo on Cuba yet has concerns about the process and implications of lifting the restrictions. She spent the fall 2008 semester in Havana, Cuba, studying with AU Abroad's enclave program.
""The Cubans want the embargo lifted,"" Shankle said. ""They are a poor country and need money, and the cheapest country to trade with is the United States.""
But from a historical perspective, she said lifting restrictions would alter a country where there are cars from the 1950s and buildings from before the Cuban Revolution; where there are no McDonald's restaurants on Cuban street corners and no real Chinese food restaurants.
""What I am sad to see is the Americanization of a place that is frozen in time,"" Shankle said. ""Cuba will look at the last days of what it's been like for 50 years.""
Cuba's infrastructure may also not be able to support American tourism, since the nation is very different from typical American tourist destinations and situations like power outages are common, she said.
Lifting travel restrictions may eliminate some problems Shankle said she faced in Cuba.
""When we were there, the discussion was on whether the program would survive with the restrictions,"" she said.
Americans do not have access to banks, credit cards or means of cashing checks while in Cuba, Shankle said.
The AU students who travel there could only travel outside of Havana for education purposes and could only buy education or art-related items, she said.
""We had to be very cautious bringing back T-shirts because technically we're not allowed to,"" Shankle said.
They could not have an internship or stay with a Cuban family and the classes they could attend were limited, she said.
""The United States wants to keep us in a pocket of Havana and doing exactly what they specify in classes with chosen Cuban teachers and American students,"" Shankle said.
Easier travel would come at a cost, she said.
""I'm grateful I got to see Cuban government as a closed government, pre-whatever happens before the embargo is lifted,"" Shankle said. ""It's still untouched so it's incredibly unique. It's a glimpse of a closed society and what those peoples' lives are like.""

2009-08-13,AU,study,"Confining your studying routine to the familiar shelter of Bender Library or Mary Graydon Center is a dangerous move. As an AU student, it's easy to develop the same plight as Princess Jasmine in ""Aladdin"" and remain within the palace grounds. Studying on campus is rather convenient, but beyond the quad dwells a whole new world and there's no evil Sultan keeping you from experiencing it. Hop on your magic carpet, or Metrobus or rail of your choice, and explore the plethora of alternative studying locales around D.C. at your disposal. The following places serve as a basic springboard for further off-campus studying adventures with easiest transportation routes from the AU/Tenleytown area. 
5) Sticky Fingers, 1370 Park Rd., N.W.
Best transportation route: Columbia Heights Metro, H4 bus. 
A few steps from the 14th Street core of Columbia Heights rests vegan sweet haven Sticky Fingers, an ideal spot for morning studying. Modern in its design, Sticky Fingers is a hotspot for the socially and politically conscious, as the establishment strictly abides to vegan and animal rights conditions and standards. Also a staple are killer pastries, which there's no shortage of here. From their famous sticky buns to delectable cupcakes, brownies and muffins, it's easy to flirt between sugar rush and diabetic shock. Once you're all amped up on sugar, though, Sticky Fingers has a dozen or so tables for studying or working purposes.  
4) Ebenezers Coffeehouse, 201 F St., N.E.
Best transportation route: Union Station Metro
Nestled on a quiet corner in northeast D.C. a few blocks from Union Station, Ebenezers Coffeehouse is the perfect spot for a day when you want to get far off campus. The building was purchased by the National Community Church in 2002 and extensively renovated before its 2006 opening. Not to worry, though - there's no trace of religion in the coffee. All profits of the fair trade coffeehouse go towards community outreach projects around the Capitol Hill neighborhood through the National Community Church. Aesthetically, Ebenezers has the sophisticated, sterile ambiance of a Starbucks, its exposed brick and eclectic seating arrangements make for a lively coffeehouse. Its barren basement is used for concerts and dance classes nearly every night. During the day, however, it makes for an excellent, expansive space to spread out your books and papers and dive headfirst into your work. 
3) SoHo Café, 2150 P St., N.W.
Best transportation route: Dupont Circle Metro, N buses
A hop, skip and jump away from the Circle resides SoHo Café, a quaint coffeehouse with ample pizzazz. Featuring bold colors and unique décor lining the walls, SoHo Café is an ideal destination for writing papers. The seating dynamic is tight and clustered, making it rather difficult to spread out, but ideal for getting down to business on your laptop. The café has recently acquired a liquor license, sporadically rendering it a bar hangout spot on weekend nights. During weekdays, however, SoHo boasts a fairly subdued work environment - a quick, easy retreat off campus for those in search of an afternoon studying session with a jolt of caffeine. 
2) Steam Café & Lounge, 1700 17th St., N.W.
Best transportation route: Dupont Circle Metro, N buses
Steam Café & Lounge is irrefutably the most accommodating place to study off campus, if only for its unique hours of operation. During the week, Steam is open from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. and to 3 a.m. on weekends, which is ideal if you've got a full day of studying ahead of you. The accommodating nature extends to the kitchen, too. Steam has an extensive menu that entails selections from every meal of the day, served from open to close - yes, all-day breakfast. The standard seating isn't particularly comfortable, but Steam attains its charm through the large windows that boast pleasant Dupont Circle vistas.  
1) Tryst Coffeehouse/Bar/Lounge, 2459 18th St., N.W.
Best transportation route: Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro, H4 bus
Undoubtedly the most textbook ""coffeehouse"" in terms of personality, style and setup, Tryst is a fully functioning bar, café and lounge. With a haphazard seating arrangement composed of plush armchairs, dining room tables and everything in between, Tryst exudes a busy, yet welcoming atmosphere with delicious meals and myriad caffeinated beverage options, each served with Tryst's signature side of animal crackers. Studying and working in groups can be difficult given the helter-skelter seating organization and consistently popping business. The clientele ranges from students and locals to families lost on their way to and from the zoo, so it can get quite loud at times. For those that require silence to study, look elsewhere; for those who like boisterous work environments it doesn't get much better than this.

2009-08-13,AU,study,"If you're an incoming freshman, you've probably already maxed out your credit card at Bed, Bath and Beyond to buy a new bedspread, alarm clock, trendy-looking lamp - and anything else you could have sworn you needed to go away to college. Your grandmother probably bought you a ""how-to-navigate-D.C."" travel book, equipped with Metro maps and tips on where the popular tourist spots are. But leave the fanny pack at home, dear newcomer - you're not a tourist here. D.C. is your new home for the next four years, but don't let that intimidate you. The Eagle's annual guide issue makes a great cheat sheet; we're here to prove that there is life outside of the National Mall.
Once you're settled in your dorm room, grab some of your new friends and do some exploring. Your options are certainly not limited to campus events (though those can be pretty cool). The Eagle has mapped some of the coolest spots in D.C. - for everyone from political activists to arts enthusiasts and all those in between. We've got places for you to study, museums to visit, restaurants and sports events, on campus and across D.C. 
So please, explore neighborhoods outside of Tenleytown. Places like Columbia Heights, Petworth, Bethesda and Cleveland Park have some cool things to do. Find a coffee shop to call your own, hang out at a park - and let The Eagle tell you how. 
Of course, by the end of this semester, you'll be an old pro at navigating the Metro. Come parents' weekend, you'll be able to give mom and dad the most ultimate tour of the monuments. But everyone has to start somewhere. D.C. may seem like a big, confusing place at first. A few things to remember though, stand to the right and walk on the left of the Metro escalator, there is no J Street and take note of which airport your flight leaves from (yes, that actually happens). And buses aren't scary.
Oh, and make sure you go to your classes amidst all the excitement that the city provides. Those can be interesting, too. I swear.
Welcome to AU and good luck!

2009-10-12,AU,study,"With the words of hope and spirituality the Dalai Lama brought to AU this past week, there also came the question of religion and the younger generation. As a group coming to adulthood when so much of the status quo has been questioned, are we a group able to follow faith blindly?
Our generation is one that accepts greater sexual freedom. We understand that being gay is not a decision, but rather part of a person. We desire to be colorblind. And we also face the question of whether or not religion is compatible with our modern beliefs. I’ve found that often, it feels as though being religious means being hypocritical. One cannot deny that adhering strictly to religious observances is increasingly difficult. It seems unfair for a Jewish girl in college to have to turn down a night out with friends because a restaurant can’t ensure her plate hasn’t touched meat — not to mention most restaurants within a college budget probably can’t. Being part of a certain faith should make one feel like they are part of a group, not alienate them from others. Yet many students who practice Judaism do not strictly keep kosher and consider themselves highly religious.
One could also point out that this generation’s beliefs contradict those of our religions. Christianity, for example, encourages followers to sacrifice their own well-being in order to ensure the wellbeing of others. To give without expectation is to practice faith; to accept and forgive others is to do the work of God. However, the church does not recognize gay marriage; thus, we are asked to not accept our friends in gay relationships. We are asked, in a sense, to stand against the well-being of our friends. 
When religions are morally opposed to groups of people, one must wonder if we can stand as one united group of people, hoping to do the best for everyone. It has long been true that religion has been the cause of most wars in history. One could even argue that religion is behind the wars of our political parties. Is there any hope for young Americans to practice a faith and practice what we feel is right?
I would like to think so. We are of a different mindset than many of our parents, as they are of our grandparents. There was once a time where your wedding kiss was supposed to be your first. Social norms have changed a lot since then, but religion has remained a constant — an unchanging facet of life that holds us in common with our ancestors. 
This is why it’s no surprise that religion will follow us through graduation — if faith and morality made it through the ‘70s, it can make it through anything. We will have religion as long as we take faith as it takes us: as a whole, overlooking some of our lesser characteristics.
The fact that we can practice religion that we may not agree with 100 percent gives me great hope. It shows that we have open minds; while we may not agree with all parts, we stand for what the whole stands for. The fact that our generation still practices religion — 81 percent of freshmen students at UCLA, according to a university study, shows that we are comfortable being ourselves, despite how our beliefs may be different. If our generation can keep this open-mindedness and welcome the fact that other people have different opinions, we may be in a much better place come 20 years.

2009-11-12,AU,study,"Many AU students have never heard of the College Level Examination Program — a College Board-administered test that can accelerate education at a lower price. 
The tests, more commonly referred to as CLEP exams, are catered to students who feel they have already mastered the material they would have to cover at their university. Students who take the exams have generally acquired their college-level knowledge from independent studies, advanced high school courses and on-the-job training and cultural pursuits, according to CollegeBoard.com.
The cost per credit hour at AU is $1,148. Therefore, if students pass a CLEP exam — which carries a $72 price tag — in place of a three-hour credit course, they will save $3,372. 
The exams cover 32 topics, according to CollegeBoard.com, but AU only accepts five of them as replacements for general education courses, according to Jamie J. Wyatt, assistant director of General Education. These subjects include American government, general chemistry, introduction to macroeconomics, introduction to microeconomics and introduction to sociology. The only CLEP testing center at a D.C. college is the Catholic University of America, according to the College Board Web site. 
Students must achieve a score of 75 out of 80 or higher in order to obtain the general education credit, according to the “Exam Equivalencies” undergraduate advising document. Once students have submitted their scores, the exams are forwarded to their corresponding departments for review, Wyatt said. The department faculty members then decide if the test was rigorous enough to prove the students have a firm handle on the material, thus exempting them from taking the course. 
“It takes motivation and focus to prepare for a CLEP exam. Many students would prefer not to take an examination without formal instruction,” Executive Director of CLEP Ariel Foster said. “In short, they are ‘not for everyone.’”
CLEP was established in 1967, according to Foster, and despite any financial and logistical benefits the exams may offer students, they are not well known among the AU student body. Questions about CLEP exams almost never reach Wyatt. 
“As long as I’ve been in this office, I’ve never gotten any articulation about a CLEP exam,” she said. 
In addition to testing students, College Board offers free CLEP exams to Active Duty and Reserve military personnel. Military veterans may also seek reimbursement from exam fees, according to the College Board Web site. The exam also appeals to working adults who want to obtain a degree, international students who wish to demonstrate their knowledge overseas and people changing careers.
Kristianna George, a freshman in the Kogod School of Business, said she is not familiar with the CLEP exams and would have been interested in taking them in order to save money. 
“I’ve heard about them, but I don’t really know what they are and I’ve never taken them,” she said. 
Kelsey Cadden, a sophomore in the School of International Service and the School of Public Affairs, said she had heard of getting course credits for Advanced Placement and SAT II examinations, but never for CLEP. However, she said if she had known about them, she might have tried taking one for physics, a class she currently enrolled in but also took in high school. 
“I think AU students like to take classes for their major instead of [general education courses] which have nothing to do with what they’re studying,” Cadden said.

2009-11-12,AU,study,"The planned Women’s Resource Center has ignited some debate on campus about the need for such a center.
On one side, students argue that the center will fill a void in the administration, the responsibility for which has previously fallen on a paid Student Government official and several volunteer student activists, namely the staff of Women’s Initiative. In opposition, others point out that this costly expenditure will, in some cases, create services that are already available on campus.
THOSE IN FAVOR
Former WI directors met with current WI staff Nov. 9 to discuss the debate on campus. Vanessa Mueller, former director of WI, whose term ended in spring 2008, led the meeting.
Mueller said one of the main benefits the WRC would offer is a paid professional staffer to be available to students with personal concerns.
“For example, one of the big issues our year was a lot of the [work study employees] were reporting awkward situations bordering on sexual harassment, and it was a concern because we didn’t know who we should be reporting it to,” she said. “Greek life has a person. Athletics has a person. [The Office of Multicultural Affairs] has a person. GLBTA has a person. ... There’s a clearly delineated person of contact in every one of these situations except this one.”
Mueller also recounted incidents in which students reported sexual assault to her as the WI director, though she had no formal training in rape-crisis counseling.
“[Victims] show up at your office at two in the morning because you’re there all the time,” Mueller said. “I think it’s very easy if it hasn’t happened to you to say, ‘oh there’s no need for this center.’ I can tell you there’s a need for this center here.”
The center would also ideally provide a resource library and advocacy for female professors in ensuring equal consideration for tenure, according to Mueller. 
Mueller said that she, personally, had begun to set aside $100 from each of her paychecks for the Women’s Resource Center.
“I’ve put [the money] in a fund,” Mueller said. “... And it will stay there until I have something to donate it to ... I think that there are very few students and very few groups who have been so dedicated to one single thing for so long on this campus. And when it comes true I will happily earmark this money over to the center.”
Current SG President Andy MacCracken also spoke in favor of the WRC.
“Women’s resource centers have been introduced on campuses across the country,” MacCracken said. “We’re actually pretty far behind on that curve ... You look at the data, and it’s very clear that women have some issues that tend to gravitate towards that gender ... a women’s resource center would aim to address those needs by creating a place to go [for those needs].”
THOSE OPPOSED
Robert Ruszczyk, a junior in the School of Public Affairs, said he would not support the creation of a women’s resource center as it is currently proposed.
“Mostly, it’s because from what I’ve seen the people who are setting up the WRC are aiming for it to be only a women’s resource center,” Ruszczyk said. “It’s not opened up to the general student body, and the amount of money that is being spent on it can be spent elsewhere.”
Though the voices of the opposition exist on campus, the movement against the WRC is largely fragmented in comparison with the consolidated voice of the WI. Ruszczyk attributed the lack of organization to fear of being mislabeled by opponents.
“If we organize against it, we’re labeled sexist and chauvinistic when we’re really not,” Ruszczyk said.
Zach Lancet, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, said he felt the WRC would not offer anything new to students at AU.
“We already have a lot of resource centers all around campus, and it seems like we’re just throwing money at these problems, not even defining what is actually going to go on there,” Lancet said. “In every bathroom there’s a label that says if you’ve been sexually assaulted or sexually harassed you can call a certain number, you can call Public Safety, you can call your boss, you can call the Counseling Center ... Overall, I just don’t think it’s necessary, and I think it’s a waste of funding.”
HOW IT HAPPENED 
Former SG President Joseph F. Vidulich, Mueller and former SG Chief of Staff Joseph Pavel first put forth a formal proposal for the women’s center in September 2007. 
This proposal cites the goals of the center as services and programming that fall under the four categories of “Support, Empowerment, Education and Advocacy.” It references three-pages worth of other institutions with similar centers, including two Patriot League institutions. The proposal also relates the creation of a women’s center to the mission statement of the Office of Campus Life. 
The proposal listed a few reasons why the resource center was necessary. First, it suggests that the well-attended programming put on by WI in the past could be further improved “if there were university-employed professionals who could focus exclusively on these tasks.” Next, it highlights the interest in a center demonstrated previously by both students and faculty. It then says that students often feel uncomfortable reporting sexual assault and other issues to the Student Health Center or Counseling Center and that the WRC would offer a “safe place for students to come for information and referrals.” It then addresses the fact that under the Cleary Act, AU reported only one sexual assault in the 2005-2006 school year, going on to say that student interest in such events as the Take Back the Night campaign demonstrate an ongoing desire to “address those sexual assaults that do not occur on campus or occur on other university campuses” outside the limits of the Cleary Act.
The voting to include funding for the WRC in the fiscal year 2010-2011 budget passed in 2008, according to MacCracken.
“That all happened before my term started,” MacCracken said. “My job now, as I see it, is to identify a space [for the WRC] and make sure that there’s follow-through and not just that it gets done, but that it gets done in the right way.”
Mueller said that funding for the center would take effect in May 2010 and that she hoped the facility would be ready for students next fall.

2009-11-12,AU,study,"These thoughts haven’t raced through my head since grade school.
I know this one. 
Come on — I just learned this. 
It’s on the tip of my tongue. Why can’t I remember?
I glance around the classroom. The Turkish students seem used to this. One’s muttering a mnemonic. Another’s writing, then erasing, then writing again, wearing through his test sheet with each pencil swipe. 
My eyes catch with Cassie — one of the few other Americans studying at Koç Üniversitisi in Istanbul. Her face shows the same desperate confusion as mine.
“What the F?” she mouths. “Dates?” For a moment, we share a panicked unity. Then she turns her glance back to her paper. The professor paces by, checking on us like Mrs. Snyder would in second grade.
I lower my gaze back to my paper, returning my thoughts to Justinian. Or, more accurately, to his death. My problem? I don’t remember what year that was.
I could write a whole essay about Justinian the Great. I could discuss his myriad accomplishments. He rebuilt Constantinople after the Nika Riots burned the city down. He constructed the Hagia Sofia (Greek for “Church of Holy Wisdom”) and topped it with Christendom’s largest dome. He tried to rebuild Rome’s Empire, his soldiers even marching on Rome itself.
I could put a whole discourse together just on Justinian’s death. It ended what historians call “The Early Byzantine Period” or, as it’s more romantically known, “The Golden Age of Byzantium.” Scholarly debate still rages over why the Empire began its decline after Justinian’s death. Some historians say the Empire became too reliant on autocratic leadership, and that Justinian’s nephew, Justin II, couldn’t pick up the reigns. Others point to the huge debts Justinian racked up expanding the Empire, enlarging the army, and building things like the Hagia Sofia.
In other words, I know who Justinian is. I can explain why he matters. In an AU history exam, I’d be halfway through my blue book.
But there’s no blue book on my desk. There’s a single paper, with a single blank spot, and the professor’s admonishment to use “dates.” She’s even underlined the word. Twice.
I know this one.
Is it 563? 623? It’s definitely after 500 — he hasn’t taken the throne yet. And 650? The Hagia Sofia’s older than that, isn’t it? I’m getting closer.
I know this one.
But I don’t. I grimace, scrawling my answer: 
“Justinian’s Death: c. 600”
A fine ballpark figure for a first-draft essay. But for this test? It’s not going to suffice. I mentally subtract two points from my possible score and move on.
A few days after my Istanbul history brain-freeze (and after I’ve Googled Justinian’s death — it’s 565, by the way) I have lunch with Hilal Eryilmaz, a chemistry student at Koç, as well as one of the school’s few scholarship students. 
Eryilmaz has never understood why I study history. When we first met, I tried to explain history’s allure. The study of man’s inherent drama, the understanding of why things are the way they are — I told her I found these things fascinating. I couldn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t study history.
“That stuff is interesting,” she said. “But I don’t like remembering dates.”
At the time, I found the response incomprehensible. History was no longer about dates, I said. It was about social movements, understanding the development and impulses of man. The dates — even a lot of the names — were, by definition, trivial.
Now, with my first Koç history test behind me, Eyilmaz is reminding me that, in Turkey, history is still very much about dates.
“In Turkey, history classes ... are just facts,” she said. “If you want to think logically, critically ... that’s what calculus classes are for. Or science classes.”
Eyilmaz tells me that at universities like Koç, the intellectuals of academia — the critical thinkers, the brightest and best — aren’t studying the Humanities. Here, she says, they’re studying chemistry, biology, engineering or (I shudder) math.
However annoying this may be for me, it makes sense. Turkey is still a growing country. Its economy is still developing, its financial skyscrapers still being built.
When John Adams was visiting the French Court during the Revolution, he was criticized for being unable to intellectually discuss the “finer things” like music and art. He responded:
“I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study ... navigation, commerce and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music ... and porcelain.” 
Intellectual study of history is in the second of those categories — maybe even the third. But math and science? Those are the things Turkey is learning now. No wonder that’s where the thinking students have flocked.

2009-12-03,AU,study,"As budgets across the country are strained by the pressure of the economic climate, some cities are starting to think about taxing the student population attending universities located in those cities — a practice which is likely to spread should it pass, according to an expert from the American Council on Education.
The mayor of Pittsburgh, Luke Ravenstahl, is exploring a tax on students dubbed the “Fair Share Tax.” It would add a 1 percent tax onto college tuition. Pittsburgh contains seven colleges and universities with 100,000 students who do not pay to use city services, according to a press release on the mayor’s Web site. The tax would raise $16.2 million in a year for the city, the press release said.
“Every day, public safety and public works personnel are providing core services to the thousands of students in our city,” Ravenstahl said in the statement. “Whether it’s a building inspector called out to a rental property, or public works crews picking up students’ garbage, it all adds up to costing city taxpayers.”
D.C. has 12 colleges and universities, which thousands of students attend each year, according to the College Board Web site.
Should an identical policy be implemented in the district, AU undergraduate students would be obliged to pay $344.56 per year in taxes, based on one percent of this year’s tuition rate at AU, which is $34,456. The AU tuition rate changes year to year, and it has gone up annually at least since 2003, according to the AU Annual Reports on the university’s Web site.
While Ravenstahl does not think it fair for “working people ... to shoulder this burden [of public services] alone,” Jackie Schumacher, a graduate student in the School of International Service, said such a tax would not be fair to college students because studying is not their occupation.
“If you’re generating money for the economy it should be taxed, but if you’re not making money [you] shouldn’t be taxed,” Schumacher said.
Junior in the College of Arts and Sciences Laura Harris said she does not think such a tax would be a good idea for D.C. because students are not the only people in the city who use its services and resources without being taxed.
“There are a lot of people who come to D.C. that don’t live here that use resources all the time,” Harris said. “I just think that’s not fair to students and their parents to have to pay more than they thought they would have to pay here at schools ... AU is already expensive.”
Ravenstahl is not the only mayor considering dipping into students’ wallets. In April, the mayor of Providence, R.I., David Cicilline, proposed a fixed tax of $150 per semester for students at schools including Brown University and Providence College, according to an article in USA Today, even though those schools have voluntarily donated to the city government for the past six years.
D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty’s office did not return calls to say whether a similar tax is planned for university students in the District.

2010-04-12,AU,study,"AU is in the planning stages of a major construction project to dramatically increase the number of beds in the on-campus housing inventory.
Overall, the goal is to add 1,000 new beds, said Chris Moody, the executive director of Housing and Dining Programs. That number comes from a study conducted last year by an outside planning firm, The Eagle previously reported.
While it is still early in the phase  — actual plans for the project are not anticipated until the end of the summer — a number of sites are being considered, said University Architect Jerry Gager.
“I think it’s fairly certain that we’re going to be using the Nebraska Parking Lot site to accommodate a portion of our need,” he said. “Very good possibility that a Nebraska Hall addition will be part of the plan.”
Other possible sites include land by the President’s Office Building, the area behind Letts Hall known as the “quadriplex” and Tenley Campus, Gager said.
It is still too early to tell how many buildings will be constructed or modified during this project. If the project stays on schedule, the first buildings should open by the fall of 2013, Moody said. 
But what is known is the type of housing that will likely be built.
“Any housing that gets added, we’ve requested to be more suite- and apartment-style living,” he said.
AU currently has a very high ratio of double rooms to suites and apartments, and he hopes to bring that down, Moody said.
Gager called the combination of adding 1,000 new beds as part of suites or apartments — which require more room than traditional double rooms  — a “challenge.”
“I think we have the land area to do some good architectural designs,” he said. “It’s a matter of what the exact numbers are and whatever the exact design is.”
The plans will have to pass through a number of regulatory bodies, including the D.C. Zoning Commission and the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, Gager said.
The university has no cost estimates for the project yet, he said.
“Total costs would include any common areas and auxiliary spaces that are not yet programmed,” Gager said. “There are a lot of variables that will change over time and therefore the total cost is difficult to estimate.”
The rise in construction comes at a time of high demand for housing. Too many first-year students were assigned triple rooms, with the number rising each year, Moody said. Space for upperclassmen was recently assigned by lottery for the first time in years. 
In the near future, two new residence halls — with about 140 beds overall — will come online. Clark and Roper Halls, currently office space, are set to be converted to residential space and will be ready for occupancy in October and August, respectively, The Eagle previously reported. The two buildings will exclusively house freshmen.
The housing expansion is part of a larger campus plan for the next 10 years that is currently under development. The university is expected to submit the plan to the Zoning Commission this summer, according to the AU Web site.

2010-04-12,AU,study,"The Arabic department recently increased the number of credits, course time and faculty for its courses, according to Ana Serra, the chair of the Language and Foreign Studies Department.
The move was designed to better compete with other university Arabic programs and better prepare students to speak fluently both in and out of the classroom.  
“The number of enrollments in Arabic has been growing exponentially in the past few years,” Serra said. 
Elementary and intermediate language courses are currently worth four credits and advanced courses worth three. Wednesday class sessions currently run for 50 minutes. 
This fall, the elementary and intermediate levels will be five credits with 100-minute Wednesday sessions or 250 minutes per week. The advanced level will be four credits with 50-minute Wednesday sessions. 
These changes are a direct result of student feedback. Many have returned from study abroad programs in Arabic-speaking countries and said they were not prepared to speak there, according to Serra. 
“I put myself in my students’ shoes, and I understand that it’s sort of inconvenient for you to have to devote so much time and devote so many of your credits ... but it’s like, ‘OK, do you want to learn Arabic?’” Serra said. 
This summer the Arabic department will begin intensive courses during which classes will meet four days a week. The elementary and intermediate levels will gain eight credits by meeting for three hours per day over nine weeks. The advanced topics level will meet for three hours and 15 minutes over six weeks to earn six credits. 
“It’s a lot of credits, but you knock out two semesters,” Serra said. “Language in general is best when it’s learned with a lot of intensity, with a lot of exposure — Arabic in particular. So the summer is a good time [for students] to do it, not when [they are] doing a zillion other things and taking a zillion other courses.”
Georgetown University offers a competitive Arabic program where students take classes four times a week for six credits, Serra said. 
“In order to catch up with other universities that have a level of intensity in Arabic to be able to bring their students to a level of proficiency, we’ve had to raise that number of credits and contact hours,” she said. 
Erez Naaman, a Harvard University graduate, will join the faculty in the fall as the language’s first tenure-track professor. Naaman will teach an Arab and Islamic course as well as an advanced Arabic course and topics courses as an assistant professor. 
Ideally, the same changes will happen in the Chinese, Japanese and Russian language departments, Serra said. 
“At this point, we don’t have the necessary faculty support to do that,” she said. “We want to offer our students classes that are taught by qualified professors, and we don’t yet have enough of those professors to provide that many contact hours, those many classes.”
Chinese, Japanese and Russian are currently five credits at the elementary and intermediate levels. Elementary Korean also has five credits. However, Russian, Japanese and Chinese are only three credits at the advanced level.

2010-04-12,AU,study,"The Office of Sustainability and EcoSense are working to reduce the amount of bottled water used on campus and to encourage the AU community to drink more tap water.
They are developing a plan to replace water coolers in offices with water filters and bottled water with water fountains and other sources of tap water at events, according to Director of Sustainability Chris O’Brien.
EcoSense President Jennifer Jones started a petition in November asking the administration and faculty to reduce the use of bottled water. The petition — which currently has 103 signatures  —  encourages the university to end the sale of bottled water and encourage people to drink tap water.
“If we don’t invest in the [tap water] system now, we’ll have problems in the future,” Jones said. “We need to invest for the system to keep being funded.”
Jones said the petition was more of a personal pledge for students and a way for them to make an individual decision to switch to tap water.
Bottled water is not tested at the shelf and can contain different contaminants from plastic bottles, according to Jones. She also said a large amount of greenhouse gases are released in the production and transportation of the bottles.
Bottled water production wastes water in the process and most single-serve bottled water containers are discarded and end up in landfills, O’Brien said.
A number of offices have already switched to filtered tap water including the Department of Public Safety, Facilities Management and the Office of Campus Life, O’Brien said. The Office of Sustainability plans to reach out to offices still using water coolers over the summer. 
The Public Safety office installed filters in fall 2009. Since then, the office has eliminated the purchase of 504 five-gallon water coolers and now saves $81.68 per month on average, according to a case study done by the Office of Sustainability. 
The switch to filters could potentially cost some smaller offices more money, O’Brien said. These offices can also decide to share filtering systems with neighboring offices. 
Taste and the stereotype of D.C. tap water quality are some of the biggest challenges in getting people to reduce their use of bottled water, according to both Jones and O’Brien. D.C. tap water already meets Environmental Protection Agency safety standards, and water at AU is tested again at the tap, O’Brien said. 
“We had one person in my office who was concerned about us making the switch, but when we installed the water filter she said she never thought tap water could taste so good,” O’Brien said.
Campus Beautification Day on April 6 was a water bottle-free event. Water was provided to volunteers from water coolers instead of from individual single-serving bottles of water.
Bottled water will continue to be sold at the Eagle’s Nest and the Block Express. O’Brien said the possibility of removing bottled water is being discussed now, but no decisions have been reached yet.
According to CampusProgress.org, a project of the Center for American Progress, seven colleges or universities have completely banned bottled water from campus, including the Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Portland. Nearly 30 more schools have campaigns to reduce their bottled water usage.

2010-06-02,AU,study,"Students and local residents learned at a panel discussion Wednesday evening about the history of the AU Experimental Station and where the Army Corps of Engineers’ dig for World War I-era munitions is headed in the future.
The discussion, titled “The Toxins beneath American University,” aimed to inform the AU community and Spring Valley residents about the future of remediation efforts and potential health issues, according to Michael Ginsberg, a senior in the School of International Service who is doing his capstone project on the issue and organized the panel.
Some topics addressed were arsenic-contaminated soil at and around AU, a 2007 public health study conducted by the Bloomberg School of Health at the Johns Hopkins University and potential health effects of the dig for AU students.
Panelists included representatives from the Spring Valley community, area Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, Johns Hopkins, the AU Chemistry Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.
No one from the Army Corps or the AU administration was present at the meeting, and the future of the dig was not addressed, except to say that the Army Corps’ operations are scheduled to begin winding down in the next two years because no more funding is set to be allocated to the project after fiscal year 2012.
David Taylor, President Neil Kerwin’s chief of staff, said he chose not to attend because his schedule did not leave that evening available for him, and that his absence was not representative of the administration’s stance on the issue.
Taylor also noted that the event was a project by one student, not a forum requested by student leadership or a campus organization.
“Aside from Michael’s own research project, there did not seem to be an outcry for this,” Taylor said in an e-mail. “The Board of Trustees Chairman and President Kerwin held a campus forum/open microphone event on April 12, and not one question arose about Army Corps activity.”

2010-06-02,AU,study,"Undergraduate tuition, housing and meal plan costs for the school year starting in the fall of 2010 will be higher than they were this year, according to AU’s 2010-2011 budget report.
Tuition costs for a full-time undergraduate student are $17,228 for the 2009-2010 academic year, but that price will increase by five percent to $18,090 for the 2010-2011 academic year. The price of on-campus housing will increase by 4.5 percent.
The price of tuition usually changes every year to reflect AU’s growing budget costs and upward nationwide trends in tuition levels. Most private universities in the United States raised their undergraduate tuition for the 2009-2010 school year by 3 to 6 percent, according to a College Board report.
Tuition is calculated every two years as part of AU’s budget and is approved by the Board of Trustees, according to Executive Director of Budget and Payroll Nana An.
The calculation takes many factors into consideration, including the Private University Index reported by College Board, which measures inflation and its effect on college tuition rates across the nation. AU also considers student needs, financial aid and institutional priorities, she said.
When determining the cost of tuition, AU increases rates “very modestly,” An said. AU’s tuition and mandatory fees are still “well below the mid-point of our market competitors,” despite the recent rise in price, she said.
“It’s not just a cost increase from the student perspective. By the time you graduate, your degree will be worth more than when you enrolled,” An said.
The 5 percent hike for undergraduates amounts to about $1,700 per year in additional tuition costs, according to AU’s 2010-2011 Budget Report.
Tuition rates for summer classes have increased as well, from $973 last year to $1,022 per credit hour this year for an undergraduate student, according to the budget report. The price of online summer courses has not recently changed and will still be $800 next year.
Tuition for graduate students pursuing an MBA will only increase by 3 percent.
Increasing Costs of Room and Board
Housing and meal plan rates will also increase next year. On-campus housing for all students — singles, doubles and triples on the main campus, including Nebraska and Centennial Hall — will cost 4.5 percent more, moving the price of a double to $4,315 per semester, according to AU’s 2010-2011 Budget Report. A double occupancy room on main campus currently costs about $4,129 per semester.
Meal plans will increase in price by 4 percent. For a student currently on the 150 Block Plan, which costs $2,150 per semester, the same plan will cost about $90 more.
“The cost of maintaining residence hall facilities increases annually due to inflation,” said Executive Director of Housing and Dining Chris Moody.
Costs for housing and meal plans are determined similarly to tuition and are set every two years, according to Moody.
For the 2008-2009 academic year, AU raised residence hall room rates by a greater percentage than the George Washington University and Georgetown University, but AU still consistently has lower housing costs than the two local universities.
How tuition money is used
Tuition, room and board make up 95 percent of American University’s revenue. Out of AU’s total revenue, which is about $450 million, almost 50 percent pays for salaries and compensation for faculty and staff. The rest goes to financial aid, new technology and services on campus, according to AU’s Budget Report.
GWU spends 53 percent of its budget on salaries, according to their 2010 Operating and Capital Budget. Georgetown University, which depends on gifts and endowments for half its revenue, also spends about 50 percent of its budget on salaries, as listed in its 2009-2012 Financial Plan.
The rest of AU’s revenue comes from investments, gifts and public radio station WAMU’s earnings. Unlike most universities, AU does not depend on gifts to survive financially.
Although tuition may increase yearly at universities across the nation, students rarely pay the full sticker price.
A recent study from the National Association of College and University Business Officers found that, on average, undergraduate students are paying 58 percent of full tuition costs at private universities nationwide.
At AU, the average financial aid package accounts for 29 percent of the full costs, according to An. Although that package varies from student to student, the average AU undergraduate pays 71 percent of the full cost of tuition, she said.

2010-10-12,AU,study,"In addition to the disappearance of spare time, money (spent on mostly coffee these days), and perhaps a bit of our sanity, furniture from the University Center and Butler Pavilion have been disappearing over the course of this semester. We don’t know who the perpetrator of such vile acts is — students on a vandalism lark, students too poor to furnish their house this semester or a dastardly villain that isn’t a student at all. Regardless of the culprit, however, the humor in this situation is fading fast.
An e-mail was circulated on campus last week regarding the thefts and the estimated costs of replacement for the items stolen, including ten bar stools from the Marketplace and a booth seat from the Tavern. That figure currently hovers around $7,000, a fortune to us students that often find ourselves paying to intern (for credit and transportation).
Better yet, if the items are not returned, the costs of replacing these items comes out of our tuition money. While $7,000 dispersed amongst a student population of over 6,000 seems insignificant, it’s really an issue of the principle of the matter — we’re paying for furniture rather than our education.
To be fair, we have no idea who is to blame. It could be a student, an employee or a random individual who came across MGC open late on a week/weekend night and decided they needed some Butler Board Room chairs. Despite the lack of a scapegoat or responsible party to hold accountable, the underlying issue remains: Even if we students are not directly responsible (or even if we are) for the damages done to this campus, we are held financially accountable for them. Past and present residents of the dorms can attest to this, having paid for numerous damages done to ceiling tiles, bulletin boards and pulled fire alarms at some point in time. While the majority of us are not running around on a Saturday night punching out ceiling tiles or stuffing Tavern booths into our trunks, people out there are. And we are the ones paying for it.
In addition, this string of thefts could one day mean a change in our ability to use MGC late at night. MGC is open 24 hours a day and has served not only as source of food and center of learning, but also as a study area and place of refuge during middle-of-the-night fire alarms for many of us. Thefts of this magnitude tend not to occur in those buildings that are locked up at night, such as Ward. If MGC continues to be pillaged and plundered in the middle of the night (or another time of day that someone can sneak a Tavern booth out the back door unnoticed), then our ability to use these facilities may be jeopardized. While some of us can spend hour upon hour in Bender Library, those of us that get that soul-crushing feeling from spending too much time there will be unduly impacted by the disappearance of this favorite late-night alternative study location. 
While these thefts appear at first to be fairly insignificant or even humorous, the reality is that unless the items are returned and the actions cease to occur, the effects will have repercussions for us all.
If the culprit or culprits are students, we ask you: Please return these items. Please do not steal any more items. Not to mention that you’re bringing down heaps of bad karma upon yourselves. This is our community. Our home away from home, if you will. We all live and share in it, and by doing stupid stuff like this, you’re hurting all of us — and may whatever higher power you believe in help you if we find out who you are after we spend all night in the library.

""I Never Saw Another Butterfly""
DIRECTOR: Gail Humphries Mardirosian
MUSIC DIRECTOR: Jonathan Tuzman
Katzen Studio Theatre, Nov. 11-14
“I Never Saw Another Butterfly” is one of the most heartbreaking pieces of literature to emerge from the Holocaust. It’s comprised of stories and poems written by Jewish children in the Theresienstadt (or Terezin) concentration camp, few of who survived to see their works published. 
Gail Humphries Mardirosian, a professor in AU’s College of Arts and Sciences,  has now re-imagined that work at a multimedia show to be performed at the Katzen Arts Center.
“I Never Saw Another Butterfly” incorporates several elements, including music, puppets and other cast-created art, as well as several languages added to the English translation of the show. 
Audiences will be exposed not only to Czech and Hebrew, but to American Sign Language as well. 
Ben Gibson, an AU alumnus and recent Helen Hayes Award Nominee, is the show’s choreographer and visual theater specialist. 
”[ASL] really transcends the spoken word and blends text and movement in theatre, which is part of my goal for this show — to represent another voice that was not only heard, but could be seen.” 
Mardirosian chose to incorporate ASL because of the intensely physical nature of Czech theatre and how important the physical expression of words is.
Mardirosian is not new to the surviving artworks found at the Terezin Concentration Camp in the Czech Republic. After returning from her study as a Fulbright Senior Scholar in the Czech Republic from 2008 to 2009, Mardirosian staged “The Voices of Terezin.”
Inspired to reach out to the children of the D.C. community, she decided to extend the Terezin project.
However, “Butterfly” is a show entirely separate from “The Voices of Terezin” and was in fact written as a children’s show. The musical, inspired by a collection of poetry and artwork done by children and found at the Terezin camp, tells the stories of those within the Terezin camp and their struggles.  
Mardirosian used a favored phrase to describe the project, “‘Works of art as both a sword and a balm,’ because it’s a way of expressing and fighting … and also as a possibility to heal.”
The cast members all spoke about the different aspects of the show and about performing a show rooted in heavy subject material aimed at a younger audience. “[Children’s theatre] just adds another layer of selflessness,” said cast member Laura Aristovulos, a senior in CAS, “because you’re doing it for the children. And I find that [in] children’s theatre, more than any other theatre the show becomes more about giving to the audience.” 
In addition to the production itself, the “Butterfly” project has an educational outreach aspect. Members of the project traveled to various D.C. schools to speak with children about the issues of the Holocaust and Terezin and taught them portions of ASL. 
Mardirosian’s eyes sparkled when she spoke about the educational outreach workshops. 
“We were doing the workshops for children [aged] 12 and 13. The children in these stories were mostly 12 to 15.”

2010-11-12,AU,study,"• To the couple making out on the 2nd floor of the library-
I realize that you two think you're adorable, however this is the quiet floor.  That means no giggling with each other every thirty seconds.  I realize that there are few people around, but kissing sounds still count as noise that will piss us off.  Neither of you are even studying so go annoy you're roommates with your incessant cuteness.
Sincerely,
A student that’s actually working
• To the girl behind me in line at Salsa: You shouldn't have come to salsa at 7:55 expecting to get your food and go back to your dorm in time to watch Glee at exactly 8:00. So please stop complaining about your life being over because you are going to miss 10 minutes of Glee. Also, please stop making comments behind me telling me to move forward, even though Salsa clearly doesn't open until 8:01 for meal swipes, so walking way up to the counter in fact does no good.
• Okay I know I’m just a college student, but why can't the Tavern workers be polite to me? Since when did it become acceptable for someone to roll their eyes at me when I ask for ketchup? Hello workers, IT’S YOUR JOB. YOU'RE GETTING PAID. If I ever took that kind of attitude at a job, I’d be fired in a second. So why are the adult Tavern workers allowed to act like thugs?
• To the boy who said ""You're welcome” when I thanked you for showing me your ID at the front desk this morning, you made my day! I may have acted like it was no big deal, but nobody ever replies!
• I'm an alum getting my masters at AU — although I haven't gotten a call yet, I would probably hang up on them too — I am broke for goodness sakes. They should give a ten year job/life establishment period or something before guilt tripping us into giving money...
• Dear AU Shuttle Bus Operator:
While I appreciate that you may be a football fan, I'm not sure it's a great idea to wait at the metro until a time out is called to drive the shuttle to campus.
• Dear Provost Bass:
Are you crazy? 7:30 a.m.?  I need time to sober up before I go to class.
• Why don't we have bigger condoms in the women's resource center?
• I'm pretty sure there's a mouse living in our lounge. It lives under the oven. Please AU, so something about this. I don't want to be the one responsible for the death of an innocent mouse stinking up the hall when I make dinner and he doesn't get out. McDowell smells bad enough. Thanks.
• New Schedule? NOT ok...I really like this whole 8:55 thing… no one in their right mind is going to take a 7:30!
• Obviously people did not read the previous rant about walking on the right side. There is something about AU's campus that gives people the impression it's OK to walk wherever they want on the sidewalk. We drive on the right side and stay to the right on the metro. Please, we don’t need more awkward situations on campus. Stay right.
• I don't understand any better when my professor rephrases in an attempt to make it easier.
• To all my fellow phonathoners, why don't you learn how to budget your projects and papers? I'm tired of getting ridiculous amounts of e-mails from you guys. No I don't feel bad about your all nighter.
• Why does the Eagle put up dumb articles like ""In a relationship, three in bed can be a crowd""? I don’t pay $52,000 to find this crap in my newspaper.

• Do the people who run the Ward Cafe know what the prices of these things are EVERYPLACE ELSE IN THE WORLD? 5 dollars for a Snapple and Croissant, INSANE!

That is all.

• hey guy,
I know that you're really busy (who isn't, these days?), and I know that I might seem like a hot mess right now — but if you could see fit to actually give me the time of day now and then, I think you'd find that we could be pretty much best friends. Now, I know better than to beg, plead or whine, so I'm just going to point this out: wouldn’t that be worth wasting a little time on?
sincerely,

• To the two misguided idiots who, separately, are thrilled with the ""free food"" (maybe you’re kidding--if so, you're probably st ill an idiot) and believe that YOU are paying your tuition, allow me to remind you that the food ain't free and your tuition money is bled from the veins of your parents. You spoiled twits.

• Dear annoying freshmen girls,
Good for you, making friends of the RA. One stigma — don't rat out sophomores for “breaking the rules.” It doesn’t make you cool, it makes you a snitch. Get out of high school, being gossipy won't get you anywhere in college.
Sincerely, 
Annoyed Sophomore
• You wanna know why everyone annoys you, dear friend? Because you annoy them! Seriously, stop being so effing angsty and annoyed at everything and maybe you'll get farther. Right now though, you're just really frustrating to be around, and I'm getting sick of playing the silent and understanding friend. Try being positive once, maybe it'll improve your day!
• Where are all the cute indie girls? I miss drinking chai and discussing the complexity of Animal Collective lyrics with my ex girlfriend while watching The Life Aquatic.
• I don't even go to this school ... LOL
• I've always been a devoted RantReader, but never a Ranter, however now I feel the need to respond to several Rants.
#1. To the girl who wants a cute, sensitive, heterosexual, literary type. They do exist! I've found one, and ironically enough, he is a frat boy. He asked me out by saying he wanted to be my Adam Trask instead of my Dean Moriarty, and we read each other e.e. cummings. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!
#2. To the person who argued with the editor over an apostrophe vs. a quotation mark, I am in awe. I strive to one day be like you. No sarcasm.
• As a knowledgeable semi-promiscuous, semi-feminist, semi-whore, semi-lady, who has a quick wit and lots of fun stories involving sex and men, I'd like to take a poll of The Eagle Ranters and ask if they would appreciate me pursuing a sex column in the likeness of ""Sex and the Ivy"" of Harvard or ""Sex & the Cigar"" of the University of Rhode Island. Any opinions?
• To all the lonely people who rant,
Remove yourself from your computer screen. Walk out of your dorm room and go meet people. You have entire lists of people who are doing things e-mailed to you daily. Want to play soccer? There is a group. Want to paint? There is a group. Want to help a random cause? There is a group. Want to party all the time? Want to debate? The list goes on and on.
You think its hard to meet people now? How are you going to meet people when you don't have a giant network of people your age looking for people to do the exact same things with them. Seriously, making friends and meeting will never be as easy as it is now. REALIZE THAT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Until then, get off your computer. Seriously.
With all my love,
Someone who thinks you are bitching about nothing.
• Hey WVAU-
I love your reviews, but as someone who is just getting into the ""hip"" music scene can you dumb down your music knowledge just a smidge? It would be nice to know more than 1 band in the ""sounds like"" section.

We need to keep fighting for Professor Manny Berard!

• To the girl who watches Disney movies alone on weekend nights wishing for her Prince Charming to come along, I DO THE SAME THING! We should be friends.
• Hey AU, it kinda blows when you don't offer more of the required courses I need for my freaking major. I love how you basically force me to take classes I really don't want to take, but yet have to in order to satisfy your damn requirements. Thanks for having the worst selection of classes. I appreciate it.
• To the girls clearly insulted by my AU girls rant:
You're the problem. Not me.
The point was that I don't think I'm entitled to anything and that I don't treat others who aren't as ""fabulous"" like secondary trash.
• To the person who made me lose the game. Props on your use of EagleRants to do that. It is creative (showing AU has creativity), it is humorous (because the people without boyfriends are depressing), and it is not about the Phonathon (even though I work there and hate it!)
• Dear guy in my class. Your voice pains me. I know you can't help it, but at least try to not talk unless it's something important. For some reason you just feel inclined to repeat what the professor said. No one wants to hear your high-pitched nasally voice aaaaah
yours truly, 
person trying not to punch you
• All these girls are complaining about how all they want is a guy to cuddle with and how the guys here on campus just want to have sex. WELL I'M WITH THE GUYS! Hello! We’re at college, the whole point is to meet as many people as possible and find out what you really like in a person, and that includes sex! I'm in a relationship right now and it's completely frustrating not seeing my boyfriend for a few days and then when we do see each other all we do is hang out or do homework together. I'm in my sexual prime right now and instead I'm helping him conjugate verbs and analyze supply v. demand graphs.
• Stop kicking the MGC handicap button!! It really bothers those of us who sit in the MGC corner lounge.
• In response to ""all girls are the same here,” while I do feel there is a typical female student here (fashionable or indie) saying you looking better than everyone else here is extremely conceited. You may be fortunate like most of us attending a place of higher education, but you are not privileged. Your attitude is exactly what made that person make their original comment. You are the reason Pink created the song ""Stupid Girl.” Respectfully show some humility and stop making all girls look like assholes.
• TDR can you please make meals that aren't complicated. A simple meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans would suffice.
• I could have transferred from AU to a different school. I wanted to. I stayed because I didn’t want to leave the orchestra. So thanks, AU, for denying a deserving and talented music professor tenure. You can thank him for my tuition dollars and for our much improved orchestra.
• To the jerk that uses the handicap button,
It actually creates an unnecessary draft of cold/hot air which makes people inside cold/hot and uses extra energy to make warm again.
• I've been hearing rumors about a secret society at AU. Is this legit? If so, can girls be in it? I'm waiting to be tapped. Nothing yet...
• I wish sleepovers were still socially acceptable for college girls. I miss having another girl share my bed as we stay up all night and tell each other secrets. But I think if I asked one of my girlfriends to have a sleepover with me, she would think I was sexually interested in her. Oh, the days of innocence.
• I have too much booty for one man to handle.
• Nice try calling me from a blocked number so that I would pick up. Stalker. I'm not that stupid. And I ignore you for a reason.
• Loving No Shave November!!!
• I miss you inside me.
• I'm so sick of having to wait around for a treadmill at the gym only to have people take the one I sign up for! Do people just not understand the system? Am I supposed to tap them on the shoulder and tell them to get off?? Why doesn't the staff DO anything when you complain? AHHHHH!!!!
• Dear pre-frat friend,
I miss the old you

• To the person who wishes she/he had gone to Chapel Hill: Your grammar is horrible.
• Dear anon WVAU lover - I love YOU with all my being. Meet me by the rack next week and we'll make some spins together?
• ""Only bad professors deserve tenure""? Because department politics couldn't possibly have played a role. Those of us fighting for Professor Berard have studied the process. Some of us have been in the orchestra for many, many semesters. We would know by now if Berard was a ""bad"" professor.
• We need more things to read in the bathrooms. I like the ""installs"" that the library has, but can these start appearing in the dorms etc? I think that's where the eagle rants should be posted, that would keep me entertained.
• Dear Perch, sell food.

• Yes it is midnight in the library. Yes there are not many people here. Yes we are in the basement. But, THIS IS STILL A LIBRARY. Seriously, wasn't this reviewed in preschool, ""inside voices"" everyone.
• I don’t care about politics AT ALL. so please stop asking me if I’m registered to vote, and stop questioning me why I came to this school.
• The freshmen guys are cuter than the ones in my grade, but is that considered ""slumming"" ?
• My Eagle Rant was not posted.  To be fair, they never are - but I really thought this one would make the cut.
On an unrelated note, I really like the editor's notes too. And I would be happy to write crosswords for the Eagle, but only if they can have funny clues.

• Quick word to all you ""artists"" let me give you a quick lesson on what is and isn't art.  The Mona Lisa is art.  Having a bunch of students draw lines down a canvas isn't.  That’s lazy.  The thinking man is a brilliant sculpture and a work of art.  Something I have to side-step every damn day when I turn a corner in Katzen isn't.  That's annoying.
• Love, love, love Eagle Rants!
• Whoever turned my wallet into lost and found, THANK YOU! You are a wonderful person. I am sending good karma waves to you.
• My dearest AU,
I do not ask for much from you. My digestive system works hard for TDR and I try to be as kind as possible to everyone, but I am cold. Do you know why I'm cold, AU? I am cold because I can't get any semblance of a warm temperature in my shower. Forget pressure, that I understood would always suck. But now that it's fall and quite cold outside, taking a shower under my shower aka the water dripping from melting ice bergs, I’m saddened. Please help me out AU.
Love,
A cold, but seriously in love student.
• What the hell is up with the Health Center? I can't schedule an appointment online because they put my email address as @american.edu instead of @student.american.edu. But, even worse than that, is the fact that I've called them at three different times in the past three days DURING their open hours, and not once has a ""patient service representative"" picked up the phone! The phone just keeps ringing and ringing. Plus, the last time I had an appointment, I sat there for an hour before they realized that the doctor left for lunch since she forgot I was there! This is the most incompetent health service to which I've ever been exposed.
• Why is there no hype about the Elton John event @ Bender Arena on Nov. 15?!?
• THE BAND PROCESSION JUST WOKE ME UP FROM A NAP BY LOUDLY PROTESTING IN THE LA QUAD... and yet those caps locks are the extent of my anger. Congrats, band kids, for standing up for your teacher and what you believe in. If it came to a vote, despite the rude awakening you gave me, I would be for your cause.
• I love that AU is doing the energy challenge, and I don't really care if you want to take the challenge seriously.
But most AU students care about the environment in some way, and this is kind of a nice time to build up some good routines in energy conservation.
• Every time you see someone eating alone in TDR, asking them to join you. I wish someone would sit with me.
• To everyone who has a disability of any kind-you don't need to be ashamed.  Whether it is a learning disability, physical disability, mental disability, audio disability or visual disability, you are welcome here in the AU disability community. It's okay and great to come to terms with your disability. Embrace that as part of your identity.  There are lots of others just like you.
• People who are disabled are cool.
• Go Disability Alliance!!!

I'm really okay with being friends but you can't be that forward and not create false expectations.
• People who whisper in the second floor of the library: it is a SILENT FLOOR, not a whispering floor, not a lower voice floor, but SILENT! That means I only want to hear the typing of keyboard and my own thoughts. So please, if you’re in a group or just feel a need to talk and laugh while studying just go to the third floor and let me study in peace.

• For all the academic adviser promotion AU does, we have some pretty shitty ones. What kind of advisor doesn't recognize AP credits, thus making you falsely believe that you need to take classes that YOU'VE ALREADY PLACED OUT OF?! No AU, I already give you a shitload of money per year—recognize and quit trying to drain me monetarily. AND MAYBE HIRE SOME PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO THEIR JOB.
• I hate roommates who never leave the damn room.  Like seriously, get a damn life and leave the room for once!  You only leave to go to class, go to the bathroom, shower and eat.  I’ve never seen you socialize with people outside our floor.  So please, learn to be social, and let me have the room to myself for at least an hour a day.  I don't think that’s too much to ask for, considering I LITERALLY give you the whole day.  And, do you mind like cleaning your side of the room?  Your spillage is getting on my side, and the odors coming from the food you leave chilling on your desk make me want to vomit.  Clean your mess, and get a life!
• Maybe it's just me, or the fact that I've been out of AU for three years, but the students at AU seem to complain a lot more about trivial shit.  When I was at AU, we bitched about real problems, like the president embezzling a money and then having AU jack up tuition rates to pay off his golden parachute.
• To the person complaining about wasting $32.50 on two dates:
Not to nitpick, but spending $16.25 on a date might be part of the reason for rejection.
• The removal of the Orchestra director is just the next step of a continuing level of disrespect for the arts. Does it surprise anyone? This is what happens when you have a cultural ignoramus running your university.
• I was really disappointed in the quality of the protest that the Band Geeks did on Wednesday. I expected Mars the Bringer of War, or Fugue in D Minor. Instead there was some lousy blatting of horns. Band Geeks, play well!
• Having the gym open to midnight? Probably the greatest thing to happen to AU since, well, since 1893.
• I hear they're re-doing Mr. Holland’s Opus. They’ve cast Neil Kerwin in the William Macy Role of Wolters and Manny Berard in the Richard Dreyfuss's role.
• So the boys who ran for ANC tried to help out AU. Instead, we have two anti-AU people trying to fill the seats. Great job....
• If the library has late hours...
If the gym has late hours...
Why can't we have late hours for Student Activities?
• For all you hating on phonathon ranters. You try sitting in front of a computer screen for 3.75 hours with nothing else to read except the Eagle, then tell me how you feel. This job is sucking out my soul.
• What I don't understand is why the Grad Student Government can spend all of this money on alcohol, but we can't. Some of us are over 21.

2010-12-06,AU,study,"• To rant or not to rant, that is the question. Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous college fortune, or to take arms against the sling of troubles, and by ranting, end them. To die, to rant, no more. And by a rant to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that freshman are heir to, ‘tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To rant, to sleep, to rant perchance to dream. Aye, there’s the rant.

• People who whisper in the second floor of the library: it is a SILENT FLOOR, not a whispering floor, not a lower voice floor, but SILENT! That means I only want to hear the typing of keyboard and my own thoughts. So please, if you’re in a group or just feel a need to talk and laugh while studying just go to the third floor and let me study in peace.?
• Annoyed second floor loner
• Maybe it’s just me, or the fact that I’ve been out of AU for three years, but the students at AU seem to complain a lot more about trivial shit.  When I was at AU, we bitched about real problems, like the president embezzling a money and then having AU jack up tuition rates to pay off his golden parachute.
• To the AU Alum hating on Phonathon:?Why are you on Eagle Rants?!? Do you really have that much free time on your hands that you can find the time to complain about the phone calls you’re getting?

• I never thought I would be another person complaining in the library but this is ridiculous.  Girl sits next to me on the quiet floor, and chews LOUDER than I can think.  I’ve never wanted a bagel to be out of my life so quickly.  I’m pretty sure this girl has an unnatural amount of saliva in her mouth cause I can hear EVERYTHING going on in there.  FML
• Do you remember that time I got drunk, and wrestled a panda bear, and made out with you, and skydived, and dressed in drag?
Yeah. Me neither.
• Reading over the lengthy E.R. column from 11/12 I noticed that about 60% of all the rants could have been solved at the time of occurrence. Please people, stop being passive-aggressive and let others know if they are?-a terrible roommate?-making too much noise in the library?-a slow mover in food lines, etc.?What may be so blindingly obvious to you may never have crossed their minds! Stop grinding your teeth in frustration and just talk it out
• I like that the Tavern workers are mean to me. I am a white male with an unnecessarily large scholarship, great family and great friends, life has given me every opportunity.

2010-12-07,AU,study,"Newsweek recently named American University the sixth most diverse college in the nation. Although we are proud to be recognized for the diversity that we do have, we, along with other AU students, were shocked by this ranking. 
According to Newsweek, the racial profile of AU consists of 5 percent Asian, 4 percent African-American and 4 percent Latino students. In Newsweek’s study, diversity is measured in terms of ethnicity, geographic origin, economic status, sexual orientation, and gender. We are all aware of the female gender majority here at AU and we are honored that many international students choose to study on our campus. Furthermore, AU has also gained a reputation as a “gay-friendly” university and earned praise from The Advocate for its positive atmosphere for queer students. 
Each of these aspects of diversity are highly valuable and not to be diminished. However, can AU truly be considered a diverse campus without racial diversity and integration? At AU, we pride ourselves on our open-minded and politically active campus, yet we are limiting our progress as an institution with a lack of racial diversity and integration. What narrow racial diversity that does exist at AU is tempered by a distinct separation of students on campus.
This is evident in the greek system, the student activist community and the broader social context of our campus as a whole. For example, it seems historically black sororities and fraternities have been less integrated into the dominant greek community. 
We’ve noticed this type of separation within our own close friends and broader social circles. In these aspects, areas of student life at AU lack racial diversity, making it clear that we as students face issues of segregation within our very own institution.	
This is an important issue for AU to focus on in upcoming years. We should take advantage of the existing, although limited, racial diversity that AU offers and work to increase it in order to undermine racism as a system of oppression. This will enrich our experiences here as AU students and will better prepare us for our post-college lives. 
In approaching the issue, we want to emphasize crossing racial lines and opening discussion among all students. Race is important in the world outside of AU, and our generation is tasked with confronting the ingrained white privilege that exists in our country. We must form relationships and have personal experiences with others in order to improve the current racial inequalities of our country. White people should be aware of privileges and recognize their responsibility in helping to combat racism. To be silent about racial issues makes us complicit. We pride ourselves at AU in our passion for social injustice, so please speak out now. To proceed, we encourage you all to leave comments or write to us about your perspective on racial issues at AU. We have spent this semester noticing, questioning, and analyzing racial issues in our White Privilege & Social Justice class. We want to continue talking about racial segregation on our campus and find some answers by hearing from our fellow students, professors, and faculty. Do you see this issue in your own circle of friends and in your social life? What about in classes and in your involvement with campus activities? How can we make changes as individuals and as a collective student body to help our campus integrate?

2011-01-11,AU,study,"Ward Circle received the most comments in a recent D.C. Department of Transportation public survey of 176 intersections in Ward 3.
Chevy Chase Circle had the second-highest number of comments.
This correlates with the number of accidents occurring in Ward Circle, said Anna Chamberlin, a DDOT transportation planner.
The study is one part of a District-wide effort to find problem traffic areas in the city. 
The high number of comments may be attributed to “the underlying tension between a university and its neighbors,” that happens everywhere, Chamberlin said.
The final draft recommendations for Ward 3 intersections were presented in December, she said, and DDOT hopes to implement some of the short-term recommendations over the spring and summer. 
The long-term recommendations will have to wait for more funding, she said. 
The biggest concerns for Ward Circle were its awkward configuration and pedestrians crossing illegally at mid-block locations, according to the survey. 
“It is awkward having the two lanes go right through the middle while Massachusetts Avenue goes around,” Chamberlin said. 
She added that Massachusetts Avenue and Nebraska Avenue see high volumes of traffic, because people usually try to stay on these streets, rather than turn off on the circle’s other exits. 
Because with a circle, it’s meant to have people turn off on various streets, she said.
DDOT plans to bring in traffic circle experts, but funding is needed first. The agency’s traffic signal modeling experts do not deal with circle flow.
“They kind of seem to be their own creatures,” Chamberlin said of circles.
The experts will also need to look at upcoming developments to the area, including AU’s Campus Plan, a 10-year facilities plan that includes turning the Nebraska Parking Lot into an East Campus.
“That plan has to ensure there aren’t any negative impacts” to the traffic, Chamberlin said.
She said the area might not have high traffic simply because it is near a university, but that there are other factors to consider. 
In November and December, DDOT added new signs to the circle and made pavement improvements as part of previous recommendations, she said.
The final report is expected to come out in February.

2011-02-08,AU,study,"After a year of snow and precipitation-fueled puns, AU officials say they are now better equipped to deal with winter’s natural disasters.
The blizzards of February 2010, known as “Snowpocalypse” and “Snowmageddon,” tested the strength of AU’s emergency preparedness. In the process, it set a precedent for handling future storms.
Preparation for short-term and long-term snowstorms is the same, according to Chris Moody, executive director of Housing and Dining Programs. 
Groundskeepers and snow removal crews begin planning for winter storms as early as November, according to Mark Feist, assistant director of Facilities Management. Preparation involves equipment maintenance and adding snowplows to University trucks.
First, an emergency management work team looks at the University’s protocols for weather-related emergencies and creates a plan based on what is most relevant to the time of year and the weather situation, Moody said.
Facilities Management is then in charge of stockpiling salt and equipment to clear roadways and sidewalks. From there, the challenge is managing the actual storm and student reaction.
To combat last year’s storms, the entire Facilities Management staff was housed on-campus and worked around the clock.
“After 10 hours of operating equipment, you’re pretty burned out,” said David Wilson, a grounds maintenance zone supervisor. “Sometimes we have to drop back and let it just come down. There's no way to keep up.”
Once a storm starts, the University focuses on communicating with students about upcoming activities on campus, such as sporting events, movie nights and dances.
“Snowmageddon” helped show Housing and Dining how to plan successful events in bad weather, should another storm occur.
“Last year was a good case study in what activities would attract students and what activities would not,” Moody said. “More informal things worked better because people just wanted to get out of their rooms and interact.”
In the event of another large snowstorm, Housing and Dining plans to work with information technology resources to expand communication to students who live off-campus and cannot receive e-mails through the residence halls.
Professors used Blackboard, Wimba Classroom, Google Wave, Facebook, Microsoft PowerPoint, Skype, e-mail and telephones to communicate with students during the storm. Twenty-one classes were held via Wimba during last year’s storms, according to the Center for Teaching, Research and Learning.
CTRL Director James Lee believes AU faculty is better prepared for another blizzard because of online classes. Since last February, enrollment in CTRL’s online tools training course has doubled.
“Just because we had a big snowstorm does not mean we stop [teaching],” Lee said. “It can happen again even if it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience … Swine flu kind of brought [emergency preparation] to the conscience, but ‘Snowmageddon’ made it a reality that [we] won’t forget.”
Weather emergencies require that essential staff members still be able to reach the University. Last year, Bon Appétit workers stayed in Georgetown hotels and 40 AU employees were housed on-campus over the course of a week, according to Moody. 
“Snow events take major commitment from the staff to be away from their families and to be here to provide services,” Moody said. “It’s great when students appreciate the [staff] that don't have a day off of work like many others have. Those are the real heroes of a snow event.”

2011-02-08,AU,study,"AU was ranked as having one of the highest numbers of Peace Corps volunteers in the nation this year, compared to other universities.
Last year, 55 AU students served in the Peace Corps, ranking it fourth with Cornell University on the list of medium-sized universities with the most Peace Corps volunteers. AU was also ranked fifth for the highest number of Peace Corps volunteers from graduate school.
AU ranked No. 2 in its division in 2009 with 51 students in the program.
Blair Ufer, the Career Center’s employer services coordinator, said AU has a high percent of students who volunteer compared to other universities.
“We’re extremely pleased with the number of volunteers relative to our undergraduate population,” she said. 
AU has significantly smaller undergraduate population than George Washington University — which ranked first on the medium-sized universities list — and other D.C.-area universities, but has a large number of volunteers.
Since the Peace Corps’ inception, 819 AU alumni have served in the Peace Corps, Ufer said. 
Stephen Chapman, public affairs specialist for the Peace Corps’ Mid-Atlantic Regional Office, said AU’s high number of volunteers is due to the school’s focus on international affairs.
“AU students have a strong interest in both service and international affairs, so the Peace Corps is a perfect way to launch a career,” Chapman said. “Volunteers return to the United States as global citizens, with leadership, language, teaching and community development skills that position them well for educational and professional opportunities.”
There are many benefits to joining the Peace Corps, including free housing, medical insurance, graduate study benefits and a readjustment allowance upon return to the U.S., according to Chapman.
Some of the countries where current AU alumni are serving include Zambia, Jordan, Ecuador, Honduras, Cambodia, Togo, South Africa, Bulgaria, Rwanda and Madagascar, Chapman said.
In 2009 and 2010, 51 AU students volunteered each year. This number has been steadily rising since 2006, when 34 AU students joined the Peace Corps.

2011-02-08,AU,study,"This past Thursday, I was invited by a squad of D.C. ROTC Cadets to one of their morning physical training sessions.???Being a enlisted Iraq veteran who has just returned from his second tour, my ego took a little hit after being beaten by 20 year old cadets during shuttle sprints (of course I patronizingly told them that if I had a college gymnasium to train in, I would be running circles around them).???After the workouts, the platoon leader called the cadets in, and told them that an article had been published in the American University newspaper that they might take offense to.???She told the cadets that while they may have strong feelings on the matter, they were not to criticize the article or respond publicly.??That’s just not what cadets do.
Make sense,?I thought.??Cadets are going to need to learn that discipline to keep their head down and stay focused on the mission, shrugging off praise and criticism alike, even when their first instinct may be to react.??
While the development of military professionalism and humility is a necessary part of the development of a commissioned officer, it comes with the drawback that ROTC cadets may be hampered from engaging in the dialogue necessary to justify their presence on campus when it is called into question by men such as Mr. Shapiro.
Good thing I’m not a cadet.
The practicable issue that this article poses to the students of American University has nothing to do with the concept of reserve officer training, but rather the following:??Are the male and female cadets who already attend American University deserving of the same common respect and dignity as the rest of the students on campus, or should they be ridiculed for their identity????By inferring soldiers are murderers, warmongers and delusional victims, Conor Shapiro makes it absolutely clear that cadets are second class students at American.
Perhaps it is hard to understand how deeply upsetting this rhetoric is to cadets and veterans alike, as our experiences and group culture are different from the non-military student.??The closest way to illustrate how cadets and veterans perceive this article is to humbly ask you, the reader, if you’ve ever been told that because of who you are, and that which you can’t change, you are somehow contemptible.??Being called a killer and warmonger may seem fair game to some, but for soldiers such criticism cuts to the fiber of our being, as it suggests that the service that has become the crucible of our lives will forever alienate us from our civilian brothers and sisters.?
Yet despite the discriminatory rhetoric employed by Mr. Shapiro, let this be absolutely clear:??No matter what our backgrounds may be, and no matter what our futures may hold, together we are American University.??At this school we pride ourselves on diversity not only of being, but also of beliefs, and by extension of this solidarity our differences may serve only to enhance the greater community.??As a student who has served two tours in Iraq, what has struck me most about American was how much I had to learn from students who demonstrated their service in different ways, from those that volunteer in the D.C. community to those brave study abroad students who have witnessed the uprisings in Egypt this past week.??Conor Shapiro would like to imagine American University’s relationship with the military as a binary between idolatry and criticism, praise and scorn.??As members of the military, we have asked for neither, but rather only the common equality and shared kinship with the rest of the student body.
The discussion over whether or not ROTC should be expanded is a legitimate discussion, and faculty and students alike should give serious thought and analysis to the matter.??Mr. Shapiro is by no means required to support the program.??But as with all students at American University, our cadets are owed the reciprocal dignity and respect that makes our school as exceptional as it is.??

Just so you know they give away free library pens at basically all of the help desks on the first floor.
Enjoy :)
• The recent waxiness of the tavern cups is unacceptable.  My Coke tastes like crayons.
• Employees of the Tavern: Smile! We're nice people. We're just hungry!
Diners at the Tavern: Treat the employees with some respect! They deserve it for putting up with our attitude every time they're overloaded with customers. 
• A housing lottery for students that inherently discriminates against those of us who have to work full-time jobs to pay for our education: if it's not in violation of some law or school code, it should be.
• I was in an GOVT class tonight and about 10 people had bottled waters in the class, including the teacher. STOP using bottled water. TAP WATER IS JUST AS GOOD. STOP WASTING PLASTIC! Am I the only one who notices this? Oh, and after you savor your beloved FIJI bottled water ... put it in the recycling! (it is only 2 feet away from the garbage)
• Dear resident who thinks that he/she owns the place,
Keep in mind that you share the floor with 50/60 other residents. We're sick of seeing your crap in the bathroom, in the kitchen (ALL over the counter drying or stacked up in the sink), and seeing the laundry room as your own closet. It's a bit much, and we're all sick of it. And your habits of you leaving your crap everywhere.
Sincerely, 
Tired of dealing with your stuff

Papyrus is even more of an abomination than Comic Sans. Helvetica all the way!

• I am proud to be a Wonk, and I will never deny it. 
• The food offerings at AU are pathetic. Get rid of Bon Appetit. I feel for the people working there (I worked in service for a long time) but they seem miserable and are angry most of the time. That, on top of really shitty and unhealthy food, is enough to make me want to check out GWU or Georgetown.
• Dear Tall Undergrad Guy in the gym: STOP walking around with a scowl on your face. It makes you look weak, especially since you’re not even THAT built.
• Can we stop judging each other based on wealth, putting people down for being ""rich kids"" or ""poor kids""? We all work hard, and I'm sure all of our parents work hard. Different upbringings do bring about different attitudes, but aren't we supposed to be in college learning our true attitudes, away from the comforts of home? Lay off!
• OIT needs to get it together. I got kicked off the Internet [I'm in Starbucks right now] for something I didn't do [I called them, they told me someone downloaded ""Tropic Thunder"" on my account. Never seen it, no interest. Wasn't me]. So I went to OIT yesterday at 3:00 and I was told they wouldn't be back from their meeting until 4:30. So I came back then, and they just never showed up, since they end work at 5:00. So I went at 3:00 today, and the girl at the desk basically told me they were gone for the day and I should come back tomorrow ""around 10 or 11 because that's when they're almost always here.""
Okay then, fine OIT. Just don't post on your sign that you're around 9:00-5:00 if you're not. I don't like having to go to Starbucks to get my lecture notes off blackboard.

Dear AU Central: I hate your e-mail ticket system. I have a request, I send it to you. I get a nameless, one-sentence reply. And your e-mail bot says my question is answered! Solved! And that my ""service request"" is now closed. Well, I asked a question about the same damn ticket after your inane reply, and what have I gotten back? Nothing. Let me talk to a REAL PERSON, AU Central.

• Founder's Ball changed my life in a very real, very fundamental way. Thank you SG and RHA!
• I don't use aderall either, and I don't understand people who do use who don't have ADD/ADHD. It feels like cheating. It's called self-control and self-discipline. Maybe instead of leaving everything to the last minute, y’all could learn how to balance a social life, work, and classes like I do. It's really not that hard. I hope real life kicks your asses.
Whenever someone tells me they're thinking of going to AU, I tell them if they're not going for SIS, then don't bother. It's not worth the price tag, administration, registrar problems, health-center fails and general disregard for students here. We're second to money. It secretly makes me very happy.
• The Dav has one dubstep song on their playlist.  It makes my day every time I hear it.
• I just got a book report assigned to me for the first time since about fifth grade.  The kicker? It's for an upper level philosophy class.
• Where did all the Tabasco Sauce in The Tavern go?
How can one attempt to enjoy a turkey cheesesteak without it?
• Dear Housing and Dining,
Thanks for putting me in a triple in the squalid shack you call Letts Hall this year and then refusing me priority housing over all the freshman for next year. I'm super excited that I get to live in the dungeons of Anderson Terrace while some frosh gets to live on 6.
Sincerely, 
Rising sophomore
P.S. TDR is overpriced, the only good things about it are Kevin, Christine, and waffle fries.
• To the people complaining about the wonk campaign-
Get over it. They spent the money and it's here whether anyone likes it or not. It's not like anyone outside of D.C. (or really anyone who doesn't pay attention to metro ads) knows anything about what a wonk is or its association to AU.

After that, I will become disillusioned by my fame and move to New Zealand's lush country side where I will work at a cheese producing farm. I will then return to the U.S. and finish my education in Southern California. Next I will start an unprecedented franchise of quality Italian food in SoCal so they can know how pasta is done. I will return to my native New York and live in Carol Gardens and lead a happy life with my family. But right now, I need to study for my midterm tomorrow.
• It was so extremely unprofessional and offensive to put Michelle Rhee on a ""panel"" with AU undergrads who played dress up career day and pretended to be experts. That made AU look so bad.
• I'm so tired of smokers polluting my lungs with poison. AU students for a healthy campus unite! Fight for a campus wide vote to ban smoking from campus. Hundreds of college across the country have done it, from private schools to public schools to community colleges. We can do it too. Fight for your right to clean air!
• Wow Roosevelt Institute, really? You had two hours to fix the sound on the “Waiting for Superman” movie showing and you gave up after 10 minutes. Wow. Thanks for ruining the movie, as no one could hear it since you didn't bother turning up the volume.
• I came to the event to hear Michelle Rhee speak, as the advertisement said. I didn't come to hear AU freshmen pretend to be on the same level of educational knowledge as her. That was so embarrassing and awkward for everyone at the event.

• I believe I have the most difficult jobs at AU, explaining the stupid ""neighborhood parking policy"". OMG! WE ALL HATE IT! I'm tired of telling people why they were cited in their own neighborhood. I'm sick of getting cursed at, yelled at and hung up on. Why do we even have such a policy??? And to the tiny old lady who keeps tattle tailing on people parked in the neighborhood, GET A LIFE! Stop calling us to make our lives terrible ... That is all.
• TDR needs fish and chips. Actually, the AU campus needs fish and chips.

2011-03-13,AU,study,"No AU students abroad in Japan were harmed in the 8.9 magnitude earthquake and tsunami there on March 11, nor are they in immediate danger from the damaged nuclear reactors, according to Associate Director of Media Relations Maralee Csellar.
Four students are studying abroad at Waseda University in Tokyo and all are accounted for. Six students studying with the School of International Service’s Dual Undergraduate Degree Program at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto did not feel the earthquake, according to Ethan Merritt, AU Abroad senior adviser. 
“There are no plans to evacuate the students,” Merritt said. “We’re basically seeing how things develop and staying in touch.”
AU officials have been in contact with officials at Waseda and Ritsumeikan and also contacted students via e-mail and Facebook to ensure their safety. 
Merritt said the largest issues right now are limited communication due to downed telephone lines, as well as problems with public transportation and traffic. 
“Waseda has not sustained significant damage,” Merritt said. “Not much damage or injuries were reported from Tokyo in general … students were shaken up but are all fine.” 
Both AU Abroad and Waseda officials are monitoring the situation at four nuclear power plants whose cooling systems have failed after power was cut off by the earthquake. The plant nearest to Tokyo is about 75 miles north of the city.
The program adviser at Waseda will reassess the situation Monday after speaking with Japanese government authorities, according to Csellar.
With a death toll of more than 1,500 lives, March 11’s earthquake is the worst natural disaster to occur in Japan in nearly 100 years, according to Japanese authorities.

You suck. That is all.
I really dread the days when it gets warm out and there are frat guys throwing a football out on the quad. Some of the guys were never taught to throw and throw like girls. I am a girl and I was properly taught how to throw a football. I am honestly embarrassed for them. It is also a huge turn off.

JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE ISSUES IS NO REASON FOR YOU TO BE A COMPLETE JERK FOR ME.
I'm pretty sure having this many flowers on campus is essential to my mental well being. The AU Grounds Crew rocks!
I am NOT a WONK. I am NOT a narrow-minded technocrat who specializes in one field. I am a broad-minded liberal arts major who enjoys learning about all sorts of subjects and takes pride in being well-rounded and NOT married to just ONE subject.
Dear Eagle,
Can you please actually cover all the interesting events that Women’s Initiative is hosting this month? They seem to all fall on times when I have class, but I would like to read about them before I graduate. Thank you.
why am I always the person who people come to talk about their problems with? Sure, I would always help a friend who needs to talk about a crazy boyfriend or what they want to do after graduation, but I get sick and tired of people whining about having homework, going to work or waking up at 8 a.m. Meanwhile, I have a mother diagnosed with a non-curable form of cancer, a father who has been unemployed for a year and I wake up at 6 a.m. Mon-Friday. I don't mind being the ""dependable"" friend, but it would be nice to have SOME type of recognition or for somebody to have the same consideration I show for them. So next time you're whining to a friend about how you didn't get the yoga class you wanted, think about what they might be dealing with while they listen to your meaningless rant. THANKS
No. WONK and Roosevelt Institute both live on the same level of Hell. Do not try to compliment WONK like that.
You are wrong. I can be a housewife after college while at the same time being a feminist. Why does raising the future generation of children get such little respect? The whole issue of family is completely ignored by feminist groups.
You know what I want? I want a guy to hook up with who won't either treat me like crap whenever I'm not naked or become clingy and needy and try to ask me questions about where this is going. Can't we just have sex, be friends and not take anything too seriously?
To the girl who yelled at me for trash talking Blends at Acapalooza: Yeah, I shouldn't have said anything in public. It was rude, I know. However, being out of tune is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact, and Blends was SO out of tune.
Is it so bad that I just want to live-rant the music that the Dav plays?  #sometimesshuffleisembarrassing
To the people who apparently hate the very idea of Women's Initiative: get over yourselves. If you really think women have no particular issues worth pursuing, you live in an ivory tower taller than theirs. If you think we need a Men's Initiative, get on that.

@ The Eagle article on the number of people AU students sleeps with was completely disgusting and one sided to me.  My number is one and it is going to stay that way for the rest of my life. Unless I know I am with the one person I am going to spend the rest of my life with, then I am not just going to hand over my body like fast food to some guy I meet at a party. Respect yourselves, people.
I didn't read that article, but my number is 9 and I don't think I have a problem with self-respect. I don't ""hand it over"" to ""some guy"" when I have a one-night stand — my body is MINE and when I have sex it's because I'm respecting my body's needs. I sleep around because I like to have sex. Having sex with someone doesn't mean they own you — it means both of you (hopefully) had a good time and shared a connection. That's it. Self-respect means I do what I want with my body without caring what judgmental pricks like you have to say about it.
Random statement of anger over arbitrary thing that can only be blamed on fate! DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
Dear Student Health Center,
I came in and spent $35 for you to tell me that I'm not sick, though clearly I am. But that's not even why I'm mad. You. Lost. My. Forms. That's ridiculous. It can't be that difficult to put a paper in a folder. I saw it done right before my eyes when I filled it out a SECOND time. Not only is it unprofessional, it's insulting. I don't particularly enjoy writing down all of my family's serious illnesses. It borders on ethics. There are certain negative aspects that come with the territory of acquiring medical care. I'm fine with that. Forcing me to recount my family's hardships is not one of those acceptable tribulations. AU, the Student Health Center is clearly understaffed/under-trained/whatever. If I'm paying all this tuition money, I expect my forms TO BE IN MY FOLDER! ...That is all. Thank you.
Why must you have a girlfriend? You obviously have a crush on me and it's driving me nuts in class when I see you sneaking looks at me. Argh.
I don't smoke, but I'd rather hang out with smokers than all the uptight jerks in this week's rants. Seriously, stop parroting everything you learned in your high school health class! Everything causes cancer. And even if you're allergic to smoke or something, stop whining — it's not that hard to avoid on campus. I can't even remember the last time I smelled smoke on campus and it was probably when I was voluntarily hanging out with friends who were smoking. If you're annoyed by people smoking near you, move! It's not like they're smoking indoors! And if you happen to walk through a cloud of smoke, get over it — the world does not revolve around you and it will not end because something smelled bad for .5 seconds in your life.
AU asks, ""What kind of WONK are you?"" Well, do you want the short answer or the long answer?
To the person who left his used cigarette butt on the floor of my hall: Are you serious? Get a flipping life. This is my home, damn it. How would you like it if I defecated on your doormat? Pretty sure you wouldn't appreciate it very much. Grow the frick up.
Holy wonk there were a lot of rants last week.
So happy I came to AU when they still let me place out of college writing. They're about to screw over a bunch of people who, you know, went to competent high schools.
A friend of mine, after telling multiple stories of how he hooked up repeatedly over the past few years, started complaining about not having a girlfriend at the moment. As someone who's had considerably less action, I wanted to punch him in the face.
@The Eagle, You guys are awesome! The Eagle and the rants are probably the things I will miss the most from AU (apart from my friends, of course).
Dear Greek Week,
I have not problem with you all going all out and raging for a week, celebrating your brotherhood and sisterhood and sharing all the good things about greek life with the rest of us. There are great aspects of greek life like philanthropy, support and the dedication to having a good time. It reminds me that while not a good fit for me, greek life is a great opportunity for many students.
But please. Clean up after yourselves. Did you even take a backward glance after you left Tenley on Saturday? It was absolutely disgusting both outside on the field and inside the building. Mud was tracked everywhere, and I know you don't have control over the weather but a little consideration for the space you occupy would go a long way. Don't litter, we don't need to live the rest of our weekend with your leftover shit everywhere.
Thanks.
That awkward moment when someone thinks that the rant you wrote is somebody else's.
I don't know, I kinda like the WONK thing. Could be a lot worse.
Living well (better than you) is the best revenge.
AU, please hire me. I just applied. I'm a poor first-year graduate student who can't find a job that pays enough to pay her tuition bills.
RE: What is that truck that’s been on the quad?
The EatWonky truck? They're an awesome and delicious poutine truck that is independent and unaffiliated with AU.

Dear Bike-Haters,
In D.C., it's totally legal for bikes to ride on the sidewalk. The only exception is downtown where there are clearly marked and established bike lanes. Furthermore, cyclists are allowed a FULL lane of the road, though some cyclists find it more comfortable to ride at the sides of the lanes. These laws change when in different Md. counties. Maybe do some research and get your facts straight before you receive a U-lock to the face.
Sincerely,
A Disgruntled Cyclist
April 5 Eagle Rants kind of suck. Maaaan, do we all need to get away from AU for a while.
I love this school. So far the most annoying thing is the people who rant. Grow up, stop being ungrateful and stopped being annoyed by such trivial things. Everyone here has it pretty good so stop being so whiny! And enjoy yourself
Sexwonks are too vanilla. And while I recognize vanilla as a kink, go beyond it.
We are going to be apart for a while, are you as distressed as I am? Let me know.
Big bald shuttle driver, I guess whole attempt at chivalry would have been cool back in the ’50s. But making me go to the back of the shuttle line so that all the girls can get on first and making me stand up so that a girl can take the seat I was in is really lame. Stop treating people differently because of their sex.
When my ghetto roommate threatened me both in person and on Facebook and screamed in my face, I told the Resident director, thinking he would do something. Since it is AU, he ignored my problem for two weeks. If I told AU I was living with a murderer they still would probably take their damn time. Sincerely, a student who’s sick of our disciplinary system that hardly seems to exist.
Just read these for the first time in a while and geez are people getting long-winded. For future reference fellow Eagle Ranters, if it's more than two sentences, people probably don’t care what you're upset about.
ACADEMICS: STOP BEING SUCH A COCKBLOCK
Watching the Humans vs. Zombies game this week is awesome. Things like this make me so proud of this nerdily wonderful school. Plus, anything that distracts me from the vortex of school and job-hunting is good these days.
Being at a school with more girls than guys, I should be happy that there is a guy who wants to be with me. He's being very nice and genuine, yet I've heard sketchy things about him. Not sure how to deal with this situation. :(
But I really like this other guy who I’ve hung out with a few times, and he's accompanying me to formal. Should I stick with the safe option (aka the formal date?) or should I hang out with the guy who's been very nice/genuine yet is possibly sketchy? Ahh.

I'm extra sorry if you had to step off the sidewalk to let someone pass because everyone knows grass and dirt combine to make lava.
I think AU should offer an HFIT meditation class. It would make so much sense.

GREEK WEEK IS THE BEST WEEK OF THE YEAR.
No one is entitled to anything.
@personal family issues ranter
My family is totally dysfunctional too. I hate the fights over rent money and everything. The bright side is that it gets much better when you graduate and become independent. The possible downside is that when you do find that real love, you may feel guilty that you love that person more than you love your own family. It's not necessarily a bad thing but a very awkward, unexpected feeling.
I recently noticed a sharp uptick in the number of bottle refilling spouts attached to water fountains. I am now so much more hydrated. AU WIN!!
Stats on Greek Week 2011:
Greeks Give Back collected almost 1,000 items of non-perishable food and over 1,400 cards for overseas troops. *EVENT OPEN TO ENTIRE AU COMMUNITY*
Pi Kappa Phi Wheelchair Basketball raised $4,000. *EVENT OPEN TO ENTIRE AU COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD*
SigEpic Comedy Night was also OPEN TO ALL AU STUDENTS.
Yes, some of the other events were targeted towards greeks. About 20% of students at AU are affiliated in a greek organization. If you can find a good reason why these students shouldn't be proud of their organizations, let me know. The Greek Programming Board worked for months to fundraise for the week, organize events, get sponsors and make the week as successful as possible. The events went on even with cold temperatures, rain storms, hail storms and more rain storms.
Stop complaining about how much fun greek life had last week and plan your own week of fun. They enjoyed it and have sunglasses to prove it.
Wait, why is Nate Bronstein such hot commodity around here? Really guys? I mean, he's a nice enough person, I guess, but nothing that special. Am I the only one who doesn't think he walks on water?
""uhhhhh green tea has no caffeine. Where have you been?""
Umm green tea has four times as much caffeine as white tea and over half as much as coffee. What planet do you live on?
Dear SG,
Please do something about the horrific Health Center policies. Why can they bill my doctor's appointment fee home but are incapable of billing the $20 co-pay home? This makes no sense. And if I have to pay $20 to go to the health center, I will just not go, and instead spread my untreated STDs around campus. You're welcome.
Do you seriously think you are CONSIDERATE for throwing your cigarette in the trashcan SOMETIMES instead of throwing it on the ground? Wow. Your narcissism astounds me. Smoking in public is narcissistic. Smoke in your own house/apartment and give YOURSELF cancer. The rest of us prefer to see our future grandkids grow up, thank you very much.
Why does TDR never have blackberries?
I miss Dairy Queen.
To the smoker who dislikes the lack of disdain for drug dealers: Last time I checked, prostitution and marijuana don't cause cancer. SMOKING CIGARETTES DOES. I work hard to stay healthy. If you want to smoke yourself to death, do it in your own residence, not on AU's campus.
Agreed. Green tea keeps me up all night. To the person who is ignorant about caffeine content: I recommend you use 'the internets' to gain yourself some sense (and some basic knowledge about caffeine).
To the selfish people who walk around campus smoking: Some people have asthma or severe allergies and your smoking puts them in danger. It's more than just an inconvenience. Please be considerate of others. And my professor is pregnant. I'm sure she doesn't appreciate her baby being subjected to secondhand smoke because you are too selfish to smoke in private.
I'm really sick of all the class warfare on campus. Yes I have a $10 million trust fund. But I shop at thrift stores (on the rare occasions I do shop) and I am not flashy with my money. Stop judging everyone and dismissing them just because they are rich. I want to devote my life to solving international conflict for little to no pay. I am NOT shallow just because I have money.
I wish someone were generous enough to offer free meal swipe for students like me who live off-campus.
- Student who is hungry and wishes to have some good TDR food!
I love the penis-shaped and breast-shaped lollipops! We should have more of those to suck on daily!
:o
I told my mother I have a girlfriend. Her first answer was ""Does she know?""
Dear Eagle Rants Editors,
Do you really not fact check idiotic false statements people make that are easily googleable? Green tea DEFINITELY has caffeine. Everyone knows that (except last week's confused ranter).
[Editor’s Note: The Eagle only edits Rants for occasional grammar, spelling and Associated Press style errors. We leave accuracy and opinion up to you ranters.]
It's kind of messed up how a romantic interest can control your emotions and well-being. I haven't hooked up / been involved with a single person at AU and I am totally fine with that. 
To the person who says we should get off the smokers' backs because lots of people have alcohol vices: If someone wants to get drunk until they throw up, that is their own health problem. It isn’t affecting MY health. I would have no problem with smokers if their habit were only affecting them (i.e. if they smoked in their own room). But I have a problem with smokers walking around smoking and spreading toxic cancerous fumes for people who DO NOT chose that lifestyle. They are forcing their bad habits on me. And that is not okay. When will AU join the hundreds of other colleges around the country that have become tobacco free?
I wish I had a puppy. I need someone/something to love me.
To the person who says we shouldn't care about smoking because everything causes cancer: Wow. You really need to take a health class or a statistics class. Or just get some common sense. Smoking doesn't just possibly lead to some negative consequences. It's been proven above and beyond to be extremely toxic. Have you seen pictures of babies born to mothers who smoke? Well, THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO THE REST OF CAMPUS.
The worst kind of hypocrites are people who claim to care about the environment, but then go out and smoke, releasing toxic chemicals into the air and accelerating global warming.
Dear Eagle Rants Editors,
Please learn your grammar. I submit Eagle Rants with correct punctuation and then you change them.
Correct Example: I am going to the store to buy milk, eggs, and cheese.
Incorrect example: I am going to the store to buy milk, eggs and cheese.
Note the comma.  And please stop erasing the commas from my Eagle Rants because you destroy the rants and create needlessly long sentences that were meant to be compounded by a comma.
[EDITOR’S NOTE: We take out the comma because Associated Press Style dictates that there is no comma before the word “and” in a list. But we appreciate your concern for our writing skills.]
Dear girl in the library who is alternately laughing and crying loudly,

To the girl who wrote,
""I let my friends walk all over me. I pay dues to a sorority whose girls collectively don’t give a shit about me or my wellbeing. I drunkenly hook up with random guys well past the point where I would soberly say stop. I hope one day I stop feeling so worthless and isolated and gain some self-esteem.""
 Your rant really affected me. I have been in the same position many times before. I know that it sounds stupid, but the best advice someone ever gave me was that you won't be loved or respected if you don't have love or respect for yourself. It made me really angry when I first heard it, but eventually I built up my self-confidence, it took a long time, and it wasn't easy. Although, you’re already a member of sorority maybe you could try joining an on-campus club or at least go to one of their events to give yourself a change of scenery where you can meet new people who might share the same interests as you. At the very least it will give you a break from your negative surroundings and you'd be doing something that you find interesting or enjoy with other people with similar interests. I just want to tell you that you're not worthless and to keep your head up. Don't let people walk all over you. I tried for years to make everyone around me happy and as a result sacrificed my own happiness. It's time you put yourself first. I'm not trying to preach to you. But, I hope in someone you get this message and it makes you feel better by knowing that there are people out there who care.

I can't believe that so many people went to hear Colin Powel in Bender Arena. This guy has blood on his hands, lied to the entire population for the sake of his career and ideology, and when he comes here to explain that he is raising fund for a visitor center at the Vietnam War Memorial, you applaud him? There wouldn't be any need for Vietnam War Memorial without people like him. When I was 8, my country was bombed for more than a thousand days, because of people like him, forcing me to move and become a refugee. Shame on you who welcomed him like a movie star. You encourage the next generation of hawks.

Today on the AU shuttle, some incredibly handsome young man started dancing, singing and clapping his hands. He kept insisting through song that he was on a ""party bus."" He then impressively improvised verses about how society made him feel he couldn't express himself and since he couldn't take it anymore, he was going to dance and sing in public. He invited everyone on the bus to join in, but we all declined. Why are we so afraid to dance and sing in public? I want to get on the party bus.

And I can tell by looking that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked

2011-04-12,AU,study,"When an opportunity comes up for an additional $300,000 to help the victims of sexual assault and prevent further ones from happening, you’d think that AU would be all over it. In addition to the programs we already have, getting that extra funding would be a big step toward reducing rape on campus. Nothing too controversial there, right?
Wrong. When the University decided to apply for a Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grant, they failed to follow through on their original decision. And one of the main reasons was that the grant requires all incoming freshman to complete a sexual assault education program, like AlcoholEdu, except it’s actually mandatory. And that’s a reason I just flat-out don’t understand.
Seriously, can anyone give me one good reason not to make sexual assault education mandatory? I’m sorry, but is it too much of an annoyance for freshmen to find a stop on their account because they didn’t complete SexualAssaultEdu? The consequences of having a student body uneducated about sexual assault far outweigh the mild annoyance of having to do this course.
Incoming freshmen are about to enter a world that’s completely new and will confront them with situations they’ve never considered before. Yes, there is usually a rape component to high school health (although, who knows what you learn in abstinence-only programs), but it’s often a very “No means no!” based program. And sex in college is a hell of a lot more complicated than that.
This type of education actually can help students understand sexual assault. Despite the complaint that AlcoholEdu is “cheesy,” it actually seems to work. Study after study finds that students who enter freshman year without completing AlcoholEdu have a significantly higher chance of engaging in “problematic drinking,” “high-risk drinking-related behavior” and overall drink considerably more than their peers who complete AlcoholEdu. There’s no data on SexualAssaultEdu specifically, but it’s probably fair to extrapolate that these online programs are somewhat effective.
So why not make SexualAssaultEdu mandatory? And why let that stand in the way of getting even more funding for sexual assault prevention and programming? There’s almost nothing you can do that’s crossing the line in terms of preventing sexual assault.

Dear AU Financial Aid Office: Please make a note of all of the students who left campus just before midnight on a Sunday evening so that they could go rally at the White House about the Bin Laden killing. Clearly they don't care about studying during finals week, and since the Metro was closed, they had enough income to spend on a round-trip cab ride. I don't have that kind of money, I'm studying hard, and I really need more financial aid. Just keep that in mind, plzkthxbai.

It's fraud the way doctor's offices try to make you think a pap smear is required to get birth control. It is NOT required! European countries find it backwards that American doctors would withhold birth control until they get to ""examine"" you. Why are women standing by this oppression? Why is women's initiative not fighting for women's equality and instead wasting their time on trying convince us that all men are rapists and drunk sex is rape. True feminists should not stand for this. Women: Did you know you are NOT required by law to get a pap smear before being given birth control? The student health canter (and likely any other health center you go to) will try and push one on you because it is an way for them to make $$$$. Are they screening you for colon cancer? Lung cancer? Lymphoma? (all of which occur more frequently than cervical cancer) Nope. They are using your female sexuality against you and charging you for pap smears when you ARE NOT required to get them. What is Women\'s Initiative doing about this (the most gender oppressive issue in our nation)? NOTHING. Take a stand.
If you are not an AU student, then that makes sense that you do not get free security. Security for an event, is a privilege for AU students because they are paying the salaries.

2011-09-13,AU,study,"If you or your friends have a Facebook, you know the Tom Petty quote about college. It’s too long to print, but it encourages students to stop worrying about GPAs and concentrate on being irresponsible. I’ve always knocked it as an easy thing to say for millionaires, but after four years of observation, I find most of those who followed his advice have just as good GPAs as those who didn’t. 
The system seemed broken, and swinging my Eagle press credentials like the pistols they are, I went to string-up every smart kid’s favorite villain: grade inflation.
First stop: the Interwebs. A recent article, “A History of College Grade Inflation,” on the New York Times economic blog reports on the findings of researchers at Teachers College at NYU who study the distribution of grades. The number of A’s given out has nearly tripled over the past 70 years, to the point where nearly half of all grades given are A’s. I shudder to think what the School of Communication’s statistics are, where two comments on a discussion board assure your good fortune. Am I really the über-genius my mom tells me I am? More on that in next week’s column. (Spoiler alert: I am.)
Next stop: disgruntled smart kid, i.e., the victim. I found one in David Park, a senior in the School of International Service, who is intelligent, articulate and brooding — and single! 
He echoed the researchers at Teachers College when he said the reason for the inflation is “due to the tacit agreement between students and professors that if we get inflated grades, they will be indemnified with good enough evaluations to keep their jobs.” He then tearfully recapped how grade inflation has robbed him of the chance to differentiate himself from the pack, how it keeps the least challenging professors employed and how that is hastening the decay of the higher education system. 
David turned out to be a real downer, but he made some good points. I couldn’t let him write my column though, so to gain another perspective I visited Sue Gordon, the director of career development at the AU Career Center. I was sure she would shed some light on the chaos grade inflation must be playing on graduate school applicants and getting top-paying jobs. 
She didn’t — instead shunting my obvious tilt by reminding me how little GPAs matter after your first job, how really only financial and consulting firms set bare minimum GPAs (usually around an attainable 3.0 or 3.5) and how other factors like letters of recommendation are huge in getting into grad schools. My faith in the downfall of American education was shaken. 
Grasping for answers and compliments, I called upon Associate Director of Merit Awards and all-around nice lady Joan D. Echols. Her take: it’s terrible, but top students will find a way above the rising tide of 4.0s.
“Beyond the grades, undergraduates can set themselves apart by collaborating with faculty on writing a paper or doing research,” she said. “And it’s a more enriching undergraduate experience.”  
She made a lot of sense, and not only because her sentences didn’t include the word “indemnified.” Seeing as how AU produced nine Boren Scholars last year and seven the year before, which is the second most in the nation, it doesn’t seem like the school has felt any negative effects of the grade inflation. 
And thus my witch-hunt ended with me deciding the witch isn’t such a bad influence on the neighborhood. If grade inflation forces our top students to do more than memorize facts, to earn their way in their field as an intern or make their mark doing research, then maybe it has been a blessing in disguise.  
GPAs have never been a good measure of a student’s ability, just as student evaluations have never been a good measure of a professor’s. As GPAs become more uniformly high, graduate schools and employers will have to weigh them less when considering applicants and find other ways to recognize the best and brightest.  
To modify the old Ibu axiom, GPAs should be respected, but achievement should be revered. Or was I the only one who did the African Writing homework, you Petty-listening slackers?

2011-09-13,AU,study,"Having sex in the dorms calls for sensitivity and special attention to the cultural mores that govern the florescent-lit halls we call home during the academic terms. While baby Eagles debate age-old questions like spit or swallow, other issues have traditional answers that are worth reviewing.
1. Get a smush room
In order to set the mood, you should work with your roommate(s) to ensure a sexy scenario that avoids awkward walk-in moments, unless that is a kink for all parties involved. Despite daily cleaning of the restrooms, I maintain that sex in common areas  downright offend the sensibilities of the ordinary student. No shower, cement-block study cell or stairwell can take the place of your very own, private smush room (which you probably share with one or two other people). Simply put, the formula is lose the roommate, lock the door and lube up your barrier devices.
2. Be considerate of neighbors
Even though you have created a sanctuary for you and your sexual partner(s), you might disturb the peace if you do not keep the noise down. Keep in mind that the building is not private, even if your smush room is, so keep the sexual hullabaloo at a minimum. And please, no hanky panky or anatomy review sessions in the laundry room in hopes of avoiding the noise issue. Keeping sex between you and your consenting partners qualifies as basic polite behavior.
3. Know the schmuck before you f***
Know the sexual history of your partner before you get going. No one wants a sexually transmitted infection, which might not present the obvious symptoms that diseases cause. For example, the most common STI, chlamydia, may “silently” cause pelvic inflammatory disease and permanent damage to reproductive tissues in women. Silent as in most people have no symptoms. 
Tell your partner about your most recent STI test and about past sexual partners. Since HIV can take up to three months to appear in testing results, you should let your partner know of any potential risk for infection, even if you came up negative.
If you need to be tested, visit I Want The Kit online at www.iwantthekit.org. They will send you a kit to test for chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis free of charge. Then, find a location to get a free HIV test at www.hivtest.org. The Student Health Center also offers testing services.

One online commenter even claimed the columnist simply wrote the piece to get girls (a strategy that has worked terribly for me), and many more wrote things not fit to print. 
Disillusioned with the fabled etiquette of the Internet, when my friend Cheryl Chan asked what this week’s column would entail, I responded, something noncontroversial, like conserving pandas. 
When she responded in all seriousness (like my columns) that pandas are the most controversial bear out there right now, I decided I hated the constant need of AU kids to argue about anything.
Chan’s dissonance reminded me of the time I ate at a restaurant once with a bunch of my SIS friends, all decent individuals. As we talked about our future plans, the conversation turned to the Peace Corps. While I held my opinion in check (it’s a fine way for those who studied abroad in Europe to see the world), the others were essentially divided on whether it’s helping people or it’s not helping people. 
Both sides made intelligent points, but all of a sudden my one friend just got up, said she didn’t want to take part in any more of this ignorant conversation, and walked away. At that moment, I saw my entire combative AU academic career unfold in front of me: my year as an SIS student spent arguing over international aid, my two weeks as a lit minor arguing over Achebe’s decision to write in English and all my time spent in SOC arguing over the merits of the serial comma. Contention has filled my classroom experience; do I really need more of it?
But while this flashback within a flashback played out in my head, Chan prattled on. “Yeah, pandas drain conservation funds that could save many more species and habitats, when evolution dictates they should go extinct.” Did Chan just make a convincing argument to pull the plug on pandas? 
“But there’s the other side too, by saving pandas, we’re saving that whole ecosystem. And I learned all this while studying abroad in London, you hater,” she continued. This debate fascinated me — that there was even a debate fascinated me — and I spent a considerable amount of time fact-checking her claims (admittedly mostly on YouTube, watching the little fur balls sneeze). Chan’s initial disagreement and subsequent reasoning not only helped me learn about a topic I didn’t know existed, but think from a different point of view. And so it came to be that a little Chinese export taught me the value of debate. Chan helped too, of course.  
Debate is healthy. As Ibrahim Babangida said, “Debate and divergence of views can only enrich our history and culture.” Had Babangida, military dictator of Nigeria from 1985-1993, followed his own advice, he might not have been thrown out in another military coup. I could regale you with stories from my aforementioned SIS stint of the importance of dissent and discussion to the political process, but I’m not trying to get you to argue more, just antagonize less.
When I proclaimed my hatred of AU’s love affair with argument mere paragraphs ago, I confused debate with derision and dismissal. However, based on my anecdotal observations, I’m not alone in that mistake. 
It’s important to debate the effectiveness of the Peace Corps, the raison d’etre of pandas and the opinions of columnists. However, as I tried to convey in my anecdotes (and regular readers will point to other examples), irrelevant ire is a fallacy likely to convince few people. So the next time someone dares to have a viewpoint different than your own, tell them they’re wrong the right way.

2011-11-09,AU,study,"•This Rant is currently longer than my paper due Friday. :/
•These hands don't even look like mine anymore.
•I always thought SPA Leadership was like the honors program (i.e. useless and annoying) but without the scholarships … I may put up with crap but at least my tuition is free? Oh, I guess you guys did sell us Taco Bell a couple times freshman year … I did enjoy that. Is there a financial reason to stay in the program … If not, why don't you disgruntled folks bail?
•Dear ""Every time I try to get “Beauty and the Beast” out of the library, it’s checked out. I need to meet my fellow Disney-lovers."" I'm the one who had it checked out! It's my favorite movie of all time! Let's be best friends?
•What if we had Eagle Rants categories like ""relationship rants,"" ""roommate and friend rants,” ""school rants,” etc.?
•Eagle sucks for getting rid of anonymous commenting two years ago. Now no one comments on articles or Rants because they don't want to register. And now no one gives me advice on the issues I rant about. And Eagle still doesn't have an anonymous advice column. Major fail.
•@SHINee and U-Kiss fan: If you're cool with 2NE1, Brown-Eyed Girls, Outsider and BIGBANG, you might be interested in hanging out with my roommate and I. Our room=K-Pop zone
•True bliss is finding someone that you love more than you could ever possibly love yourself, and knowing they feel exactly the same way. That they would take a bullet for you because they would rather die than live without you. I'm not much for bragging, but that's what I have and that's why I'll always be happy :)
•Men: Stop encroaching on my space in class! You are not entitled to any more desk space than any other student, so CLOSE YOUR LEGS!
•""I’m trapped in a cycle of slothfulness followed by frantic work, all wrapped up in self-loathing and despair. Hello senior year …""
•I feel you completely. As a freshman.
•I just read CS's op-ed, ""Six packs are no match for social norms,"" and it was so well-written that I became instantly turned on by him. I've never met him but I want to now … badly. Find me, stat.
•I only read Eagle Rants to make sure people aren't ranting about me
•""You know your life is strange when you’re excited to go back to OHIO so that you can Rant about Korean pop music/dramas. V.V I need more Kpop friends at AU so that I can blast some SHINee and U-Kiss with them <3"" 
•Who the heck from Ohio listens to Korean Pop????
•You're an amazing photographer … I think that's sexy. We should hookup again sometime.
•I don't want to listen to you talk with your dad. I don't want to wave at people on Skype every time I walk in. I don't want to hear the awkward breaks in conversation when the door opens. Thanks. Now I know what grades you got on your tests … This isn't high school, sweetie. I don't care.
•I am sick of the trust fund babies in the school spending their parents’ money while not learning a thing. I can’t afford to have AU friends
•That was NOT AVOCADO that I just ate. I don't know what it was, but it was NOT AVOCADO.
•Ironic how ""Pronto"" takes a long time to make paninis.
•""Yes"" does not count as ""words of affirmation.” You need to read ""The Five Love Languages,” Eagle Rants Editor. I need to be told how special I am.
[Editor’s note: You’re special.]
•Can someone please start a Disney movie appreciation club, during which we watch Disney movies once a week and then maybe play a board game of Disney Trivia? This would make my life.
•The clothes you lent me are going where they belong … with the homeless guy by Z-Burger.
•I hate when you forget to turn off your swag at night and wake up covered in girls …
•Hey Hughes 6 — LIVE A LITTLE. Your Teddy had the time of his life on Hughes 5.

•Dear people who #hashtag everything, please restrict this to Twitter. You're obnoxious — especially when you say something like ""Hashtag first world problems.""

•I'm so horny I could cry. You're a guy AND my boyfriend; that means you should always be down to have sex with me. Am I dating the only guy on the planet that doesn't want to have sex daily???
•Berlin from Salsa dressed up as Lady Gaga in her bubble costume. This officially makes her the most epically awesome person ever.
•To paraphrase a “Friends” episodes, I haven't had sex, I'm worried it's changed and I haven't gotten the memo.
•So my best guy friend is totally awesome, but lonely and single. And my best girlfriend is totally awesome yet lonely and single. Yet neither one is interested in being set up with the other.
•We had a really legit, albeit drunken, conversation the other night. Because AU social life is weird, I'll probably never see you again.
•Just when I was starting to feel good about my body for once … I start feeling fat again.
•""asdfjkl;"" Should be officially added to the dictionary. I know of no other words to describe the feeling ""asdfjkl;"" describes.
•Death to all past ignorant Eagle Rants. This is to address some of the most idiotic rants I've read in the past.
•1. TDR, Tavern and Aramark workers are NOT your personal maids. Stop complaining that they do not bow down to your over-sized egos. We're all big kids now; clean up after yourself.
2. Why is the ""suspect"" in almost every ""crime alert"" described to be a tall African-American male? AU you need to step up your creativity.
3. Congratulations to American University's increase in diversity … I'm no longer the ONLY black person in class. There's two of us now!
•I wonder how many rants I can get published in one day …
•Is it ironic that I am procrastinating on my Civil Disobedience readings by ranting?
•Students, when you are in TDR and drop a utensil or food DO NOT try to pick it up quickly and put it back. You are not slick. Most likely someone will see you and call you out.
•Also, when hovering over food do not sneeze or cough period. But at least, if you have to, cover your mouth. Cough into your elbows, not your hands then try to touch all over the food that we all have to eat. Who raised you? Cover it up!
•Oh no no nooooo don't funk with my heaaaart.
•Lunch at Tenley Cafe is seriously underrated. Stir-fry FTW!
•Laundry Thef t(caution this is a true story):
•If I'm doing my laundry and I come back three minutes after my laundry is finished, DO NOT touch my clothes. At the same token, do not leave your laundry in the machine all day. And do not go shopping through people's laundry. I’ve been robbed of half of my wardrobe and I'm sick of it! If I find you wearing my shirt that I've had since gymnastics in the 7th grade, I will find you and it will not be pretty.
•Free things from Panera: baguette, coffee thermos, cookies. It's like they're compensating for something …
•Dear Cars in Ward Circle,
Do NOT honk and curse at me when I cross in the crosswalk when my light is green and your light is red. Next time I will jump on the hood of your car and proceed to imitate a gorilla until you understand that red means stop.
Sincerely,

•Dear jealous of rape victims: rather than get into a debate, I’ll just say LOL.
•To the Phonathon inquirer: actually, both. 
•Dear AU Central, why do I have to come to your office and communicate with people who do not know what they're talking about? Talking in circles about nothing? Yeah, real helpful, guys. On top of that, why do I have to stand in front of the entire office like a convicted felon trying to get on parole, while you scream all my business so loudly? Like, what happened to confidentiality? I think the whole office overheard my Social Security number, birthplace and future college debt, yeah. Thanks, AU central.
•Shout out to all the classes with deceivingly cool titles but consist of lousy professors, boring material and long unnecessary readings. For example ""The Roots of Racism.”
•Dear RPG geek, we actually play World of Darkness quite often in ATV …
•To all the people ranting about Tommy, How many of you actually listened to the original album? Actually, without looking it up, name eight songs on the album. I'm fairly certain most of you don't actually know what it's about.

•If The Eagle can't do the police blotter anymore, I think much more care should be given to select good Eagle Rants. Seriously, this last selection in the paper edition was deeply unfulfilling. Not only am I disappointed in the ranters, I am disappointed with the editor's choice to put in non-Rants. The ""notice the pleasant things in life"" type quotations. This isn't MLIA or MMT, these are the Eagle Rants, WTF. Have some integrity!

•@I think it’s really mean that people are saying such rude things about the AU play: Part of being in the theater industry is dealing with criticism. Sometimes that criticism is harsh. It's an important skill for performers to develop a tough skin. Also, most of the criticisms I noticed were about directorial decisions, and not about the performers themselves. The director is a big boy and can take care of himself.
•Before there were schweddy balls, there was the SCHWEDDY BEAR!

2011-12-06,AU,study,"•yesterday I purposely turned the encyclopedia on the first floor of the library to page 1089.



•There is this guy who kind of looks like a young hot Robert Downey jr...thick glasses and everything....but I can't tell if he's gay or just another hipster. So RDJ lookalike, if you aren't gay, make eye contact with me at TDR and let's watch iron man together.
•@person annoyed about sniffling: It is my biggest pet peeve when people are annoyed at people who sniffle. It's a frickin bodily function, it's not a bomb exploding in your face. Sometimes there aren't tissues around, or sometimes your nose still runs even after you've blown it. Chill the f*** out.
[Editor’s note: Thanks for the laughs!]
•editor, I'm sorry your so sad. in al honesty these rants SOMEWHAT remind me of last year. I think it's just last year we had police blotter, collegeacb, and more active userson LAL that funny stuff around campus got posted on here.
here's my rant: I went an entire day wearing my underwear insideout and backwards (without realizing) and then I noticed my shirt tucked into my undies. SORRYNOTSORRY
•@jog on first date
DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER ASK A GIRL TO GO ON A JOG AS A FIRST DATE!!! I DONT CARE IF SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE NEEDS TO JOG, OR LOOKS LIKE SHE JOGS BY HERSELF ALL THE TIME!! (Unless you discussed jogging as one of both of your favorite past times it should NOT come up now) THAT IS SUCH A LOADED PROPOSAL AND CAN BE TAKEN THE COMPLETE WRONG WAY!
dear god i worry for the boys at this school.
•@""I find I learn about my fellow American U students just by spying on their computer screens in the library""  haha yes! I feel like such a creeper but it's so much fun. glad to know I'm not alone
•Next semester is my last one before I graduate. Despite the fact that the last four years have given me a lot to rant about, I really do love AU. My life started when I came to college.
•Your Eagle Rants suck
•@ChristianRepublicanboy, get at me please. I love country music and america. So sick of Dav hipsters....
•@is it weird to ask a girl to go on a jog as a first date? i want it to be casual, but part of me doesnt think this is a good idea... feedback?
like seriously dude? its a sad day when a JOG can be considered as a possible date option. #poorcollegekidproblems
•@""is it weird to ask a girl to go on a jog as a first date?"" As long as you don't make it sound like she needs to go for a jog I think it sounds like a cute idea.
•Best party of my college career involved no rando hookups, but lacked pants, and from what I can remember had some very scandalous garland. I'm not sure if this is what regressing or progression feels like....
•Dear semiboyfriend. Call me your girlfriend or lose me. Sincerely, Frustrated and wondering if I'm your booty call.
•hey eagle rant editor! i want to write an anonymous relationship advice column, who can i talk to to get such a thing going! i think it would be awesome, and fit perfectly on the eagle rants page in an opinion section :D
[Editor’s note: We don’t publish anonymous columns. If you’re interested in writing a column with your name on it, email thescene@theeagleonline.com to pitch your idea.]
•""I'm sick of one night stands"" Challenge accepted.
•@""@The rant about AP credits:"" I said suck because they still do... But my grammar does suck, I'm sorry. Maybe that's why I have no AP credits?
•I have 8 papers due in 6 days... 5 of which were assigned since last Wednesday. FML.
•How many pages have you written in the past week for classes?  I'll start the bidding at 22.
[Editor’s note: See below. Someone raises your bid to 29.]
•I'm stuck on campus until the very last day before winter break. As possibly the only person left in my building on that day, I will be repurposing my lounge's furniture for elaborate shenanigans in the hallways.
•@Christian and Republican is impossible: It's not. I am and proud of it :) and other Christian Repubs, let's be friends.
•So the only free time I have to go into the city is during the weekend and that happens to be the time every week when the Metro SUCKS. Thank you DC for ""amazing public transportation""...
•Study break: I'm making little elf suits for the mice in the dorm.
•@ All the people who posted a rant about me after I said I wish someone would: You guys are the best. Seriously made my day, THANK YOU!!
•PSYCHO YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT.
•That awkward moment when the librarians are making more noise than the students on the quiet floor. You can stop yelling when you talk. Oh, and please stop hitting on each other...
•@your swipe is only worth $8... the cost of a swipe varies based on what meal plan you have.
•@Fourteen days: you can do this!
[Editor’s note: Ranters supporting each other makes The Eag so happy!]
•that awkward moment where you see typos in Eagle Rants.
[Editor’s note: Happens every day. The Eagle is tired of editing Rant grammar and is leaving it all up to you guys!]
•Wanted:  A boy who like Kiel James Patrick.  Please come find me.
•""How the hell did I not ask you out? The opportunity practically presented itself on a silver platter and I didn't take it. I'm an idiot"" You can make up for it ;) next time you see her!
•That unfortunate moment when you realized that the guy who gave you a ride back from a party (while you were sober) had some things in common with you and you didn't do anything about it.
•Before I started lifting weights I was like a 120 lb. virgin.. As soon as I touched my first weight it was like BOOM, still a virgin
•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?
•@""You know how girls get, right?"" Yes, I do, because I AM a girl, and I hate girls who make excuses for not having a handle on their emotions. Is it your time of the month, sweetheart? It's mine too, you don't see me sobbing and yelling and freaking out - take some Midol and get over yourself!""
I love you
•@truthaboutKristenStewart: It's all over Tumblr.
•@I don't think a good morning text and a goodnight text is too much to ask from a long distance boyfriend. Am I wrong here?
You're wrong to have a long distance relationship
•damnit. yesterday I ranted I had fourteen days left in this hellhole abroad. turns out I had fifteen and today I have fourteen. why didn't I change my flight when my mom suggested it? DYING.
•why do i seem to find the jerks who are only physically interested in me? Of course, the only decent guy who's interested in me AND my personality is abroad right now, and I'll be abroad next semester #timingfail :(
•Hey what's with the hating on Letts  4 North? Sure almost everything has broken at some point, but at least our floor is tight
•Why in the hell have the Eagle Rants gotten so pitiful and scathing? I remember the last time I sniped someone's grammar just to be an ass; I remember the last time I ignorantly bashed on someone's religious beliefs and politics. Seriously people, rants are NOT for:
-Relationship classifieds
-Poetry
-Public policy debate
-Being a dick
-Etc...
So, let's get this nice and crystal clear: play nice, play fair, and don't be a complete tool. Sincerely,
- All the normal people who read these
•If Greece defaults on their debt, what does that mean for Greek Life!?!
•@""Wow, Clark and Roper Halls were the ones that saved the most energy last month..."" I'll have you know that students in both halls took the challenge quite seriously and purposefully reduced unnecessary electricity use, even going so far as to unplug the vending machines. So thanks for mocking us.
•Why is it that being a conservative at AU automatically makes everyone hate you? I'm not rude to you about your political beliefs, don't be rude to me about mine. And for the record, conservative =/= republican.
•That moment where you're hooking up with one of the 3 guys in your class and none of your classmates know.
•That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.
•If you missed the basketball game Monday night, you really missed out. People need to start going to games, our team is actually really freaking good!!
•""is it weird to ask a girl to go on a jog as a first date? i want it to be casual, but part of me doesnt think this is a good idea... feedback?"" DO IT. if she likes jogging too! otherwise it could be awkward.
•""How the hell did I not ask you out? The opportunity practically presented itself on a silver platter and I didn't take it. I'm an idiot"" next time! im sure you'll have another chance!
•Were you in IB in high school?  Wait, really?  I didn't realize you were, I guess I didn't hear you the first twenty times you mentioned it in class.  Stop thinking and acting as if you're better than everyone else.  You're not.  And also, stop answering other students' questions before the professor gets to them; I'm paying over $100 a class to learn from HIM, not some prissy-assed girl who thinks she knows more than the man with the Ph.D. in the front of the room.
•Dear next door neighbor: I'm super delighted you like playing electric guitar so much but it would be awesome if you could do it less than FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK and maybe turn your amp down a little, plug in some headphones or realize that we hear you ALL THE TIME I especially enjoy it when you stop playing guitar and just start singing at the top of your lungs, it really brightens my day
•""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other..."" This is intense but just adorable. Make plans to see this person again. I'm sure they want to see you too!
•Dear Professor,
I appreciate you assigning us a 3,000 word essay on an event that happened in North Korea during 2011..  and not teaching us a damn thing this semester.  This should be fun, because you know.. There is so much information available on an event from North Korea... in 2011... /sigh/
•Rob Battaglia resigned from the AUSG Senate...one less member to take themselves too seriously
•@Oregon pronunciation: I know how you feel. Signed, student from Arkansas
•I know how stressed out I am by the number of times I masturbate during the week.
•To the first date jogger-- depends on the girl, but I personally would worry that I""d be sweaty and gross while jogging. Maybe a walk instead? That's still pretty casual.
•Dear Roommate,
I love you but your biddie best friend has to go. Every time she visits our room, I want to scream...
Sincerely, love you not her.
•@dear person who wants to get to know me (the one who plays roller coaster tycoon)...do you love math?-- I love both!!!!!!!
•I hate classes where EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD is due the last day of the semester. Spread the misery out a little, please?
•Dear stupid giggling biddies,
The quiet floor is called the QUIET floor for a reason. Don't bring your unwanted noise here.
•@""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other for a long time..."" I know exactly how you feel-- I ran into a guy who's that person to me this weekend. I had just convinced myself to give up but every time I see him... I can't V.V and I almost never see him.
•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.
•The other day I was in CVS and I saw some guy smelling a bottle of shampoo, and I totally freaked him out by running up to him and telling him really excitedly that I do the same thing. Then he was embarrassed and said he was trying to do it all sneakily so no one could see...
•@The NAVY ranter-- Don't be hatin' on the Air Force. I'm a proud Air Force sister. The Chair Force saves the country one cup of coffee at a time ;)
•Don't re-download eagle secure.  Disconnect from the internet, connect to ""connect2eaglesecure,"" wait, and then select ""eaglesecure"" from the available wifi options.  You may have the repeat this process if it doesn't work immediately.  Beats re-downloading though.
•How many double-spaced pages have you written for classes this past week?  Winner gets the right to b**** about it.  Bidding starts at 29 pages.
•Why hasn't the IT department been fired yet?
•To the girl in my M/TH American Political Parties class who doesn't shut up,
SHUT UP! Your answers and comments are incredibly drawn out and saying ""like"" and ""um"" every other word makes you sound dumb. Your 67-sentence answers can be condensed into 1-2.
Sincerely,
Somebody Who Would Rather Hear the Professor Speak
•You don't have to keep downloading SafeConnect. Just double click on it in your downloads folder. 2x faster at least.
•Also, person who pointed out I wrongly said ""Timonese"" rather than ""Timorese"": you misspelled ""sanitation.""
•meow from abroad.
mraow.
•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@""try to get laid right now"" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT IN THE SEMESTER. seriously, I admire his courage for asking me out and I do like him, but now isn't exactly the time to start a relationship!
•Yes, male biddies do exist. However, they frequently go by the title of douche, tool, or a$$ hole.
•Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one.
•My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning
•You've got beef with the occupiers? Really? Making assumptions about what type of wood was used haha?!?! Get a grip. Let's hear the reasons...list them and perhaps we can educate you some.
•@I really hate animated movies! Why doesn't anyone want to watch gory horror movies with me?--Gory horror movies are the sh*t. I love being scared.
•@""Can someone please explain what guys find attractive in females? I've seen some rather unattractive ones get attention and I'm just not comprehending.""
answer = S-E-X
•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because ""you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide"": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@""Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,
I feel like you must be a guy.""
Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ ""Good Christians aren't Republican"":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@""(but of course I have to come back...)"" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.
-person who loves AU and dislikes complainers who like to complain for no reason
•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.
•@""That awkward moment when you are the ONLY one that does not want to go home"" It's only one WHO not only one THAT. You are a human being. Human beings are WHOs not THATs. Items are THAT. YOU ARE NOT AN ITEM. LEARN THIRD GRADE GRAMMAR NOW!
•Nicholas Kristof is a god.
[Editor’s note: Agreed.]
•I am not a security threat. And my middle name is KURT, NOT FART.
•Just finished an 11-page paper.Nothing to rant about now. BOOYAH!!!!
•Clark and Roper saved so much energy during November because we lived in a dark hell for two months.
•What's good about sad? It's happy for deep people.
•*If you play acoustic guitar on the quad.... your TERRIBLE..... Animal Collective is not music, it's poison...
•It's three in the morning. I'm so spaced out from lack of sleep that ergativity actually makes sense.
•I wish it was socially acceptable to be naked all the time. Figuring out what to wear every day is a pain in the butt for indecisive people.
•Yes, it is 6 AM. Yes, I am belting You and I in the study lounge. Thanks finals week.
•I write a rant about not seeing you in a while. For having these feelings for you. And who do I run into in TDR that day, before Rants went up. But there was so much awkward silence...
•Hi I'm calling from AU, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!!
•I. Will. Kill. The. Tech. Department.
WTF CAN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE INTERNET WORK. IT ISN'T THAT HARD. MY FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL MANAGED IT JUST FINE.
Just create a goddam system where the password for the internet is your student ID or something and stop making me download safe connect. If the internet works well enough to make me download something IT OBVIOUSLY WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO LET ME ON THE INTERNET.
•I just don't understand people sometimes. They just don't make sense. At all.
•Whenever I find the jerk who invented Eaglesecure, I'm gonna roast his chestnuts on an open fire.
•Scones all day erry day. #occupytdr
•I'm freaking out about whether I'm just tired and have a sore throat, or if it's mono (I hope I'm just overreacting...)
•Why does everyone else seem so damn interested in my love life? Like more so than I am? Is it really obvious I need to get laid or something?
•If anything, the sh*tshow that was my behavior this weekend showed me that I have the best friends ever. Thanks for keeping me sane through my scrimmage/putting up with my drunk biddiness, guys. Y'all are the best.
•As if running Safe Connect every other time I want to go online on my computer wasn't bad enough, I now have to do it on my phone. #eaglesecureproblems
•""Beware the Jabber WONK, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that snatch!""
•The Dav didn't have soy milk... A good coffee shop would have soy....
•I got a double shot latte by accident instead of a chai -- I don't usually drink caffeine. I'm going craaaazy. I'm sorry English class.
•Ever since our talk, there have been days when you're acting not like a friend and days where you are acting like a friend. I have had many, if not all people tell me that you are not worth it...not even the friendship. Too bad that I am my own person, and I am in this world for ME, and I advocate for myself. I see all the good in people, even if some may not. I believe there's good in you-I can genuinely see it. Do what you want, and forget the rest. You'll be happier listening to yourself.
•@Got any Sodium jokes: Who are you?! That's  my favorite meme! My roommate thinks I'm crazy :/

•""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other..."" This is intense but just adorable. Make plans to see this person again. I'm sure they want to see you too!
•Dear Professor,
I appreciate you assigning us a 3,000 word essay on an event that happened in North Korea during 2011..  and not teaching us a damn thing this semester.  This should be fun, because you know.. There is so much information available on an event from North Korea... in 2011... /sigh/

•I know how stressed out I am by the number of times I masturbate during the week.
•To the first date jogger-- depends on the girl, but I personally would worry that I""d be sweaty and gross while jogging. Maybe a walk instead? That's still pretty casual.
•Dear Roommate,
I love you but your biddie best friend has to go. Every time she visits our room, I want to scream...
Sincerely, love you not her.
•@dear person who wants to get to know me (the one who plays roller coaster tycoon)...do you love math?-- I love both!!!!!!!
•I hate classes where EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD is due the last day of the semester. Spread the misery out a little, please?
•Dear stupid giggling biddies,
The quiet floor is called the QUIET floor for a reason. Don't bring your unwanted noise here.
•@""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other for a long time..."" I know exactly how you feel-- I ran into a guy who's that person to me this weekend. I had just convinced myself to give up but every time I see him... I can't V.V and I almost never see him.
•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.
•The other day I was in CVS and I saw some guy smelling a bottle of shampoo, and I totally freaked him out by running up to him and telling him really excitedly that I do the same thing. Then he was embarrassed and said he was trying to do it all sneakily so no one could see...
•@The NAVY ranter-- Don't be hatin' on the Air Force. I'm a proud Air Force sister. The Chair Force saves the country one cup of coffee at a time ;)
•Don't re-download eagle secure.  Disconnect from the internet, connect to ""connect2eaglesecure,"" wait, and then select ""eaglesecure"" from the available wifi options.  You may have the repeat this process if it doesn't work immediately.  Beats re-downloading though.
•How many double-spaced pages have you written for classes this past week?  Winner gets the right to b**** about it.  Bidding starts at 29 pages.
•Why hasn't the IT department been fired yet?
•To the girl in my M/TH American Political Parties class who doesn't shut up,
SHUT UP! Your answers and comments are incredibly drawn out and saying ""like"" and ""um"" every other word makes you sound dumb. Your 67-sentence answers can be condensed into 1-2.

•You don't have to keep downloading SafeConnect. Just double click on it in your downloads folder. 2x faster at least.
•Also, person who pointed out I wrongly said ""Timonese"" rather than ""Timorese"": you misspelled ""sanitation.""
•meow from abroad.
mraow.
•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@""try to get laid right now"" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT IN THE SEMESTER. seriously, I admire his courage for asking me out and I do like him, but now isn't exactly the time to start a relationship!
•Yes, male biddies do exist. However, they frequently go by the title of douche, tool, or a$$ hole.
•Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one.

•You've got beef with the occupiers? Really? Making assumptions about what type of wood was used haha?!?! Get a grip. Let's hear the reasons...list them and perhaps we can educate you some.
•@I really hate animated movies! Why doesn't anyone want to watch gory horror movies with me?--Gory horror movies are the sh*t. I love being scared.
•@""Can someone please explain what guys find attractive in females? I've seen some rather unattractive ones get attention and I'm just not comprehending.""
answer = S-E-X
•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because ""you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide"": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@""Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,
I feel like you must be a guy.""
Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ ""Good Christians aren't Republican"":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@""(but of course I have to come back...)"" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.
-person who loves AU and dislikes complainers who like to complain for no reason
•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.
•@""That awkward moment when you are the ONLY one that does not want to go home"" It's only one WHO not only one THAT. You are a human being. Human beings are WHOs not THATs. Items are THAT. YOU ARE NOT AN ITEM. LEARN THIRD GRADE GRAMMAR NOW!

•Yes, it is 6 AM. Yes, I am belting You and I in the study lounge. Thanks finals week.
•I write a rant about not seeing you in a while. For having these feelings for you. And who do I run into in TDR that day, before Rants went up. But there was so much awkward silence...
•Hi I'm calling from AU, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!!
•I. Will. Kill. The. Tech. Department.
WTF CAN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE INTERNET WORK. IT ISN'T THAT HARD. MY FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL MANAGED IT JUST FINE.
Just create a goddam system where the password for the internet is your student ID or something and stop making me download safe connect. If the internet works well enough to make me download something IT OBVIOUSLY WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO LET ME ON THE INTERNET.
•I just don't understand people sometimes. They just don't make sense. At all.
•Whenever I find the jerk who invented Eaglesecure, I'm gonna roast his chestnuts on an open fire.

•Why does everyone else seem so damn interested in my love life? Like more so than I am? Is it really obvious I need to get laid or something?
•If anything, the sh*tshow that was my behavior this weekend showed me that I have the best friends ever. Thanks for keeping me sane through my scrimmage/putting up with my drunk biddiness, guys. Y'all are the best.
•As if running Safe Connect every other time I want to go online on my computer wasn't bad enough, I now have to do it on my phone. #eaglesecureproblems

•Ever since our talk, there have been days when you're acting not like a friend and days where you are acting like a friend. I have had many, if not all people tell me that you are not worth it...not even the friendship. Too bad that I am my own person, and I am in this world for ME, and I advocate for myself. I see all the good in people, even if some may not. I believe there's good in you-I can genuinely see it. Do what you want, and forget the rest. You'll be happier listening to yourself.

•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.

•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

After the first week, I will be crying myself to sleep every night wishing for mid-January to come faster. I guess I should be thankful enough to be able to come back. As for all of those out there that cannot come back because of family/financial problems, I have tremendous sympathy for you. Hang in there. Hope you'll all be back.

•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.

Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

•Eagle Rants have gotten so less substantive since they've gone to daily... I mean I obviously still read them religiously but still... I think we need to go back to the weekly Rants.

After the first week, I will be crying myself to sleep every night wishing for mid-January to come faster. I guess I should be thankful enough to be able to come back. As for all of those out there that cannot come back because of family/financial problems, I have tremendous sympathy for you. Hang in there. Hope you'll all be back.

•@”US News and World Reports includes sports and grad schools when calculating rankings.” Lol Jocks wish this were true. Actually US News Rankings are calculated by a combination of freshmen retention rate, faculty resources (number of professors, small class sizes, faculty tenure, etc), academic reputation (published articles, highly ranked departments, etc), student selectivity (average SAT/ACT scores and GPA of freshmen), university endowment, and percentage of alumni donating money to the school. Sports are not a factor. And they shouldn’t be because throwing a ball around is in no way enriching the mind or helping society.
•Here is the link to the rankings methodology  : http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2011/09/12/how-us-news-calculates-the-college-rankings-2012?PageNr=4

•Alright, look. Now, I know that rankings are based off of specific criteria and each school is good for it's own reasons... but to know that I could have gone to an in-state school, paid like 1/6 of tuition, still had direct access to D.C. via the metro, and gotten a similar education not to mention been at a more recognizable and higher ranked school (from which I've recently heard professors talked about in my classes and even had one as a guest speaker)... look, I love AU.. but I'm going into a lot of debt for this.

Opinion: AU’s response to what happened in Kerwin Hall will not keep us safe 







Opinion: The US is designed for cars — not people







Opinion: What it’s like being an immunocompromised student at AU




•ZOMG TODAY IS GOING TO BE THE BESTEST DAY EVARRRRRRR
•White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like ""I hate all white people, they are all racist"", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street.
•I'm scared for my future, not because of the seemingly insurmountable amount of debt I'll be in, but the fact that I came here expecting to find the girl I'll be with for the rest of my life; now I have only a semester left, and its beginning to look like I'll never find her. Forever friendzoned.
•@globalscholarssuck, no but we know the difference between 'your' and 'you're' and appreciate the value of spellchecking. Maybe you need a few more years at college.
•All the people ranting that they hate AU and never want to come back, why are you here? Are you seriously paying 50K a year to hate your school? #Transfer
•Not sure what was worse; waiting on the long line for TDR stir-fry with the flu, or having to listen to you for the whole time go on about how you hate your parents and love to stare at yourself while you're filming a show.
•@”US News and World Reports includes sports and grad schools when calculating rankings.” Lol Jocks wish this were true. Actually US News Rankings are calculated by a combination of freshmen retention rate, faculty resources (number of professors, small class sizes, faculty tenure, etc), academic reputation (published articles, highly ranked departments, etc), student selectivity (average SAT/ACT scores and GPA of freshmen), university endowment, and percentage of alumni donating money to the school. Sports are not a factor. And they shouldn’t be because throwing a ball around is in no way enriching the mind or helping society.
•Here is the link to the rankings methodology  : http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2011/09/12/how-us-news-calculates-the-college-rankings-2012?PageNr=4
•@other Russian/SIS/nat'l pol people: there are others like me? we're not a nearly nonexistent species? this is fantastic news. let's be friends :)
•@""Why on earth would they change how the Dean's List works?"" If you have ever been to an AU graduation ceremony you will know why.  When 90% of students graduate cum laude it makes the school look like it is fraudulently giving every single student an A.
•I don't know what I am going to do without rants over winter break. I guess I am going to read the old rants from other schools. Does anyone know any other schools that have rants? Eagle Editor, do you? Do any ivy league schools have rants?
[Editor’s note: No idea. Maybe try FML or Post Secret?]
•Football has bee proven to cause brain injury. So proud AU doesn’t participate in this Neanderthal-ic activity.
•@smokers: I honestly couldn't care less whether you smoke on campus or not. it's your choice and all but it would be nice if the butts made it into the trash. The ward steps have a trash can yet they're covered in cigarette butts. Smoke all you want just don't litter please.
•""i know a lot of people complain about leggings and uggs, but its actually one of the best parts of winter. provided that the women wearing them are below the weight limit"" and what is this weight limit for leggings/uggs?
•wtf stat. I absolutely hate you.
•Hey bro in Tavern: If there were a Brooks Brothers in Somalia would you be able to find it on a map?
•I'm asexual.  Sometimes, I can be classified as aromantic; it's like all attraction is shut off in me for several months.  But it comes and goes--sometimes, I really do want a romantic relationship.  I'm too scared, though... wouldn't it be wrong for me to be in a relationship with someone only to randomly not want to be with them like that anymore, and then a few months later be interested again?  Help me Eagle Rants--you're my only hope (not really, but you get the gist).
•I'm not bisexual, but I'd like to try making out with a girl.
•I feel like I'm the only not-fat freshman girl that's almost out of meal swipes...
•yes
•""Editor’s note: Uhhh, have we met before?"" Yes
[Editor’s note: Hmmm, assuming you’re a student, what year are you?]
•The letts sky lounge is the worst idea ever
•Know any chemistry jokes? All the good ones argon
[Editor’s note: You’re this editor’s favorite ranter ever.]
•I don't think you understand exactly how much I like you. When I see you, and we talk, I cannot help but smile and stare into your eyes. (YEAH THIS SOUNDS CORNY BUT THIS IS REAL.. really.. not joking..) I want to continue building our friendship into a possible something more like hookup; but the stupid MONTH long winter break is in the way. I hope you'll still have that fire of being my friend like you do now. I cannot wait until we study together. It will be the highlight of my week. Literally.
•Wait so I can't take a Gened P/F next semester?? :(
[Editor’s note: You can next semester in the spring but not after fall 2012.]
•@Patiently waiting girl,
we'd love to have you on our team. flirting helps and let's us know when it is okay to pursue this.
-come to my window
•@Fellow politics lover-- I love following national politics as well and am always game for a good debate... I'm not an SPA/Pol-Sci major... but I am a SIS major >.> Do I still count?
•@countrydayschoolkids yes yes yes! we must bond over country day schools % golf courses.
•You broke my heart. And you'll never know.
•@""•are there any other country day school kids here?"" Country Day in PA?!?!?!
•to whoever lives in hughes with the south carolina and tea party flag hanging in their dorm. i love you. we must meet up soon
•I'm desperate for love. I don't mind admitting it, I just don't know who to admit it to....
I really need a hug. I want someone to hold me. I don't care about sex at all, I just need someone to love. It's never happened and I'm losing hope that it ever will. Can anybody find me somebody to love?
-heterosexual male junior
•Auto-correct plucked up my rant! Duck you, auto-correct!
•All eagle writers I know are hot.
•I just want to apologize to anyone who heard me screaming expletives in the rain on the quad on Wednesday night. My crappy AU umbrella broke.
•Can someone please tell me where to find info on the new academic regulations?
[Editor’s note: You can chck out all the changes here: http://www.american.edu/provost/undergrad/undergrad-rules-and-regulations-toc.cfm]
•Dear Best Friend Back Home,
I get it--you're happy with your new boyfriend.  That's great, I'm glad for you.  But now that we've had three 2-hour long Skype sessions with you (only you) talking nonstop about him (ONLY HIM), it's starting to get really old.  Would it kill you to talk about something else, anything else?  Or, here's an idea, ask me about my life?  I don't even want to talk to you anymore and it breaks my heart...
Love,
""Variety is the Spice of Life""
•Alright, look. Now, I know that rankings are based off of specific criteria and each school is good for it's own reasons... but to know that I could have gone to an in-state school, paid like 1/6 of tuition, still had direct access to D.C. via the metro, and gotten a similar education not to mention been at a more recognizable and higher ranked school (from which I've recently heard professors talked about in my classes and even had one as a guest speaker)... look, I love AU.. but I'm going into a lot of debt for this.
•@hopeful""convert""  Just make it known you're open to this. ;)
•Nothing about being single could make me happier than finding out your ex boyfriend is now a misogynist frat boy douchebag.
•@patiently waiting girl
i'm you're woman. although currently abroad, expect a conversion come this spring.
hope you can hold out.
-your latent lesbian lover
•Isn't it in the SG bylaws that the Senators and Execs can't accept gifts, etc.? Then why do THEY get VIP seats and they're picture with every elite that visits this school, while we all sit in the general audience? Transparency.
•The awkward moment when the guys in Z-Burger are so excited to see you and give you a discount for being a good customer. I don't eat there THAT often...
•THIS IS THE QUIET FLOOR. DO NOT HAZE YOUR PLEDGES ON THE QUIET FLOOR. DO NOT BLAST YOUR STUPID MUSIC ON THE QUIET FLOOR. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP AND SNORE ON THE QUIET FLOOR. I HATE YOU ALL.

•@smokers please don't litter: the only reason I don't throw cigarettes in the trash can is because I'm always afraid that my cigarette is not fully put out and that it's gonna set fire to the trash.
•@""This is the quiet floor"". Try studying in McKinley building. Although it isn't designated as a quiet building, it is often way more quiet than the library. Same goes with Kreeger, Watkins, and Gray.
•I actually saw Neil Kerwin walking through campus the other day, and almost died of shock
•I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone is from the same state, has the same political views, and the same provincial world view. At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world. And not just a couple students, but in every single class at AU. So glad I chose AU.
•I hate that you're flirtatious by nature. It creates feelings in me I know you don't share. I'm really happy to be your friend and am proud to know you trust me with your issues. But now I have feelings for you, and that can't be good for either of us.
•The awkward look guys give you when they find out your ring is a purity ring......
•I feel like ranting should not be the place that you come out of the closet...
•Irene was a joke compared to Wednesday night.  A poorly timed, inappropriate, fart joke.
•There should be like buttons for individual rants.
•I don't want to go home... I'm happier here in DC <3
•Dear Big, I know you read eagle rants so listen up. You chose me, remember? And I chose you? We were so happy that first semester. Then you went abroad and I tried so hard to make time for you, despite my personal issues. Then you came back and acted like nothing changed. I worked so hard to try and talk to you, but you were ""too busy"". This semester I'm abroad and have emailed you, messaged you, skyped you... with no responses. What did I do to make you not like me? I just want to get an answer.
•I know I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I'm pretty sure my neighbors use their apartment for a Fight Club. That's the only rational explanation for all of those noises...
•AU is SO. SMALL.
•Why doesn't my boyfriend like cuddling more??? I DON'T UNDERSTANDDDDDDDDD
•I think my friends are telling me I'm pretty because they don't want me to give up hope on the closeted lesbian and bisexual ladies.  please come out, come out wherever you are.
•why is it so cold in the library? :( I have so much to do but I can't work like this
•@Nothing about being single could make me happier than finding out your ex boyfriend is now a misogynist frat boy douchebag.- I feel you. Brings a smile to my face to hear others talk about his attitude, and say what I'm thinking.
•Thanks for all the suggestions for essay-writing soundtracks! I now love Bastion btw. Perhaps because the music reminds me of Firefly.
•@SGShouldn'tAcceptVIPSeats: Actually, the only times people on SG get VIP seats is when their organization co-sponsors the event. KPU and SUB are very strict on who gets VIP seats, and SG members are in no way allowed to just go because of their position. If you want to get a VIP seat, ask KPU or SUB if an organization you're involved in can co-sponsor!
•I'm the only one of my friends who have not had finals yet... all of their facebook statuses are killing me.
•Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin!
•This is supposed to be an incredibly open, diverse, and accepting school right? Everyone, regardless of race/creed/sexual orientation is supposed to be accepted right? Except Republicans appear to be the exception. All the time. And it's gone farther than joking - now it is starting to really hurt.
•Why aren't my rants about sex being posted? Are we not allowed to rant about sex?
[Editor’s note: It was probably over 100 words or had profanity.]
•I kissed a girl and I liked it. hope you're ready for this babe.
•""Hmmm, assuming you’re a student, what year are you?"" WOAH! Try another question. Yes or no questions please. If not, then you could ask ""what's your name?"" and I would be forced to say...
[Editor’s note: You didn’t specify yes/no questions. But fine, are you in SOC?]
•Is Silicon the same in Spanish? Si
•I'm happy my chemistry jokes get a ""reaction"" out of you guys :-)
[Editor’s note: Hehehe.]
•Your new boy toy is really ugly. Good riddance and good luck with that one!
•You're not boring. I'm just bored with you.
•Considering napping in the library. No shame.
•I was sexually harassed (is that the word?) in the men's bathroom in the basement of the library. I in a position to get help, but I just hid from him in the stall until left, so it wasn't necessary. Needless to say, I'm shaken by it, but I don't fell like I can tell anyone because nothing ended up happening beyond the above...
I've learned two things: (1) those rape stickers in the bathrooms are absolutely vital, and (2) I can never imagine what rape victims must feel like, given how I feel bc of this
[Editor’s note: First, sexual harassment is against University policy and the student conduct code. Even though “nothing ended up happening,” as you said, you have every right to talk to someone, whether it be a friend, counselor or AU staffer, and to report the incident if you want to. If you want more information on sexual harassment and assault at AU, you can look through AU’s resource page: http://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/sexualassault/. If you’re just looking to talk, maybe try the Counseling Center at 202-885-3500. I’m sure other ranters have ideas as well.]
•Anyway, I guess I'll just make sure I attend the ""rape is bad"" parade again this year... Idk...
•I wish we weren't so complicated. I wish you weren't so medicated.
•I hate it when people think the glass study rooms in the library are sound proof. THEY ARE NOT. The whole entire floor can hear your conversation. You biddies have no right to disturb the students in the library who actually care about their work. Also, wtf are you wearing? Mini skirts don't constitute winter clothing, and 30 pounds of make-up won't replace a lack of personality. Why has our society let this happen, and why are there are so many people like you at AU??
•Now don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for Winter Break. But I want the chance to hang out with you actually before break to know if something is there! Why is break coming so fast now??
•AU should have a graffiti rock.
•Dear Roommate:
You do not look that great in that attire, despite your assertions to the contrary, you look dumpy and like a disheveled old physics professor, you need some decent clothes hombre.
•Ah Paultards... you guys are so silly I almost feel bad for you.
•If you are a guy taller than 5'8, with a beautiful body, who knows random nerdy facts and is extremely sarcastic. HMU
•A hahaha... Editor is having a conversation with a Ranter.
[Editor’s note: Agreed.]
•""Normal"" student here graduating in three years. #globalscholarscansuckit
•It makes me so happy to know that all the girls you are now hooking up with are unattractive skanks. I hope you get herpes. Sincerely, your ex.
•Someone on this quiet floor is ranting about me and my friends being too loud. Im sorry but my friend was too drunk last night not to be laughing while reiterating her actions to her
•Dear roommate: You can't be in this room forever, some time, some day, I will find your computer when you aren't at it, and I will delete all of your annoyingly repetitive music (because you always listen to the same crap) so you can broaden your horizons. And I WILL BE FREE!
•I used to think Ringbom was hot. Now its more like Douchebom...
•ladies who responded to my plea:
thank you, it's nice to hear some encouragement! just wish it was easier to pick out girlswholikegirls. and to ""your latent lesbian lover,"" i wish this wasn't so anonymous, haha. but good luck finding me next semester, i can definitely wait for you ;)
-still waiting
•I wish Danny Mack was straight.
•I really hate printing dollars...
•anderson third floor is too much to handle.
•Dear people who like brag about how much work they do,
1. We all do a lot of work. Get over yourself.
2. No one cares that you went 320 words over the word limit for your paper.  In fact, word limits exist so you don't talk about unnecessary information. Oh, I guess that didn't stop you from bringing this conversation up either.
Sincerely,
Annoyed person that is far from impressed.
•""White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like ""I hate all white people, they are all racist"", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street.""
One of the key parts of racism is one group having power over another.  Sure, you could argue that we have a black president but let's be real, there still is a huge amount of discrimination against black people in many parts of our country.  Clearly, AU DOES need to change the Dean's list.
•SIS people,
I wonder what David Hume would think of you...but sadly we'll never know.
Sincerely,

•nothing good happens after 2am...
•I can't wait to detriple for spring semester.  I've hit my head on the bunk above me too many times in the past few months!  I wouldn't be surprised if I sustained a concussion from today's smack to the head. FML.
•@quiet floor ranter
I DO WHAT I WANT.
•The world ended last night.  And I have the pictures to prove it.
•@Not-SPA/Poli-Sci major: YES! Let's be friends :)
•REALLY LEO 6?! REALLY?! I thought there was a banana rotting away when it was a bloddy tampon on the shelf in the shower. And I thought part of the shower floor was rippping off when it was a used condom. First a pregnancy test left on the toilet seat, now this?!!? LOOK AT YOUR LIFE, LOOK AT YOUR CHOICES. Clean up after yourself, please.
•I don't even know how many times I orgasmed last night...
•Hey boy. I like you. I think. Let's watch more movies together..
•I'm tired of these mixed signals.  I don't want to be another random hookup.  If you like me, then show it and do something about it, but if you're going to tell me you like being my friend and then hook up with me, I'm done.
•It sucks when boy X shows so much interest in you but you don't like him. And boy Y has finally made his move  to an extent but you  just wish it were boy Z that made his move already.

2011-12-12,AU,study,"•I just want to talk to you like a normal human being instead of tripping over my tongue when I meet your eyes.



•Is it just me or do you feel the sexual tension too?
•I'm part of the 99% that procrastinated all this work until the end of the semester and tries to rid ourselves of the blame by focusing on how much work we have to do, instead of WHY we have to do it right NOW.
•I'm a freshman and I consider most people on the east coast REALLY weird. And I see all the freshman everyday because this is a small school. #needtotransfer #california
•What am I going to do without seeing President Rangos for over a month? #longdistancerangoslove?

•Dear Editor,
I have a girl crush on you too.
Love,
Elizabeth Olsen
[Editor’s note: Elizabeth Olsen is totes this editor’s fave actress.]
•I don't think you know what I want. Once you hear me out, I think you will change your mind and go along with it all. A month is a long time and it will eat me alive not knowing how you sincerely feel... in all honesty. If think I am as young as my age, you're wrong. Just please listen, you mean more to me than you think.
•To buy a sprite from the Letts vending machines you have to press C4. This amuses me immensely.
•@""Considering napping in the library: DO IT. i did it. definitely no shame.
•You know what sucks? The Creationism vs. Evolution debate. I have a solution for all of you: God created evolution. There. Everyone wins.
•@might set trash on fire: Fair enough, didn't think about that. There's gotta be some way to prevent littering while being safe about that though. If not someone should come up with one.
•I honestly have no idea why so many people ask me for relationship advice. I've never been in a relationship before
•I've come to a conclusion: fantastic things happen at Monticello...especially when ugly xmas sweaters and tequila are involved. Thumbs up for another night to remember. #jkwhathappened?
•i always have the urge to walk to the quiet floor and just let a huge, loud fart rip and then walk out
•Why is it impossible to find a place to poop in peace and quiet on this campus?
•@new Bastion fan: i'm glad! when finals end i'd highly recommend checking out the game if you haven't already, it's a great story.
•Stop filling my inbox with all this textbook swap or whatever bull. It's really wonking annoying and even if I owned my own textbooks I wouldn't sell them to you.
•am i the only person annoyed by the people who won't whisper on the quiet floor? if you can't read the sign, let me explain it to you: SHUT UP.
•AUTO! I hate you!
•I hate it when people leave rants that aren't rants- ""I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone... has the same political views.... At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world.... So glad I chose AU."" This paper toots the University's horn enough as it is.

•YES TO THE GRAFFITI ROCK

•just saying, the best song to get you pumped to study for finals, in my opinion, is Mulan's 'I'll Make a Man Out of You'
•Am I the only one whose parents have not paid for any part of my education? Because I honestly feel like I am.
•Why is my unwanted suitor trying to hang out with me more than my friends? There is a problem here.
•People call me a gold digger, but they just want what I have.
•You always complain about not getting a rant here but you never read them when I write one about you!! Ugh, you're impossible and I can never please you
•That awkward moment when you and your roommate accuse each other of writing the same Rant.
•I wish it was easier to pretend some people didn't exist.
•Twenty questions with the Editor is getting annoying. Editor, don't feed the troll monster. Ignore this person!
[Editor’s note: Don’t worry, already considering it.]
•Where are all the snazzy events where I can re-wear all of my high  school homecoming dresses and my fabulous collection of heels?
•Anybody on the second floor of the library have a pen I can borrow?
•Creepy senior, please stop texting me. Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody.
•Last night (Saturday night, Sunday morning) I shared an elevator ride with an extremely chivalrous and kind military man in Leonard. Round 1:30am. If you remember, and felt some sort of connection, rant back. I love a man in uniform.
•According to a chemist, why is the world so diverse? Because theres alkynes of people
•If you are a Packers fan, give a shout out for A-Rod and the crew! 13 and 0 ALL THE WAY!
•I am in love with my TA, dear lord. what a gosh darn stud. I always thought this whole ""oh, I like my TA"" thing was silly, but mmm, girl, I would pay for that.
•The WONK campaign sucks. But I gotta make sure to catch the Eat Wonky truck before I leave for winter break. (There's no cognitive dissonance there, right?)
•Silent study lounges need sound proof walls. Girls in the hallway: what are you DOING.
•Why does everyone hate on Football? It's a great way to exercise, have fun, and work out pent-up aggression and stress! So please don't hate on it just because you're jaded, unathletic, and got picked last for kickball in in 5th grade.
•TEDDY PLEASE POST ANOTHER BLOG POST I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LIFE
•This weekend was the best. I can conquer anything now.
•I have to wait in the lounge to sign a stupid form and I can't leave to study and everyone in the lounge is talking at the top of their freaking lungs and can't shut up.

•That awkward moment when everyone thinks you were a lot drunker than you actually were.
•""You didn’t specify yes/no questions. But fine, are you in SOC?"" Yes
[Editor’s note: Are we Facebook friends?]
•mrrrroow!
•Seize the day. For the pure reason that life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
•#OccupyNickRangos
•To the cute blonde girl in the Renaissance and Revolutions class,
You are absolutely adorable.  You're sweet, smart, and everything I want. Will you go on a date with me?
•FINALS MAKE ME HORNY... why do I have to possess such a high standard of morals that I won't allow myself to jump the guy that lives across the hall?!?!? I AM GOING TO GO CRAZY!!!!
•I like you more than I'll ever let on, even though I tell you how much I like you all the time.
•I can't stop thinking about you, boy who I flirted with in college writing class last semester. It's been so long, and I rarely see you, but you were perfect for me. Just so you know. I wonder if you ever think about me...
•I may be a little bit of a biddie, but you're a cheater. So don't judge because what you do is way worse than anything I've done.
•When I write a dissertation or I become a doctor and have to write articles because being a doctor requires it, I'll make sure to make them one column, double spaced, easily accessible, free, and make sure its edited by three people- A professor in English, a professor in my field, and a professor in education. That way I’m sure that I'm clear and concise, I make sure that my paper is something new and innovative to the field and is accurate yet debatable, and make sure that its simple and understandable to even a senior in high school.
•I know you don't like me as more than friends, and I know I have a boyfriend, but every time you talk, I take my earphones out just to hear your voice.
•Before I came to AU I was already addicted to Dating in the District entries. Someone bring them back!
•Dear beautiful post back in my bio class who lives with his identical twin-- you are so sexy. Let's be friends. Or at least introduce me to your twin brother. ;)
•STFU with all the finals stuff! Everybody is in the same boat so get over it. No one is trying to compete and top everyone else by having the most finals! Take them, be done with them, enjoy your vacations!
•really AU?! you kick me out of ward first cause it is closed and then at 4 in the morning you kick me off the second floor of MGC cause it is ""closed"" as well? do you think that i am going to vandalize or steal something when i'm trying to study for my finals?
•""anderson third floor is too much to handle."" #winning
•I find it mind-boggling that the biddies next door can't wake up to an alarm repeating the same ten seconds of some crappy pop song for fifteen minutes. It wakes me up through the wall, how are you still asleep!?!
•That awkward moment when a group of people you just met start talking about things they can't imagine someone doing... and you've done all of those things.
•@Real metaphysics--I think I love you.
•Seven days left abroad!!!! I know I should be sad, but by now you've seen my countdown and know last week was really hard for me. Five finals and a week stand between me and the good ol' US of A!!!
•You were a mistake I had to make.
•To my two professors who just gave our class 4 and 6 day extensions on the final papers, respectively, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOUUUUUU. (Yes, I have finished both already but I really wanted to work on them some more.)
•I don't want to go home for break AT ALL. I have too much fun at AU, and I'm going to miss my friends so so much when I go abroad next semester :(
•'Tis the season to zealously check for your grades to be posted. Fa la la la la, la la la laaaa.
•Why, whenever I'm attracted to confident, outgoing guys, do they turn out to have the worst self-confidence problems? I wish I wasn't a nice enough person to stick around and help them through it. It's not what I signed up for.
•Finals aren't actually that bad when you drink your way through them like a man...
•That awkward moment when... you nerdgasm because you realize that, although you can't solve this math problem, you DO finally know how to make Mathematica solve it for you.
•dear God, Zia's Song is stuck in my head and it's such a pleasurable torment. Na NA na na nahAaa.

2012-01-09,AU,study,"Students will be able to live with members of the opposite sex in Centennial and Roper Halls next fall.
Housing and Dining's decision to add gender neutral housing follows a joint effort between Student Government and the Residence Hall Association to lobby Housing and Dining for the change.
“This has been an issue on campus for almost a decade now, and this is the first and largest step in a long time,” Student Government President Tim McBride said in an email.
Gender neutral housing is intended to allow gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students and students who do not consider themselves traditionally male or female to live in an environment where they feel most comfortable, according to RHA Resolution 11-12-009 passed Dec. 1. 
While Open Gender Housing has existed in Nebraska Hall, the Berkshire Apartments and suites in McDowell Hall, many students have not taken advantage of these opportunities, said Chris Moody, assistant vice president for Housing and Dining.
AU adds drug, alcohol-free housing
The Housing Options Task Force, created during the fall semester and consisting of staff and students, also provided Housing and Dining the recommendations for AU’s new living learning communities.
The Substance Free Living Learning Community in Clark Hall will allow students to live in a guaranteed substance-free environment.
Students living in the Substance Free Living Learning Community will agree to not be under the influence of alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs while present inside Clark Hall. Students will also refrain from bringing these substances into Clark Hall, Moody said.
“In formal and informal assessments, students share stories about how choices made by hallmates related to alcohol and other drugs have played a role in the quality of their sleep and study environments, even though these substances are not permitted in university housing,” he said in an email.
Social justice-themed housing added to Roper
The Social Justice Living Learning Community in Roper Hall and will be gender neutral and will expose students interested in social justice issues to several opportunities to immerse themselves in the field, Moody said.
“Students will have the opportunity to engage in a wide variety of experiences on the topics of civil rights, women’s rights, GLBT rights and other social justice movements,” Moody wrote in the email.
Students in the program will listen to guest speakers, travel to social justice-related sites around D.C. and meet alumni who are working in the field, Moody said. 
“National and American University data have shown for several years that students participating in a living learning communities express higher levels of satisfaction with their residence hall and university experience,” he said. “Additionally, retention rates at the University have shown a trend of being higher for students who participate in a living learning community versus those who do not.”
The Online Housing Application will be due Feb. 3 at 11:59 p.m. The Living Learning applications will be due Feb. 3 at 5 p.m. 
Students will receive their lottery numbers in an email Feb. 10, according to the Room Selection Guide, which Housing and Dining sent to students Jan. 9.

Are there more discreet ways to masturbate?""  go to Pleasure Place in Georgetown, get a waterproof vibrator and use in the shower. Bam! problem solved
• @""Why does the Eagle Rant editor get to be anonymous but a sex columnist can’t be?""
KA-POW!
[Editor’s Note: It’s so unfair]
• @""How do you know if you are in love?"" love is when you can't imagine living your life without that person. They are in every waking thought you have and every sleeping dream you have. They are the center of your universe. Every decision you make takes them into account. You constantly think of ways to make him/her happy. And you would sacrifice parts of yourself for the other person. That is true love.
• @person making Disney quotes: I love you. Please don't stop.
• @""I want to have sex with a girl somewhere inside MGC"" Try the 3rd floor (4th floor if you include TDR as a floor). No one is ever up there.
• @""I""m worried that the counseling center won’t be able to help me, and I have no back up plan."" If the counseling center can't help you (or if you feel they aren't helping you in the way you would like) they can give you an outside referral to nearby therapists. I've used both nearby and on campus therapists and both have been very helpful.
• @""Nate Bronstein stole all the forks from TDR.""  ...and my heart! (swoon)
• Stop worrying who you will sit next to at commencement. Just sit a stranger. No AU student is going to bite you. We're all one big happy family. Why not make a new friend the day of graduation?
• @person helped by the counseling center. I am so happy for you. I was greatly helped by the counseling center too due to some PTSD issues from an event in my past that kept haunting my dreams. But now I am almost completely better, and have learned to deal with my baggage in more healthy ways.
[Editor’s Note: Go counseling center!]
• when will I outgrow blacking out?? because finding out about my night from pictures on my phone and texts (those that I haven't deleted) is getting old
• @""I kind of agree with the opinion that going to grad school and then immediately starting a family, while fine, seems a bit like a waste. why not take a few years, have a career, travel, do things for you."" How is going to grad school not doing things for me? Who else would I be going to grad school for? There is nothing I would want more in my life after college than to go to grad school.

• WTF AUSG job board. So angry I can only speak in A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S. SMH.

• @how do you know if a girl is gay?:  I think we need a massive gay girl meeting.  As in, Look!  All the lesbians on campus in one place at one time!  They do exist after all!  (I hope.  Still have yet to find any eligible girls.  Sigh.)

• @Commitment issues: Welcome to the club.  It's not so bad; now that you recognize the problem, you can work to overcome it.  Or choose to be friendzoned and just enjoy the friendship.  I personally prefer the second option, but if you seriously want to be in a relationship with this person, don't let your fears hold you back.  Play some cost/benefit and decide what matters to you the most. #support

• I don't think Tim McBride is cute. Bring back Nate Bronstein!
• I honestly do not like AU students. I try to spend as much time off this god-forsaken campus as I actually can. I should have gone to University of Maryland.
• If I find someone in my class attractive, and I want to stir up conversation and eventually hopefully soon lead to a hang out time, How would one go about doing that? I cannot just wait for it to fall and just happen, I like being proactive. (soph girl--->junior guy) ADVICE?
• I am tired of people telling me what to do. I am 19 years on 20 years old and I can make my own decisions whether or not my friends think they are trying to help me or not. If it ends up being a mistake, SO WHAT. That would be a mistake I would have had to made, and had to learn from. (this is probably totally so grammatically incorrect, but, yeah.) THOUGHTS?

• I don't think anyone is saying education is a waste of money or that mothers shouldn't be educated.  But grad school does cost quite a bit of money (and parents are usually less likely to pay for it).  If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don't need a Master's Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.  Hell I'm currently taking a class at Stanford University on computer programming through iTunes U for free.  Anything is possible

• I don't care about your girlfriend... I bet her address ends in dot com.... shut up
• I am sad. And kinda lonely. I mean, I have friends here that I love spending time with, but it just doesn't feel the same... I miss home.
• i'll trade you. I'll do all your work for the year but you take my roommates...
• lets be honest, if I truely were a wonk I would realize that there is no point in copyrighting a word nobody else would copyright.
• addicted to eagles rants :( #firstworldproblems
• I don't care if you are Jewish, or Muslim.  We can still meet Jesus anytime
• The Eagle Rants editor needs to hurry it up or they will have a late night visitor.
[Editor’s Note: I need you to stop yelling at me and calm down.]
• Has anyone seen my business cards?  They say Trojan Magnum on the front.
• Why can't I get off?
• Is it bad if you can't get it up?
• I want to have sex with a girl somewhere inside MGC
• Has anyone seen my golf ball?
• You are taking too long on posting Eagle Rants you lazy bums
• I might get some serious eye-rolls and groans for saying this... but I actually like the KNOW/WONK campaign. I'll admit the money that goes into it might have better uses, but it's quirky. I like quirky.
• Sometimes I think my DNA is laced with boy repellant.
• To the Editor:
Sometimes my rants get through;
Sometimes my rants get cut.
I don't place the blame on you;
You've gotta go with your gut.

[Editor’s Note: THIS.]
• @Person seeking a reading
Hmm, tough question. Maybe we should agree on a meeting place, since I'm fairly sure the editor won't publish e-mails (good thing to).
• To the obviously cute guy in the gym: it is annoying enough to know that you only have looks going for you- but can you please not touch your chest after you lift? It makes you look like an even bigger douche.
• The ""Lost"" ranter: I love you. Buy me a cup of coffee and we can chat about the Dharma Initiative.
• @Taking oxycodone before class Solution to your problem: give me your oxy.
• Love the rants-where were they when i was in college lo these many years ago!
• Why does the Eagle Rant editor get to be anonymous but a sex columnist can't be?
• I've never been so horny or for so long in my life. I can't even stop fantasizing during lectures.
I hate it how coffee shops serve extremely hot water for tea. I shouldn't have to • wait half an hour just so I don't scald my tongue.
• Why does the Mudbox sell stick-on bindis? I feel like that's offensive...
• I hate the fact that more people here don't like country music. It has something for every feeling and phase in college.
• Aaaand I just made cookie dough. For the purposes of eating as-is, not so much for the cookies. Damn, senior year panic and depression is setting in much earlier than I had anticipated.
• today, eSuds is down and I have no clean underwear left. fml.
• So there is this girl in my class who wears disney shirts all of the time.  I think she is cute
• I keep seeing pepsi girl... I want to ask her to come drink a coke with me one time...
• I'm going to be the one person that complains about TDR food ALL THE TIME.
• Yo, kids in Battelle, this is not the silent floor of the library. Please say something... anything.
• lookin' dapper
• ""The first casualty of gender-neutral housing""... idiot, not unless he or she is gay and thus, could have sex with his or her roommate now. Pea brain, expand yo mind.
• Could someone please explain to me how the heck we got two new senators and I heard nothing about a special election??
• Re: ""...Gay until proven straight."" Although I chuckled when I read it, but I don't act like people wouldn't freak out if someone posted the opposite.
• I love reading rants from abroad! I feel like I'm back at AU every day for 5 minutes.
• ""... I’m thinking of asking a guy out on a date…
I’m a girl… is that weird?""
Hell no
• Don't leave your Uncle T-Bag hangin'!
• One of the new roommates in my apartment is a pretty girl and now I'm afraid to poop in my own home. This is terrible.
• Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON!
• I'M A MONSTER!!!!!
• Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass!
• WHY ARE NONE OF THE SOUTHSIDE ESUDS MACHINES WORKING?!?! TODAY IS LAUNDRY DAY GODDAMNIT.
• I""m worried that the counseling center won't be able to help me, and I have no back up plan.
• I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits.
• I realize everyone has strong opinions on this baby @ 25 subject, but enough already.  if you want to have a baby and you're happy, go for it. if you don't that's fine too. who cares what everyone else has to say. in my opinion, unless someone pays your bills every month, their opinion is irrelevant.
• living life=getting drunk at a bar?? you're kidding right?
• I think that a guy in one of my classes is really cute but I have no idea how to spark up a conversation with him. It's not that he's intimidating, its just that it would be so random!
• There is no reason to complain about the FWS situation if you don't qualify for work-study. BABYSIT! You'll make more money anyway, and there are plenty of positions that don't require a car. This especially applies to international students since babysitting is almost invariably under the table.
• I love doing homework naked.
• i'm tired of reading the ""married at 25"" rants! can you please stop posting several rants regarding the same topic?
• Seriously, don't ever ask me to watch your stuff again and come back an hour later.
• re:sitting alone at commencement: I literally know no one in my major. I just realized this. WHO AM I GOING TO WALK WITH?!?!
• @how do you know if a girl is gay?: as a gay girl who really doesn't look gay but tries really hard to make it known, please ask. i just want a date.
• I thought the Dav prided itself on being fair trade, the cool thing, the hipster thing where intellectuals can sip coffee...... but they've been playing Taylor Swift all morning. Ears. Bleeding.
• @The person who thinks having sex with your roommate is a casualty of gender-neutral housing: Sometimes people have sex with their same-sex roommate which has nothing to do with gender-neutral housing....
• @fetish game: I'm turned on by rainbows. And velvet.
• I'm abroad, but I feel like I'm back at AU with these daily rants SIGH
• @married by 24 if you want to be married/have children by the time you're 25, that is your choice and I respect it. However, everyone defending her needs to stop scaring the naysayers by saying that after 25 there's a much lower chance for fertility/making it sound like developmental disabilities become an inevitability; my brother was born when my mom was 36, and I was born when she was 38; she got pregnant naturally and fairly easily, and neither of us have any developmental disabilities.
• Let's jump out a window! T_T
• Seriously guys 10k a year is a drop in the bucket in terms of AU's budget.  Splitting the position in 4 parts and not paying any of them wouldn't work either.  That would make the running of SG even less efficient b/c the 4 heads would have to do so much extra coordinating to make sure they were on the same page.  Too many chefs spoil the pot.
• I wish I had more support.
• I am miserable in law school, but there is no way out now.
• I'm so embarrassed and I can't get over it. What do I do?
• @fetish rants: I have a bubble fetish. I want to have sex in a bath full of bubbles.
• best bathroom graffiti is in ward!!!! MADE MY DaY!
• @""... I’m thinking of asking a guy out on a date…
I’m a girl… is that weird?""
That's not weird at all! My current girlfriend asked me out, and it's by far the best thing that's ever happened to me!
• I really....really.....REALLY hate valentines day.  And it doesn't help that all of my friends love that infernal holiday
• So I posted a few days ago about not having happiness with anything I do anymore. But that's gone! I am doing much better, thanks to surprisingly enough the AU Counseling Center. If you are having thoughts about going, GO. All the sessions are FREE. I think you get up to 8 or 9? Not sure. Also from the support of certain friends. Also journaling has helped too. Ahh. Today was the day when I finally realized that I WILL be alright, and EVERYTHING in the end will sway the way you want it to because you make it that way. Progress with my happiness all the way!
[Editor’s Note: Right on.]
• Every time I get close to dating you, I freak out, act like a child, and start ignoring you. I didn't think having a fear of commitment was a real thing, but I'm seeing more and more that I can't get shake the feeling that something will go horribly, horribly wrong if we date... but I'm absolutely in love with you.
• If my group doesn't get our RCC, I will destroy McDowell. We deserve that suite.
• Have to point this out: it's entirely possible that the roommates who slept together are the same gender and just gay. Same-gender housing only stops hooking up if everyone's straight.
• @Can girls ask guys out? YES! They totally can. Unless the guys is a total jerk, he'll be flattered.
• I hear that you like me.... confirmation would be nice from any valid source.... drunk or sober....
• @ BDSM kitchen fetish--I'm a guy and my fetish is that I would like a woman to peg me.
• Whoever made the Sh*t AU Students say left out complaints over Eagle Secure and the Metro System. SHAME!
• I'm used to being single for Valentine's Day and all, but this year it just seems even more annoying for some reason. Eagle Ranters, will you all be my valentine?
• omg the feb. 6 rants were freaking amazing. There should be an award for how great they were!!
• Please make a sequel to sh*t AU students say. PLEASE!
• @grad school for ""just a mom"": I wasn't the original poster but I plan on going to grad school and then immediately becoming a stay at home mom as well. I plan on going to grad school for psychology. I am going not only because I enjoy learning about psychology and want to learn more, but also because psychology knowledge will make me a better mother.
• I'm so sad and lonely and anxious that I have started talking to myself. At first it was just when I was alone, but now I have started doing it in public. #scared.
• @why grad school for just a mom: I don't view grad school as a vocational training ground. I view it as a mentally enlightening life experience that everyone should be lucky enough to get. I do not at all consider it a waste of money. Expensive cars and clothes I consider a waste of money. I guess we all have different priorities in life.
• @graduation issues: Graduation is just a ceremony. Not going to graduation does not in any way devalue your degree or make you a bad person. A significant minority of people do not go to graduation because a) it costs money to rent the garb b) it takes forever to go to all the practices and the actual ceremony and c) there are much better things you could spend your time doing.
• That awkward moment when really ugly guys talk about how they wouldn't sleep with a biddie. As if you had a chance!
• @girl asking why a mother would want to grad school if she doesn't plan on working: Higher education makes people parents, better citizens, and better people overall. And maybe she wants security in case she ever does need to work and she is too busy raising kids to go back to school to get a graduate degree.
• So I got cold called in law school and totally blew it. Crying in class = not cool. :(
• @""the person who responded to my “sitting alone at commencement rant” Not going is not an option when my parents pay over $50,000 and are flying to see me graduate."" It's not too late to cancel flights. It's only February. Tell them you appreciate their willingness to fly out and see you, but they really don't need to spend the money because you just aren't up for the whole show that is the graduation ceremony.  Tell them you are saving them lots of money.
• @fetish ranter: my fetish is sex in public places ;)
• I feel like all my coping systems are breaking down.
• @""Seems like a waste of money to me if your highest goal is to mother 6 kids"": I am not seeing your logic. Please explain. Why would you imply that mothers should not be educated? And I don't view education as a waste of money.
• @""that awkward moment when you get arrested over break and now you’re afraid the school will find out and take away you’re scholarship"" How did you get a scholarship in the first place without knowing the difference between your and you're?
• Nate Bronstein stole all the forks from TDR.
• Why does TDR suck?
• I just want to sleep
• Just heard about a very single Anderson Hall President via eagle rants. Mr. President, I offered before but once again, I'd love to be your Monica LeWONKsky ;)
• @""Is anyone going to see that Shel Silverstein show that AU Players is putting on?! It sounds hilarious!""  I'll be there! It does sound hilarious!
• Oh my god. If you're going to talk to your friends in an abnormally loud voice and laugh obnoxiously every minute THEN LEAVE THE FUCKING LIBRARY.
• I kind of agree with the opinion that going to grad school and then immediately starting a family, while fine, seems a bit like a waste. why not take a few years, have a career, travel, do things for you.
• lol au sux
• So an engineering student told me it is better to push the automatic door button rather than manually force them open as it damages the electronic system. Could this be true?
• To the guy who's been ranting in the desperate hope that suddenly he will find out whether or not the girl he's crushing on is available and, if so, whether or not he has a chance with her, I have some advice. Ask her out. I'm serious. Nothing will make you instantly more attractive and even if the answer is no, she should be flattered. If it doesn't, she's not all you thought she was.
• Dear sir, we do not care about your personal opinions on religion or the burqa. You should stop bringing them up.
• this guy i'm sitting next to a phonathon is one sexy catt!
• Grow up. This is all so stupid. Remember what's important and just start being a good person.
Rant here!
 Type your rant here!

2012-02-10,AU,study,"• Can we put the eagle rants tab on the right side the of the eagle website rather than the left. It's really annoying to have to expand the window each time when I want to click on eagle rants. Or at least make the format go ""news"", ""scene"", ""eagle rants"", ""sports"", ""opinion"", ""incubator"". Incubator isn't even really a part of the eagle. It shouldn't be before Eagle rants. I'm sure rants have 100 times the audience that incubator has.
• Why is it whenever I try to strike up a conversation with someone around campus (usually females) I basically get told to F off? Is it so hard to have a friendly chat, yes you're cute but that doesn't entitle you to have a ego the size of Jupiter.
• @How do you know you are in love--> yes everything the guy yesterday said, except for the fact that sometimes the significant other can be a lying, cheating, low-life sub-human that uses you for all your money and connections and leaves you feeling hopeless and broke. But best of luck to you!
• Jar jar binks is NOT the worst star wars character.

• A university in Pennsylvania just got a vending machine that dispenses the morning after-pill. Get on this AU!
• I miss Christmas! Is that weird?
• When I had a boyfriend I never felt like having sex. Now, I am single and I want sex every day. SO FRUSTRATING.
• @ Peg fetish.  Where there is a dong there is a way
• Delt's pledge class is hot. I thought they were gay???!
• @""straight girls: how flattered/creeped out would you be"" I would be so flattered and not at all creeped out in fact I might say yes, college is about experiencing right?
• I heart the Eagle Rants editor. Your snark makes the Eagle Rants that much better. I want your job when you retire, my friend, to let the legacy live on.

• Honestly I would rather have someone use a urethral probe on me than go to another shift at the Phonathon.
• How about we just call ""the pepsi girl"" Hallie Eisenberg? She's beautiful and amazing on her own, has done more than just the pepsi commercials, and should in no way be shadowed by her brother. She deserves her name. :)<3

• I love crossing the days off my calendar waaayy too much.
• Come on Alpha Sig! You were kind enough to give the other guys on the floor bids, but why not me? I feel like i'm pretty close with a lot of you guys, and am disappointed that this didn't work out. nevertheless, i'll see ya this weekend ;)
• ""Two sides: One is light, one is dark""
• @”If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don’t need a Master’s Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.” Actually you can’t take graduate level psychology classes at community college. Or any graduate classes for that matter.
• I know you're having a harder time than you're letting on.  I just wish I could take some of your unhappiness onto myself for a while, so that you could have a break.
• @”If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don’t need a Master’s Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.”  On that theory, a college degree isn’t necessary either. Or a high school degree. Neither is legally required. It’s not about being required.  I desire it, and it would make me more educated and better person overall. And a better mother.
• Dear Anderson 4 North,
A Just Dance Party?? Really??? Some people have class in the morning!!!
• @ MGC sex: been there, done that, several times. won't tell you where though, but it's highly recommended.
• @”I don’t think anyone is saying education is a waste of money or that mothers shouldn’t be educated.  But grad school does cost quite a bit of money” Money is not an issue. But even if it were, I would gladly spend my limited money on a graduate degree rather than a new car or a vacation, etc.
• I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.
• @why go to grad school because you can take classes on itunes for free:  I take online classes online for free too.  But I’m guessing the ranter wants the self-validation and self-esteem that comes with actually earning a graduate degree. And like she said, if she ever did need to work someday, she would already have a graduate degree to fall back on (like an insurance policy).
• @”don’t they know we’re poor”. Actually many students are not poor. I for one, would love to add AU to my estate and give annual donations.
• @itunes over college: Then why go to college at all for undergrad? You can learn it all from library books? You don’t get it.  It’s not just about the classes. It’s about the graduate school experience. Meeting fellow intelligent people who share your interests.  Having challenging homework assignments. Getting grades and feedback from experts in the field. Etc.
• @fetish rants: I wanna have a threesome while my dog watches.
• @Gender Neutral Bathrooms.  I heard that all of the bathrooms in DC were gender neutral.  Establishments can still put up signs on bathrooms suggesting that they be for men or women, but they don't mean anything legally (whether or not this applies to the dorm bathrooms where people shower, I don't know)

• To the girl sitting next to me in the library on the 2nd floor: you're really pretty and I wish I had the courage to talk to you...
• Dear Editor,
I like that you post the rants in the evening! It gives me something to look forward to. Guys, if you wanna read in the morning, adjust your reading schedule to read the previous day's in the morning! The editor has a life and stuff to do too.

• This is the closest I'll get to telling you I like you,
We met at orientation leader interviews a little over a year ago. You've continued to be such an asset to AU. I wish I wasnt so shy, and could ask you to just chill, even as friends. The years will continue to fly by, and I'll continue to wonder what could we have been, if anything at all? Keep being awesome.
-probably in the friend zone, and that's fine by me.
• I REALLY wish it was socially acceptable to not wear pants in class
• @hard to convince yourself: I felt the same way my entire Freshman year, and it didn't help that 2 good friends ended up transferring. Just keep stay positive, don't let the negativity bring you down, and remember: the most vocal are the ones with the strongest opinion. There are still a lot of people here who really like this school, but don't go around complaining / talking about it all the time. JUST KEEP SWIMMING :)
• What is with all the hate on girls who mix business dress with sexy dress, as being in the 1% of AU (being a straight man) I find it liberating and empowering. (Psst... Not really, but maybe a lib will eat it up... like comm major lib.)
• kinda wish the GLBTA office had another A... A for Aesexual.
• The computers in the Anderson Lab are so slow, it took me 10 minutes to get to my email. I think I actually felt myself aging because of the slow speed of those damn machines.
• Folks, stop ribbing on the Eagle Rants Editor for the time of day that the rants get posted. Keep in mind that these were only posted once a week just 3 months ago. She probably has classes and homework and a social life to keep up with too. Lay off.

• @person who wants AU to open a medical school. As someone who is pre-med, I don't recommend this.

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect.

But good try.

WHY are you wearing sweatpants in public? I'd agree with your bf that you should dress a little nicer than that to go out. But if he also criticizes the clothes you wear around the dorm/ in private, that sounds controlling/problematic.

• To the ranters making Breaking Bad references, I want to sweet raw love to all of you!

It sounds like someone is a virgin in terms of emotional maturity. Apparently, you still have some growing up to do.
• @""Sweatpants wearer."" You have to be yourself, do your thing, and stick to your own style. Keep on wearing sweatpants as much as you like.  But if it would make your bf happy, it wouldn't hurt to dress nice every once in a while.

• @”You’re going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries,” Actually I don’t eat those types of foods. I eat all organic, vegan, no saturated fat foods, and I exercise each day. I choose to live a healthy lifestyle and do not appreciate people who selfishly release their toxic fumes into my walking path when they could just as easily get their high from a nicotine patch and thereby avoid harming others with their decisions. I try my best not to make decisions that harm others, and I expect the same respect from others.
• @why fat people are fat. It couldn't be because of thyroid disorder or because they don't have a lot of money and fattier, carb loaded unhealthy food is cheaper so they get stuck buying that instead of expensive fruits and veggies from whole foods...quit being such a jerk.

• Why is everyone hating on the slut shamers!? I didn't know adultery was cool nowadays... (Yes it's not traditional adultery but it's all the same) I mean I guess I can go tell my girlfriend of 2 years that I'm allowed to sleep around because everyone else does it. That isn't right and neither is whoring yourself to every guy in EI. #stfu and #gtfo please and thank you!
• @TimMcBrideDelawareRant- I'm just glad you know it's a state. Proud to rep the state of our SG Pres, not so proud about that witch
• @ ""Dear ugly wonk who hates smokers:""  And that ladies and gentleman is what we call an ad hominem attack.  Also some possible anger management issues.
• @”I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Actually I have plenty of sex with my amazing girlfriend, thanks for asking.  But I’m glad you view your sluttiness and impulsivity as an accomplishment.  And I admire virgins for waiting for the right person instead of giving it up at a trashy frat party. But I don’t even know why I am bothering to argue with someone who clearly lacks basic human decency towards others and doesn’t care if they blow toxic fumes at innocent bystanders.
• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.
• Guys. Hot TA who's a grad student, I'm a sophomore. Anything possible there? Grad students, help me out.
• Eagle Rants Editor: Are you male or female? Jw so I could put your editor's notes in better context. I know the original rants editor was male. And then there was a female. And you are the third editor right?
[Editor’s Note: I am everything.]
• Editor, are there going to be rants over break??
[Editor’s Note: Probably not. Maybe once on Wednesday]
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.
• @To straight female conservative republican: wow. People like you are the reason conservatives are demonized on campus and the epitome of what I dislike about liberals.
• I love sluts!
• who is peeta? and who is gale? and why do they have teams?
• Mainstream bands that should come to AU: Brand New, Anti-Flag, fun., Say Anything, Motion City Soundtrack, Vampire Weekend, WolfMother, Fostor The People. All these bands are relatively cheap to see, so come on SUB!!
• The girl always wearing a cap, brown-ish hair and a red backpack. YOU ARE SO HOT!!!!! And I really want to talk to you!!!!!

I love this rant.  I relate so much to playing video games late at night.  Lol
• Gonna be on campus all Spring break.
As dumb as hash tags are...
#forever alone.
• @""dating five guys means you is a SLUT."" - dating, kissing, and sexing with 5 guys at the same time may potentially qualify you as a slut...or just seeing what's out there. Who am I to judge?? Better yet, WHO ARE YOU!?
• AU students are good at making petitions and protesting ish. Where do all the smokers sign?? Even better, why don't we just congregate on the quad and have one big puff sesh?
• To everyone on the side of Kogod facing Hughes: Hope you enjoy the shows~ We'll be here all week. XD
• To the editor: You make my day with your comments, especially since you love Christine like I do too. Keep on being awesome. :]
• To the smokers: maybe a smoke-free plan wouldn't even be necessary if you actually listened to the 25 feet rule? Just saying, it's not that hard and could make everyone's life easier. Could even save you from dealing with a smoke-free campus policy. Hm, novel idea? Sounds like it to me.
• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]
• @Meet us at 6am Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the fitness center wrestling room.  We won’t judge you, we will train you.""  -... what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I'm kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.
• @I agree about the Adele chick. She’s in my class and I want to play with her boobs. ---what class is this, i think i know who you're talking about
• @""5th week at the counseling center""
Congratulations! I may not know who you are, but I want you to know that I am proud of you for your progress. I just went today for my initial appointment and I felt so relieved even after that. They are really great at what they do, and I can't wait for another appointment. I hope things continue to go well for you!
• @""its just smoke""
are you serious, or just completely uneducated on this topic? its ridiculously carcinogenic, and while i couldn't care less if thats your habit (i have several friends who smoke, and i respect their choices), don't you dare belittle the risks involved.
• I'm sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished when in actuality it is the hard work of many others over several years who have worked to get a victim advocate on campus. Why are the other people never mentioned?! You can't claim credit for others work and always get away with it
• Yo sexy business major in my art class, wanna get in my business this weekend??
• The rude way students treat staff/faculty/anyone-who-actually-has-authority makes me want to transfer to where people actually give a f*#k about respecting others
• @""Who doesn't want to see a little more booty?"" AMEN! :D Nothing wrong with that, and besides, shouldn't we all be able to wear what we want?
• Oh boy! the SG dumped more tuition dollars into a Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator! Excellent use of tuition money, especially since there are so many sexual assaults on campus as to overwhelm the existing resources for dealing with them. Just kidding. There are virtually no sexual assaults on campus and there are already adequate resources available.
• @It’s called a lance…hello
 I will fong you, until your insides are out, your outsides are in, your entrails will become your extrails I will w-rip... all the p... ung. Pain, lots of pain.
• You put the boom-boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same
• I wish I had started talking to you so much sooner. You are such a beautiful and unique person, and if only I had had a chance to get to know you sooner, I would love to show you so much more. But being your friend can be still be uber fun. :]
• @My Drunk Kitchen ranter:
YES. I'm addicted to that show and that song. My roommate thinks I'm crazy.
• na na na na na na hey hey hey its spring break in a few days cheer up!
• Is it me or does everyone on the BOE have a stick up their ass? I mean, even if they were having sex they probably would still have a smug/serious face on and express no pleasure whatsoever...
• I swear I've gained five pounds this week alone. Stress eating ftw!
• Hey guy on crutches - sucks that you have to get around campus on those. Good for you looking incredibly attractive while doing so!
• Anyone noticed that orbit gun dissolves in your mouth really fast if you're salivating a lot?  Good thing I don't have to worry about that at American University!  (Get it anyone, anyone?)
• You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
• @""Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc..."" Um, maybe some of us are just fulfilling our natural sexual urges and comfortable with our human sexuality? I occasionally sleep around and I am perfectly happy with who I am personally and sexually. I don't need anyone's help. You have no right to try to make me ashamed of that.
• We should ban anti-smokers at AU! It's bad for my brain to process such filth and unnecessary thoughts
• I really like the Kony bracelet though.
• Ok so I read the Hunger Games and enjoyed it. But guys, you need to chill out. IT'S JUST A BOOK
• I have to wonder, why is there no on campus river? I feel like my tuition should pay for such a thing.
• You lost The Game.
• @very excited The Wombats fan: !!!!! I am sooo excited they are coming back. I saw them back in October at the 930 club and they were amazing. I got VIP tickets, did you?
• @""Who doesn't want to see a little more booty?""  Me.
• Let's be real, no guy looks at a Victoria's Secret model and thinks to himself ""I wish she would tell me her problems, because I'm in love with her and I want to be someone she trusts.""   When it comes down to it, men like REAL women, so don't sweat the small stuff.
• GOAL: something will happen with me and a guy by finals. Only I can make it happen. Men: hi!
• @""Drop. Your. Sword."" Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!
• Again, can we please put the Eagle Rants tab on the website on the LEFT side of the screen, so we don't have to expand the website each time we open the eagle website in order to access the rants.
• I don't know whether you think i'm just weird or crazy...
• @I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
It's not RHA persey, I'd blame the RA's who don't bother looking up at the front desk when you walk in and offing public safety. This would all be so much easier if we just had freaking security cameras in the dorms like other colleges...
• @""Why can’t Eagle Rants be clever and contain basic English. I’ve read other schools rants (UNC-Chapel Hill) and they surpass us in ranting.""
I am 99.9% sure I know who you are, and you annoy the sh*t out of me. Go to UNC already if you really think the kids there are so much better than the AU student body.
• The next time I see someone say that AU is a politically active campus, I'm showing them the list of candidates for this year's SG elections and laughing in their faces.
• Lol, my friend originally made the Adele rant about me, even though I don't think I look like her at all. Some people disagree, but either way, it looks like we got a few Adele look-alikes around campus! :)
• @ ""caught mysterious man in his 30s walking around""
Was this on Southside? On the top floor of Letts/Anderson. Around... 11 or 12 o'clock at night on Monday. If so, that ""30 year old man"" was me. I'm 19. I was looking for a friend of mine. Sorry to be a burden.
• I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer. That'd be cool. But God could have made pokemon real but instead was like ""Nah man. Malaria."" T_T
• if you werent so adorable we wouldnt be in this mess! how am i supposed to survive a whole week without you!
• I dont know if its that my AU goggles have become thicker OR  that I've just finally found some guys that I am actually attracted too, but im loving my selection right now.
• To the guy that took god-like care of me when I needed it: you have no idea how much I appreciate everything, especially since you were a stranger to me.
• If anyone's taking Metro this weekend, do take note of the Red Line closure between Van Ness and Dupont Circle. You might want to save yourself some stress and take the N6 bus straight from campus to Dupont Circle instead.
• Hey guess what? Who I sleep with is none of your business unless I'm sleeping with you. Why do you even care? It has NOTHING to do with you. So why don't you focus on your own life instead of judging other people, because no one asked you.
• Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.
• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.
• does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?
• to the people quoting Lost:
i love the show, and admit to posting a few lost quotes myself. with that being said, please dont post the same ones over again. your just flat out bothering people
• so who wants to make love with me?
• AU email defaults the check-in for Alcohol Edu to the spam folder.  Even gmail knows nobody really cares about it at this point.
• Is Women's Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a ""rape culture""?
• Smile! Someone, somewhere cares about you!
• what's up with those black cars on the quad...? EAGLE do a tweet/story about this please!
• Eagle Rants Editor, you so funny
[Editor’s Note: Thanks babe]
• Why do people care about other people being sluts? Or even use that word at all? It is quite derogatory to women everywhere and completely none of your business what a woman chooses to do with her own sex life.
• I live on hughes 5, I don't close my curtains and I'm generally always naked. You're welcome.
• I would be out on the quad right now,you know if wasnt allergic to grass or anything #goingtoschoolatanationallyrankedarboretumproblems
• Funny how the Occupy AU students protest a sitting Governor for being racist but don't protest a woman who was a member of the Black Panthers and was listed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list...
• To the D Chi who gave a flower to a girl on a tour Thursday afternoon: While I am flattered, you managed to pick the one person in the whole tour group who was already a student here to ""welcome"" to AU with a flower. I am actually a junior and was evaluating a new freshman tour guide. However, I do appreciate your attitude and I am keeping the flower.
• @""Drop. Your. Sword"" -- STOP. YOU DIDN'T. I LOVE YOU.

• QUAD SO HARD MOTHAF***ERS WANNA FINE ME.
• Dear AU community,
I'm sorry if I flashed you today. It was really windy and my skirt was really flowy.
Love,

•@women choose lower paying jobs. additionally, you need to look up the statistics that show that (white) women have to have a PhD in order to make the same amount as a man with a B.A. That means that women have to shell out more for more than 4 yrs of education in order to earn as much as a man who paid for 4.
•@women choose lower paying jobs. this is effing bs. how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president? how many of them keep those ambitions? it's because they get shamed into thinking they're not good enough for those jobs by society. I'm ashamed of YOU for buying into that bs.

•I want to take your advice and just go with it, but my history keeps me from taking that leap. I wish I could be bold, but I can't.
•So Eaglesecure started sucking again on my computer when I was forced to change my myAU password. I was able to fix it by going into the command line. I wonder how AU students who aren't super-technical computer geniuses are supposed to survive with this thing?
•One is not two countries. One is not meat corrupting. It is important to stay sweet and loving.
•What most people don't know is, if you have enough credits, you can lower your meal plan. Last year I only had 100 meal swipes second semester :D
•I have never saved the world. I have played beer pong. I'm okay with this.
•what makes you think a bunch of anonymous ranters who are probably most all undergraduates who don't know you or your boyfriend at all will somehow help you figure out his mindset and why he hasn't proposed if you as his girlfriend can't. what gives indeed
•@""Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours. Is this right? Just wondering?"" No. You can call the department and anonymously report her.
•Do I Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet–and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
•stop hating on the Eagle/the editor.. it's their job, let them do it because they do it well
[Editor's note: Aww thanks.]
•I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above
•You clearly didn't do any research if you think that women get paid the same as men do for equal work.  Women's Initiative is not saying that a female teacher should make as much money as a male lawyer.  WI is saying that a female teacher and a male teacher on equal ground should be paid the same.  Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.
•@person who didn't give consent- not saying anything does not ever mean it was consented to.. and about AU doing more to educate, if you took a look at Women's Initiative, you would see there is a sub-group called ""Consensual"" that is dedicated completely to educating students about consent. I would look there for more information and I am truly so sorry about what happened to you.
•@Dear SIS: THIS! Seriously, SIS you have your own building that's beautiful and new. Stop infringing on our space.
•Funny how a melody / Sounds like a memory / Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
•i've heard that AU is going on a witch hunt to dig up stuff about fraternities to try to get them kicked off campus in favor of fraternities that aren't as popular on campus but are loved by the administration. why does AU keep making up lies to get people in trouble and decrease the amount of fun????  this pisses me off...where's the transparency?
•@once you're pregnant, it's not just your body.
It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it. And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.

•@legal guardian of younger brother: You sound like a really great guy. If your gf can't give you the support you need then there are plenty of great local support groups for family members dealing with caring for a child with autism. You should check them out. Good luck!
•@sex in the library: sounds good.
•Can't remember my own age. ""Am I nineteen? I think I'm eighteen. yeah,I'm eighteen.""
•I feel like I should've taken better advantage of the potential to hook up and meet people this year. In just a few weeks, thousands of students will graduate and I'll probably never get the chance to meet/hook up with them again...
•@won’t be donating to AU bc of eagle rants: I will be donating money to AU every time they call BECAUSE of the eagle rants. They have helped AU become a community more than any other initiative. They provide a forum for free discussion. They give a daily boost of happiness. And they show how smart and supportive AU students are. And they give alumni a window into current AU happenings.
•I can't take this anymore. By stress blood pressure is through the roof.
•I want to go back to my high school reunion, but I was bullied a lot during high school and Im scared that some of my classmates will still be very immature and mean. Should I risk going or should I skip it and be ""that girl"" who didn't go to the reunion bc I had no friends in high school.
•@using a credit card at TDR: I am also surprised at how few people do this. Newsflash: You don't need (not do I recommend) getting a meal plan. They rip you off. Just go when you want and pay with credit card or cash.
•@”I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.” People like you make me ashamed to be an alum of this university. I’ve read eagle rants every day since the day they were invented and there have never been rants that promote “rape culture”. People who want women to be held to an equal standard than men while drunk are not promoting a “rape culture”.
•@”[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]” This was a rather rude reply. Why not apologize and then say what you said.
•@ranter who thinks rants support rape culture: The editor rightly made you look like a fool by pointing out that the eagle frequent does women’s issues stories especially when it comes to the rape issue (probably more so than any other college in the country due to AU’s extremely powerful lobby from Women’s Initiative being part of student government).  Please think outside your small bubble and learn to accept differing opinions and viewpoints.
•My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got my nerd friends (RPG, Halo, etc), my floormates (drinking, shenanigans), my occupy friends, hispanic friends. Its so goddamn difficult, because I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have to focus on my goddamn GPA and how I'm going to spend my life, when I really want to focus on getting a girlfriend and who I'm going to spend my life with. And at the moment, noone wants to be my girlfriend.
•Dear (who I can only assume to be) freshmen ranters:
You have made Eagle Rants suck.  The majority of what you post aren't even rants, they're just political crap or statements.  The last couple years had REAL rants.  I'm sure you have stuff you dislike about this crappy school of ours, so stop arguing about abortion and complain.
Sincerely,
Bored Upperclassman
•Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...
•I love the idiot hippies who protest events at this school when their hero Che said gems like “The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.”
•Why are you so talkative on words with friends but as soon as we see each other in public you shut right up? One out of ten games on words with friends ends up in a hook up and I want you to be that one!!
•Women’s initiative does not make me feel empowered. It only tries to make me feel like the world is a scary dangerous place full of evil rapist men. I look forward to the soon-to-be created conservative women’s group that will hopefully be much more empowering to women.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain.."" I find therapy very helpful. There student center on campus is great, and there are a lot of therapists in the area. It's good to just have an objective outsider to talk to sometimes. In a fix, videogames are pretty great too...
•I'm always scared that people will think that I wrote rants about them here.  It's kind of creepy how familiar some of these sound.
•OIT used Wikipedia as a source in their email in addition to terrible grammar. EVERYONE SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE AND CLAIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS OK WITH IT.

•@Night runner: See you tonight! :)
•It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle in Wednesday's post. The Editor's done a good job cleaning up Knepper's mess that she inherited. The Eagle Rants are so interesting because we--actual students--get a platform to say what we want. I commend the Editor for not censoring those rants. It encourages debate and discussion. Now you can actually see how much work needs to be done on the feminism front at AU if that's something you care about.

•@""TA is making us pay"" Absolutely not. It may technically be legal if it's not her office hours, but it's rude and not why you should be a TA. There are other great resources-- the writing center, academic support, professors, friends. That TA just sucks. I ask my TA dumb questions all the time and he's fine with it. Better luck next time, and consider mentioning it to your prof.

Yeah. Sure. Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.
•To the T.S. Eliot ranter: I want you here, please don't leave.
•Do you know what's a real tragedy? That WI thinks that people are ignoring the rape of women and that people ""aren't taking rape seriously"". Seriously? If anything it's women who are ignoring the consistent sexual abuse of men by fostering a culture where men are supposed to protect women, and where men ""can't"" be abused. Not only that, but it was incredibly hard to study during ""Take Back the Night"" and it achieved nothing than furthering the goals of the female circlejerk that is Women's Initiative. It is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.

The fact that they don't even let students know what events will be happening when is very inconsiderate.

Eagle Rants: July/August 2013





Eagle Rants: June 24, 2013





Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




[Editor's note: This editor understands that it's finals seasons, which means stress and tension; but please, Ranters, follow the rules of Ranting, and please don't be hateful against people or groups of people. Conversation, criticism and view-sharing are one thing; outright profanity, hate speech, racism, sexism, advocating illegal activity and just plain cruelty are another. To the Ranter who once asked how many Rants this editor deletes each day, I take back my response; we've gone well over a dozen today.]
•@women choose lower paying jobs. additionally, you need to look up the statistics that show that (white) women have to have a PhD in order to make the same amount as a man with a B.A. That means that women have to shell out more for more than 4 yrs of education in order to earn as much as a man who paid for 4.
•@women choose lower paying jobs. this is effing bs. how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president? how many of them keep those ambitions? it's because they get shamed into thinking they're not good enough for those jobs by society. I'm ashamed of YOU for buying into that bs.
•A woman with a weapon and knows how to use it. There is almost nothing hotter.
•I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside I've got the month of May, I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way? my girl.
•I want to take your advice and just go with it, but my history keeps me from taking that leap. I wish I could be bold, but I can't.
•So Eaglesecure started sucking again on my computer when I was forced to change my myAU password. I was able to fix it by going into the command line. I wonder how AU students who aren't super-technical computer geniuses are supposed to survive with this thing?
•One is not two countries. One is not meat corrupting. It is important to stay sweet and loving.
•What most people don't know is, if you have enough credits, you can lower your meal plan. Last year I only had 100 meal swipes second semester :D
•I have never saved the world. I have played beer pong. I'm okay with this.
•what makes you think a bunch of anonymous ranters who are probably most all undergraduates who don't know you or your boyfriend at all will somehow help you figure out his mindset and why he hasn't proposed if you as his girlfriend can't. what gives indeed
•@""Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours. Is this right? Just wondering?"" No. You can call the department and anonymously report her.
•Do I Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet–and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
•stop hating on the Eagle/the editor.. it's their job, let them do it because they do it well
[Editor's note: Aww thanks.]
•I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above
•You clearly didn't do any research if you think that women get paid the same as men do for equal work.  Women's Initiative is not saying that a female teacher should make as much money as a male lawyer.  WI is saying that a female teacher and a male teacher on equal ground should be paid the same.  Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.
•@person who didn't give consent- not saying anything does not ever mean it was consented to.. and about AU doing more to educate, if you took a look at Women's Initiative, you would see there is a sub-group called ""Consensual"" that is dedicated completely to educating students about consent. I would look there for more information and I am truly so sorry about what happened to you.
•@Dear SIS: THIS! Seriously, SIS you have your own building that's beautiful and new. Stop infringing on our space.
•Funny how a melody / Sounds like a memory / Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
•i've heard that AU is going on a witch hunt to dig up stuff about fraternities to try to get them kicked off campus in favor of fraternities that aren't as popular on campus but are loved by the administration. why does AU keep making up lies to get people in trouble and decrease the amount of fun????  this pisses me off...where's the transparency?
•@once you're pregnant, it's not just your body.
It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it. And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.
•@""I like you a lot too. We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious. Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward..."" It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Just go for it.
•STRESS
•@legal guardian of younger brother: You sound like a really great guy. If your gf can't give you the support you need then there are plenty of great local support groups for family members dealing with caring for a child with autism. You should check them out. Good luck!
•@sex in the library: sounds good.
•Can't remember my own age. ""Am I nineteen? I think I'm eighteen. yeah,I'm eighteen.""
•I feel like I should've taken better advantage of the potential to hook up and meet people this year. In just a few weeks, thousands of students will graduate and I'll probably never get the chance to meet/hook up with them again...
•@won’t be donating to AU bc of eagle rants: I will be donating money to AU every time they call BECAUSE of the eagle rants. They have helped AU become a community more than any other initiative. They provide a forum for free discussion. They give a daily boost of happiness. And they show how smart and supportive AU students are. And they give alumni a window into current AU happenings.
•I can't take this anymore. By stress blood pressure is through the roof.
•I want to go back to my high school reunion, but I was bullied a lot during high school and Im scared that some of my classmates will still be very immature and mean. Should I risk going or should I skip it and be ""that girl"" who didn't go to the reunion bc I had no friends in high school.
•@using a credit card at TDR: I am also surprised at how few people do this. Newsflash: You don't need (not do I recommend) getting a meal plan. They rip you off. Just go when you want and pay with credit card or cash.
•@”I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.” People like you make me ashamed to be an alum of this university. I’ve read eagle rants every day since the day they were invented and there have never been rants that promote “rape culture”. People who want women to be held to an equal standard than men while drunk are not promoting a “rape culture”.
•@”[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]” This was a rather rude reply. Why not apologize and then say what you said.
•@ranter who thinks rants support rape culture: The editor rightly made you look like a fool by pointing out that the eagle frequent does women’s issues stories especially when it comes to the rape issue (probably more so than any other college in the country due to AU’s extremely powerful lobby from Women’s Initiative being part of student government).  Please think outside your small bubble and learn to accept differing opinions and viewpoints.
•My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got my nerd friends (RPG, Halo, etc), my floormates (drinking, shenanigans), my occupy friends, hispanic friends. Its so goddamn difficult, because I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have to focus on my goddamn GPA and how I'm going to spend my life, when I really want to focus on getting a girlfriend and who I'm going to spend my life with. And at the moment, noone wants to be my girlfriend.
•Dear (who I can only assume to be) freshmen ranters:
You have made Eagle Rants suck.  The majority of what you post aren't even rants, they're just political crap or statements.  The last couple years had REAL rants.  I'm sure you have stuff you dislike about this crappy school of ours, so stop arguing about abortion and complain.
Sincerely,
Bored Upperclassman
•Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...
•I love the idiot hippies who protest events at this school when their hero Che said gems like “The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.”
•Why are you so talkative on words with friends but as soon as we see each other in public you shut right up? One out of ten games on words with friends ends up in a hook up and I want you to be that one!!
•Women’s initiative does not make me feel empowered. It only tries to make me feel like the world is a scary dangerous place full of evil rapist men. I look forward to the soon-to-be created conservative women’s group that will hopefully be much more empowering to women.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain.."" I find therapy very helpful. There student center on campus is great, and there are a lot of therapists in the area. It's good to just have an objective outsider to talk to sometimes. In a fix, videogames are pretty great too...
•I'm always scared that people will think that I wrote rants about them here.  It's kind of creepy how familiar some of these sound.
•OIT used Wikipedia as a source in their email in addition to terrible grammar. EVERYONE SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE AND CLAIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS OK WITH IT.
•@T.S. Eliot: HUGS HUGS HUGS
•@Night runner: See you tonight! :)
•It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle in Wednesday's post. The Editor's done a good job cleaning up Knepper's mess that she inherited. The Eagle Rants are so interesting because we--actual students--get a platform to say what we want. I commend the Editor for not censoring those rants. It encourages debate and discussion. Now you can actually see how much work needs to be done on the feminism front at AU if that's something you care about.
•that awkward moment at phonathon when the person you're calling has the same name as your high school principal and you get really scared for a second...
•I sit next to a beautiful girl at phonathon.
•It has gotten to the point where the only point I am relaxed is when I'm at work. Because I'm not allowed to do school work then
•It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes
•I am an Republican, but what's happening in Arizona is just plain wrong. Seriously someone needs to stop them. That abortion bill makes no sense
•I believe in God and believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. If you don't, then let's be friends
•Who wants to start a Fight Club? once we get enough members we will start enforcing the rules
[Editor's note: Rule #1 - Don't talk about Fight Club.]
•Need to heal emotional pain? Jesus will take the wheel. Prayer helps...and tea...and green trees.
[Editor's note: Hoped this editor edited your Rant right!]
•Welcome to the Emptiness
•Why are you so awesome? I'm weird but cool and so are you...how did we find each other? Thanks OKCupid, even though we didn't meet on there.
•Now that were good and lost lets party
•Why do I close up and get scared when you tell me how much you like me? The feeling is mutual, but it's always been a problem for me to share my feelings. I hope you can see how much I'm grateful that you walked into my life. Perfect timing.
•@ Whenever I e-mail a paper to myself to print, I write nice notes to myself in the subject line so I feel like there are people who love me and think good things about me.
I know its late, but I do this too!!!!!  From now on, I'll think of you as well each time I do this.  :D
•@""Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy."" Shall we rant about men? How about them crazy boys?!
•Roomie, I adore you. And I get that you like talking on the phone in the room, I do too. But somehow your voice is three times louder on the phone than on real life.....
•@""TA is making us pay"" Absolutely not. It may technically be legal if it's not her office hours, but it's rude and not why you should be a TA. There are other great resources-- the writing center, academic support, professors, friends. That TA just sucks. I ask my TA dumb questions all the time and he's fine with it. Better luck next time, and consider mentioning it to your prof.
•""you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life"" I love you.
•@""Lately, I've been going through some major life changes..."" Those are pretty major, I'd be surprised if she was completely not understanding. Maybe bring them up casually in conversation, gauge out her reaction?I have no idea. But if I were her, I'd probably be worried but not want to make you more worried about the new pressures. She might appreciate you bringing it up so she knows it's ok to talk about.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol."" Art? Throw some paint around, get your hands dirty, stop thinking for a bit. :)
•Why does is everyone so effing annoying? I'm so sick of dealing with this.
•I don't understand why my prof has such a high rating on ratemyprofessor... He assigns so much busywork, his grading system doesn't make sense, and the essay assignments he comes up with are just plain dumb. I've never hated a class so much before in my life...and this is my favorite subject, too. :/
•sometimes i think my HIGH libido talks for me...
•All I want is to sleep, party, and for someone to hold me when I need it until everything is all the way better.
•While I appreciate the sincerity about the fact we only want to use each other for hook ups... the fact that you can't hold a conversation has made you lose all chances you ever had with me. If you're that boring in conversation you must be boring in bed.
•@""What they promote is the idea that women CAN...""
Yeah. Sure. Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.
•To the T.S. Eliot ranter: I want you here, please don't leave.
•Do you know what's a real tragedy? That WI thinks that people are ignoring the rape of women and that people ""aren't taking rape seriously"". Seriously? If anything it's women who are ignoring the consistent sexual abuse of men by fostering a culture where men are supposed to protect women, and where men ""can't"" be abused. Not only that, but it was incredibly hard to study during ""Take Back the Night"" and it achieved nothing than furthering the goals of the female circlejerk that is Women's Initiative. It is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.
•My boyfriend and I (long-distance) have planned on getting married for a long time. Now he's saying he's not happy, and he might want a break. Suddenly all that Vicodin leftover from my surgery is looking pretty freaking good.
•You're strong, reliable, and authentic, and you'll make it through to the other side of all of this.
•I took her out, it was a Friday night - I walk alone, to get the feeling right. We started making out, and she took off her pants, but then I turned on the TV... and that's about the time she walked AWAYYY FROM MEEE. Nobody likes you when you're TWENTYYY THREEE and I'm still more amused by TV shows; what the hell is ADD? My friends say I should act my age... what's my age again? What's my age again?
•Omnivores: please do not take tofurkey for the novelty, or I will carve a V into your face
•@The love for the La Cage and the Billy Joel lyrics posts: Thanks for all the love! I just saw La Cage earlier this semester at the Kennedy Center and loved it!
As for Billy Joel fan, I've been nonstop listening for the last few days. I can never get enough of his songs! :D #proudlongislandboy
•I hate to break it to you guys, but the original free speech board wasn't taken down because of speech issues, it was taken down because people drew penises all over it.  Turns out some college students still don't really have much to share with the public besides their genitalia.
•@Dear SIS: I was thinking the exact same thing. I realize that Katzen is a big space to put events. I do. But blocking several classrooms with tables all day is ridiculous. Half of those tables were not even used. They were set up around 10 am and were not taken down until around 8 pm. The fact that they don't even let students know what events will be happening when is very inconsiderate.
•Hey ANTH 225! Why do you stare like you have no light going on in your head. When the teacher says ""Hey, there are no wrong answers"" then there are no wrong answers. And I see writing notes, but you know thats not gonna do you any good in a class MOSTLY ABOUT PARTICIPATION! Stop wasting everyones time and participate, you are paying 50,000 to be here...

•@”Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.” That’s because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours. Please give me one single study that shows that women are being paid less than men when working the same jobs for the same amount of time. This is a non-issue and turns women away from feminist groups that ignore REAL issues facing women.
•@how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president?"" Actually, There are more women than men in both law schools and med schools. So you may want to check your facts.  Society is NOT ‘keeping women down’ and squashing their dreams. STOP PLAYING VICTIM! I’m a woman law student at AU. I have never encountered anyone telling me I couldn’t be a lawyer bc I’m a women. The fact is women CHOOSE lower paying jobs like teaching and social work more than men because many women ENJOY helping people more than making tons of money.
[Editor's note: This editor just wants to point out that there's a difference between having more women than men enrolled to study a particular subject and the rate of pay those women and men receive.]

•@You clearly didn't do any research - June O'Neil, formerly of the Congressional Budget Office, found that young women who have never had children make, after controlling for experience and education, 98 percent of what men make. She found that on the whole, there is an  unexplained gap of 8% between what ALL men and women make when controlling for these things. This is far too large of a gap, the gap in a perfect world would be zero - but it is also FAR less than ""77 percent,"" as one ranter said yesterday.

•My huge craps ain't goin' away.
•ALL OF MY PLANS ARE COMING TRUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEE <3
now I just need to find the motivation to keep my grades up...
[Editor's note: Congrats!]
•Later on, on the drive home, I called her mom from a pay phone. I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail (the state looks down on sodomy). And that's about the time that B**** HUNG UP ON ME. Nobody likes you when you're TWENTY-THREE and I'm still more amused by pay phone calls. What the hell is call ID? My friends say I should act my age... what's my age again? What's my age again?
•The only forms of human contact I get anymore are punches to the ribcage and kicks to the stomach.  And I'm strangely okay with that.
•woke up spooning a trashcan #mylifeisrobcoy
•I've finally gotten the college experience; this entire year was one crazy whirlwind of an adventure. I'm scared that maybe it was too much of an adventure, and now no one will want to get serious with me. I promise I'm an amazing girl, I just needed my ""single"" year!
•I.  Hate.  Group.  Projects.  Nothing against my fellow group members, you're all great, I just hate feeling obligated to produce better work since we're all in this together...
•Love who you are.
Because God made you who you are for a reason and trying to be anyone else is an insult to His creation.
•Whoever ranted Springsteen by Eric Church lyrics is my hero. Can we be friends????
•@transfer who can't find friends: I transferred here 4 semesters ago, and although I have a lot of acquaintances, I wouldn't call any of them true friends. Just know you're not alone, this place can be pretty lonely, but maybe we'll bump into one another some day?
•@Desperate Housewives: I DON'T KNOW! DH has been my guilty pleasure for way too long.  I may go back and watch the first few seasons, as I don't really remember them at all.
•@Bullying Club: Tuesday the 17th, 4pm, Mudbox? (Posting this way in advance so you can respond with another time if that's not good.)
•Oh my bad I was completely wrong about how they were edited.
•I stay facebook friends with a girl from high school who I a absolutely hated (because she was mean was so mean to me) just so that I can take pride in knowing that my life is better than hers. And knowing that she peaked in high school gives me happiness. Is this wrong of me?
•Dear Eagle Rants Editor---Grow a pair you pussy
[Editor's note: This editor reads angry Rants all day and runs a business. So already got a pair, but thanks anyway, honey.]
•@”And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.” Um actually once the baby is viable (ie around 5 months) biology and the supreme court agree that it is NOT ‘just your body’. But it shouldn’t take you 5 months to realize a missed period.
•I was asked why materialism was a bad thing. I was so shocked that I couldn't come up with a coherent answer? What do other ranters think?
•The flowers are AU are so beautiful. Does anyone else take daily nature walks and stop and smell the flowers?
•@ “It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I hope someone as selfish as you never reproduces. I cannot wait to grow and nurture a life inside me. To do prenatal yoga. To read to my unborn baby. And to take care of the LIFE that is inside me. I do not judge those who choose not to have kids. That’s why we have many options for birth control. But to say that a baby living inside you is destroying your body? Wow, just wow.
•Can one be thankful without being religious or spiritual? I say yes but my friend says no because who are they thanking?
•@”Women's Initiative is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.” I agree. If our tuition money is paying for Women’s Initiative (a branch of student government), then why are Women’s Initiative leadership positions up for student government elections?
•When were hipsters invented and where did they come from? Does anyone know? I don't know any hipsters back where I come from.
•@”If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I always supported the idea that the government should never be able to force anything on people. Therefore, while I abhor the idea of abortion, I abhor even more the idea of an overly intrusive government restricting liberties. But to hear a fellow AU student talk so selfishly about a baby as if it is a cancer is almost more disgusting that the idea of an abortion.
•Editor, Sorry you had to deal with a dozen rule breaking rants on the 11th. It was probably just one really angry person ranting away. Don’t let that day ruin your faith in the eagle rants community.
[Editor's note: It's Ranters like you that keep this editor going!]
•@Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.” There was an event a few years back about choosing abstinence. Women’s Initiative protested it.
•@”This editor wouldn't want her classmates or friends to refrain from Ranting just because they know she's editing them. Make sense?” No not really. The rants are anonymous, so you wouldn’t know which ones were from your friends anyway. And if you know certain friends well enough to know their writing style, then they probably know you well enough to know that you are the editor even if you don’t publicly release that information.
•that awkward moment when your boyfriend thinks you ranted about him when it was really someone else in the same situation
•To the girl next door who keeps yelling at her boyfriend on the phone every night – please STOP. Sincerely, someone who is trying to study.
•Be converted. Follow the signs
•I have to pee -- but that means packing all my stuff up and taking it too the bathroom only to return minuets later :( On another note, my essay is due in 7 hours and I really haven't started it yet.
•I wish I could spend every night wrapped up in your arms. I shouldn't, (for now anyhow), but you make it so tempting...
•""It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes.""
Amen. I wish the best of luck to you, and I hope I receive the same in return. Just keep looking toward the future, seriously. That's what is getting me by now. Well, that and finally watching Heroes. XD
•@Desperate Housewives fan: I really don't know what I'm going to do. I know that other networks have tried to fill up the Sunday 9pm time slot, but that has been dedicated to DH for the longest time. :[ I don't know where you may want to go from here, but if you want to take a chance with a show in a whole different direction, may I recommend Breaking Bad?
•The last few weeks may be crashing down on my head, but through all the chaos of this, you pull me through it all. We have trudged through so much to get where we are, and while we may struggle with all the obstacles that face us now, I really believe we can make it. Thank you for never losing hope and making me so ridiculously happy again. I love you, rain or shine
•Note for TV characters everywhere: I know it's very dramatic and all, but angrily sliding things off of tables, desks, and other free-standing objects does not usually end well. Just saying. #avoidingworkatallcosts
•there are scary noises in the library at 5am.
•To the beautiful man wearing light blue shorts and dark khaki backpack in the Dav this morning, joking about putting out a fire with the barista... you are delicious, and seem really nice and funny. Even though I'm not brave enough to approach you, please continue to brighten my days by being incredibly sexy in the Dav. Please and thanks.
•See you at Dan Deacon on the 27th!
•I've been so stupid about guys lately that I literally should not be allowed to have a vagina.
•My boyfriend won't even hug me in public.  He claims it's because he hates PDA, but then he hugs all of his friends every time he sees them or says good bye or anything
•To all the stressed ranters, I suggest taking a walk through the neighborhood that is straight past and to the right of SIS.  It's called either rockwood or rookwood--I can never remember.  Either way, it's very peaceful and the fresh air helps.  Some light exercising at the gym with an iPod can work wonders as well.
I propose that instead of bickering back and forth about social issues on eaglerants everybody just post a tip on how to unstress.  Or you know, actually rant.
•Confession: I left AU after my freshman year, but I still read eagle rants religiously. Don't tell anyone ;)
[Editor's note: It'll be our little secret.]
•Aw dang, early morning Eagle Rants were starting to grow on me. But I'm sure the editor is doing her best to get it out and ready for us. :]

Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




•Arrogance, Pessimism, and being Anti-social have helped me find the self confidence I've been missing for a long time. It gets lonely at times, but I truly believe it's worth it in the end when I achieve my life goals. If you feel like deep down your lacking an identity, try seeing the world as against you instead of around you. It may be the motivation you've been searching for. # Darth Vader Advice Column
•sheeeeeebz
•""Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...""  Why do you say this? A select few think this. Not all of them.

•K, so my recently (ex) boyfriend is coming to visit to see if we can work things out. He says he can see us together but this weekend will determine if that happens. What can I do to get him back? Any success stories of things that have worked for you? HELP PLEASE
•@""It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle"" When I first read this I initially thought it was about  typographic alignment. My bad. #DesignStudentProblems
•@Can we please cite who wrote the poetry at the end? I'm pretty sure ranting without citations is still plagiarism. And if you are writing your own poetry and want to remain anonymous, just sign it ""self"": Excuse me while I go gag.
•4/20 is right around the corner...i don't know why but that day just speaks to me
•@""I'm a GW Student. An AU friend told me about rants, and I've been reading them for awhile. I have lots of boyfriend issues too. Am I allowed to rant?""
Yay, welcome to the magical world of eagle rants =) I wish I could meet more people from the other DC schools, not that I don't love AU kids but DC could potentially be such an awesome ""college town"" if there was a lil networking between all of us!
•@""consistent sexual abuse of men"". obviously you didn't go to take back the night because you wouldn't be saying the awful things you're say. Male sexual abuse was addressed.
P.S. the whole world is a men's circlejerk. when do women get a turn?
•An LDR support group fo' reals? HUZZAH, HUZZAH! Please notify us when this is official!
•I feel special when I get little Editor's Notes on my rants. :)
[Editor's note: This editor hopes you feel extra special today.]
•Does Editor have facebook? I can't find her there. :(
[Editor's note: Yes, but this editor's privacy settings are pretty strict.]
•@”Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.” That’s because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours. Please give me one single study that shows that women are being paid less than men when working the same jobs for the same amount of time. This is a non-issue and turns women away from feminist groups that ignore REAL issues facing women.
•@how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president?"" Actually, There are more women than men in both law schools and med schools. So you may want to check your facts.  Society is NOT ‘keeping women down’ and squashing their dreams. STOP PLAYING VICTIM! I’m a woman law student at AU. I have never encountered anyone telling me I couldn’t be a lawyer bc I’m a women. The fact is women CHOOSE lower paying jobs like teaching and social work more than men because many women ENJOY helping people more than making tons of money.
[Editor's note: This editor just wants to point out that there's a difference between having more women than men enrolled to study a particular subject and the rate of pay those women and men receive.]
•@original cold call ranter...yeah, totally wasn't talking about the same thing you were talking about...I was talking about solicitation calls, and yeah, it was in reference to a professor...sorry..
•UC World Politics hater: I completely agree with you. UC World Politics = so much unjustified ego.
•Why is this so much fun?
•of course the day I am about to buy my ticket to see Say Anything, the concert is sold out. of course
•You 100% did not deserve to get hired for that job and I'm sick of you taking good things away from good people just because you can. Plus, you're tacky and I hate you.
•@You clearly didn't do any research - June O'Neil, formerly of the Congressional Budget Office, found that young women who have never had children make, after controlling for experience and education, 98 percent of what men make. She found that on the whole, there is an  unexplained gap of 8% between what ALL men and women make when controlling for these things. This is far too large of a gap, the gap in a perfect world would be zero - but it is also FAR less than ""77 percent,"" as one ranter said yesterday.
•@Emotional Pain: Music.
•Honey, yo' nose sounds like a donkey blowing a horn. I understand that sometimes you just gotta sniffle, but other times you seriously just gotta BLOW. Please. Tissue yourself.

•@""Girl that new haircut is tragic, you literally look like a boy, and the track pants aren't helping."" Yes, God forbid someone not conform to gender norms. It makes me sad that people still think this way. Just let others be who they want; the fact you don't like how she looks is irrelevant.
•@""To the person who helped me get past chapter 5 of pottermore. I appreciate you, and glad to say I am a Hufflepuff.""  I'm glad I could help you out, but now that you're a Hufflepuff, we can probably never talk again.  Slytherin ftw.
•Good thing you are graduating...because you would be so wrong for me but I'm falling for you...
•I'm still seeing bright red Stars of David from the Matisyahu concert.
•I want more WVAU shows. Dan Deacon at Comet Ping Pong last Friday was awesome.
•@""I want to respect women but I know if I do, it'll lower my value as a man in the social hierarchy of life."" The only reason those guys appear cooler now is because girls don't mind using guys who are assholes if they're looking for a hookup or something like that. Stay the way you are and the one's who are looking for something more serious will flock to you when they realize how amazing you are. We just don't like using the nice guys.
•Wow. I was the one who ranted about psychics not being real, and I read my rant and it started out as ""Physics are not real"". My first thought? Who is this idiot who says physics aren't real? Then I realized it was my rant. Horrible spelling error on my part...
•@Every additional day that I'm here makes me wish that much more that I'd sent in my transfer applications. So exhausted from the harassment and lack of friendships.” Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist.
•@”You only get one life and one chance to live it, so cherish it.” How do you know we aren’t reincarnated into other people or life forms. #Hinduism.
•I'm scared of the direction I'm going. I''m scared my worst nightmare will come true. Stop me.

[Editor's note: The Campus Plan includes turning the Nebraska Parking Lot into East Campus with dorms and some retail space; building a dorm, North Hall, behind the behind the president's office; adding to Nebraska Hall; adding to MGC; and moving the law school to the Tenley Campus.]
•@Allison is just cold calling: How can you cold read someone you have never met or never knew existed? She’s not doing magic tricks. She’s just highly intuitive and in tune with the ‘other side’. She’s not the only one with that ability.

•Hey, stop complaining that you don't have a job after graduation... thats what happens when you don't apply to any...
•The food options on this campus are some of the most unhealthy and boring choices I have faced in many years. In an atmosphere of diversity I am discouraged with the efforts to bring real ethnic and diverse cuisine to this campus. How about forgetting the idea about the space in the tunnel and working on a way to provide some space for the great Food Trucks of DC. Check out Food Fiesta.

However, once we start dating, it's time for the games to stop and the relationship to begin, and that's when I want him to be nice.

•By claiming Eagle Rants are funny, people prove they have a dry sense of humor. IMO

•¡¡¿¿¡¿¡¡¡¿POR QUÉ NO ME AMAS??!?!?!!!?!!
•@""Girl that new haircut is tragic, you literally look like a boy, and the track pants aren't helping."" Yes, God forbid someone not conform to gender norms. It makes me sad that people still think this way. Just let others be who they want; the fact you don't like how she looks is irrelevant.
•@""To the person who helped me get past chapter 5 of pottermore. I appreciate you, and glad to say I am a Hufflepuff.""  I'm glad I could help you out, but now that you're a Hufflepuff, we can probably never talk again.  Slytherin ftw.
•Good thing you are graduating...because you would be so wrong for me but I'm falling for you...
•I'm still seeing bright red Stars of David from the Matisyahu concert.
•I want more WVAU shows. Dan Deacon at Comet Ping Pong last Friday was awesome.
•@""I want to respect women but I know if I do, it'll lower my value as a man in the social hierarchy of life."" The only reason those guys appear cooler now is because girls don't mind using guys who are assholes if they're looking for a hookup or something like that. Stay the way you are and the one's who are looking for something more serious will flock to you when they realize how amazing you are. We just don't like using the nice guys.
•Wow. I was the one who ranted about psychics not being real, and I read my rant and it started out as ""Physics are not real"". My first thought? Who is this idiot who says physics aren't real? Then I realized it was my rant. Horrible spelling error on my part...
•@Every additional day that I'm here makes me wish that much more that I'd sent in my transfer applications. So exhausted from the harassment and lack of friendships.” Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist.
•@”You only get one life and one chance to live it, so cherish it.” How do you know we aren’t reincarnated into other people or life forms. #Hinduism.
•I'm scared of the direction I'm going. I''m scared my worst nightmare will come true. Stop me.
•@Allison Debois challenge: She can’t just dream on command. With your logic you could say that no dreams don’t exist because I can’t prove I am dreaming if put on the stop.  And btw the Human Energy lab at University of Arizona confirmed her abilities.
•Wednesday May 3rd shall be the day that everyone reveals feelings their true feelings to their loved one.
•Don't worry about not having a bf/gf in college. You still have grad school.
•Alum here, I don't really understand what's going on in the new campus plan. It seems to have changed since last year. Can someone summarize what's going on?
[Editor's note: The Campus Plan includes turning the Nebraska Parking Lot into East Campus with dorms and some retail space; building a dorm, North Hall, behind the behind the president's office; adding to Nebraska Hall; adding to MGC; and moving the law school to the Tenley Campus.]
•@Allison is just cold calling: How can you cold read someone you have never met or never knew existed? She’s not doing magic tricks. She’s just highly intuitive and in tune with the ‘other side’. She’s not the only one with that ability.
•""I made a rant about how my tongue hurts from eating this girl out and how blowjobs are always boring ""
who are you and where can I find you before May 8th?
•Every time I come to your room you have your shirt off. You tried to put your arm around me during the movie and I didn't accept. I am not afraid of you and just really really want to make out with you. i apologize for being afraid of touching.
•I had a dream last night that I made out with one of my closest friends
•To the person addressing ""B"": Not sure if you're who I think you are, ..but regardless, its never too late. Go talk to this person.
•You know what, this may be crass but it took balls for Sarah to come out. I applaud her.
•@""I sense a troll among us, trying to spur on debate..."" YES. I am just at my biddie breaking point.
•Hey, stop complaining that you don't have a job after graduation... thats what happens when you don't apply to any...
•The food options on this campus are some of the most unhealthy and boring choices I have faced in many years. In an atmosphere of diversity I am discouraged with the efforts to bring real ethnic and diverse cuisine to this campus. How about forgetting the idea about the space in the tunnel and working on a way to provide some space for the great Food Trucks of DC. Check out Food Fiesta.
•@Let's have a day where everyone reveals their true feelings to everyone:  A demon made that happen once in Buffy.
Half of the town ended up on fire.
•Women in Prison films should be required viewing for all students.
•I love the sight of a woman in an orange prison jumpsuit with shackles.

•can people stop complaining about the lack of attractive men here? maybe the guys here are just my type, but i see a lot of guys that are ""real"" cute and more than just ""AU"" cute
•Rants have really gone downhill since they stopped going in the Eagle
•Okay, so I've definitely seen more mice than ever in the last few weeks, so that claim by 2-Fix is bogus.
•Spider Pig! Spider Pig! Does whatever a spider pig does. Can he swing from a web? No he can't, he's a pig. Lookouttt! Here comes the spider pig!
•Oh my god Becky, look at that dumb biddie!
•I'm feeling very sick, but I can't help think about this girl I just started hanging out with. This one goes to you I.R
•Dear Mr. Kerwin, I don't get email often, but when I do I put yours straight to the SPAM folder.
•@ ""Girl who loves being an attractive, feminine girl no one would really pin as bisexual.""
I'm a bi-species hamster and I don't mind hooking up with a human.
P.S. I wrote this with a banana on my head so don't judge me.
•@""Psychics are not real.""
I knew you'd say that!
•@I hope I don't annoy you, it's just that I think you're a really cool dude and I'd like to get to know you. (:... that's a good one. It's just sad that in today's world we still have to qualify that type of statement. Just because I'm into you doesn't make me a crazy stalker.

2012-05-03,AU,study,"•@""Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist."" Just because people here are accepting (which generally, yes they are), doesn't mean they're what a person is looking for in a friend. Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.



•Girl, I love you, but I have to confess that I rub my chest hairs for two hours in the morning to get the blood flowing.
•@ ""Sneak into TDR"" or ""Make out with an AU student who later comes out"" or ""Go to an 8:55 class drunk"" or ""Post an EagleRant"" ""
already did all those, haha.....
•You have the longest, flattest butt I have ever seen.
•To Do List:
1. Do stuff
•But I don't wanna go to another one of these group project meetings! #finalsweekproblems
•Type your rant here!
^ Haha!
•I just kissed my best friend I'm in love with. He's leaving in 2 days. Better late than never I suppose.
•China.  That is all.
•""Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist.""
So you're saying that if this person doesn't have any friends at AU, it must be because he/she is so obnoxious that even the most accepting students in the world won't put up with him or her. What a nice person you are- I'm sure you're very accepting.
•Ok, May 2nd rants sucked. 4 more days of daily rants you guys. MAKE THEM GOOD!
•@”If you've had something of yours stolen on campus, please join the Victims of Theft Facebook group (filed within American University). Together, we victims can stand up for ourselves and for justice!” That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
But sorry for the ranter with the lost phone? Did you have the “find my iphone” function turned on so you can GPS track it?
•Did anyone else read the New York Times ""Room for Debate"" section yesterday on the feminism versus motherhood debate? It was very fascinating. But the first columnist talking about attachment parenting and then randomly veering off into being anti-birth control talk was a disgrace. She does not represent attachment parenting. Attachment parenting is driven by science, and the science is in on birth control preventing cancer.
•What's the real difference between Salon and Slate in terms of news coverage?
•Editor, a few days ago you referred to watching summer shows this summer as a god alternative to daily eagle rants. Do you have any to recommend? Because once Desperate Housewives is over in 2 weeks, I am scared life as I know it will cease to exist.
[Editor's note: ""So You Think You Can Dance"" is my personal favorite.]
•""Wednesday May 3rd?"" I'm just going to assume you mean today (Wednesday, May 2nd). Here goes nothing.
•So after the NESAC (the little ivies), the Patriot League (which AU is part of) is listed on college confidential multiple times under rich kid schools.  I always thought of AU as extremely economically diverse with lots of rich kids but also lots of upper middle class kids, middle class kids, and lower middle class kids who are the first in their family to go to college. I thought of Vanderbilt, Duke, Emory, Wake Forest, Richmond, and mainly southern schools as the more “rich kid” schools full of snobbery and an old money plantation type feel.  Am I wrong here?
•You're so cute and wonderful. Suddenly, everything looks and feels differently in the world and I think this may be right. I'm going to miss you so much this summer.
•Does this bagel have tarragon? Oh la la
•@""I want to respect women but I know if I do, it'll lower my value as a man in the social hierarchy of life...""
You're not looking at it correctly. Girls aren't attracted to nice guys, that's correct, but it's not because the guys are nice- it's because ""nice"" translates to ""obsequious."" Doormats aren't entertaining. On the flipside, girls really aren't attracted to straight up assholes- there's a big difference between lighthearted teasing and genuine assholery. Teasing is fun, it's the name of the game, not being a dick
•@""•Whenever I work the desk and the rowing team comes in, I get excited. I think their coxswain is a cutie.""
props for knowing how to spell it!
•We know you don't want to be doing this group project with us. We don't want to be doing it either. But if you would please drop the attitude and stop simultaneously insisting that you need to do all of the work for us, it would make this experience a lot less painful.
•You want to talk about being a Jake and Amir fan?  I followed their personal Vimeo accounts before either one started making videos for CollegeHumor.  Originally they were both normal people, but in one early video Amir claimed to have drunk sixty beers in one night, and Jake realized that he had never been drunk at all.  They rolled with it, and Amir got crazier in every episode.
•Sometimes I wish I had regular finals... what I would give to just sit down with a book a study. But no, I'm staying up all night working on projects and trying to perfect even the tiniest of details.
•I just now used the ""Chat with a Librarian"" tool on the Library website-- coolest thing ever :) It's nice to get answers to question without having to go to the library. ^.^
•This has been such a great year. Expelled some biddies from my life, met some great people and better friends, partied hard, finished last semester with a 3.5 and still doing well!
•@ Chick who tried to give me an HJ.
Don't try to perfect what I already have. You'll just embarrass yourself.
•Thanks AU...for one more year of horribly overpriced food and limited dining options.
•We should put a kosher/halal place where McDonalds was...tired of eating the kosher meals at box lunch, aren't we supposed to be a ""diverse"" school
•does the language department hate students? why else would they put finals on a Saturday?
•""Let's be real here.
I'm not even a COMM major and I know that SOC has some of the coolest/greatest professors on campus"" THANK YOU!! But really, it's true.
••""I am 23 years old, have never had a girlfriend, and I am a misanthrope. Yes, I am a proud product of AU."" you sound sexy, let's go out.
•To the bro who doesn't like the who
Dafuq is wrong with you?
•@Is it just me, or do floorcest couples never ever break up? There are two on my floor...: HAHAHA. If only.
•I think I'm in love with the former SG president.
•EDITOR: Gracias mi amor por publicar mis rants, ¡te extrañaré durante el verano! VIVA ECUADOR!!!
Y Viva AU :)

•Dear Editor, Dorm ? Res. Hall
•@""Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. "" Actually, the person harassing me started harassing my friends as well so I stepped back to protect them, and now because of this person and their friends I'm afraid to go out on campus except for class. But thanks for being the complete opposite of supportive.
•Sarah McBride is cool.
But I feel like that handwashing article in the Eagle next to Sarah's letter was a joke? It was so extreme that it made me question whether Sarah's letter was a joke, too.
[Editor's note: No joke. And the hand washing column was written by a former Eagle columnist known for his sarcasm.]
•Mother wonking finals can wonk themselves.
•I wonder how many rants were submitted that didn't get published about people who don't support Sarah McBride.. I would venture to guess there were quite a few despite AU being so ""accepting""
[Editor's note: Yes, there were a few.]
•@I'm crushing so hard on you! Describe the girl!!!
•Allison DuBois: It's easy to profile someone you don't know and make vague guesses that could be interpreted a number of ways. There have been numerous cases and tests where she's been completely wrong. Even the Texas Rangers who she claims to have helped deny working with her. And its very convenient that she can't do it on command isn't it? I swear people just want to believe its real so much that they just don't care about the evidence against it. You desperately want your belief in the supernatural to be affirmed.
•Can we revoke the campus plan?
•you have a flat butt and never had anything more than that so stop complaining. also you got fat while abroad and now look like an awkward jellybean with toothpick legs. you make me angry.
•got tickets to dispatch and good old war! ay ay ay ay ayy
•@""How do you know we aren’t reincarnated into other people or life forms?"": How do you know that we are? I have no problem with the idea of reincarnation, but I'm not going to spend my entire life thinking its actually going to happen. Everyone is so fixated on what happens after to you die that you just forget to live. Yea death is a scary thing but its a part of life. Without life there would be no death.
•i have a midterm at 8.55 tomorrow and played the ukulele all day. noo regrets at all.
•“I would love to believe that when I die I will live again... But much as I want to believe that, …I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.” – Carl Sagan
•""If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?....For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."" -Carl Sagan
•""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" -Carl Sagan
•You're leaving on Friday and for some strange reason I want to see you before you're off. I can't ask you... But I'm holding out hope that you'll ask me. I'd say yes!
•Dear, Its nice to miss you, but its also nice to kiss you. Can't wait to be reunited :)
•@""Otters?""
Yes.
•Every time you see me I am buying sleeping pills, candy, and Red Bull. Dear Cute Boy, please don't think I have a drug problem, especially since I did not explain CLEG right.
•To the XO freshman biddie staring at me at the gym for a full 30 minutes. Yes I am bigger than you and yes I am working harder than you. It's people like you that make people afraid of the gym.

I am so happy we can end on a good, friendly, happy note. Although I'm half way done, and you're off to the next chapter in your life, I hope we can still continue our friendship. I have learned and experienced a lot from everything with you. I don't regret anything I did, or say. It was all worth it because of how much it gave me. Thanks. Good luck with everything. You know where to find me.

Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




•@""Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist."" Just because people here are accepting (which generally, yes they are), doesn't mean they're what a person is looking for in a friend. Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.
•Girl, I love you, but I have to confess that I rub my chest hairs for two hours in the morning to get the blood flowing.
•@ ""Sneak into TDR"" or ""Make out with an AU student who later comes out"" or ""Go to an 8:55 class drunk"" or ""Post an EagleRant"" ""
already did all those, haha.....
•You have the longest, flattest butt I have ever seen.
•To Do List:
1. Do stuff
•But I don't wanna go to another one of these group project meetings! #finalsweekproblems
•Type your rant here!
^ Haha!
•I just kissed my best friend I'm in love with. He's leaving in 2 days. Better late than never I suppose.
•China.  That is all.
•""Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist.""
So you're saying that if this person doesn't have any friends at AU, it must be because he/she is so obnoxious that even the most accepting students in the world won't put up with him or her. What a nice person you are- I'm sure you're very accepting.
•Ok, May 2nd rants sucked. 4 more days of daily rants you guys. MAKE THEM GOOD!
•@”If you've had something of yours stolen on campus, please join the Victims of Theft Facebook group (filed within American University). Together, we victims can stand up for ourselves and for justice!” That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
But sorry for the ranter with the lost phone? Did you have the “find my iphone” function turned on so you can GPS track it?
•Did anyone else read the New York Times ""Room for Debate"" section yesterday on the feminism versus motherhood debate? It was very fascinating. But the first columnist talking about attachment parenting and then randomly veering off into being anti-birth control talk was a disgrace. She does not represent attachment parenting. Attachment parenting is driven by science, and the science is in on birth control preventing cancer.
•What's the real difference between Salon and Slate in terms of news coverage?
•Editor, a few days ago you referred to watching summer shows this summer as a god alternative to daily eagle rants. Do you have any to recommend? Because once Desperate Housewives is over in 2 weeks, I am scared life as I know it will cease to exist.
[Editor's note: ""So You Think You Can Dance"" is my personal favorite.]
•""Wednesday May 3rd?"" I'm just going to assume you mean today (Wednesday, May 2nd). Here goes nothing.
•So after the NESAC (the little ivies), the Patriot League (which AU is part of) is listed on college confidential multiple times under rich kid schools.  I always thought of AU as extremely economically diverse with lots of rich kids but also lots of upper middle class kids, middle class kids, and lower middle class kids who are the first in their family to go to college. I thought of Vanderbilt, Duke, Emory, Wake Forest, Richmond, and mainly southern schools as the more “rich kid” schools full of snobbery and an old money plantation type feel.  Am I wrong here?
•You're so cute and wonderful. Suddenly, everything looks and feels differently in the world and I think this may be right. I'm going to miss you so much this summer.
•Does this bagel have tarragon? Oh la la
•@""I want to respect women but I know if I do, it'll lower my value as a man in the social hierarchy of life...""
You're not looking at it correctly. Girls aren't attracted to nice guys, that's correct, but it's not because the guys are nice- it's because ""nice"" translates to ""obsequious."" Doormats aren't entertaining. On the flipside, girls really aren't attracted to straight up assholes- there's a big difference between lighthearted teasing and genuine assholery. Teasing is fun, it's the name of the game, not being a dick
•@""•Whenever I work the desk and the rowing team comes in, I get excited. I think their coxswain is a cutie.""
props for knowing how to spell it!
•We know you don't want to be doing this group project with us. We don't want to be doing it either. But if you would please drop the attitude and stop simultaneously insisting that you need to do all of the work for us, it would make this experience a lot less painful.
•You want to talk about being a Jake and Amir fan?  I followed their personal Vimeo accounts before either one started making videos for CollegeHumor.  Originally they were both normal people, but in one early video Amir claimed to have drunk sixty beers in one night, and Jake realized that he had never been drunk at all.  They rolled with it, and Amir got crazier in every episode.
•Sometimes I wish I had regular finals... what I would give to just sit down with a book a study. But no, I'm staying up all night working on projects and trying to perfect even the tiniest of details.
•I just now used the ""Chat with a Librarian"" tool on the Library website-- coolest thing ever :) It's nice to get answers to question without having to go to the library. ^.^
•This has been such a great year. Expelled some biddies from my life, met some great people and better friends, partied hard, finished last semester with a 3.5 and still doing well!
•@ Chick who tried to give me an HJ.
Don't try to perfect what I already have. You'll just embarrass yourself.
•Thanks AU...for one more year of horribly overpriced food and limited dining options.
•We should put a kosher/halal place where McDonalds was...tired of eating the kosher meals at box lunch, aren't we supposed to be a ""diverse"" school
•does the language department hate students? why else would they put finals on a Saturday?
•""Let's be real here.
I'm not even a COMM major and I know that SOC has some of the coolest/greatest professors on campus"" THANK YOU!! But really, it's true.
••""I am 23 years old, have never had a girlfriend, and I am a misanthrope. Yes, I am a proud product of AU."" you sound sexy, let's go out.
•To the bro who doesn't like the who
Dafuq is wrong with you?
•@Is it just me, or do floorcest couples never ever break up? There are two on my floor...: HAHAHA. If only.
•I think I'm in love with the former SG president.
•EDITOR: Gracias mi amor por publicar mis rants, ¡te extrañaré durante el verano! VIVA ECUADOR!!!
Y Viva AU :)
[Editor's note: : )  ]
•Dear Editor, Dorm ? Res. Hall
•@""Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. "" Actually, the person harassing me started harassing my friends as well so I stepped back to protect them, and now because of this person and their friends I'm afraid to go out on campus except for class. But thanks for being the complete opposite of supportive.
•Sarah McBride is cool.
But I feel like that handwashing article in the Eagle next to Sarah's letter was a joke? It was so extreme that it made me question whether Sarah's letter was a joke, too.
[Editor's note: No joke. And the hand washing column was written by a former Eagle columnist known for his sarcasm.]
•Mother wonking finals can wonk themselves.
•I wonder how many rants were submitted that didn't get published about people who don't support Sarah McBride.. I would venture to guess there were quite a few despite AU being so ""accepting""
[Editor's note: Yes, there were a few.]
•@I'm crushing so hard on you! Describe the girl!!!
•Allison DuBois: It's easy to profile someone you don't know and make vague guesses that could be interpreted a number of ways. There have been numerous cases and tests where she's been completely wrong. Even the Texas Rangers who she claims to have helped deny working with her. And its very convenient that she can't do it on command isn't it? I swear people just want to believe its real so much that they just don't care about the evidence against it. You desperately want your belief in the supernatural to be affirmed.
•Can we revoke the campus plan?
•you have a flat butt and never had anything more than that so stop complaining. also you got fat while abroad and now look like an awkward jellybean with toothpick legs. you make me angry.
•got tickets to dispatch and good old war! ay ay ay ay ayy
•@""How do you know we aren’t reincarnated into other people or life forms?"": How do you know that we are? I have no problem with the idea of reincarnation, but I'm not going to spend my entire life thinking its actually going to happen. Everyone is so fixated on what happens after to you die that you just forget to live. Yea death is a scary thing but its a part of life. Without life there would be no death.
•i have a midterm at 8.55 tomorrow and played the ukulele all day. noo regrets at all.
•“I would love to believe that when I die I will live again... But much as I want to believe that, …I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.” – Carl Sagan
•""If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?....For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."" -Carl Sagan
•""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" -Carl Sagan
•You're leaving on Friday and for some strange reason I want to see you before you're off. I can't ask you... But I'm holding out hope that you'll ask me. I'd say yes!
•Dear, Its nice to miss you, but its also nice to kiss you. Can't wait to be reunited :)
•@""Otters?""
Yes.
•Every time you see me I am buying sleeping pills, candy, and Red Bull. Dear Cute Boy, please don't think I have a drug problem, especially since I did not explain CLEG right.
•To the XO freshman biddie staring at me at the gym for a full 30 minutes. Yes I am bigger than you and yes I am working harder than you. It's people like you that make people afraid of the gym.

•RAWRRR. I planned Thursday to be silent and roommate-free so I can finish my huge paper. Except it sounds like my neighbor's shower tiles are being replaced one by one and there's SO MUCH BANGING AND LOUD NOISES.
•""These didn't used to be so low"" -Carl Saggin'
•@""Why is the final schedule so cruel?"" Because if every class started its final on-time, then 4:00pm class finals would go until 6:30pm, thus messing up 5:30 classes for everyone. Hey wait, that's not such a bad idea...
•I don't give a fuchsia about you!
•Huzzah for those Carl Sagan rants!
•Update: the deafening construction on my neighbor's bathtub stopped almost immediately after I sent in that rant. Eagle Rants, you have magical magical powers.
•Ugh, I'm already antsy to get my grades posted already.
•My neighbor is loud, annoying, and rude at all hours of the day. I hope he moves or drops out. I would add ""graduates"" to that list but since he apparently never does any homework, I don't think that's a possibility.
•Wish I could just have a hook up for finals week, I need some way to get rid of all this stress
•Editor- I don't understand why you can't get the message to STOP CENSORING rants. If people have comments about Sarah McBride, and they're not obscene, by your own rules, you have to publish them. She's a public figure and like it or not, people have a right to express their opinions. If she didn't want the criticism, she shouldn't have published in the Eagle. You guys published it, you have to allow ALL sides of commentary.
[Editor's note: Hateful Rants will not be published. See Rants rules.]
•@fruit sharer: you made my day
•NANTS INGONYAMA BAGITHI BABA!
•@”Even the Texas Rangers who she claims to have helped deny working with her.” Are you seriously using this as your evidence? NO ONE she works with is allowed to confirm that she worked with them. Evidence discovered through a psychic is not admissible in court because we don’t yet understand the science behind it, so the police have to say that they found the evidence on a hunch via good police work. Are you really that clueless?
•@”And its very convenient that she can't do it on command isn't it?” Ya, it’s convenient that you can’t dream on command either. You must be lying whenever you talk about your dreams. Just because you don’t understand the neuroscience behind what she does doesn’t mean that she is faking it. People said the same thing about the first scientist who said that washing hands before delving babies would prevent more babies dying from infections. Why is it impossible to think there could be mind germ or mind DNA that we haven’t yet discovered?
•Can we vote to change the once a week summer rants? Is there any way the new editor will change his/her mind and decide to do daily rants? I can't take the weekly suspense! And it hasn't even started!
•@”Actually, the person harassing me started harassing my friends as well so I stepped back to protect them, and now because of this person and their friends I'm afraid to go out on campus except for class.” Why can’t you just ignore this person? I doubt AU has bullies who would follow you around harassing you. But if there is one, have you told your RA or campus security? PS Sorry for your situation.
•I can't wait to see my LDR bf either. That sense of peace knowing you will see him is wonderful. But I have to wait 6 more weeks. :(
•@”It's people like you that make people afraid of the gym.” People WHO, not people THAT.
•@”Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.” Assuming the rant was not jointly written by two friendless people, the plural pronoun “they’ve” does not go with the singular noun “OP”.  You’re welcome.
•I don't wanna leave AU next week!
•@”@ Chick who tried to give me an HJ. Don't try to perfect what I already have. You'll just embarrass yourself.” Curious, how does one perfect a penis with a HJ?  Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough? jw…
•@obsequious guys rant: Personally I like having an obsequious guy who wants to be my slave. ;)
•@ “Thanks AU...for one more year of horribly overpriced food and limited dining options.” You do realize AU was voted best vegetarian and vegan food for any college in the country right? AU food is great. Stop being a snob. Sorry you don’t have a personal chef following you around.

•It is me, the AU Vigilante. I am here to give my only warning to those who seek to take advantage of the drunk and vulnerable. Starting this summer and next semester I will be doing safe walk backs, quad patrols and other activities to ensure people are safe on this campus and the surrounding area 24/7. I will also create a system in which anyone can reach me if they ever feel unsafe. You may not see me, but you will feel my presence fighting evil on this campus. Vigilante Out

•I wish I hadn't wasted so much time in the beginning of the semester trying to be friends with one group of people.  I feel like I missed out on making other friends who I would have clicked with better.  I feel like it'll be harder to start up friendships as a sophomore than it was at the beginning of freshman year.
•I really don't want to have a big wedding with lots of people. Large crows for extended periods of time really stress me out. I'd rather just elope. But I know my brother and sister want a big wedding party. Is it selfish or emo to elope? Btw, my bf also prefers a very low key elopement.
•I love you so much. I wish I could give you your love language, but in this situation I cannot.
•Atlantic > Slate + Salon
•I wish eagle would allow anonymous commenting on the articles again like they used to a few years ago. It really sucks how now the articles don't have any comments. But I guess I'll just have to suffice with commenting on articles via eagle rants.

You were lucky. Most of us have not. My experience has made me a lot less naive and willing to trust random AU kids to look out for my best interest. Someday you may lose your iPhone and it simply won't come back. Then you'll get the point.

•Im sorry but the DG salute looks absolutely stupid in all of your facebook pictures
•We can debate whether or not gym class heros was good all day long, but as long as AU continues to neglect the need for a big, campus wide outdoor music festival with a name like ""spring fling"" or whatever we're never going to have any campus-wide musical unity. Its sad that the best concert Ive been to this year was at GW.

•I started waking up early so I can read the rants when they first come out each day. I wake up early today and NO RANTS yet!!! AHHHHHH!
[Editor's note: Sorry! This editor is posting Rants from downtown at D.C. Superior Court in between covering murder cases.]
•Look, I just got accepted to AU a couple weeks ago. I’m just an average guy. I like sports and DVDs, but I’m worried the AU community won’t accept me because I’m “different.” You see, I was born with Werewolf Syndrome. My whole family’s got it for crying out loud! Before I enroll, I wanna hear what the AU community has to say about this.
•People here are so shallow Here!!  I have a micro pene. Ok there, I said it! Why can’t someone just give me a shot.
•The Incubator has just died.
•Why are there so many people hanging out and talking in the library during finals week? What the hell happened to courtesy?
•If you want your eagle rants questions answered the day after you ask them, tomorrow is the last day to do that before next fall. Ask away!
Rant here!

Eagle Rants: July/August 2013





Eagle Rants: June 24, 2013





Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




•@ ""Dafuq is wrong with you?""
As an American, I'd like to invade Dafuq tomorrow. They stole our Cheese Nips.
•RAWRRR. I planned Thursday to be silent and roommate-free so I can finish my huge paper. Except it sounds like my neighbor's shower tiles are being replaced one by one and there's SO MUCH BANGING AND LOUD NOISES.
•""These didn't used to be so low"" -Carl Saggin'
•@""Why is the final schedule so cruel?"" Because if every class started its final on-time, then 4:00pm class finals would go until 6:30pm, thus messing up 5:30 classes for everyone. Hey wait, that's not such a bad idea...
•I don't give a fuchsia about you!
•Huzzah for those Carl Sagan rants!
•Update: the deafening construction on my neighbor's bathtub stopped almost immediately after I sent in that rant. Eagle Rants, you have magical magical powers.
•Ugh, I'm already antsy to get my grades posted already.
•My neighbor is loud, annoying, and rude at all hours of the day. I hope he moves or drops out. I would add ""graduates"" to that list but since he apparently never does any homework, I don't think that's a possibility.
•Wish I could just have a hook up for finals week, I need some way to get rid of all this stress
•Editor- I don't understand why you can't get the message to STOP CENSORING rants. If people have comments about Sarah McBride, and they're not obscene, by your own rules, you have to publish them. She's a public figure and like it or not, people have a right to express their opinions. If she didn't want the criticism, she shouldn't have published in the Eagle. You guys published it, you have to allow ALL sides of commentary.
[Editor's note: Hateful Rants will not be published. See Rants rules.]
•@fruit sharer: you made my day
•NANTS INGONYAMA BAGITHI BABA!
•@”Even the Texas Rangers who she claims to have helped deny working with her.” Are you seriously using this as your evidence? NO ONE she works with is allowed to confirm that she worked with them. Evidence discovered through a psychic is not admissible in court because we don’t yet understand the science behind it, so the police have to say that they found the evidence on a hunch via good police work. Are you really that clueless?
•@”And its very convenient that she can't do it on command isn't it?” Ya, it’s convenient that you can’t dream on command either. You must be lying whenever you talk about your dreams. Just because you don’t understand the neuroscience behind what she does doesn’t mean that she is faking it. People said the same thing about the first scientist who said that washing hands before delving babies would prevent more babies dying from infections. Why is it impossible to think there could be mind germ or mind DNA that we haven’t yet discovered?
•Can we vote to change the once a week summer rants? Is there any way the new editor will change his/her mind and decide to do daily rants? I can't take the weekly suspense! And it hasn't even started!
•@”Actually, the person harassing me started harassing my friends as well so I stepped back to protect them, and now because of this person and their friends I'm afraid to go out on campus except for class.” Why can’t you just ignore this person? I doubt AU has bullies who would follow you around harassing you. But if there is one, have you told your RA or campus security? PS Sorry for your situation.
•I can't wait to see my LDR bf either. That sense of peace knowing you will see him is wonderful. But I have to wait 6 more weeks. :(
•@”It's people like you that make people afraid of the gym.” People WHO, not people THAT.
•@”Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.” Assuming the rant was not jointly written by two friendless people, the plural pronoun “they’ve” does not go with the singular noun “OP”.  You’re welcome.
•I don't wanna leave AU next week!
•@”@ Chick who tried to give me an HJ. Don't try to perfect what I already have. You'll just embarrass yourself.” Curious, how does one perfect a penis with a HJ?  Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough? jw…
•@obsequious guys rant: Personally I like having an obsequious guy who wants to be my slave. ;)
•@ “Thanks AU...for one more year of horribly overpriced food and limited dining options.” You do realize AU was voted best vegetarian and vegan food for any college in the country right? AU food is great. Stop being a snob. Sorry you don’t have a personal chef following you around.
•@""Can we revoke the campus plan?""
-DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!
-Your license has just been revoked.
•ONE INCH. ONE FREAKING INCH. What kind of sick human being forces a sleep-deprived, hopeless college student to remount a project because the illustration board is ONE INCH too short.
•Dear Editor, Dorm ? Res. Hall
•I respond well to jerks
•It is me, the AU Vigilante. I am here to give my only warning to those who seek to take advantage of the drunk and vulnerable. Starting this summer and next semester I will be doing safe walk backs, quad patrols and other activities to ensure people are safe on this campus and the surrounding area 24/7. I will also create a system in which anyone can reach me if they ever feel unsafe. You may not see me, but you will feel my presence fighting evil on this campus. Vigilante Out
•Hope is not lost. Faith is not broken. The Vigilante lives
•can we make war against all the biddies?
•I do like you, I really do, but some things about you I really dont like.
•IF YOU SAY GDI AGAIN IMMA PUNCH YOU IN DA FACE <3
•Why do I bother playing support if my carry is just going to end up rushing a black cleaver and a warmogs.  LoL fans will know what I mean.  So many bad AD carries.
•I wish I hadn't wasted so much time in the beginning of the semester trying to be friends with one group of people.  I feel like I missed out on making other friends who I would have clicked with better.  I feel like it'll be harder to start up friendships as a sophomore than it was at the beginning of freshman year.
•I really don't want to have a big wedding with lots of people. Large crows for extended periods of time really stress me out. I'd rather just elope. But I know my brother and sister want a big wedding party. Is it selfish or emo to elope? Btw, my bf also prefers a very low key elopement.
•I love you so much. I wish I could give you your love language, but in this situation I cannot.
•Atlantic > Slate + Salon
•I wish eagle would allow anonymous commenting on the articles again like they used to a few years ago. It really sucks how now the articles don't have any comments. But I guess I'll just have to suffice with commenting on articles via eagle rants.
[Editor's note: Our comment system changed, making comments no longer anonymous. You can always make up a username.]
•Taking a shot of whiskey right before my exam today = best finals choice I've made yet.
•The only reason I really want to know your sexual preference is because I think you're dating potential. I know it's technically not my business and that you have every right not to make it public, but I really am curious. Unfortunately, it would be extremely odd to ask, so I'm left trying to figure it out with very little clues.
•@That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
You were lucky. Most of us have not. My experience has made me a lot less naive and willing to trust random AU kids to look out for my best interest. Someday you may lose your iPhone and it simply won't come back. Then you'll get the point.
•@""Hahaha, here that nice guy? One girl says sure you can be sloppy seconds after she has stopped whoring herself out, and the other ""I like nice guys"" but am a complete ditz. Screw em' acquire capital.""
^this guy is a moron and a douchebag. Don't listen to him.  I mean, come on- he used the wrong type of ""hear"". That's failing at basic middle school grammar.
•@ ""I don't care that girls think the straight men at AU are ugly and nerdy. I've always had good luck."" Amen, sister!
•@ ""I am 23 years old, have never had a girlfriend, and I am a misanthrope. Yes, I am a proud product of AU."" Are you from NJ and smoke a lot of weed? If so, I think I know you...
•I know. And if I seem like a b***h sometimes, it's because I don't want to give you the wrong impression.
•""Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known"" -Carl Sagan
•I want Finals week to be renamed ""Student Deathmatch Super Fun Time Week.""
•I know it's messed up but a part of me hopes you fail your ivy league finals and drop out so that we can be near each other again. I'm dying of loneliness.
#sorrynotsorry
•I love AU. I have had the best years of my life here and am glad that I won't have a single regret when I leave. #sucked the juice out of college and had the most enriching years of my life
•Let's play a game called ""If I didn't go to AU, I would be at x college."" I'll go first. If I didn't go to AU, I would be at University of Florida. So glad I came to AU.
•Im sorry but the DG salute looks absolutely stupid in all of your facebook pictures
•We can debate whether or not gym class heros was good all day long, but as long as AU continues to neglect the need for a big, campus wide outdoor music festival with a name like ""spring fling"" or whatever we're never going to have any campus-wide musical unity. Its sad that the best concert Ive been to this year was at GW.
•The reason I'm failing all my finals: Tetris Battle on facebook. Ack!
•Being unavailable is temporary until she's wearing a ring.  Do you seen one on me? Don't count me out yet.
•Here's how I rate The Eagle! F!!!!! Stop trying to be sensationalist and maybe you won't be sued
•CAUS and CASJ...shut up! No one cares what you have to say! If you don't like it here go to another school!
•President McBride wasn't present at enough events? Are you serious Eagle? You ""reporters"" need to come out of your cubby hole because McBride was everywhere.
•Hey Eagle reporters....get over yourself! You're not The New York Times or The Washington Post...Thanks!
•Hey Eagle...SG Senate got Gender Neutral Housing on campus #giveussomefreakingcredit
•SO MUCH SEX! YAY
•SG does not have a problem with inclusion! Stop making us seem like we are the Antichrist
•I didn't see The Eagle at the SG Senate Townn Hall. It's amazing how the one time we can look good the Eagle is not there. Coincidence...I think not?
[Editor's note: Eagle staffers have been at every SG Senate meeting.]
•Finals...Must Study...OOH cats online!
•REVEAL YOURSELF QUEEN OF THE QUAD!
•Thanks Heather for your fair report of SG Senate! It is good to know that there is someone who takes there job seriously in The Eagle
[Editor's note: Go Heather!]
•What does YOLO mean?
•Alright, Sarah McBride and those who obsess over her, I am very supportive of her but her attention is getting really annoying. We get it, you've been picked up by Gaga and HRC. I hope she remembers where she comes from. Also, her op ed was not necessary. Again, totally supportive, but her need for attention makes me gag.
•The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?
•I just overheard a girl ask who Tim McBride was... really, a whole year at AU and you don't know who he is?
•Eastbound and Down, baby.
•Peace to the homeboy Yangmo Ku. Keep ya head up, dawg.
•It won't be worth it without you.
•I never want to come back from Russia.
•the only time I go to breakfast at TDR is when I pull all nighters in the library- another punishment for staying up all night. am I the only one who thinks TDR breakfast sucks?
•To the girl constantly posting about how much she hates her roommate and how she is in love with her best friend who already transferred, hi. This is your roommate. Want to have an adult discussion? I'm not going to get upset; I've heard it all before. Might as well clear the air because we are only living together for four more days.
•No puedo hablar español, pero quería apoyar a la nueva sección bilingüe diatriba. Gracias Google Translate!
[Editor's note: Jajaja.]
•@ China. That is all.
Man you know what's up. ?????
•Editor, I love you.
[Editor's note: Aww thank you. This editor loves you too.]
•I started waking up early so I can read the rants when they first come out each day. I wake up early today and NO RANTS yet!!! AHHHHHH!
