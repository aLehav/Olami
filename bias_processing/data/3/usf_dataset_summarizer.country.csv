2009-01-04,USF,China,"As coach Jim Leavitt stood on the pier in St. Petersburg he was all smiles. He was shaking hands, talking to people and getting ready to coach his fourth bowl game in as many years. There was something different about him.


This wasn’t the same guy who ran up and down the sidelines screaming at anybody within earshot during football games. Nor was it the guy who admitted to being the worst interviewee in the Big East Conference earlier this season.


After a season of trying to dodge the media with one-word responses and podium-slapping endings to post-game press conferences, Leavitt looked happy.


In fact, as a St. Petersburg native, Leavitt was happy.


“I don’t want to sound biased, but I really like this situation,” he said.


Why wouldn’t he? His team was about to play what was realistically a home game against a 6-6 Memphis team from a weaker conference (Conference USA).


And, as fate would have it, the Bulls ran away with the St. Petersburg Bowl trophy, finishing the season 8-5 — one game worse than the 9-4 they finished in the previous two seasons.


Leavitt said he liked the St. Petersburg Bowl because everybody wants to play in Florida, and it helps with recruiting.


Well, if Leavitt wants USF to be mentioned in the same breath as Florida, Florida State and Miami — all schools that have won National Championships in the past 10 years — then the Bulls’ first trip to the St. Petersburg Bowl needs to be their last.


The game itself was a snoozer, with USF jumping out to an early lead, then trying to score enough points to make everybody forget that it allowed a Sun Bowl-record 56 points to Oregon last year.


The Bulls — victims of another midseason collapse — had every chance to play in the Orange Bowl. However, they lost three of five conference games by a total of 62 points, including a 33-point loss at home to Rutgers.


Other than the Rutgers game, and a 24-10 loss to Cincinnati on Oct. 30, the Bulls had legitimate opportunities to win three more games. That would not only have given USF its first 10-win season, it would have given the team the opportunity to play in a storied bowl game — not a scrimmage against a weak team 20 minutes from campus.


Leavitt was excited after the game, playfully boasting about USF winning “the inaugural game of two different bowls.”


That’s great, coach, but even though the Bulls won a bowl, nobody seems impressed by a team that finished with a 2-5 record in what was perceived to be a weak conference by “experts” on ESPN before the season started.


Restoring interest in the team and ensuring that the Bulls steer clear of another postseason performance at Tropicana Field starts with recruiting.


Leavitt should be awfully busy this year replacing the talent he will lose. USF is losing two starting linebackers, three safeties, a cornerback and a defensive end — not to mention the potential departure of two-time All-American defensive lineman George Selvie to the NFL draft.


On offense, the Bulls will lose nearly as much. USF was a team built to win now, but it didn’t get the job done. As players got injured throughout the season, it became obvious that depth was a real problem and contributed to the team losing five of its last seven games.


Getting talented players — a lot of talented players — to fill the roster is a must for the Bulls. If Leavitt can’t acquire more than a few talented starters next year, USF will be lucky to make the St. Petersburg Bowl.


With all the new faces, he needs to preach discipline to a program that sorely needs it. The Bulls have finished in the bottom 10 out of 119 teams in Division I football in penalties every year since joining in 1999.


The Bulls also sat three starters — junior corner Jerome Murphy, and seniors Cedric Hill (tight end) and Carlton Williams (safety) for violating team rules before the St. Petersburg Bowl.


If Leavitt’s players aren’t under control on and off the field, it will be hard to keep the Bulls competitive in the Big East.


It could also mean a return to the Rays’ home stadium.

2009-01-05,USF,China,"YouTube is no longer just for water-skiing squirrels and pre-teen girls facing off about which of the three Jonas Brothers is the hottest. In light of record-low unemployment rates, the user-created video Web site is putting Americans back to work — in front of their webcams.


In October of 2006, youtube.com, then in only its second year, was bought by search engine giant Google for  $1.65 million. Before the buy, Google Video was YouTube’s biggest competition, allowing all its users to upload lengthy videos, whereas on YouTube uploads were limited to a length of 10 minutes unless granted a director account. This brought advertisers and viewers looking for full-length pictures like the conspiracy theory film phenomenon Zeitgeist: The Movie over to Google’s side of the fence.


Google Video used its fan base and advertising power to create an Internet super-hub for self-expression via YouTube. In early 2008, to promote this self-expression — and, of course, to generate revenue — Google created the YouTube Partner Program, a sector of Google Ads used to pay YouTube stars for their work.


According to the partnership’s homepage, “YouTube partners are independent video creators and media companies who are looking for online distribution and who meet (the partnership’s) qualifications. Becoming a partner gives you the ability to share in ad revenue from your YouTube videos.”


This may come as music to the ears of relentless vloggers and undeclared college students searching for their lot in life, but becoming a YouTube partner isn’t as simple as becoming a partner at your local food co-op. To become a partner, users must meet three qualifications: They must create original  videos suitable for representation by YouTube, own the copyrights for all video and audio used and upload videos regularly that are viewed by thousands of YouTube users.


Such exclusivity is unusual for Google Ads, as on blogspot.com anyone who wishes to add the application can. This is because Google Ads on BlogSpot are all from Google’s small business AdSense program, which doesn’t bring in nearly as much money per advertiser as YouTube, according to an AdSense support representative. Support of Google Ads on blogs typically brings in 3 to 5 cents per hit for bloggers.


The YouTube Partner Program, on the other hand, deals with the big corporate bucks. Sponsors include the likes of Sony, Verizon, LG, CBS and McDonald’s, to name a few, and their advertising dollars will be spent only in a medium in which they can reach hundreds of thousands of people. Michael Buckley of buckhollywood.com was one of the first handful of video creators to make it as a YouTube partner. His online show What the Buck?, a commentary on all things celebrity, comes out three times a week and averages more than 200,000 views an episode. Buckley told the New York Times that his show earned him over $100,000 in 2008,  the year in which his videos were most viewed.


Buckley may be a case of one-in-a-million YouTube stardom, but one doesn’t have to be a household name to gain sponsorship. Newer YouTube channels with only a few videos at 25,000 views a piece have gained sponsorship, and YouTube moderators help give potential partners a jump start by featuring some of their favorite videos of the day on the homepage.


Heather Jayne, a senior majoring in social work, is grateful for the partnership program because even if not everyone can make it big on YouTube, everyone can benefit from it.


“Everything is online now, so everyone gains from this. The people who make the videos make money, the people who make the ads make money and the people watching these videos get free entertainment,” she said.


Commenting on the press coverage of the YouTube Partner Program on his live BlogTV webcast last month, Buckley shared this sentiment with his viewers and all of YouTube:
“It’s nice to see people off of YouTube getting successful and creating positive press attention. It’s (no longer) like a viral and freakish ‘Oh! Do you believe these kids did that on YouTube!’ kind of thing anymore. It really is a great day for YouTube.”

2009-01-06,USF,China,"America has been a great nation since its start and it developed relatively quickly. Other nations have been around for centuries yet had little influence on globalization and the world, leading one to ask how America achieved its success. The answer to that question is America became a world leader so rapidly because of the moral fabric it was based upon.


America was built with the middle class as its backbone. As a society, citizens have worked together toward insurmountable-seeming achievements. They have done so through respect, doing what is right and working for the greater good.


Many other countries have not achieved what America has because they have too much classism and greed. When the majority of society is working efficiently and cooperatively, the greatest results are seen. This can be seen in cultures such as that of ancient Rome.


America’s moral fabric could also be said to be the foundation of the country because it was the shared morality of its founders that inspired them to declare independence.


It seems, however, that this moral foundation has been crumbling over the past few decades. The respect that was once given is not there anymore. Many people feel they must get respect to give respect, but this thought is, essentially, the basis of the problem and needs to be changed.


In this time of economic crises it seems particularly important to reiterate that respect must be given before it is expected in return. This is a time unlike any most have seen before. This generation can’t relate to the Great Depression or World Wars and doesn’t seem to understand what hard times really are.


Society overcame those crises because people banded together and helped each other. The standards of decency were higher because of a stronger sense of ethical responsibility.


As a society, people have forgotten what the true source of our problems is. It is easy to look at individual situations and feel helpless, but we are only truly helpless if we give up.


Members of the younger generation don’t give their elders the respect they deserve. They neglect to remember that they owe many of the opportunities they have today to the efforts of their parents, grandparents and ancestors before them.


These days, everyone is feeling the recession and lack of health care and other public services — and it shows. People are upset about the situations they are in and take it out on everyone else. One person disrespects another, who shows dissatisfaction by disrespecting others in a vicious cycle.


People live in a “take what you feel you deserve” world instead of an “ask and receive” one. People need to remember that much of the country is struggling under the same pressures.


The irony is, when people feel wronged and deal with it as they have been doing, the injustice expands because the source has not been identified or corrected. If people are more supportive of each other and deal with problems as a group, they accomplish much more.


It is unfortunate that America’s moral fabric is deteriorating, but that situation can be reversed in an ethically sound way. It is pertinent that this country strengthen the foundations upon which it was founded. That is the only way we will overcome the current economic struggle and persevere as a nation. Let’s bring America back into the great ranks that it once held and can hold again.

2009-01-07,USF,China,"Later this month, students will be able to pay for their laundry on campus using USF Bull Bucks ― but it will come at a price.


Washer and dryer use has increased in price to $1 each, up from 75 cents.  Upon returning this semester, students were unaware of the price increase.


“Economic times over the past several years made it necessary to increase laundry prices,” said Kelly Best, associate director of Facilities and Maintenance for Housing.


The difference will help offset University costs, as well as help pay for a program that will allow students to swipe their ID cards and use Bull Bucks to pay for their laundry.


Bull Bucks are part of a program set up in May that allows students to spend electronic money on campus at places such as the dining facilities, the bookstore, the pharmacy, and on printing and copying at the Library and computer lab, said Chris Akin, associate director of Information Technology (IT).


“Students, faculty and staff can deposit funds into an electronic account for use on campus,” Akin said. “It’s kind of like a gift card.”


Before May, students could pay for laundry with a “vend stripe” on their card, Akin said.  When USF initiated the Bull Bucks program, the electronics needed to allow students to use Bull Bucks were not available. Until the equipment is up and running, coins must be used to operate the machines.


At the start of this semester, students found a sign in the laundry rooms that reads: “All machines are coin-only until further notice. Card reader scheduled to come online mid-January.”


Best said that hardware and wiring is already in place, and that the machines will be installed and programmed this semester to work with the IT department.


Money generated from laundry facilities is used to fund resident programs such as events, meetings and alcohol awareness, said Lucy Willis, associate director of business for Housing.


“One hundred percent of those costs are from laundry commissions,” she said.


One advantage of using Bull Bucks is that students will not have to worry about finding quarters to use in the machines, said Samantha McLean, a fine arts major.


“(The system) is more convenient,” said biology major Tatiana White, “because people will not have to find change.”


Students have differing views about the increased price, though.


Though McLean said she thinks people can afford the price increase, she added that the previous price of 75 cents was still too much to pay for laundry.


Chris Jenkins, a music major, said that even though people have the money for it, “people will always complain.”

2009-01-08,USF,China,"Attacks have been waged on single mothers. The weapons of choice: Implements of destruction in the form of vacuous diatribes from self-righteous and unsympathetic pundits and politicians:


Ann Coulter wrote in her book Guilty : Liberal ‘Victims’ and Their Assault on America, “Look at almost any societal problem, and you’ll find it is really a problem of single mothers.”


Emily Yoffe of Slate magazine called out-of-wedlock births a “national catastrophe.”


Colorado State Rep. Larry Liston said during a GOP caucus lunch that covered issues regarding teen pregnancy: “In my parents’ day and age, (single mothers) were sent away, they were shunned, they were called what they are. There was at least a sense of shame. There’s no sense of shame today. Society condones it … I think it’s wrong.They’re sluts.”


While some statistics show higher crime rates among children raised by single mothers, one must not confuse correlation with causation. An innumerable amount of factors contribute to the environment in which a child is raised.


It is intuitive that more good would come from efforts put forth to mentor children, rather than attacking their mothers’ circumstances.


Single mothers are not bad parents merely by being unwed. It is unreasonable to determine a person’s value and character based on marital status — but these false characterizations and speculations are foundational to the argument that single mothers are ruining America.


Emphasizing the nuclear family’s additional parental support is one thing — admonishing single mothers is quite another.


If those so adamantly slandering single mothers put as much effort into trying to reform social welfare and education programs, perhaps our “national catastrophes” could be remedied, at least in part.
Unfortunately, all they seem to contribute is empty criticism and finger-pointing.


It serves no sustainable good to look down on mothers without husbands. Shaming those in fatherless families solves nothing. People so concerned for children’s welfare should consider supporting rather than shunning them.


Venomous words serve no purpose other than alienating and disparaging a group based on false generalizations.


A positive — and perhaps more valid generalization — would be that many single mothers want only the best for their children.

2009-01-12,USF,China,"Since my childhood — when Nintendo 64 and Zelda were king — I’ve been working to defy the stereotype that there are no girl gamers. I love the worlds the gaming industry has been creating through the years: They have always been a welcome getaway from my own boring life. After a successful 2008 gaming year, my hopes are high for 2009. Here are my top picks for games to play this spring.


F.E.A.R. 2 (1)
I spent most of the first award-winning F.E.A.R. game screaming like a little girl, and I have high hopes for its sequel. F.E.A.R. 2 still has excessively bloody moments, frightening creatures and that dead psychic girl who makes missions both difficult and terrifying.


The story has changed and the graphics are slightly better, but overall it’s looking like more of the same from F.E.A.R. I’m not complaining — why fix something that’s working just fine anyway?

Street Fighter IV (2)
Capcom is boldly rehashing its 1990s fighter with an artistic twist in the long-anticipated Street Fighter IV — and it works. I haven’t gotten my hands on a preview copy, but screen captures have sold me already.


The game promises the return of beloved characters like Ryu, M. Bison and Chun-Li, but also adds some new faces. With both new and old moves — complemented by breathtaking backdrops — Street Fighter IV is guaranteed to please old fans and attract new ones.


Release: Feb 17


Consoles: PS3, Xbox 360


Sims 3 (3)
No game has me more excited for the new year than Sims 3. As a die-hard Sims fan, I’ve been pleased with each new installment in the series — and the newest version looks flawless.


The levels of customization border on the infinite, allowing each Sim to be completely unique with options ranging from a Sim’s body weight level to the paint job on his or
her car.


Neighborhoods are no longer limited and the open world of Sims 3 lets characters move freely from lot to lot, leaving more opportunities for chance encounters and events.


Sims 3 is all about unending possibilities, which is what gamers have been clambering for from the series since its birth.

Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop (4)
Dead Rising was released for the Xbox in 2006, but in 2008 someone at Capcom read my mind and thought that bashing zombies with a Wii remote would be the best direction for the series.


Unfortunately, sacrifices will be made in graphics, and picture-taking is no longer a part of the game thanks to the new first-person camera, but these losses are made up for with adjustable difficulty and multiple save slots.


Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop isn’t innovative or new — it’s just fun. My recommendation: Find a park bench, fashion it as a weapon and go crazy on the undead.


Release: Feb 27


Consoles: Wii


Killzone 2 (5)
Released just in time for those finishing up the batch of 2008 first-person shooters, Killzone 2 continues the popular trend of sci-fi war games.


Players with a small budget or an Xbox will be out of luck with this PlayStation 3 exclusive. The graphics and gameplay are stunning, featuring an interactive environment complete with climate and all the conditions expected from a war-tattered planet.


Another great addition is the online multiplayer, in which up to 32 players can face off against one another. But don’t expect to splatter online friends on the front of a vehicle or defeat the story co-op right away — these features won’t be available until they distribute a patch sometime after the game’s release.

MadWorld (6)
Tuck the kids in early before playing MadWorld — it is not your average Wii game. MadWorld takes place in a city quarantined after a deadly virus that forces citizens to fight for their right to live.


What’s really unique about this game, though, is its art style. The cartoonish graphics are reminiscent of Sin City and are strictly black and white — except for the blood. No More Heroes needs to get its act together in its sequel or MadWorld will take its place as the most graphic, disturbing game on Wii.


Release: March 10


Consoles: Wii


Resident Evil 5 (7)
RE5 takes what was great about Resident Evil 4 — like the style and the battle system — and adds to it. Though some gamers were disappointed by the game’s Japan-only demo released last December, I feel they set their sights too high.


RE5 has enough changes to keep you interested, and the story line is phenomenal. This new installment also has a co-op mode — with main characters Chris and Sheva — where players can shotgun their way through story mode with a friend.


For fans of Resident Evil 4, this game only looks better. And gamer gals like me can look forward to the ladies of RE5 kicking some major butt.

Batman: Arkham Asylum (8)
A trailer hasn’t gotten me this excited for a video game since Kingdom Hearts. It’s dark, it’s creepy and it’s Batman.


I’m not a fan of superhero games — usually because they seem poorly made and have no point — but this game looks too good to pass up. From what I’ve seen so far, the game has moved away from standard comic-book game stereotypes and is leaning more toward the feel of the Silent Hill series.


Though not much has been released on this game, there are rumors of a free-roam Gotham City, and some classic characters are expected, like the Riddler, the Joker, the Penguin and Killer Croc. For more information and rumors, check out the Eidos forums at batmanarkhamasylum.com.

2009-01-13,USF,China,"South Florida senior guard Shantia Grace finally understands how challenging the Big East conference is.


“Everybody should know how hard we have to play to win in the Big East,” Grace said after Saturday’s 81-71 overtime victory over St. John’s.


The Bulls will play one of their toughest opponents of the season when they host No. 7 Louisville tonight at 7 at the Sun Dome.


Coming off the win, Grace said she is confident in USF’s ability to win two straight in Big East play, despite losing the first two conference games to Marquette and No. 1 Connecticut.


“Louisville is another top 25 team,” she said. “It will be another hard, grinding game, but we should be able to come out with a win.”


Hard, grinding games are staples in the Big East.


Including tonight’s opponent, the only team without a winning record on USF’s remaining schedule is Providence (7-9), who the Bulls play Jan. 20.


Coming off a 64-59 victory over Rutgers on Sunday, the Cardinals (16-1, 3-0) have won 11 straight games, 10 of which have been at home.


All-American senior Angel McCoughtry leads Louisville in scoring and rebounding, with
21.2 points per game and 8.7 rebounds. With her help, the team ranks in the nation’s top 30 in scoring offense.


The Bulls (14-3, 1-2) are led by Grace’s 15.9 points per game. South Florida has the third-best scoring offense in the country.


Coach Jose Fernandez said he’s hoping for USF’s offense — and a home crowd — to fuel his team to an upset.


“It’s just another (Big East team) we have to play,” he said. “We have them at home. You play better at home because that’s where you practice every day.”


South Florida guard Janae Stokes said even in light of Louisville’s success, the Bulls will not approach the Cardinals differently than any other opponent.


“We just have to stay together, play as a team and keep our heads up,” she said. “We have to keep the mind-set that nothing is going to be easy.”

2009-01-14,USF,China,"It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that, even as they read this article, at least some USF students are text messaging friends, logging on to Blackboard for assignments, listening to music and checking Facebook. All this activity may give off the illusion of hyper-productivity, but studies suggest that the practice known as “multitasking” might be one of the best ways to underperform.


Recent studies by the University of Michigan and UCLA have both concluded that dividing one’s attention among several different things makes the person less efficient in his or her work, and can cause considerable stress.


In November 2008, the University of Connecticut published the study “Distractions, Distractions: “Does Instant Messaging Affect College Students’ Performance on a Concurrent Reading Comprehension Task?” Researchers found that students engaging in a reading comprehension exercise while carrying on an instant message conversation took significantly longer, indicating that “concurrent IM use negatively affects efficiency.”


Researchers also found that the more students said they instant messaged in everyday life, the lower both their test scores and reported GPA were.


These instances of multitasking are counterproductive, but they are certainly not the most dangerous. A study conducted by the RAC Foundation and the Transport Research Laboratory in the U.K. shows that nearly 50 percent of people aged 18-24 text message while driving. The study also determined that texting while driving is more hazardous than being under the influence of alcohol (up to the legal limit) or marijuana.


If cell phones and the Internet are to blame for robbing the attention span of American youth, Apple’s iPhone could be a prime offender. Apple calls it “a revolutionary phone, a widescreen iPod and a breakthrough Internet device” — a description that screams multitask. Such marketing rhetoric embraces the idea that one device must be able to perform a multitude of tasks, and the 10 million iPhones sold in 2008, as reported by macdailynews.com, support the importance society places on the ability to multitask.


And it’s not only students — just ask an adult who tries to hold a phone conversation while typing an e-mail.


USF psychology professor Michael Coovert said any person — child, teen or adult — who tries to do multiple things involving the same brain functions will be hindered.


“The key issue is if the new activity — for example, phone usage — is demanding cognitive or perceptual resources that are already engaged,” he said.


However, Linda Elliott, a research psychologist for the U.S. Army stationed in Fort Benning, Ga, said the product of multitasking depends on the individual.


“Some people can manage their attention processes, process information and perform at higher levels than others,” said Elliot, whose work is concerned with improving soldiers’ multitasking ability.


“If there are several tasks that are related to a single goal — for example, navigating cross-country to a waypoint safely (in enemy territory) — it’s best not to overload a single sensory channel,” she said. “The soldier should not have to be focused on computer screens when he or she needs to be alert to surroundings.”


For this situation, she said a mechanism that vibrates in eight directions could be placed on the soldier’s belt — allowing him or her to navigate hands-free, eyes-free and even, she said, “mind free.”


Research like Elliot’s should help make jobs that require rigorous multitasking easier but doesn’t discredit studies showing multitasking’s negative effects. Whether multitasking is a counterproductive waste of time and efficiency or a useful tool that can be developed, it is something that everyone can expect to increase as technology advances.

2009-01-15,USF,China,"Despite trailing early, No. 7 Louisville beat South Florida 76-60 at the Sun Dome on Wednesday night with the help of a late first-half surge.


“We did a very good job of breaking the press and scoring off of it,” said Louisville coach Jeff Walz. “I thought they stopped pressing us because we scored in transition.”


The Cardinals were able to force 24 turnovers on USF, but despite their success, Walz said his team did a poor job of defending against two USF players.


“Our goal was to try and keep (USF) out of the paint,” he said. “(Forward Jessica) Lawson and (forward Brittany) Denson, they rebound the ball as well as any team in the country. They absolutely owned us in the paint.”


With Lawson’s help, the Bulls cut the Cardinal’s lead to 56-50 with six minutes remaining. However, a 9-2 run allowed Louisville to pull away.


Lawson scored 16 points and grabbed 14 rebounds on her way to her second double-double of the season — and all this after being unable to practice earlier this week because of a knee injury. USF coach Jose Fernandez said he was proud of her effort.


“She didn’t practice the last two days just because she has knee swelling,” he said. “I think she’s really working hard for us down there and finishing around the basket.”


Lawson said USF’s turnovers made a major difference in the game.


“They turned us over and just got us out of our element,” she said. “I think they just scored on most of our turnovers.”


South Florida guard Shantia Grace went 6-of-7 from the free throw line en route to 15 points.


“Every loss we can learn from,” Grace said. “And for us to compete with top 25 teams is a great experience for us. It motivates us to know how good we can play and how well we can play against  top-ranked teams.”

2009-01-16,USF,China,"Actors Danny Glover and Felix Justice inspired an audience Thursday night, through the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and Langston Hughes.


The lecture was more of a performance, as both Justice and Glover fully assumed the personalities of King and Hughes. Glover used his character to connect with the audience personally, while Justice connected through the powerful words of King.


“When Felix Justice and I began this journey of coming to campuses years ago it was with the intent or engaging young men and women in this dialogue,” Glover said.


The audience found the performance engaging as the room filled with silence and awe at the words of two men. Standing ovations and applause were actions repeated throughout the entirety of the event.


Thursday night’s lecture took place in the Sun Dome. About 600 people attended the event, ULS student director Lindsey Grossman said.
“It was fun, although the turnout was not as great as we might have thought,” ULS student director Amy Bortzfield said.


After the lecture, Felix and Justice held a question and answer session. The topics varied from politics to movies, when one middle school student asked Glover what his favorite character to play.


“Overall, it went very well. I really liked the Q&A because you get more candid responses from the speakers,” Grossman said.


The topics covered in the lecture covered the major political events of King’s time period. Glover spoke about the role of young people, asking for change, in the recent presidential election.


“Change is not an event but a process,” Glover said.
Robert Gray, a senior majoring in economics said that while he wished there would have been more time with Danny Glover, he still enjoyed the event.


“They were both really good. I really liked the MLK speech that Felix did. It was neat to hear it on his birthday,” Gray said. “Also to was good to see the little kids get this experience of history that they probably wouldn’t have otherwise.”

2009-01-20,USF,China,"In their eighth studio album, released today, Animal Collective continues a roll of innovative releases that has snowballed into the band’s finest opus.


Merriweather Post Pavilion is the most approachable experimental album of the decade and is the crowning achievement of a band that has so far appealed only to a small niche group. If one thing stands out in this album as the biggest change to Animal Collective, it is the level of professionalism.


The group’s early releases were either poorly produced or poorly thought out, which resulted in immense criticism for their ability as live performers. They relied so heavily on computer-generated music and electronically manipulated vocals that their onstage performance was an absolute disaster.


Bare-bones Animal Collective was essentially just one guy screaming inaudible lyrics and banging on a trash can while a few of his buddies wandered around the stage.


Such harsh criticism is unlikely to continue if the band performs this album as it was recorded. Though Merriweather Post Pavilion is its most electronic album to date, it’s also the most likely to work live for two good reasons: There are no frantic tribal noises and, for the first time since the band’s beginnings, lead singer Panda Bear is actually singing.


His vocals have been good in the past, but up until now they’ve served as just another layer of noise. The vocals on Merriweather Post Pavilion stay within a range below falsetto that sounds more suited to their singer and the words are enunciated clearly — which is essential, as this release is host to the band’s best poetry yet.


Much like Radiohead’s 2008 release, In Rainbows, Merriweather Post Pavilion is an album that celebrates life. Its lyrical focus is broad and accessible, setting the album apart as one of the group’s only releases that could be considered timeless.


But like many great works, appreciation for the album only increases with age.


Merriweather Post Pavillion’s layered sound is impactful and nearly overwhelming to begin with, but deconstructs with a closer listen. The individual pieces of the barrage of sound make themselves clear with each listen — and it’s quite a thing to admire. An immeasurable amount of work must have gone into assembling this album.


It may be wrong to assume an artist could have set out to imitate the style of others, but it’s hard to doubt that Animal Collective is stealing pages from the books of other alternative bands. Luckily, they’ve been reading some pretty great books.


Many of the tracks’ tonal structures feel like Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots-era Flaming Lips, and vocals on deep ambient tracks like “Daily Routine” are reminiscent of Peter Bjorn and John’s debut album.


These big changes, however, don’t make Animal Collective a copycat band. Merriweather Post Pavilion is just an improvement on genuine Animal Collective sound. There are still astonishing moments of simplicity in the album, most notably in “My Girls,” a track that begins slowly and completely changes its key signature and feel with the addition of a single repetitive tambourine hit.


Other tracks like “Summertime Clothes” refine old drumming techniques to fit with the band’s newfound musicality, and sounds fit into the pieces they garnish rather than popping up at random.


Merriweather Post Pavilion is a wonderful labyrinth — with a new surprise around every corner, confusing at times and beautiful throughout. This is the best improvement by a band in years and Animal Collective was pretty decent to begin with. It may be a bit early to call, but don’t be surprised if this ends up as the best album of 2009.

2009-01-21,USF,China,"Tiffany Coakley couldn’t head to the nation’s capital to see Barack Obama take his oath of office.


But that didn’t stop the communications major from being photographed with America’s 44th president Tuesday.


“I may not have been in D.C., but I can say that I took a picture with him and that I witnessed history being made,” she said, referring to the life-size cutout of Obama in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom.


Coakley was one of the estimated 900-plus students, faculty and staff members who filled the room at noon to watch Obama’s inauguration.


Every chair in the ballroom was filled, attendees said, and people lined the walls and craned their necks to see the event on one of the room’s two projector screens. Across the hall, others gathered in the Oval Theater, but the inaugural experience wasn’t confined to the second floor of the center.


Just below these parties, students clotted the walkways to Beef ‘O’ Brady’s and, halfway across campus, they clustered in the lobby of the Communication and Information Science (CIS) Building, as well as the Grace Allen room of the Library.


“It was all over campus — it was what everyone was doing at that certain time,” said English major Sommer Geck.


Provost Ralph Wilcox sent an e-mail Tuesday to faculty members, encouraging them to tune in to the event. Wilcox left it up to instructors’ discretion whether to cancel class for the occasion.


Many students said their afternoon classes were noticeably thinner and some who decided not to skip said resisting the temptation to sneak a glimpse of the inaugural coverage proved difficult.


Environmental science and policy major Kris Caldwell and biomedical science major Sarah Monson said they logged on to cnn.com during their biology class to watch streaming video of Obama and Vice President Joe Biden’s swearing-in ceremony.


Apparently, they weren’t the only ones.


A notice on the CNN Web site stated that users would have to wait since the program couldn’t stream video to all of the people on the site at once. After about 10 minutes waiting for the video to load, Caldwell and Monson decided to pack up their laptop and wait for the end of class.


“We ran from class to the Marshall Center,” Monson said. “We were standing in the middle of Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, just watching. Everybody got very quiet and very focused when Obama gave his speech. It felt very historic.”


Just before Obama delivered his address, CNN reported it had 1.3 million people watching live online, with 21.3 million live video streams worldwide since 6 a.m. That’s more than four times CNN’s total daily streaming record of 5.3 million, set on election day.


CNN also created a special Facebook tool for the event, which received an average of more than 4,000 comments a minute during its peak, the U.K.’s Times Online reported.


During Obama’s 20-minute speech, he addressed America’s need to usher in a new era of responsibility, saying it was the risk-takers and doers of the past who made the nation prosperous. The United States’ capacity for greatness — its ability to invent, care and achieve — hasn’t waned in the time since, he said, underscoring his campaign motto of creating change.


“What I really admired about this speech is that he said he will do these things — that they will happen, not that they might happen,” Geck said, referring to Obama’s pledge to forge friendships in the Middle East, extend a hand to nations in need and defeat terrorism.


Though the crowds in the buildings on campus weren’t nearly as massive as the million or so who gathered on the west front of the Capitol, many said they didn’t mind watching in somewhat cramped quarters.


“It seemed like the kind of event where people would rather experience it shoulder to shoulder, all crowded together, than watching it by yourself,” said Dewey Rundus, associate director of Undergraduate Research.


He watched the inauguration in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom, he said, arriving about two minutes before Obama’s address.


Students clapped and cheered in agreement with portions of the speech, he said.


“Everyone was acting as if they were there,” Croakley said. “We all stood up when we were asked to. It was crazy. I didn’t see it, but I heard some people were tearing up.”


In the CIS building, mass communications major Derek Smart-Gordon said he was headed to a meeting, but when he saw the television broadcasting the inauguration, he stopped.


“I just felt it was important enough to drop everything and watch it,” he said. Smart said he thought about 50 to 70 people were watching, with some leaning over the railings on the second and third floors of the atrium to listen to the event.


Meanwhile, 897 miles north of USF, political science and history double major Christopher Leddy watched the inauguration live in Washington. At first, he said he was disheartened to hear a roar of boos from the audience as former President George W. Bush was formally introduced to the crowd.


“I thought it was kind of disrespectful,” he said. When Obama took the stage, Leddy said the atmosphere completely changed. Leddy said one moment seemed to resonate with the audience during Obama’s address: when he said that 60 years ago, his father wouldn’t have been allowed to dine with a white person in a restaurant — and today, his son could stand before 300 million American citizens to become their commander-in-chief.


“It was electrifying,” Leddy said. “He’s helped restore hope to an older generation and instill it in the younger generation. He’s inspiring.”

2009-01-22,USF,China,"Should USF dip into the millions stored in its rainy day fund to shelter itself from the state’s storm of budget cuts, or tuck its funds away to help weather future downpours?


That’s the quandary Leroy W. Dubeck — a Temple University physics professor and National Association Budget Handbook author — will give  a  presentation about USF’s financial situation today at 2 p.m. at the Marshall Student Center.


Dubeck, who garnered attention for raising awareness of the $240 million USF had left untouched in its unrestricted reserves, will discuss not only whether the University has spent — and saved — its funds in the most prudent manner, but said he plans to explain the budget issue in a greater context by assessing the administration’s fiscal decisions in light of the nation’s worsening economic state.


“The recession hasn’t hurt USF as of June 30, but what happens in the future is a different question,” Dubeck said. “We know what happened in the past, but different people may have different opinions about what might happen in the future, and that factors into what the administration might want to do with the money.”


USF spokesman Michael Hoad said the USF administration is “very afraid” of the upcoming Florida legislative session in March because it could set the stage for further budget cuts in July even greater than last week’s cut of 4 percent.


Hoad said he supports Dubeck’s appearance and hopes it will be helpful to Student Government, the Faculty Senate and the United Faculty of Florida’s USF chapter, but said the deciding factors on how the money will be spent are the Legislature’s budget cuts and the national recession.


“You start to have no flexibility to deal with an additional cut,” he said. “It’s much harder to deal with — you can’t just do a little bit of cutting here and there. If there are more cuts in July, it could become very serious.”


Dubeck also said the recession would be a deciding factor, but thought the House of Representatives’ proposed stimulus package — which would provide $39 billion to public schools and universities to combat cutbacks — would help benefit a university coping with the latest round of budget cuts.


“(President Barack) Obama wants this done quickly. I think he will get most of what he wants, but I can’t guarantee the bill — I’m no Nostradamus,” Dubeck said. “Florida will see $1 or $2 (billion) of those $39 billion, which is no small pocket change, and an increase in Pell Grants for students of $15.6 billion. I think your problems will be solved with that kind of money.”


Dubeck said he’ll address the potential impacts of the stimulus package and Obama’s plans to boost the economy at the presentation.


Ultimately, one of the presentation’s major goals is to inform the public about the University’s budget and spending, said Faculty Senate Vice President Steve Permuth.


“There is a lot of miscommunication (between the Senate and the administration),” he said. “When the issue of the $240 million was raised, there was kind of a silence at first, and what we were trying to say is that the issue was there. (Provost Ralph) Wilcox said that there is a plan for the reserves, but I don’t know how many people have seen it.”


The conference is free and open to the public and will be followed by a panel discussion.

2009-01-25,USF,China,"The Republicans emerged from the 2006 and 2008 elections in dire need of Extreme Makeover: Political Edition. Some prominent Republicans should cross their fingers in the hopes that Ty Pennington and his camera crew will arrive on the steps of the Capitol at any minute.


U.S. Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, a Republican, had it right when he said: “Voters didn’t elect the Democrats in 2006; they unelected us.”


The Grand Old Party, emphasis on the “old,” has sustained its image as the party of America’s grandfathers with its inability to appeal to the younger constituency. Talks of rebranding the party have been circulating for a while now.


California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warned of the dangers of keeping with business-as-usual Republican politics in May.


“The Republican idea is a great idea, but we can’t go and get stuck with just the right wing,” he said in the San Francisco Chronicle.


It has become more apparent than ever that Republicans must restructure or face political extinction. But what exactly led to the recent demise of the Republican Party?


Most obviously, eight years of disapproval for a Republican president. Former President George W. Bush finished off his second term with the lowest approval ratings in history, an embarrassing 22 percent, according to CBS News.


Unfortunately, the American population views many of Bush’s failed policies as bona fide Republican dogma. The role of big government expanded rapidly thanks to the Bush administration’s Patriot Act and social programs such as No Child Left Behind. It would not be farfetched to suggest government spending under Bush was spinning out of control.


This spending was not exactly the fiscal conservatism traditionally associated with Republican politics.


America’s view of Republicans suffered another blow with the recent McCain-Palin campaign. John McCain touted himself as a maverick politician who was a proud, non-traditional Republican. These claims may have been true for McCain before the transformation that occurred once he won his party’s nomination, but he soon resorted to the same tactics that he had spoken against years earlier: political mudslinging, petty pandering and unsound judgment. In an effort to appease the Republican base, McCain picked the infamous Sarah Palin for vice president.


This move was effectively the final nail in the coffin for McCain’s already decrepit campaign. Palin brought nothing to the table except appeal to far-right Republicans, a group that would never have dreamed of voting for Obama anyway.


Independents were scared away by such brash decisions. Unable to pull from the center, McCain lost the election.


Consequently, this has become an important lesson for those attempting to salvage the Republican image. In order to weather the change in political winds, Republicans must learn to appeal to the more Independent center.


Republicans should not ignore the fundamentals of conservatism and finding a platform that falls just right of center fiscal responsibility is key. America has suffered from many years of both Republicans and Democrats ignoring calls for more responsible government spending.


However, certain aspects of traditional Republican ideas have to be refurbished. Hawkish policies from trigger-happy politicians are not a substitute for traditional diplomacy. But don’t label me as a peacenik. When attacked, America is justified in retaliating. In an effort to promote democratic ideals and America’s interests, certain interventionist policies must be adopted. Diplomacy, however, cannot be ignored as an effective tool.


Tax cuts for working Americans, meanwhile, are an important aspect to stimulating the economy, and Republicans must embrace this fact. How can the average American contribute to the retail heartbeat of our consumer society when he or she is being smothered under the weight of heavy taxation? While taxes are a necessary component to a democracy, America cannot afford to let them get out of control.


To see the effectiveness of such strategies, one can examine the victory of President Barack Obama. Tax breaks for “95 percent of working Americans” and eliminating wasteful spending were key tenets of his campaign.


It is my distant hope that Republicans will wise up and follow suit by taking a few pages out of Obama’s book and strive for cross-party integration. Unfortunately, the audacity of such a hope may not be based in reality.

2009-01-26,USF,China,"A little less than $240 million rests in part of the University of South Florida’s coffers — enough so that if every dollar were stacked on top of each other, they would stretch from the floor to the ceiling of the four-story Marshall Student Center roughly 1,401 times.


These funds mark the “unrestricted” portion of the University’s reserves, which the USF administration can use however it legally sees fit, according to its 2007 budget audit. In a time when the University has been struck by budget cuts that have lopped $52 million from its funds over the past two years — with the looming threat of additional cuts this spring — Temple University physics professor Leroy Dubeck visited the Tampa campus Thursday to inform the University community of these untouched funds and other ways the University can combat a shrinking budget.


“These are real dollars,” he said. “The question is, are they going to be used for addressing the budgetary crisis, instead of laying off more people and doing other things that’d be more detrimental to the University?”


Dubeck, who has sat on collegiate budgetary committees and authored books on the subject, compared the use of the unrestricted funds to buying a car. A person could set aside some of his paycheck to replace his old clunker, Dubeck said, but then, if he gets laid off from his job, he may need to spend that money so he doesn’t lose his house. Similarly, while some unrestricted funds are designated by the university’s governing body — the Board of Trustees (BOT) — for certain uses, they can legally be undesignated to address more urgent needs.


No restrictions, only  designations
Re-designating funds isn’t as simple as deciding not to sign the lease on a shiny new car, however. Faculty Senate President Larry Branch said that once a budget has been submitted to the state, any changes — or re-designations of unrestricted funds — must get state approval first.


Florida law also requires the University to keep an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the Educational and General revenue USF receives from the state in a cash reserve in case of an emergency, said USF spokesman Michael Hoad.


Even without those funds, Dubeck said the University would have about $190 million in unrestricted money that it could use to offset budgetary shortfalls. In an e-mail to faculty, USF Provost Ralph Wilcox said that about $53 million of these funds have been allocated to departmental operating expenses, visiting instructors’ and adjuncts’ salaries and support for graduate students, among other costs.


“From the outset, the judicious spending down of these cash reserves has been an important and integral part of our plan to balance the budget,” he wrote.


Since reserve funds are non-recurring, the University cannot depend on having them year after year, so it can’t use them to pay for base salary increases or other annual expenses, Wilcox said. This also presents a challenge when deciding how much of the unrestricted funds to use at once, since it is uncertain when the budget cuts will end.


A stimulating discussion
Dubeck said he estimates that the United States will pull out of its recession within two years, but some analysts suggest it could last up to five. If Dubeck’s estimate is correct, he said that university administrators should look into using a portion of these funds to stave off additional job losses, bloating class sizes and other issues.


Even if it isn’t, Dubeck said USF could look to other sources of funding to help the situation, such as the House’s proposed stimulus package. If approved, the package would provide about $79 billion for state education systems, with about $39 billion going toward local schools and universities.


Based on the state’s population, Florida would likely receive about $1-$2 billion, Dubeck said.


“You know, a billion here, a billion there. It helps,” he said.


This brought Dubeck to his second question of the afternoon, which served as one of the underlying purposes of the presentation: How could the University see a healthy portion of this money?


“From what I’ve been told about Florida’s Legislature — I live in New Jersey and work in Pennsylvania, so people here would know better than I would — it’s going to take mobilization on the part of students, faculty, staff and, ideally, the administration,” Dubeck said. “What we did at a local level today, you’ll later have to do at the state level. It’s old-fashioned political lobbying.”


What’s next: demanding transparency
Dubeck advised the audience — a mix of about 100 students, faculty and staff in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom — to do two things: first, seek a breakdown of how exactly administrators plan on spending the portion of unrestricted reserves they intend to use, and second, take an active role in lobbying for more money.


Faculty Senate Vice President Steve Permuth said he praised Wilcox for listing how the administration intends to use the unrestricted funds, but that the next step is finding out how much is being allocated to each endeavor, and making sure that the funds primarily benefit  students.


Dubeck’s presentation was based on an analysis of USF’s audited budgets from 2003 to 2007, as well as the unaudited budget for the 2007-2008 fiscal year. Once a university completes its budget, it must be sent to the Auditor General for official review by the state.


Though Dubeck concluded that the University was in “excellent financial condition,” he did note two areas of concern.


Dubeck found that the percentage of expenses going toward instruction had steadily decreased from 2003 to 2008, falling from 32.23 percent to 27.96 percent.

The change doesn’t reflect a decline in funding, but a dramatic increase in the amount of money USF has received toward research, said USF spokeswoman Jacqui Cash.


“It’s all a percentage of the whole — when one number goes up, others will shift,” she said, referring to the 4 1/2 percent climb research funding took during the same years. “It can only equal 100 percent at the end of the day.”


Dubeck also noted a “significant deficiency” in the 2007 financial audit. The Auditor General randomly selected about 20-30 grants and contracts from the University’s list of reserves and found that the money listed as owed to USF on six of the awards had been overstated by about $6.7 million. Similarly, USF’s deferred revenue for these awards — money that USF has received for work that hasn’t yet been completed, for instance — was overstated by $7.1 million.


This meant, Dubeck said, that some money hadn’t been collected in a timely fashion or that the amounts had been misreported.


“That was as of June 30, 2007,” he said. “We won’t know until the Auditor General completes last year’s audit if the issue has since been corrected, or if it’s been repeated.”


In an official response to the Auditor General, then-Chief Financial Officer Carl Carlucci said USF had created a special unit within the Contracts and Grants division of the Department of Research Financial Management. According to the statement, the unit will be responsible for accounts receivable collections and award closeout so that the University can keep better tabs on collecting awards before the availability period expires.


Though Dubeck analyzed all four types of University reserve funds — restricted expendable, restricted nonexpendable, net related debt and unrestricted — he focused on unrestricted funds because they are the ones the administration has the most control over. The restricted funds — such as the restricted expendable, which is the University’s endowment — are essentially a pool of gift money, grants and contracts that are legally bound to being spent in a certain way.


After delivering his presentation, Dubeck said the most important aspect to him was seeing the turnout.


“It shows that students care about what’s going on,” he said. “For change to occur, we’ve got to continue these discussions, and students have to get involved.”

2009-01-27,USF,China,"While many businesses struggle during hard economic times, others, such as thrift stores, have experienced increased sales partly because of the nation’s weakening economy.


Many thrift stores around USF reported that their sales have increased within the past year, and students seem to be spending their money at thrift stores rather than more expensive retail stores.


According to the National Association of Resale & Thrift Shops, the industry has experienced a growth in its number of stores — approximately 5 percent per year for the past three years.


Selena McCullugh, store manager of the Tampa Goodwill Superstore, credits the store’s slight increase in sales and larger clientele to the current economic situation.


“A lot of people want the same things but don’t have the money to do so,” she said. “Shopping at our store allows them to get that same quality without the price tag.”


Life’s Treasures Thrift Store also reported higher sales within the past year.


Manager Terry Hudson said the store is seeing new customers on a regular basis, especially those buying clothing and furniture.


“Overall, people are so much more conscious of what they’re spending,” Hudson said.


Chelsea Tieu, a sophomore double majoring in chemistry and history, volunteers at Life’s Treasures. She said customers wait for the store’s sales because, in the end, it comes down to money.


“The first Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the month, we have a 50 percent off sale. We get cleared,” she said. “It’s really crazy on the weekends.”


Not all thrift stores have had the same luck.


Pam McCoy, manager of Second Image Thrift Store, said sales shot up in October but have recently decreased.


“It slowed down around Christmas — most people would like to buy their loved ones a new item,” she said. “Even though we have tons of new things here, it’s kind of a mind thing.”


Many college students frequent the store, McCoy said, but she hasn’t seen a noticeable increase in student clientele. She added that the store should start to pick up again when sales begin.


Another factor to take into account may be the number of donations the store receives.


Major Don Smith, administrator of the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Tampa, said he noticed a moderate decrease in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which he attributes to fewer items being donated to the stores.


“In times of recession, sometimes that level of donations begins to decrease,” he said.


Smith said more people are holding their own yard sales to generate extra money rather than donating their used belongings to the Salvation Army. He said he hopes this trend reverses itself.


Students who frequent thrift stores said they have been more cautious of how they spend their money.


Austin Hutchinson, a senior majoring in English, said he has been more careful with his finances.


“Other things cost more money now, so I use less on clothes,” he said.


Regardless of the economy, Tieu said she has always been cautious with her money.


“When I spend more than I want to, I’m not too happy about it,” she said. “I buy    anything on sale.”


Manuel Penton, a senior majoring in biomedical science, said he likes that he never knows what he will find. Penton, who is in a band, said he found a synthesizer from the 80s while thrift store-shopping with a friend.


“It was great — it was really cool,” he said. “You can’t find that anywhere else besides a thrift store.”


Penton also bought a Banana Republic jacket for $3. New jackets from that brand cost up to $350.


James Leavitt, a senior majoring in elementary education at USF’s  St. Petersburg campus, said he has been shopping at thrift stores since his freshman year. He comes from a large family and grew up wearing hand-me-downs.


Leavitt said that a white suit at a regular retail store may cost $50 or more, but he found one at a thrift store for $6.


“I wore that outfit to a work Christmas party — a formal — and when I worked at a camp for a ’70s day where I looked like John Lennon,” he said. “You can find the coolest things at thrift shops — everything’s cheap.”


Thrift shoppers might even find wedding attire, Leavitt said.


“There’s no way I would do that for my wedding, though,” he said. “I’m not that cheap.”

2009-01-28,USF,China,"Higher unemployment rates have caused many USF students to look beyond the job market and create jobs of their own.


According to the  US  Department of Labor, Tampa’s unemployment rate in November was 7.8 percent, up from 4.5 percent in 2007.


A suffering economy is an important risk to factor into the equation of starting a new business, but the alternative is the risk of unemployment in a bad job market, said Thomas J. Carter, an economics professor at USF St. Petersburg.


“It might be tough to find a good job with a regular company, so starting a business might be more productive for some,” he said.


Business partners and USF alumni Jay Mize and Van Sefair began their entrepreneurial careers in real estate development. Even as the real estate market boomed, Mize said he realized that wouldn’t always be the case, so he and Sefair started the dry cleaning company Drytec Cleaners in November 2006.


“The economy is having an effect on all businesses,” Mize said. “It has forced true entrepreneurs to get creative and think outside the box and it has forced us to out-think the competition.”


Mize, who has a bachelor’s degree in finance, said his time at USF has had a lasting impact on his entrepreneurial career.


“My entire spirit of influence can be traced back to my USF contacts — from my friends to my former football teammates,” he said.


Mize said the weak economy might be a blessing in disguise for those considering starting their own businesses.


“There may not be a lot of capital or funding available, but in every down economy there is a silver lining and better opportunities available. It just takes finding the right niche to make it work,” he said.


Carter said he agreed that opportunities are available for those in the right industry, and funding depends on the product or service.


“There are just certain types of businesses that may improve with bad economic times — like pawn shops or job training services,” he said. “The financial market is making it difficult to get loans right now. It is dependent on what type of business you are starting, since people are cutting back on their spending — especially on luxuries.”


Hard economic times often affect the sale of luxury items and services first, but USF alumnus Andrew Dundas’ company Feed-a-Bull has so far been unaffected by the economy.


Dundas said he started the food delivery service after three  months of unsuccessful job hunting.


“I always figured I would work for a company, but I started (Feed-a-Bull) because there wasn’t enough of a job market,” he said. “Instead of being another employee, I decided I would be an employer.”


After six weeks of planning, Feed-a-Bull was started in September 2007, and now delivers food to customers of more than 20 restaurants in the Tampa area. Dundas, who co-owns the business with fiancé Linda Walter, said he started it from the ground up after conducting research on similar establishments in other areas of the country.


“When the economy suffers, luxuries are usually the first to go, but we fit in with pizza delivery and there will always be a market for our service,” he said.


Mize and Sefair provided a new twist to dry cleaning, which they said they credit for assuring their futures as entrepreneurs. The eco-friendly dry cleaning business has a coffee shop, JavaTinto, conveniently located inside.


Not all luxury-based businesses are having financial trouble.


What started as a joke for USF alumni Eddie Zaragoza and Connie Ramos is now a clothing design and T-shirt screen-printing company. NaimBran Apparel, a fashion design company, and Brisk Prints, a screen-printing company, were started in the fall of 2007 with the sole financial backing of Zaragoza’s credit card.


Zaragoza, who graduated in December with a bachelor’s degree in marketing, said the economy has not affected his business much because of its target market — which includes many groups at USF.


There are many advantages to being your own boss, Zaragoza said: He enjoys the freedom of being able to set his own schedule as well as the opportunity to meet new people. But there are also downfalls to being in charge.


“You have to be self-motivated because it’s all on you and there is no one else to blame,” he said. “It can be easy to get sidetracked.”


Dundas said he warns new business owners that work can consume their lives, but the pride that comes with the accomplishment of a dream makes it worthwhile.


“The reward, if you’re a person that is a hard worker and proud of your accomplishments, is a lasting business. This company will be here for as long as the University is here,” Dundas said of Feed-a-Bull.


Mize said pride is also an important factor for him.


“The gratification and reward of seeing something that was originally a thought written on a napkin (become) a viable business is the best part of owning a business,” he said.


Sometimes an extra push is all that is needed to make a dream a reality, Zaragoza said.


“I think definitely do it, because otherwise you will wonder if you could have done it. There are workshops you can take that will help you on things like taxes — and a lot of it is free, too,” he said.


The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) at the USF Downtown Center offers five to six seminars to the public each week, all focusing on advice for small business owners or those interested in starting a business.


“Some are free, some have a low fee, and they are in a large range of topics — anywhere from accounting and taxes to marketing, advertising and financing,” SBDC Director Eileen Rodriguez said.


The SBDC also offers free one-on-one counseling available to residents and business owners in the 10-county region it serves.


The center has seen many entrepreneurs coming in for help to combat the struggling economy, Rodriguez said.


“A lot of people have been downsized and are finding it hard to find jobs, so they are starting a small business instead,” Rodriguez said. “People who own small businesses currently are also having a hard time finding financing and are seeking advice just to stay afloat.”

Chairman of the Super Bowl Host Committee and former BOT chairman Richard Beard presented the NFL with a proposal in 2005 and said he knew that afternoon that Tampa would host the 2009 Bowl.


To host the Super Bowl, a city must meet certain criteria. The NFL sent the Tampa committee a book outlining what it was looking for in a Super Bowl city, Beard said.


He said the book asked questions such as how many hotels were in the Tampa area and what types of transportation systems would be available.


Committees are formed  several years before the Super Bowl because host cities need a group to make the pitch, USF spokesman Hoad said.


USF will benefit from the Super Bowl when it hosts a breakfast Saturday morning at the Sun Dome.


Hoad said the breakfast is normally hosted at a resort.


“That was a deliberate effort by the people who were involved to involve more students and involve the University as a whole,” Hoad said. “There’s some student organizations (working) as volunteers that work the breakfast at the Sun Dome.”


The NFL and Super Bowl committee often laud the economic benefits of the Super Bowl, but USF will not directly profit from it, Beard said.


“But there is an economic benefit to Tampa,” he said. “USF is a big part of that community.”


Though the NFL reports that cities may make millions of dollars hosting the Super Bowl, economics professor Philip Porter said that was “virtually impossible.”


While the Sun Dome may earn money from the breakfast event, he said, no one has ever been able to prove any definitive economic benefit generated by the Super Bowl.


Researchers look at factors such as income, hotel stays, air travel statistics and sales in the area tow determine the game’s economic boom to cities.


“No one’s ever found any obvious impact that the Super Bowl was (in any city),” he said.


Tampa may or may not benefit financially from the Super Bowl, but the city will profit in terms of national    recognition.


“Hosting a Super Bowl, I think, does give you that sense that you’re enjoying the success of the city,” Hoad said. “Tampa and USF are similar in that they celebrate the success of each other together.”

2009-02-01,USF,China,"Forty-four years from now, comedian Dane Cook will still be talking about you.


Well, maybe not you, exactly, but he said that even when he’s 80 he’ll remember the night thousands of students accepted his invitation to eat at Bennigan’s after his performance at Round-Up, USF’s fall comedy show, back in 2005.


Since then, he has starred in multiple movies, gone on a series of comedy tours and broken Richard Pryor’s stand-up endurance record by performing for more than seven hours straight.


Before Cook returned to Tampa Bay to give a pre-Super Bowl show at the St. Pete Times Forum on Saturday, he got up at 7 a.m. (his time) to talk to the Oracle about the catharsis of comedy, dealing with criticism and what he — albeit jokingly — wants people to remember him for. (Sorry, Cook fans — it has nothing to do with his cashew-launching abilities or his dream of having a talking, fighting monkey as a pet.)


The Oracle: First off, let’s travel back about four years. You stopped by USF for our fall comedy show called Round-Up. At the end of the show, you called up the hostess and asked about making a reservation for 10,000 at Bennigan’s. Did you ever think that so many people would show up?


DC: Yes. I knew that we were setting ourselves up for, eventually, one of the most memorable post-show after-parties. (It was) impromptu. That was — gosh — I have some great pictures from that night, and I remember when we arrived at the parking lot and people started showing up — what you need to realize is that, you know, that was also happening at a time when I was just starting to realize how many people were really kind of die-hard fans and coming out in support.


I’ll be talking about that when I’m 80 years old, looking around that restaurant and that parking lot and seeing the outpouring of people who appreciated what I was doing. It was just unbelievable. It was really wild.


O: Have you made an offer like that before or after?


DC: None like that, no. Before, I’d ask a couple people in the front row of a club to go grab a sandwich after — never 10,000 people to the challenge of, hey, let’s all meet at this local eatery here.


No, nothing like that, and I certainly haven’t done anything like it since because there’s a little bit of fear or trepidation. I wouldn’t want it to turn into something where people would get hurt or anything like that.


It was just one of those last-minute things that was very authentic … I’ll always look upon that as just a real eye-water moment that I shared directly with my fans.


O: How did this Saturday’s show differ from your other shows?


DC: I’ve been working on this brand-new hour, hour and a half of comedy all year. I purposely kind of went back to basics. I didn’t do any films this year because I literally wanted to be in the clubs night after night, and I felt like my fans deserved that (level) of dedication to bring to stand-up comedy. I mean, I continued to put out content over the last couple years, but I really wanted to get the “all new” above my name. It’s also my way of saying thank you to all of my fans for helping me to achieve success.


O: What’s the process like for coming up with new material?


DC: My process this year was digging the truth out of myself. Talking about what it’s like dealing with success. Talking about what it’s like having lost my parents. Talking about this new president. Talking about this new America.


… People came up to me at this show last week and said, “I’ve been watching you for the past 17 or 18 years and I’ve never seen so much vulnerability, but at the same time I’ve never laughed so much at some of these difficult kinds of topics.”


It’s great. You’re laughing and there’s also this great kind of therapeutic relief — that you get to share something tough that you went through and you know that maybe some other people have gone through. And isn’t that what the best comedy should be? Truth mixed with escapism.


O: Speaking of your performances, how did you manage to perform for seven hours at the Laugh Factory?


DC: Stay properly hydrated. I never expected to ever stand up on stage for seven and a half hours. I certainly was not in the mindset of wanting to break any club records. I’m proud to say it was very good — it was very authentic … I think the crowd wanted me to break the record more than I wanted to break the record. It just kind of happened. It wasn’t forced. That seven and a half hours was accompanied by the greatest sleep of my life.


O: How exhausting was it being up there and performing? You’re known for being a pretty physical performer.


DC: The term “pacing yourself” was put into play … it wasn’t hard to downshift and sometimes do stuff that was a little more old-school kind of joke-style, and there’s storytelling style and there’s definitely physicality and some more outrageous behavior. I kind of just made it a potpourri, and when I needed to rest my lower back I would just kind of plant my feet and stand and stretch for a little bit.


I went through the crowd and I talked to every single person in the crowd that night and basically dedicated a chunk of time to their life and tried to find something funny in everybody.


When we finished that show, I took a picture with that entire crowd because we all knew each other. Everybody knew everything that they could, probably, about one another. I have this great group photo of the most personal event, because it really did feel like we did it together.


It was something I would not want to repeat, but it was fun to try.


O: It seems like every time comedians come into the spotlight, critics accuse them of stealing people’s jokes and stuff like that. How do you respond to those kinds of  allegations?


DC: It’s like the crack in the dam, and you put your finger in it, but another crack comes. I actually found that there was a certain period of time when I was trying to respond to everything.


What I realized was, oh, wait a minute, no. People don’t want the truth … what I found was some people aren’t seeking out the true response. Some people are seeking out more mayhem.


I went through the spanking machine — I definitely took my hits.


O: What would you like people who meet you to walk away thinking of you?


DC: I would hope that first they’d say, “Dane Cook has the freshest breath that I’ve ever experienced,” because fresh breath is certainly an important thing to me. (laughs) I don’t know. I guess I don’t — I’m starting to sound like a grizzled old veteran here, but I don’t really think about what people take away from meeting me. That stuff was stuff I used to care about when I was younger — what people think of me.


… If I may be so candid, you can’t f*** with the truth. That’s what a good friend once said to me.


When he said that, it was like a punch to the face. It was so important for me to hear that. I said, “You know what? I’m just going to live in the truth and put my honesty forward and when I leave the room, I’m not going to wonder how people accepted what I am and what I left in there.”


O: Ending this on a light note, do you have any pre-show rituals or trailer demands — like no brown M&Ms?


DC: No. I just always have to get potassium. I have to eat a banana, and that’s about it.


No superstitions, no strange little meditations or throwing up in buckets. It’s really — I live for the show. I live for the show. God, I sound incredibly corny and cliché, but I’ll stand by it. I live for these moments — these caliber shows — this kind of sharing. This is the good stuff in life.


As long as people sit, want to come out and take time out of their lives, and go out of their wallet and throw a few bucks down and laugh, then damn it, that’s where I want to be. I want to be front and center and making people laugh their a**es off.


No pre-show rituals. Just a little potassium, and let’s do this — where’s the mike?

2009-02-02,USF,China,"Last month, University Police (UP) Chief Tom Longo became the first UP chief to be elected president of the Tampa Bay Area Chiefs of Police Association.


One of the largest Chiefs of Police Associations in the country, the association comprises most of the law enforcement heads in the Tampa area.


“Our goals are to promote the profession, hold training seminars and also have a scholarship program that we are in the process of reinvigorating now,” Longo said.


Captain Bob Staehle, UP operations commander, said Longo interacts with people in all levels of UP and relates to other agencies at director and chief levels.


“It speaks volumes both for Chief Longo and USF to say that he was the first UP chief to be named president of this association,” he said. “It is putting USF in the spotlight in an arena that would not normally have occurred had it not been for Chief Longo.”


Longo has been working in law enforcement for more than 30 years, a career he began in the military as a sergeant in the Marine Corps Reserve before he went to college. While in school he transferred to the Army as an intelligence officer, and upon retiring he joined the civilian police force.


Longo has worked with university police departments for 10 years. He began at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and served as assistant police chief at Florida State University before becoming police chief at USF in May 2006.


“(Being a police officer) was a dream I had since I was a kid,” Longo said. “A lot of kids grow up with a dream of becoming a cop or a firefighter, but it stuck with me.”


Longo said he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who had been a police officer in the military.


“He had a health problem that kept him from realizing his full potential,” he said. “It was a natural thing for me to go into it, and I’ve been with it ever since.”


As police chief, Longo oversees the police department, including the 911 center. He also orchestrates all the patrol cars and uniformed officers on campus, including traffic enforcement and DUI checkpoints.


After receiving his bachelor’s in political science from Eckerd College, getting a certificate in criminal justice education and earning a master’s in public policy from Regent University in Virginia Beach, Longo still dedicated to learning.


While serving as police chief, he is also writing his doctoral dissertation for law, which he hopes one day to use to begin a post-retirement career in   teaching law.


At the conclusion of Longo’s one-year term as president, he will remain on the association’s Board of Directors.


“I’m honored to be elected to this position of trust in the Tampa Bay area,” he said. “I think this demonstrates the high regard our law enforcement peers have for the USF Police Department, and the importance of the University in our community.”

2009-02-03,USF,China,"Jessica Lawson is the Oracle’s athlete of the month after an impressive performance in January for the South Florida women’s basketball team.


The 6-foot-3 senior center averaged 10.8 points and 7.1 rebounds per game for the Bulls in January.


And she did it battling lingering injuries in both knees.


Coach Jose Fernandez said Lawson will not practice for the remainder of the season, but she continues to play in games for USF.


With Lawson’s help, South Florida pulled off one of the best wins this season Sunday when the Bulls defeated Rutgers 59-56 on the road.


The Edgewood native, who transferred to USF from California in 2006, had eight points and six rebounds.


Lawson’s injuries began in the 2005-2006 season, when she tore her anterior cruciate ligament and fractured her left kneecap.


Lawson is second on the team in blocks with 21 this season. She will play through injury again tonight against Marquette.

2009-02-04,USF,China,"South Florida failed to capitalize on its momentum from Saturday’s upset victory over Rutgers.


The Bulls came out sluggish and fell 71-56 to Marquette on Tuesday night at the Sun Dome.


It’s second time the Bulls have lost to Marquette this season.


Coach Fernandez attributed the loss to his team’s effort on the floor. The Bulls turned the ball over 20 times.


“When you have to coach effort, that’s a huge problem,” he said.


The Bulls played tight with the Golden Eagles in the first half, but fell victim to a 12-5 Marquette run and trailed 33-26 at halftime.


“Overall, the word I can use for this game is effort,” said USF junior guard Janae Stokes. “They had more than we did. They didn’t do anything offensively or defensively that we couldn’t match. All the loose balls, all extra hustle plays, they won.”


Stokes went 3-for-10 from the field and scored nine points. She said the loss to Marquette has had a major effect on her emotions.


“It’s just frustrating,” she said. “We win a big game on the road, then come home and lose worse than (we) did when (we) played them at their place.”


USF lost 68-60 to Marquette in their Big East opener Jan. 3.


Shantia Grace led USF with 13 points.


“Before the game, we had no energy,” Grace said. “We just weren’t together coming into the game, and it carried over into the game.”


The Golden Eagles shot 37 percent from the field.


Fernandez said he won’t blame anyone in particular for the loss.


“It falls on all of us,” he said. “It falls on our players, it falls on our staff and it falls on me.”

2009-02-05,USF,China,"The Bulls landed what may be their biggest recruit in program history when Armwood High School defensive end Ryne Giddins signed his letter of intent on Signing Day, Wednesday.


Giddins is ranked No. 4 in the country and No. 1 Florida by
rivals.com
.


With help from George Selvie and Craig Marshall, Giddins will lead what could be the strongest part of the Bulls’ defense.


“We’ve got one of the top defensive lines in the country,” Giddins said. “It all comes with Selvie staying here. I am very proud of him making the decision to stay here and helping me work as a team. We can work together and make something happen at USF.”


The No. 10 best Florida prospect said he hopes to learn a few things from his predecessor.


“Technique and how nasty the game is down there at the line of scrimmage, because it all starts right there,” Giddins said. “What to do, what not to do and how to hold my composure.”


As a high school junior, Giddins broke the school’s season record of 18 sacks with 21. He made 98 tackles the same year.


Armwood coach Sean Callahan said Giddins is a team player.


“He’s done a very good job for us,” he said. “He represents us well and understands what the word ‘team’ means.”


Coach Jim Leavitt received more defensive end signings than any other position in this year’s class.


“I’ll just say bam!” Leavitt said. “And Ryne will know exactly what I’m talking about … I love him. He’s the best.”


Boca Ciega High School’s Julius Forte will join Giddins and four other incoming defensive ends.


“There’s a lot of competition, because Giddins has committed and Selvie is still there,” Forte said. “(Competition) always brings out the best in me. I’m looking forward to it.”


Giddins, the No. 2 ranked pass rusher in the state, has been looking forward to playing college football.


“When I was a freshman, I saw (Dougie Thompson and Donald Rivers) signing and I was like, ‘Man I want to be in their shoes,'” Giddins said. “I pressed forward and worked out with my defensive line coach every day after school.”


Giddins said he chose USF over Florida after his campus visit.  He also turned down offers from Tennessee, Auburn, Clemson, Florida State, Miami and North Carolina.


“At Florida, I felt not at peace there, like I always have to impress somebody,” he said. “At USF, I can be myself and impress everybody.”


The incoming freshman said the relationship with the coaches helped his decision, too.


“(Leavitt) is a great coach — a wild coach,” he said. “He fits my personality. I love that. He’s just as good as any other coach.”


Giddins’ mother is happy he is staying close to home.


“I’ve seen Ryne grow,” she said. “He’s matured very much into a man. I was hoping he would choose (USF), because in my heart I feel that’s where God wants him to be. I think he’s going to make a difference at USF. He is going to be a big impact.”


Giddins joins 28 other incoming and finalizes what could be the best USF class in school history.


“I am ready for the competition,” Giddins said. “I’m getting ready right now — my legs, my arms, my chest. I’m getting ready mentally. I’m ready for that pressure and the ball to come to me so I can snatch it and run.”

2009-02-09,USF,China,"South Florida men’s tennis coach Don Barr said he’s certain the only way his team will get better is by playing strong competitors.


This season, the Bulls are getting plenty of opportunities to do just that.


USF went up against individuals and teams ranked in the top 50 this weekend in Arizona and finished with a 1-1 record.


“It’s definitely what we need to do to get our program established as a top tennis school in the country,” Barr said. “The only way we’re going to be able to do that is to compete and beat the players that are consistently at the top.”


Though No. 45 Arizona upset No. 34 USF 5-2 on Friday, Barr said he hopes going up against tough teams will attract more players to the program.


“Not only is our team getting stronger, but recruits will be looking at our schedule and see that we play one of the toughest in the country,” he said.


Barr said the most disappointing part of the loss was the close doubles competition. No. 18 duo Lucas Jovita and Thomas Estrada fell 9-8 and 7-3. Meanwhile, Romain Deridder and Wael Kilani lost 8-4 as Arizona won the doubles point.


“When we lose that doubles point against top teams, it’s very difficult to win matches,” Barr said. “We have to stress more on winning that doubles point. It’s a crucial part.”


The Bulls defeated No. 55 St. Mary’s 6-1 on Saturday, sweeping the Gaels in doubles and winning five of six singles.


“I thought our excellent showing was in Kilani,” Barr said. “He looked so strong.”


After the freshman defeated Arizona’s Andres Carrasco 6-2 and 6-0 in the No. 4 position, Barr moved Kilani to No. 2 where he beat St. Mary’s Maxime Olivan 6-4 and 6-2.


“I was in good shape and playing so well,” Kilani said. “I am comfortable and feel good in that role. I think I can play second position every weekend.”


This is the second weekend in a row the Bulls have bounced back from defeat to win the next day. USF lost to TCU on Jan. 31 and then defeated UC-Santa Barbara the next day. Barr said that’s because of the team’s effort.


“It’s about us fighting for every play,” he said. “We’ve learned to do as well as you can and not worry about wins and losses. It’s important to see how you’re competing and focus on the level that we’re playing.”

2009-02-10,USF,China,"The University keeps finding ways to put itself on the map — and this time it’s reaching across the Pacific. USF’s Department of International Affairs and the College of Business are the first American hosts to photo panels of Japan’s World Heritage sites.


Thirty-one of the 61 panels were transported from the Japan Foundation of New York. The purchased photography collection, titled World Heritage Sites in Japan, had already been promoted in Asia and Europe.


“It’s an honor to be able to host the panels for the first time in the United States,” said Amanda Gilmer, communication and marketing officer of International Affairs. “I know that there is a long list of people after us who have been wanting the panels, so we’re really excited.”


The idea to present the international exhibit at the University came from Mitsuo Ogishima, coordinator of USF’s Japan Outreach Initiative. His aim is to promote the understanding of Japanese culture and language in the USF community.


“It took about half a year to hold this exhibit after finding the sponsor,” Ogishima said (translated from Japanese). “I repeatedly made a request to the Japan Foundation that I wanted to show the beautiful photos in Tampa, where they have relatively much less opportunity to communicate with Japanese culture compared to other cities.”


He said the exhibit’s purpose is not just to showcase the wondrous beauty of Japan’s nature and cultural heritage sites, but to remind people how important it is to preserve such legacies for future generations.


“We in Japan have 14 World Heritage sites and are proud of all of our unique culture and national treasures, but especially these treasures which we share with the entire world,” Ogishima said.


The World Heritage Convention was adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1972. It helps to preserve 878 properties of “outstanding universal value” in 145 nations, according to its Web site, whc.unesco.org. America has 20 World Heritage sites —  including Florida’s Everglades National Park.


“Some of the World Heritage sites are in critical condition,” Ogishima said. “We have a responsibility to protect them because our ancestors kept conserving them over generations.”


The World Heritage photo exhibit includes works by Kazuyoshi Miyoshi, a world-famous Japanese photographer.


“Anywhere you look in Japan, one can see that it has a lot of beautiful places — such as the mosses growing in the deepest parts of the Yakushima Island, the forest speared by the shining light and the silhouette of the temple in front of the sunset,” Miyoshi said (translated from Japanese).


At 27, Miyoshi is the youngest recipient of the Kimura Ihei Award, a Japanese award that recognizes the achievements of new photographers. He said his passion for capturing images of paradise began on a trip to Okinawa when he was 13 years old.


Since then, he has done work in Tahiti, the Maldives, the Sahara, the Himalayas and Antarctica. Some of his photographs are in the permanent collection of the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography & Film in New York.


“If you want to see (Miyoshi’s) works in different places, you have to pay about $10 — but you don’t have to pay here,” Ogishima said.


Approximately 120 people attended the opening ceremony Feb. 6 at the College of Business Atrium.


“This is a very good event and it was a nice to see the Japanese community at Tampa come together,” said August Garnsey, a senior majoring in business management. “It was great to see such a collection of artwork of Japan.”


The exhibit will be on display at the College of Business Atrium until Feb. 19 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

2009-02-11,USF,China,"Sophomore guard Dominique Jones was scoring at will, but it wasn’t enough for South Florida to make history.


Jones finished with 29 points and eight rebounds, but Providence’s hot shooting prevented USF from winning consecutive Big East games, and the Bulls fell 77-62 Tuesday night at the Sun Dome.


“I don’t know what to say,” said USF coach Stan Heath. “I know Dominique was hungry. He was a little teary-eyed after the game. He was really disappointed.”


Jones went on a 5-0 run by himself with the Bulls trailing by 11 points late in the game. However, Providence forward Brian McKenzie hit a crucial three-pointer with 4:03 remaining — quieting the crowd of 3,340 — and the Friars never looked back.


Heath said it was tough to come back after that play.


“That was a big shot,” he said. “We knew they were going inside … McKenzie hit that shot and that was it. As poorly as we played, we were in the game, though.”


USF (8-15, 3-8) was hurt by poor shooting. The Bulls went  5-of-16 from the free-throw line and finished 3-for-19 from three-point range, while Providence shot an impressive 51 percent from the field.


“It’s frustrating that people don’t take things more serious,” Jones said. “People don’t have it in their heart to come out and play hard.”


Led by sophomore guard Marshon Brooks’ 10 points in the first half, the Friars (15-9, 7-5) went on a five minute 13-2 run to take a 41-32 halftime lead.  Jones had almost half of USF’s first-half points, scoring 15 on 6-of-9 shooting.


The Bulls have never won back-to-back conference games since joining the Big East in 2005, but Jones said he was looking forward to possibly breaking that mark.


“I like doing stuff so that we can be remembered forever and for everyone to not take that seriously — it’s a real disappointment,” he said.


With the loss, USF is tied for 14th with St. Johns and faces a tough stretch. The Bulls play Notre Dame, Georgetown and No. 1 Connecticut in the next three games.


“It’s all relative in this league,” Heath said. “When you look at Notre Dame playing on the road at Louisville, we could end up having the same record when we play. Who would have thought that at the beginning of the year?”

The Bulls (8-15, 3-8), coming off a 77-62 loss to Providence on Tuesday, will face Notre Dame in South Bend on Sunday and play Georgetown and Connecticut the same week.


USF will try to improve upon a poor shooting performance against the Friars. The Bulls shot 39 percent from the field and went 5-of-16 from the free-throw line.


Coach Stan Heath said the team needs to improve from the line.


“You work so hard to fight and get to the free-throw line, but those numbers are just not where they need to be,” he said. “We went to the line and couldn’t capitalize and that was one of the frustrating things.”


While the Bulls are suffering with 57 percent shooting from the free-throw line, they are getting improved performances from the bench.


After junior Mike Mercer was dismissed from the team and senior B.J. Ajayi suffered a season-ending injury, freshman guard Justin Leemow has seen an increase in minutes. Heath said Leemow has improved the team’s defense.


The Bulls will need to play defense well against one of the best post players in the country. Notre Dame center Luke Harangody leads the Big East in scoring with 24.3 points per game.


The Fighting Irish have struggled recently, however — and a USF win could see the Bulls jump them in the Big East conference.

Giovanni incorporated history and poetry to get the audience understand her beliefs about the last three decades of civil rights.


“It’s kind of hard for young people like those in the room to understand what a nickel means. If a nickel was on the floor very few of you would stoop to pick it up,” Giovanni said. “I want to take a moment to understand what a nickel really meant. Land was a nickel an acre. For the lack of a nickel, people were lynched, people were burned, people were beaten.”


Giovanni presented her topic seriously, but also used humorous examples to engage the audience. Applause and standing ovations were repeated throughout the event.


“I was happy with it (the lecture). The crowd was really interactive too. I was kind of impressed with that. I wasn’t sure how that would go, but they seemed very excited to have her,” said Amy Bortzfield , the ULS Student Director.


Thursday night’s lecture took place in the Marshall Center Oval Theater. A crowd of about 300 gathered to see Giovanni speak, Bortzfield said.

ULS experienced some minor difficulties during the questions and answer session. Giovanni felt like she couldn’t see over the podium, so they had to make adjustments with their microphone equipment.


“The Q & A could have been a little smoother,” Bortzfield said. “We were supposed to have two microphones, but we had to transfer one of them to use for her microphone, so it made it (go) a little slower.”


After the question and answer session Giovanni was presented with tokens of appreciation by the Tampa chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and the Black Emphasis Month Committee.


Nicole Crawford, a graduate student majoring in social work and public health said she thoroughly enjoyed Giovanni’s lecture.

2009-02-15,USF,China,"Some people embrace death, and others run from it until it catches up with them. For some the idea is frightening — but others make a living off it.


Wayne Bright, manager of Wilson Funeral Home in Tampa, had mortuary aspirations from the age of 12. However, his exposure to the business started at age 7, when his father and older brother purchased a funeral home.


Morticians don’t lead a punch-the-clock existence, Bright said.


“It’s not a 9-to-5 position,” he said. “Death is unpredictable, and you are always on call and you have to be prepared to respond.”


The initiative to start Wilson Funeral Home came from brothers Clarence and Ray Wilson — both licensed morticians. The idea came to Ray, who broached the idea to Clarence while he was serving in the Korean conflict. They both approached Clarence’s wife, Curtiss Wilson, who was not enthusiastic about the idea at first.


“My first response was, ‘Are they kidding?'” she said.


But through a little coaxing, personal savings and an agreement from Ray’s wife, the Wilsons opened their doors in 1952 and began serving Tampa’s segregated black community.


As the years passed, the funeral home became almost entirely a family affair. Both wives quit their jobs as teachers in the early ’70s to help with clerical work, and Clarence and Curtiss Wilson’s son, Clarence Wilson Jr., eventually became a licensed funeral director.


In 1998, because of the elder Clarence’s declining health, the family decided to sell the business to Liberty Family Services Inc. However, Curtiss Wilson and Clarence Wilson Jr. remain involved in the day-to-day aspects of the business.


Clarence Wilson Jr. was born into the industry — he said he began working with his father at age 8 — but it is the science of embalming bodies that keeps him in the family business.


When Bright and Clarence Wilson Jr. are not working with actual cadavers, they are dealing with families affected by death.


Curtiss Wilson, Clarence Wilson Jr. and Bright described the industry as extremely people-oriented.


“You are dealing with people who are going through an array of emotions. You have to conduct business without losing your cool,” Clarence Wilson Jr. said.


Bright said dealing with people who have lost loved ones is one of the most difficult aspects of the job.


“Every service is different, every family is different, and it’s always a challenge,” he said.


Morticians also have to be able to work quickly. Bright said they typically have three to five days to contact newspapers, cemeteries, churches, printers, florists, limo services, musicians and ministers.


Bright named the “challenges of nature” as the most difficult part of the job. He said that though they try to bring the deceased as close as possible to how he or she looked in life, restoration may or may not work, depending on the circumstances of the death.


Curtiss Wilson said a common misconception about morticians is that they don’t grieve.

2009-02-16,USF,China,"A USF graduate has been nominated by President Barack Obama to be the next drug czar, said an administration official Thursday.


R. Gil Kerlikowske, Seattle’s police chief since 2000, graduated from the University with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in criminal justice.


If the Senate confirms Kerlikowske, he will be in charge of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is a component of the Executive Office of the President.


Ethan Nadelmann — executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit organization promoting alternative policies to the “war on drugs” — said to the New York Times that he would have preferred someone with more of a public health background.


“But, he’s likely to be the best drug czar we’ve seen,” Nadelmann said. “Not that that’s saying much.”

2009-02-17,USF,China,"Faculty Focus, on display at the USF Contemporary Art Museum, brings together artwork from the University’s home turf — featuring three professors from the School of Art and Art History.


“The Faculty Focus exhibition was an alternative — a smaller alternative — of what we used to do, which was a larger group exhibition of all of the faculty that would happen about every four years,” said David Norr, curator of the event.


“This is more of an intimate setting,” he said, adding that the show was an opportunity for the artists to have more space and a chance for people to spend more time with each artist’s work.


Unlike previous Faculty Focus shows, this year’s exhibit doesn’t have a theme. Instead, emphasis was placed on showcasing three very diverse artists.


One painting, “The Field That Feels Like” by Neil Bender, consists of 15 individually painted square canvases joined to form one large piece.


“I wanted to make a big painting where I didn’t know the image,” Bender said. “I worked on these squares. I didn’t know what they’d look like. I was responding to the process of seeing and forming these images.”


It’s not just the size of the painting that makes it noticeable — its provocative subject matter is an instant attention-grabber. The painting uses striking colors to juxtapose fragmented images of human sexual organs.


“I think my body of work is similar — it all deals with (addressing) sexuality in a multitude of formats — both moral and physical,” Bender said.


In addition to his oil painting, Bender has on display a series of smaller collages that incorporate a variety of materials such as fabric, cotton balls, magazine clippings
and glitter.


“I’m restless, materially,” Bender said. “So, while the underlying consistency is addressing flesh — and the clothing and unclothing of flesh — the format changes a lot. So, you get that restless quality, always wanting to investigate the subject matter in a variety of ways. I feel it pervades every aspect of our being.”


Elisabeth Condon’s painting is on the wall opposite Bender’s. “Birdsong” is similar to her previous work in that it features landscape elements, multiple layers of vividly pigmented paint and various textures. Though her individual works are similar, they begin in a way that is random and unpredictable.


“I start a painting by pouring out paint (directly onto the canvas) and then I build,” Condon said. “Whatever comes to me at that time, I’ll build from the pour … At the time, I’ll grab from whatever is in front of me — sort of intuitively — so the paintings get planned the later they go, but at the beginning they’re not planned.”


In addition to environmental themes from her childhood homes in Los Angeles and Florida, Condon’s paintings are influenced by her experiences traveling. There’s always an element of surprise, she said, and a sense of loss
of control.


“There’s an element of freedom that comes with such loss,” Condon said. “A painting has that same kind of engagement for me where, suddenly, that painting became alive and I couldn’t control it anymore.”


Cesar Cornejo’s installation, nestled in a wide corner of the gallery, is quieter than its neighbors but equally striking in detail. “Museumorphosis” depicts an image of the Guggenheim museum overlaid upon the rooftops of a rustic shantytown.


The complete image of the museum can be seen through a mirror hung from the ceiling above the installation. The houses of the town — each crafted and individually placed in the installation one at a time — form a mass of brick and clay and seem to merge into the walls of the gallery.


“I’m trying to bring together two realities that are not normally close to each other,” Cornejo said. “One of the shantytowns and the other of museums — I’m trying to bring them together as one in an attempt to make us think, what is our position regarding shantytowns or regarding museums? Do we think they relate? How do they relate?”


“Museumorphosis” is a reflection of a community project Cornejo is involved with in his native country of Peru. Cornejo works with a rural town to expand the living space of its inhabitants. He does this for free, with the condition that he be allowed to exhibit artwork within these living spaces, essentially turning the entire town into a contemporary
art gallery.


The title of Cornejo’s work references Franz Kafka’s story “The Metamorphosis” and the theme of transformation.


“It’s almost like, is it museum to shantytown or shantytown to museum?” he said. “I tried to play with that image.”


Faculty Focus is on display at USF CAM, West Gallery, through March 7. For more information, visit ira.usf.edu.

2009-02-18,USF,China,"Students lined up across the second floor of the Marshall Student Center, waiting to see pop icon Bill Nye hours before the lecture. The “Science Guy” told the 1,300 students they were part of the space and climate generation.


The lecture on Tuesday was structured like his ’90s PBS television show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, in the way he combined science and humor to entertain the audience.


He talked about the possibility of finding life on Mars, sundials, climate change and shadows.


“If you’ve never done this, I strongly encourage you to do this. Go outside on a sunny day with something very white, like a white shirt, or a napkin or a piece of paper. Cast a shadow on it with a pen, or your finger. Or your friends head,” Nye said. “If you look at the shadow, the shadow will be gray.”


Nye then said why he wanted them to examine an ordinary shadow.


“If you look closely enough, then you will see that the shadow is ever so slightly light blue,” he said.


Nye educated students about what people need to create to help stabilize the climate and the innovations of space technology.


He showed students pictures a spacecraft took on Mars.


“The color of the rocks, gives you the first idea of what the rocks are made of,” Nye said.


Students were also continuously encouraged by Nye to invent new technology.


“If you can do it, you will get rich,” Nye said. “Then maybe, you will change the world.”


Before the lecture, students created a variety of cheers demanding Nye’s presence.


Nye showed he felt like he connected with the University, when he assured one student that he would do his best to come back to USF and perform an energy analysis of the Tampa campus.


ULS Student Director Tim Repass said there were about 800 people in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom and 500 people in Oval Theatre overflow seating.


“It worked out great. There was a lot of people who took advantage of (overflow seating),” said Repass. “I was surprised how full it was. Maybe we can use it for (future) lectures if they enjoyed it.”


Repass said that although the lecture started a little late, he was pleased to see the audience cooperation and excitement.


“There was a lot of energy in the room,” he said.

2009-02-19,USF,China,"Ruckus, a free college-only program that allowed students to share music and download more than 3 million songs, closed this month.


The company closed because of legal issues, inability to continue providing free music, employee loss and layoffs.


Alex Campoe, USF’s associate director of information technology, said a Feb. 6 message on the Ruckus Web site stated that the site was being worked on. A few hours later, another message explained that the site had been shut down.


Jason Herskowitz, vice president of product management for TotalMusic, the company that owned Ruckus, released a statement in his blog lamenting the loss and explaining that economic issues forced the Web site to shut down.


“It should therefore come as no surprise that these small sites and services don’t have the resources, or desire, to deal with licensing content directly,” he wrote. “And for that matter, nor do the content owners — imagine the legal and contractual management overhead.”


Michael Pearce, USF’s chief technology officer, said the service was originally brought to USF in September 2007 because of the issues surrounding online file sharing. Before adopting the program, the University placed 11th in the nation in illegal downloading.


“Ruckus was one of the few offerings (in music downloading software) that did not have a membership fee,” Pearce said.


Within three months, more than 6,000 members at USF downloaded millions of songs, and the University dropped from its high ranking, as reported by the Oracle in 2007.


Pearce said he thinks students will continue to make wise choices about downloading music and that the ranking will not rise again.


“It’s not about one solution, it’s about education — making students aware, giving students references for where to find other alternatives,” he said.


Campoe said he suggests that students use Slacker, Pandora and Last.fm to listen to music for free.


“These programs allow students to start building up (their) playlists and do so by rating songs,” Campoe said.


Campoe said there is still a system in place that monitors computers used on campus. The system lets USF know the time and date of any illegal downloads and the IP address of the computer.


The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities determines the consequences for illegal downloading, he said. Students are notified of violations by mail and may lose their right to use the University network.


Jen Alexandre, a junior majoring in secondary English education, said she will not miss the program.


“I didn’t like the renewal business, so after a while I converted to iTunes” Alexandre said.


Junior criminology major Derek Hayward said he was not happy about the company’s closing.


“It’s annoying that now I have to pay for songs when I’m not sure if I will like them,” he said. “Before, I could listen to someone’s playlist, but now I have to use iTunes, which only lets me preview 30 seconds.”

2009-02-22,USF,China,"Each year, the planet’s population of 6.7 billion grows by another 82 million people. Some argue that to make the planet truly sustainable, people must look beyond surface issues and focus on the underlying problem — population growth.


“The bottom line is there are too many people and not enough resources,” said Werner Fornos, founder of Global Population Education, a nonprofit organization that raises awareness of the ramifications of rapid population growth, according to its Web site.


“Other countries are leading the way for solving the international population crisis while America trails behind,” Fornos said.


Jordan Stone, president of the Alliance of Concerned Students at USF, said the belief that there are not enough resources to sustain the current population is a common misconception.


“Right now, there is enough food to feed the world two times over. The problem is with the distribution of those resources,” Stone said.


According to the Population Institute, global aid for family planning helps prevent 60 million unplanned births, 105 million abortions, 22 million miscarriages, 3 million infant deaths and 685,000 deaths of women during pregnancy. However, 200 million women are still in need of assistance. President Barack Obama has already lifted a ban on funding for global family planning programs.


“The global impact of population growth on forests, topsoil, climate change, and food and water resources tells a cautionary story — one that presents a convincing case for prioritizing population stabilization,” Fornos said.


As it stands, 1.1 billion people on the planet consume unclean water — while 90 percent of sewage and 70 percent of industrial waste is dumped into surface water.


According to the Sierra Club’s Web site, sierraclub.org, all environmental efforts may be
short-lived if they do not address population growth, such as by increasing access to voluntary family planning services, health care education and economic opportunity.


Environmental leaders hope more people will recognize the connection between global population problems and environmental sustainability issues.


Robert Bair, former vice president of Students for Social Justice at USF, said high consumption often raises a population’s quality of life but at the same time damages the environment. The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world’s people, consumes more than 25 percent of its resources, according to the World Resources Institute.


“As Americans, we need to lead by example, voice opinions to political leaders and become a culture that is OK with consuming less,” Bair said. “We can’t function if people stop consuming, but we can consume things that are better for the earth.”


The Sierra Club offers a way for students to better understand how personal consumption habits stack up in terms of environmental degradation. The “Calculate your Personal Ecological Footprint” link on its Web site has a short questionnaire to calculate the environmental impact of personal consumption choices.


One way for students to get involved, Stone said, is to engage with friends and the community in local and global movements for social change by joining student and non-governmental organizations.


“If people would think with their hearts, they would realize that life is precious and we are all interconnected,” Stone said.


The many active student organizations on campus are listed on the Center for Student Involvement Web page involvement.usf.edu, along with meeting times,  locations and contact information.

2009-02-23,USF,China,"It didn’t begin well for the South Florida men’s basketball team, but that didn’t stop the Bulls from giving Connecticut some trouble Saturday.


Despite a dysfunctional offensive start, USF grinded with tough defense but eventually fell to the top-ranked Huskies 64-50 at the XL Center, giving the Bulls their fourth-straight defeat.


“I’m never happy with a loss, but how well you play has more of an effect on you, and defensively I thought we did a terrific job,” said USF coach Stan Heath. “I thought we got back well and we hustled in transition. We even battled with them on the boards.”


It was offense, however, that hurt the Bulls.


USF didn’t score until the 14:11 mark, which resulted in an early 9-0 deficit, and finished 29 percent from the field and 1-for-11 from the three-point line in the first half.


“The way we played, we had a legitimate chance to pull off an upset, if we did one thing — we had to hit three-point shots,” Heath said. “The area around the basket was just not available for us, and we had to do everything we could to make our shots.”


UConn’s 7-foot-3 center Hasheem Thabeet finished with 21 points and nine rebounds, helping the Huskies to a slim 44-40 rebounding margin for the game.


Despite the slow start, the Bulls trailed Connecticut 46-40 after sophomore guard Dominique Jones cut the lead with a dunk at 11:50 in the second half. However, a three-point shot by UConn senior guard A.J. Price and a 9-0 Huskies run put the game out of reach.


USF junior guard Chris Howard, who had 11 points and eight assists, said playing well against the Huskies will encourage the team.


“We definitely feel like this can give us confidence in the future — despite losing — as we approach the end of the schedule,” he said. “It’s kind of a catch-22 sort of thing.”


Jones finished with 14 points — leaving him just short of the 1,000 career point mark at 999.


USF was without senior guard Jesus Verdejo, who sat out with a right ankle injury. Heath used freshmen Gaby Belardo and Justin Leemow, and junior walk-on Ryan Kardok to try and take his place. Leemow played 34 minutes.


“I think a guy like Leemow has grown to where we don’t even consider him freshman anymore,” Howard said. “At the same time, it’s tough not having Jesus (Verdejo), but I think it’s great that he got to play a lot and is gaining more experience.”


USF finished 32 percent from the field and only had three free-throw attempts in the game. Heath said the Bulls’ shooting performance was disappointing.


“It’s just one of those games where you have to make shots against a team like UConn,” he said. “There’s no way to sugar coat it because you have to hit them when they give them to you.”

2009-02-24,USF,China,"When talking about abusive relationships, a physical punch or a verbal bashing are the sorts of things that come to mind. Unfortunately, what many don’t know is that abuse can be sexual, financial, emotional and social as well.


Police photos of a battered Rihanna were leaked onto the Internet on Thursday. The photos show the diva’s face marred with bruises and scratches.


The attacker? R&B superstar boyfriend Chris Brown, according to the police report.


While it’s negative publicity for both artists that these photos are circulating the Web, the event has brought attention to the prominent issue of dating abuse.


According to a Harris Poll, 15 percent of adults have admitted to being abused in a relationship at some point in their lives. A 2000 study by the Bureau Justice Special Report on intimate partner violence found that of 500 women, ages 15 to 24, 60 percent were currently involved in ongoing abusive relationships.


Sadly, even these statistics can be underestimated.


Many surveys on domestic and dating abuse are worded or interpreted as referring only to physical, instead of all forms. And even in today’s open society, a lot of men still do not like to admit that they are victims of abuse by women.


Anyone who has been forced into sex or restricted from seeing friends and family has been a victim of abuse.


Another issue is that some women won’t reveal if they’re in abusive relationships even when they are. Some fear further abuse, and some believe that the aggressor loves them and will someday change.


What the Rihanna/Brown case exemplifies is that relationship abuse can happen to anyone — even to a woman who embodies success and confidence with numerous singles on the top of the Billboard charts.


Dating violence does not discriminate. It can happen to men and women, the pretty and the plain, the leader or the follower and even, as evident, the famous and the anonymous.


People in abusive partnerships should know they’re not alone.


Liz Claiborne Inc. sponsors an organization called “Love is not abuse,” which works to raise awareness for women and men on dating and domestic abuse. The organization’s Web site has statistics and handbooks about the prominence and the dangers of abusive relationships.


The site also has a listing of help resources for people trapped in violent relationships or even people looking to help a friend.


The Spring House (thespring.org) is a safe house for victims of any type of violence located in Tampa.


The key to fighting domestic violence is to know the facts. The Center for Relationship Abuse (stoprelationshipabuse.org) lists early signs in a partner that can hint to future violence.


Keep in mind that it’s easier to end an abusive relationship before it starts. If you see the signs, walk away as soon as you can.


Unfortunately, 80 percent of women in abusive relationships will stay with their partner, according to a study by Teen Research Unlimited.


Though Rihanna’s only official words are through her publicist, thanking fans for support, polls are circulating the Internet asking if fans think the couple will stay together. If the allegations against Chris Brown are true, the best thing Rihanna can do is leave the relationship, setting a good example for all the people who need the courage to do the same.

2009-02-25,USF,China,"While the USF men’s basketball team has struggled on offense all season, the Bulls are learning to do things on defense.


Using strong defense, USF has pulled off surprising wins in the Big East this season, and the Bulls will look for the same effort when they face Seton Hall (14-12, 5-9) at 7 p.m. in Newark, N.J.


“We’re all on the same page defensively,” said USF junior guard Chris Howard. “It falls on (sophomore guard) Dominique Jones’ shoulders, and it falls on my shoulders to make sure the effort is there.”


The effort has been there lately. Despite ranking last in the conference with 59.8 points per game on offense, the Bulls are sixth in the Big East in scoring defense, holding their opponents to 65 points per game.


In the last three games, USF (8-18, 3-11) has held its opponents to less than 70 points, including 64 against No. 1 Connecticut.


“After the (UConn) game, (Huskies coach) Jim Calhoun came over to me and said ‘coach to be honest with you, you guys do a great job defensively,’ and that meant a lot to me,” said USF coach Stan Heath. “We’re fighting pretty hard out there.”


Heath said his focus remains on improving the team’s offense.


“Really, except for maybe a couple games, we’ve been able to hang around and fight in games,” he said. “It comes down to us being able to improve our shooting skills.”


Jones, who leads the team with 18 points per game, is one point shy of 1,000 in his career. When he breaks the record tonight, he will be the third player in school history to reach 1,000 career points, and the second-fastest to do it. The 6-foot-4 guard will set the mark in his 58th career game. Tony Grier reached 1,000 in 51 games during the 1980-81 season.


“I think from an individual standpoint, what he (Jones) brings to our program, it’s a huge step,” Heath said. “I’m more into team goals and winning and things that represent USF, but a part of that is having talented players.”


Heath is awaiting the status of  another important player. Senior guard Jesus Verdejo, who sat out of the Connecticut loss, is struggling with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. Heath said Verdejo should be able to play, though.


“Our team continues to fight, to compete as hard as we can, and we’re trying to spend extra time on different areas,” he said. “We have guys coming in the mornings to shoot free-throws and extra shots. I feel we can really improve in that area down the stretch.”

2009-02-26,USF,China,"Two student body election straw polls have yielded similar results, with candidates Juan Soltero and Bruno Portigliatti garnering the most votes and the green fee passing by more than 70 percent.


Student Alliance for a Politically Active Campus (SAPAC), which conducted the polls, counted votes only from students planning to vote in the SG election next week,
tallying 203  responses from the 236 students who voted in Wednesday’s poll.


Though the results are not scientific, 37.5 percent of Wednesday’s participants supported candidates Soltero and Portigliatti.


Candidates Christopher Leddy and Kayla Richmond were supported by 21.3 percent of voters, Christopher Cano and Jaime Lane by 12.3 percent and Ralph Reid and Robin Roup by 7.8 percent. Torend Ebner Jr, who dropped out of the race last week, received 0.4 percent of the vote.


SAPAC decided to conduct polls over two weeks to see if the level of campaigning changed from week to week or trends could be noticed. However, all candidates placed in the same order in both polls.


The campus green fee was approved by 76.8 percent of those polled Wednesday, similar to last week’s 73.7 percent.


This week’s results showed a larger amount of students were undecided, 20.7 percent, compared to last week’s 16 percent.


During both weeks, the poll was conducted at two locations: inside the Marshall Student Center and outside of Cooper Hall.


Christian Marble, president of SAPAC, said the organization hoped for more volunteers than it received, which limited the group from dispersing itself throughout campus.


“I feel that if there were two spots to pick on campus that have the most traffic and the most diversity of students, that we picked those two,” he said. “If we had a more standard operation in the future, we’d want to expand to at least Argos or Andros — the cafeteria areas — and perhaps to some other parts of campus, such as the College of Engineering or the College of Business.”


Marble said he was satisfied with the overall turnout of the event.


“Two hundred and thirty-six is a good sample size,” he said. “You can’t exactly pool every single college in every single time zone that students operate by.”


Susan MacManus, a political science professor, said straw polls are not meant to be scientific at the college level.


Straw polls are meant to educate students about an election and be fun for students, she said.


“A number of students have become aware (of elections) because of the straw poll,” Marble said. “I feel that because of that it was a pretty successful first event for us.”

Trailing by three with less than a minute to play, senior guard Shantia Grace made a crucial play to propel a 52-50 USF (21-9, 8-8) victory over Villanova (18-12, 10-6) at the Pavilion.


With 40 seconds left, Grace made a basket and hit a free throw to complete a three-point play and tie the game 50-50. Senior Jazmine Sepulveda then got a steal with nine seconds left and drained a shot to give the Bulls their 21st victory this season.


“Coach told me it was going to have to come from me,” Sepulveda said. “I just stole it and took it to the basket.”


At the end of the first half, the Bulls trailed by six and coach Jose Fernandez gave his team advice.


“He told us we had to talk more on defense,” Sepulveda said. “He told us we had to keep fighting the battles.”


Battle they did.


South Florida trailed by as many as seven in the second half but a jump shot by Sepulveda gave the Bulls the lead with 10:49 remaining. The Wildcats then took control of the game, but Fernandez told his team to stay together.


“He told us to keep our composure,” Sepulveda said. “He told us to play one defensive stop at a time.”


With a Georgetown and Marquette loss, the Bulls can climb into eighth place in the conference, earning them a first-round bye in the Big East tournament.


Fernandez said the NCAA Tournament ramifications would have a bigger impact.


“NCAA tournament teams find a way to win,” Fernandez said. “We went on the road and found the way to win.”

Klingebiel said Hernandez is not affiliated with the University.


Hernandez’s reason for being on campus at the time of the accident is unknown.


Athan and representatives from LEI Construction were not available to comment.

2009-03-04,USF,China,"Entering this weekend, USF softball coach Ken Eriksen said the Bulls haven’t played to their potential yet.


Coming off a doubleheader with Maine on Tuesday, the Bulls (13-9) will try to reach that potential when they host the Under Armour Invitational at the Eddie C. Moore Softball Complex in Clearwater.


“Right now, we can’t take any games for granted,” Eriksen said. “We have played lots of games this season that we’ve had a chance to win but were unable to capitalize on the little things.”


Sixteen teams will play in this weekend’s tournament, split into four pools of four teams each. USF will be in Pool A with Virginia Tech, Fordham and the Lehigh Mountain Hawks. The Bulls face the Hokies at 4 p.m. Friday.


Virginia Tech (5-10) appeared in the Women’s College World Series in 2008, making it the third team the Bulls have faced this season to do so.


The Hokies have struggled this year, beginning the season 2-7, but senior second baseman Britta Giddens said the Bulls won’t be focusing much on their opponents.


“(Eriksen’s) philosophy is to not play the name game,” she said. “We can’t worry about who we’re playing. We can only worry about how we play.”


USF will play Fordham (5-6) on Friday at 6 p.m. and the Mountain Hawks on Saturday at 1 p.m. Lehigh (7-3) made it to the NCAA tournament last season. The Bulls’ opponents for the remainder of the weekend will determine on their record leaving pool play.


The tournament also hosts teams including N.C. State, Villanova, Connecticut and Western Michigan. However, Eriksen said he wants the Bulls to worry about themselves.


“I think that recently our biggest opponent has been us,” he said. “Our main priority right now is this team, and we’re not worried about Virginia Tech or any of the other teams. In order to play good softball, we have to worry about ourselves and let everything else fall into place.”

2009-03-05,USF,China,"She’s the youngest to win an Academy Award for best actress in a leading role for the film Children of a Lesser God. She’s appeared in a variety of television shows. She salsa-ed, samba-ed and lindy-hopped through episodes of Dancing with the Stars.


She’s also legally deaf.


Tonight, Marlee Matlin will take the stage of the Marshall Student Center Oval Theater to discuss how she overcame her disability and achieved success in the entertainment industry. In the speech, titled “The Roaring Silence: From Oscar to the West Wing and Beyond,” Matlin will also share steps to overcome challenges in life.


“We all face barriers of one kind or another and (in) the end, we can accomplish so much more if we focus on our abilities rather than dwell on perceived ‘disabilities,'” Matlin wrote in her MySpace blog, “I may be deaf, but I’m always listening to my heart and I’m far from silent.”


Matlin  regularly travels to universities to share her perspectives with others.


She has appeared in television shows including The West Wing, The L Word, Seinfeld and Law and Order: SVU. She has been nominated twice for Golden Globes and four times for Emmys.


Matlin also works as a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross and sits on the board for organizations including Easter Seals and the Children Affected by Aids Foundation.


In her free time, Matlin works to help hearing-impaired causes. She helped convince Congress to pass legislation making closed-caption ability mandatory for all U.S.manufactured televisions.


ULS student director Amy Bortzfield said that in addition to Matlin’s discussion, there will be a short pre-show presentation featuring Jennifer Potter and Dwain Scheuneman in a dance duet.


“The Roaring Silence: From Oscar to the West Wing and Beyond” will take place in the Marshall Student Center Oval Theater at 7 p.m. Doors open at 6 p.m. Admission is free for USF students.


Bortzfield said Matlin’s discussion cost $18,500, which was paid for with a portion of Activity and Service fees.

2009-03-06,USF,China,"Next week, student body presidential candidates Christopher Leddy and running mate Kayla Richmond, and Juan Soltero and running mate Bruno Portigliatti will face off in a run-off election.


Soltero and Portigliatti led in the original race with 43 percent of the vote, and Leddy and Richmond trailed with 25 percent. There will be a run-off because no candidate received over 50 percent of the votes.


Candidates Christopher Cano and Ralph Reid will not move on to the final election.
Campaigning for next week’s elections begins as soon as candidates turn in their budgets, said Supervisor of Elections Michael van Hoek.


Richmond said she was “ecstatic” about their accomplishment.


Leddy said for the upcoming campaigning, the two would focus on making students more aware of the elections and getting them to vote for a second time.


Soltero and Portigliatti said they were very “excited” about their success.


“We knew we were fighting a strong campaign all along, and we’re gong to continue to do that until Wednesday,” Soltero said. “We hope all of our supporters come back and vote once again.”


After hearing the results, Cano said that he was just happy that students voted.
“Honestly, we ran the cleanest campaign,” he said. “We’re proud of the way we carried ourselves.” Reid’s running mate Robin Roup said she was “surprised” by the results. Reid and Roup probably won’t endorse another ticket, she said.


Reid could not attend the Election Night Announcement Social because he was in Tallahassee with the Political Honor Society, Roup said.


There were more than the presidential candidates to vote for on the ballot. Students could also vote for several non-binding referendums on the ballot. Though the votes will not directly decide any courses of action, they were meant to gauge student interest in the proposals.


A majority chose to use Capital Improvement Trust Fund money for a combination facility, with recreation center expansion and a nutritional dining facility in the Sun Dome, van Hoek said. The most-favored type of dining facility students voted for was a “grab and go” style of dining.


Students also chose to allocate the Tech Fee money for classroom capture technology, he said.


The Green Fee initiative was also supported by a majority of student voters, van Hoek said.


However, Student Environmental Association president Lyndsey Scofield was concerned over a last-minute change in the language of the Green Fee referendum on the ballot. Soltero said the language change will probably be looked into Friday.

2009-03-08,USF,China,"Student Government officials hoped for 10,000 educated votes in the student body election poll, but only 3,236 students voted.


Though the number of voters dropped, Supervisor of Elections Michael van Hoek said he was happy some of the “nonsense” from years past — including candidates giving pizza to voters or bringing laptops to parties where students were drinking — was eliminated. Last year, 5,165 students voted.


“We were able to get nearly 3,300 (voters) under actual, real circumstances,” van Hoek said. “From that angle, it was a success.”


SG marketing director Nathan Davison said that despite a complicated election week, there was much less corruption this year — but there were other unforeseen challenges, such as the issue with Blackboard.


“I would have liked to have seen more presence from candidates on campus,” he said.


This week, students will get a chance to vote again in a runoff election between candidates Christopher Leddy and running mate Kayla Richmond, and Juan Soltero and running mate Bruno Portigliatti.


Soltero and Portigliatti led in the original race with 43 percent of the vote, and Leddy and Richmond trailed with 25 percent. There will be a runoff because no candidate received more than 50 percent of the votes.


Candidates Christopher Cano and Ralph Reid will not move on to the final election.


Students can vote in the runoff election Tuesday and Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.


Before the voting results were announced, there were mixed feelings in the Oak Room of the Marshall Student Center (MSC).


Portigliatti said that if a runoff were to occur, it would be between the Soltero and Leddy tickets.


“It would be historical if it doesn’t go into a runoff,” he said. “Anytime you have four tickets, it is nearly impossible not to go into a runoff election.”


Soltero said he felt good but anxious, while Leddy said he was nervous but excited.


“A lot of people said they voted,” Leddy said. “Some people said they voted for me.”


Cano said he just wanted the winning candidates to have the student body behind them.


Roup said she felt some voting issues should have been resolved beforehand, such as the IP address problem that made voting more difficult for students living in off-campus apartments.


Aside from those issues, Roup felt the voting went well and said she was “trying to be optimistic” about the results.


Richmond said she was ecstatic about she and Leddy’s accomplishment.


Leddy said that in the upcoming campaign for the runoff, the two would focus on making students more aware of the elections and getting them to vote for a second time.


Soltero said the significant percentage felt good.


“But the election is still open — we’ve got to stay focused on the message. We’re going to keep fighting strong,” he said.


Both candidates said they have planned their first action in office.


Leddy said his first action would be to save the $1,000 he pledged for a scholarship fund and immediately start lobbying and talking to legislators.


Soltero said he wants to get his main cabinet members appointed as early as possible so they can gain the knowledge they need from this year’s members and transition smoothly.


Cano said he was not bothered by the loss but was happy students voted.


“Honestly, we ran the cleanest campaign,” he said. “We’re proud of the way we carried ourselves.”


Reid’s running mate Robin Roup said she was “kind of surprised” by the results. Reid and Roup  probably won’t endorse another ticket during the runoff election, she said.


Reid did not attend the Election Night Announcement Social because he was in Tallahassee with the Political Honor Society, Roup said.


Aside from presidential candidates, students also voted on several non-binding referendums. Though the votes will not directly effect any changes, they were meant to gauge student interest in the proposals.


A majority of students chose to allocate Capital Improvement Trust Fund money for a combination facility, which would include Campus Recreation Center expansion and a nutritional dining facility in the Sun Dome. Voters’ most favored type of dining facility was a “grab and go” style, like the MSC.


Students also chose to allot the Tech Fee money for classroom capture technology, which would provide video footage of class lectures that students could access online.


The Green Fee initiative was approved by 58 percent of voters.


However, before results were announced, Student Environmental Association (SEA) president Lyndsey Scofield said she was concerned about how a change in the language of the Green Fee referendum might affect voters’ decisions.


Scofield said the wording on the ballot asked if students would support a green fee for “green projects.”


“We actually had worded it as ‘renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on campus,'” Scofield said. “(The ballot) didn’t really say much about what a green project is or what it would actually be spent for. We were kind of disappointed in that.”


Soltero, as the SG Senate president, said the language issue has not yet been addressed in SG and that he will speak with Scofield and the Election Rules Commission about it.


He said the main goal of the referendum had not changed, so it was unclear whether it would require a re-vote.


Scofield said USF’s support of the Green Fee has made the case for the Green Fee legislation at the state level much stronger. She said SEA hopes to lobby state representatives to pass the Green Fee legislation during this session.

2009-03-09,USF,China,"Bathed in the light from the stained glass cross at Crystal River Methodist Church, a white “84” glinted off a dark green jersey.


That number had seen the triumph of the Bulls’ first bowl game victory. It had been pressed against a football as the person who bore that number, former USF football player Will Bleakley, ran across the field in games against UCF, Syracuse and East Carolina.


But this weekend, that number didn’t just represent Bleakley’s role as a tight end for the Bulls. It stood for the man who loved to play sports of any kind, who could beat just about all of his friends at golf but wouldn’t harass them too much about it, and whom friends said they revered as much for his book smarts as his athletic ability.


He was their friend, their teammate, their Will, and on Saturday afternoon, football coach Jim Leavitt, running backs coach Carl Franks and more than 100 people from the USF community gathered for a memorial service in Bleakley’s honor.


So many people attended the service they couldn’t all fit in the church, said former USF quarterback Grant Gregory. To let all the additional guests hear the service, the church set up speakers outside, which is where Gregory and other USF football players including Andrew Ketchel, Armando Sanchez and Carlton Mitchell gathered.


Though they didn’t get to sit inside, Gregory and Ketchel said the most important part of the service occurred afterward, when they had the chance to talk to Bleakley’s parents.


“It gave me some closure, just to hear from them and get a few words in,” Ketchel said.


One week ago, Will Bleakley and three friends — including NFL players Marquis Cooper and Corey Smith and former USF player Nick Schuyler — went fishing in the Gulf of Mexico when their boat overturned. The Coast Guard searched more than 20,000 miles of the Gulf’s waters but found only Schuyler clinging to the overturned 21-foot boat. Though the Bleakleys didn’t want to give up the search for their son, Betty Bleakley, Will’s mother, said that after talking with Schuyler as he recovered from hypothermia at Tampa General Hospital, they knew their son wouldn’t be returning home.


Schuyler, recently released from the hospital, also traveled to the service, limping as he walked — a reminder of the struggle the four men endured and the 40-plus hours Schuyler spent in the water.


“He was as devastated as anyone would be, having gone through that, but he’s doing real well,” Gregory said. “He’s lost some weight, but he should be back to normal soon.”


During a press conference Wednesday, Dr. Mark Rumbak said Schuyler had been experiencing some pain in his legs and left ankle as a result of hypothermia but is expected to make a full recovery soon.


Ketchel said that though he saw Schuyler the day before the service, spending time with him face-to-face made the past week feel all the more real.


“It gave me the realization that it all really did happen,” he said.


Though Bleakley was best known at USF as a football player, if his mom had it her way, he might never have donned the number 84. When he was in kindergarten, Betty Bleakley signed her son up for soccer and baseball, but she said she didn’t feel comfortable with the thought of him playing a sport as aggressive as football.


“I never thought I’d let him play because I was afraid he’d get hurt,” she said.


And then, when Will was in seventh grade, he came home from school with a form in his hand, she said. It was a permission slip to join the Sharks Football League. He had filled it out entirely, she said, and told her all she needed to do was sign it.


“I thought, ‘What am I going to do?'” his mother said. “So I said OK, and I signed it.”


Scott Miller, one of Bleakley’s childhood friends, played football and basketball with him in middle school. They also played baseball, and their passion for sports continued throughout college as the pair joined a men’s league in Clearwater and regularly played golf at the Claw while taking classes at USF.


Though Miller had scrimmaged against Bleakley countless times and played alongside him in a variety of sports, nothing compared to seeing his friend don a gold helmet and green uniform as he walked onto the field at Raymond James Stadium.


“Seeing him out there on the football field the first few times made me feel so good,” Miller said. “I was so happy to be a part of his journey to get to that place.”


On the field, teammates said Bleakley was the player new members turned to for guidance and support. He was a fifth-year senior when Ketchel began his freshman year, and though there are sometimes barriers between older and younger players, Ketchel said Bleakley never acted that way. Instead, he focused on helping others adjust to playing college football.


“He really provided the mentorship I needed,” he said. “It wasn’t just on the field, though — he invited me to go out on weekends and hang out with him, too. I never expected a starting senior to do that, but that was just him. He always reached out to other people.”


As Ketchel approached Bleakley’s parents, he said he worried it’d be difficult to find the right words to say to them. He grew more comfortable as he spoke to them, he said, drawing courage from their quiet strength, and decided to share with them the story he felt displayed their son’s character best: the way Bleakley broke down player age barriers, taking charge and guiding new team members through a world of two-a-day practices, adrenaline-pumping games and major lifestyle
adjustments.


“I wanted them to be able to have personal stories to take away from this and show what an impact he had,” he said. “He was such a good, caring person.”


During the service, football players, coaches, friends and family stood together not just to remember a number emblazoned on a jersey or Bleakley’s successes on the field.


They were there for something bigger: They were there for Will.
