2009-01-19,CMU,China,"As a noteworthy member of the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team, senior Terrance Bouldin-Johnson stays involved with the sports community in other ways than just varsity competition. He shows his dedication to the athletics programs through his responsibilities with intramural sports and as an avid sideline worker for home soccer matches in the fall. 
Bouldin-Johnson gave The Tartan some insight into the playing, dining, and personal hairstyling aspects of his college life while in the midst of his senior season with the Tartans.
The Tartan: While each University Athletic Association (UAA) game is as intense as the one before it, are there any conference match-ups coming up that you are particularly excited to play? 
Bouldin-Johson: I just look forward to the next game. I try not to look too far down the line so that I don’t lose focus on what I have to do to help us win the next one.
T: What has been your favorite place that you have eaten while on the road traveling as a team, and while here in Pittsburgh?
B: Tough one. I would say it is a tie between Grandlux Café in Chicago and Fire and Ice in Boston for team trips. When it comes to the ‘burgh, my tops are Fiori’s (pizza), New China Inn (Chinese), Tessaro’s (burgers), Fatheads (signature sandwiches), and Pizza Perfectta (hoagies).
T: What has been the best part about senior year so far? Is there anything left that you are still hoping to do before you graduate? 
B: The best part of this year for me was spending winter break in Pittsburgh with all of my teammates. I just hope to help the team win as many games as possible before I graduate.
T: If you could own any kind of car, what type would you own and why? 
B: I look forward to riding my bike and taking the train to work when I graduate and hardly ever using a car. That being said, I would take the Batmobile from The Dark Knight, but only the motorcycle version in order to reduce my carbon footprint.
T: What do you enjoy most, and least, about the Tepper School of Business? 
B: The one thing I enjoy the most about Tepper is getting graded on presentations. It’s like cheating: You just decide what you are going to say and look good while you do it, and bang, you get an A. The biggest downfall of being in Tepper would be the tremendous workload.
T: You’ve been sporting some pretty original hairstyles the past couple of seasons. Is there any inspiration behind them?
B: Let me break it down. I let my hair grow for about three months and then I tell my teammate Elliot [Curtis] I need a haircut. I simply wear his masterpieces.
T: Did you have a basketball idol while you were growing up? If you could be compared to any player, who would it be?
B: My uncle was my only basketball idol when I was younger because I have never really followed the sport outside of playing it myself. As far as players to be compared to, I would call myself a rich man’s Mittens.
The Tartans hit the hardwood next at Lycoming College this Tuesday, followed by a men’s and women’s UAA double-header weekend at Skibo Gymnasium with match-ups against the University of Chicago on Friday and Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday..

2009-02-09,CMU,China,"“What kind of ally is Pakistan?” screams a San Francisco Chronicle editorial, as it brashly flaunts the futility of the U.S.’s “ally in the war on terror” to the new American administration, mocking over five decades of U.S.–Pakistan relations.
I wonder too. What kind of ally objects to being bombarded with massive drone attacks, launched by American unmanned Predator drones? I mean, how completely illogical of Pakistan to, for once, stand up for the lives and rights of its own population, rather than become enslaved by its “ally’s” historically disastrous foreign policy. How unreasonable of the U.S.’s “most allied ally” (as famously termed by Pakistan’s first military ruler and former president Field Marshal Muhammed Ayub Khan) to say that, no, you cannot keep fumbling around for terrorists on our land and shooting down our civilians. For heaven’s sake, why can’t Pakistan strike a magical balance between the transition to democracy and submission to U.S. political and military agendas? What kind of an ally is Pakistan?
The answer to that question is camouflaged in the wilderness of historic events from the Cold War to the current “war on anything remotely un-American” (pun intended).
Containment policy lit the first spark in U.S.–Pakistan relations. Emerging from the influential Truman Doctrine, the policy aimed to restrict Soviet influence in Asia by creating military pacts and political blocs in and around the continent. Urged by the U.S., several Asian countries, including Pakistan, were bundled in a collective defense pact called the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). This alliance was attractive to Pakistan because its status as a pro-Western country would gain it support when in conflict with India. While ostensibly two-way in theory, these pacts were designed to benefit the U.S. only and actually stopped the other country from defending itself from aggression by any country that the U.S. did not determine to be its enemy. Not surprisingly, this obvious imbalance did not initially come under protest by Pakistan, so long as American economic aid kept flowing in and the armed forces kept receiving their military hardware, along with the rest of the benefits that were sealed under SEATO. No wonder the authors ponder — what kind of ally is Pakistan?
It was also during this time that Pakistan, in a misguided demonstration of loyalty and friendship, allowed the U.S. to build two military bases in Pakistan that were used to spy over the Soviet Union and communist China. In 1960, from one of these bases, Badaber, in the North West Frontier Province, Francis Gary Powers took off to spy over the USSR and got shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft missile systems inside Soviet territory. This prompted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to place a red circle on the city of Peshawar in Pakistan and declare that unless the U.S. packed up its base and left, he would obliterate the entire city, leaving it to the imagination of his audience as to what type of weapon he would use to achieve this aim. The U.S. duly left Peshawar after this embarrassing episode, and Pakistan was left alone to pay the price when in 1971 the Soviet Union backed India to the hilt to dismember Pakistan forever. Furthermore, the U.S. also demonstrated immense support for Pakistan’s longtime rival, India, in terms of its economic and military growth. In an attempt to make up for this, the U.S. promised Pakistan that it would consult its anti-Soviet ally before any aid was allocated to India. However, once again the U.S. turned its back on this promise by committing military aid to India, shortly before a flaming war raged between India and Pakistan in 1965. The hostilities lasted only 17 days, but forever shattered the myth of the neutrality of U.S. leaders and policymakers. Almost all of India’s military hardware providers continued to arm India while Pakistan’s principle supplier, the U.S., clamped an arms embargo on it. The excuse was Pakistan’s growing nuclear program, which was perceived as a threat to India and Israel — India being the U.S.’s new heir to progressive democracy and Israel its recipient of military and economic aid since World War II. So apt is the question, what kind of ally is Pakistan?
Come the post-9/11 era, and the U.S. once again begins stirring this cyclical friendship with Pakistan as it seeks its full cooperation in the war on terror. This time, however, Pakistan is propelled to fight a war on its own land, against its own people. Last Friday, at least 20 people were killed by drone strikes near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. While Defense Secretary Robert Gates circulates the falsity that U.S. attacks on its land are blessed by Pakistan, Islamabad publicly denied Gates’ claim, with Prime Minister Yousef Gilani clearly saying that there is no such agreement between the two “allies.”
These were the first hits to the region authorized by President Barack Obama, and probably not the last. This year alone, over 300 civilians have been the targets of both manned and robotic American military assaults on their own soil, particularly in the Swat valley, a once scenic district in the northern areas of Pakistan. The transition in Washington has not affected U.S. foreign policy toward Pakistan but in one facet: Unlike former President Bush, who believed in stabbing the enemy (or friend?) in the back, Obama believes in a head-on collision. Obama stated up-front in his campaign that Pakistan was a key target in combating terrorism, so while the civilian deaths sadden me, they do not come as a surprise. What is indeed baffling is the existing incompetence of the American intelligence. Why, and how, does U.S. intelligence fail to accurately distinguish militants from civilians? Militant groups are on a rampage, blowing up U.S. supply routes to NATO troops in Afghanistan, while the U.S. is blindly attacking civilian homes. Why are these militants not identified in advance by the U.S.? However, as it it sleeps through the destruction of key supply routes, the U.S. deems it necessary to express uneasiness over the release of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program and a “rogue bombmaker,” to the West. No wonder then, preoccupied by non-issues, the most technologically advanced and sophisticated U.S. intelligence network falls short in identifying militant hideouts even after repeated attempts.
While Pakistan continues to be a front player in the U.S.’s conflicts all around the world, it never finds its ally — and the most powerful nation in the world — by its side when in need. Not only do such double standards in an alliance defy international norms, they also churn anti-American sentiments among Pakistanis, and thus blot the big picture of U.S.–Pakistan relations. Obama’s administration needs to learn a lesson from this history of one-sided alliances and ensure U.S. loyalty (if it is to call Pakistan an ally) to the country at times of crisis and when justified. These airstrikes only boost hatred toward the American government and drive the ordinary citizen who has lost everything to the doorsteps of religious fundamentalists. These fundamentalists then arm them ideologically and economically, setting their mind to “revenge” mode.
The surprise raids that kill hundreds of innocent civilians pose no less threats than those that external terrorists pose to the U.S. soil. It is akin to rendering the U.S. Department of Homeland Security useless by stripping it of all their power to protect citizens. Since the onset of the “war on terror,” Pakistan has sent over 100,000 of its military troops into the threatening abyss of the northern tribal areas. Yet it is accused of being an unreliable ally. Perhaps for the first time, the U.S. and Pakistan seem to share a common goal — ousting terrorist networks from Pakistani land. A blatant disregard of Pakistan’s masses is sure to jeopardize this effort. At this point, before setting out on a road to nowhere, the U.S. needs to ask itself the question: What kind of ally is Pakistan?

2009-02-23,CMU,China,"The Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) is known for working its students hard, but this year’s first annual technology showcase, which displayed 12 student engineering projects, showed that all those sleepless nights of coding, soldering, and nervous breakdowns were well worth the effort.
The Tech Showcase was part of the annual National Engineer’s Week, which was hosted by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). The showcase was a new addition to this year’s E-Week events. “The Tech Showcase aims to celebrate the exciting and innovative research and technologies being developed by engineers,” Christine Ho, a senior chemical and biomedical engineering major and co-chair for E-Week, said. “It is an opportunity for students in CIT as well as students in the other colleges to explore the many ways in which engineering is changing the world.” The showcase represented projects from all different disciplines and organizations within Carnegie Mellon.
The three senior capstone projects that were displayed included a gesture recognition glove called “Hand Talk,” a fold-out toaster, and an iPod-charging exercise bike. “Hand Talk” is a project developed by electrical and computer engineering alumnus Bhargav Bhat and fifth-year electrical and computer engineering master’s students Hemant Sikaria and Jorge Meza. The device is aimed to help individuals who have hearing impairments to better communicate with other people. By wearing a glove with embedded sensors, an individual is able to make a gesture that is then transmitted to a cell phone as text.
“The cool thing about our project is that there are a lot [of] these types of gloves out there, but ours is the only one which is wireless,” Meza said. The technology behind the glove is currently being researched in regard to obtaining a patent. “Hand Talk” won the “Most Innovative Design” award at the showcase.
The fold-out toaster, developed by senior mechanical engineering students Akshay Jayaram, Leigh Fortenberry, Ian Price, and Jonathan Goetteler, is a modification of the current toaster design. 
After conducting user studies, the group found that people often have trouble removing their toast from the toaster, causing them to burn their toast, themselves, or both. In order to solve this problem, they designed a toaster in which the side walls open up and out. “We think that this is a very innovative design, and we haven’t seen anything like this in the market,” Jayaram said, “so in the future, we’re hoping to get a patent for it.”
The iPod-charging exercise bike, which was developed by senior mechanical engineers Shobit Tandon, Abe Alexander, Cason Male, and Madhu Bhagavatula, is another example of technological innovation. The design involves attaching a generator to the wheel of an exercise bike which then charges the battery of an iPod. The project won the award for best overall design at the mechanical engineering showcase in the fall semester.
Several student organizations were also represented during the showcase. The Robotics Club’s “Robot Colony Project” aims to replace one large, expensive robot, which can accomplish only one task at a time, with many smaller, cheaper robots. The robots use infrared range finders to avoid collision with walls and other robots. With the help of the range finders and encoders, the club, currently funded by a Small Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG), is trying to develop cooperative mapping behavior to enable the robot to determine its position and environment. The robot will then be able to send the information back to a central server that can then use the data to create a map of the environment. Christopher Mar, a junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering, explained, “We’re programming each robot with a very simple behavior —to avoid walls and other robots—but when you throw them all together, hopefully something bigger arises.” The Robotics Club won the “People’s Choice Award” at the showcase.
Fringe Buggy, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Racing, and Kiltie Kar were three other student organizations that participated in the showcase. 
These three clubs all focus on creating dynamic projects that are entered into annual racing competitions. Each group has performed exceptionally well in each of its respective competitions. 
Fringe has won the annual buggy design competition for the past 10 years, while Kiltie Kar placed second at last year’s national American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) chemical car competition. SAE Racing, which attends one annual competition in Detroit, placed 53rd last year in the overall competition out of 110 competitors, and also placed 23rd out  of 110 in the endurance race.
TechBridgeWorld, a Carnegie Mellon program that seeks to improve literacy among visually-impaired youth, presented the “Braille Writing Tutor” during the showcase. The Braille Tutor uses a digital stylus that interfaces to a computer, PDA, or SimPuter interface. This allows the utilization of text-to-speech software that can provide immediate feedback to the students to help them correct their mistakes while they are learning. After perfecting the use of the digital stylus, the students can then move on to learning how to use the slate and stylus. The system has been tested in India and Tanzania, and will soon be tested in China and the United States. The Braille Tutor won the “Impact Award” at the showcase.
The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) presented its project “Get In Line,” which aims to create interactive experiences for people waiting in lines. Last year, the group created an interactive game for people waiting in line for the annual “Building Virtual Worlds” show. Andrew Federspiel, a master’s student at the ETC, said, “We had maybe 200 people waiting in line playing this game. It’s scalable, so it doesn’t matter how many people join in to play.” 
The game involves players identifying themselves as either left-brained or right-brained, and then, based on this identification, they can compete in games with other players standing in line. The group, which consists of about nine members, is planning to spin the project off as their own company..

2009-02-23,CMU,China,"Increasingly, international students at Carnegie Mellon who are finishing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are choosing to pursue career opportunities outside of the United States after graduation.
Of the students pursuing degrees in STEM, 49 percent come from outside the United States, while only 20 percent of the total students at Carnegie Mellon come from outside the country, according to statistics on the university website.
Some students feel that this trend of homeward migration is in part a consequence of the general economic recession in the United States. “The crisis on Wall Street is making it difficult for any college student in the U.S. to get internships or jobs,” commented first-year engineering major Karen Yu. “If they [international students] can find better opportunities in their home countries ... there is not much incentive to stay here.” The crisis has affected all potential employees looking for jobs, not just college students.
In addition, many multi-national companies and organizations, such as Microsoft and Samsung, are expanding overseas and creating career opportunities outside of the United States. Yu explained, “Globalization and technological advances are removing geographic barriers, so job-seekers in general are going to spread out.” First-year computer science major Anuraag Jain, who is from India, also added, “I would like to find something (an internship or job during the summer) in California, but ... I’ll probably be able to still work for Microsoft or Apple if I go back to India.”
However, regardless of current events or globalization in the United States, many international students are simply obliged to return to their home countries after graduation. “Our government has awarded many Singaporean students scholarships on certain conditions,” explained first-year computer science major Jun Jie Liang. “After I graduate from Carnegie Mellon, I need to spend several years working in Singapore before I can find a job in the U.S.” The economies in emerging nations like Singapore are increasingly in demand for engineers and information specialists to compete in a more technological global economy. To encourage their youth to pursue careers in these fields, the governments of these nations are awarding full scholarships that characteristically allow local students to pursue degrees in STEM fields at many top universities in the United States or Europe. “Most scholarships require a bond of four or more years of work after graduation,” explained first-year computer science major Joseph Lum. “Our government is making an investment in us to apply what we have learned to stimulate our country’s economy.”
At the same time, the United States is also falling behind in general STEM education. According to the American Society for Engineering Education, China will likely produce almost eight times the number of engineers than will graduate in the United States this year. Students in India are also studying science and engineering at an average rate of three times that of the students in the United States.
“In secondary school, several of the required courses were about computer and information technology studies,” confirmed Jain.
The American Society for Engineering Education did note, however, that these gaps are in part due to a deliberate shift of focus to “soft” areas and liberal arts among many colleges and universities in the United States.
Nevertheless, many experts interpret trends of homeward migration and inferior STEM education as signs of the United States’ decline as a global superpower. STEM graduates play an increasingly vital role in the emerging technological economy..

2009-03-30,CMU,China,"The idea of studying abroad has a fascination that catches everyone’s attention. The thought of traveling away from home and visiting another country, not as a tourist limited to hotel rooms but as a traveler, living and eating the way the citizens do, sounds exciting and adventurous.
Carnegie Mellon offers its students ample opportunities to go on an adventure and learn from another country (read about students’ study abroad experiences in Tales from Abroad), but, for many students, studying at Carnegie Mellon itself is an adventure. International students come from all over the world, ranging from far-east countries like South Korea to European countries like Scotland.
Why the U.S.?
The reasons for studying abroad in the United States are many. Some are studying abroad for the cultural experience, while others because of the academic excellence that the U.S. offers.
Vicki Johnstone, an exchange student from Scotland and a junior English major, sheds some light on her reasoning behind coming here. “I always wanted to do a study abroad but never knew exactly where…. I had been to America twice before on vacation and have always really liked America and all that it offers. I had hoped when I was growing up to be able to live some place like America and felt that going on an exchange to here would enable me to gain some experiences and see how life works here,” she said.
Tubtim Eawchoowongse, on the other hand, focuses on the quality of education she can gain by studying here. She is from Thailand and is a sophomore electrical and computer engineering and economics double major. She traveled here “because the U.S. offers a more flexible education. At Carnegie Mellon, for example, I could take classes outside my department and pursue other areas of my interest.”
Other students base their decision on the difference between the education system in their country and that in the U.S. Young Woong Park, an international student from South Korea and a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, explained in an e-mail that admission into South Korean universities is very difficult and is solely based on academic performance. “However, in the U.S., students are highly encouraged to develop their own interests by participating in club activities,” he went on to write. “Even if a student in the U.S. has a bad GPA or bad SAT scores, if he/she has interesting extra-curricular activities, he/she has a very good chance of getting into a good university. People might have different preferences about these two educational systems; however, I didn’t like the Korean educational system as it forces students to study, no matter what their aptitudes are.”
What’s different?
One of the most interesting things to note is how other countries differ from the U.S. Be it a variation in the units of measurement used or the side of the road on which vehicles are driven, many differences are noted by international students between the way things function in the U.S. as compared to their own countries.
Johnstone complained about the confusing and unhelpful nature of the banking system in the U.S. that constantly results in her getting overcharged with hidden fees. She also noticed that taxes aren’t added until the item is billed at the register. “I always think that I have the right amount and then go to the register to pay and they stick on another 7 percent….!”
Stefan Gutstadt, a junior business administration and French double major, comes to Pittsburgh from Johannesburg, South Africa. According to him, one of the most notable differences between South Africa and the U.S. is that while in the U.S., the predominant language is English, South Africa has 11 official languages. This makes communication in the U.S. much easier.
Gutstadt also thinks that South Africans are more politically active than Americans. “I feel that people back home take current events extremely seriously, and there are often public marches, rallies, or gatherings concerning pertinent issues,” he explained. “Once, I remember a national union stopped the traffic in Johannesburg for several hours during a government wage dispute.”
Park pointed out that the diversity that exists in the U.S. is not present in South Korea. “There is only one race in Korea, but in [the] U.S., there are many different kinds of races living together,” he wrote. “Also, [the] U.S. is much larger than Korea; we can go everywhere by a car in Korea but not in here.”
You say po-tay-to, I say po-tah-to
One of the main difficulties in transitioning into life in a new country is adjusting to the ever-present cultural differences. These differences may be small, like the usage or pronunciation of a word, or large, like the way people interact with each other in social situations.
Manasi Patil, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major and an international student from India feels that culturally, “the way [Indians] define friendship…, the way the weather does or doesn’t affect, the way [Indians] behave with our professors” are just some of the vast differences between Indian and American culture.
Johnstone feels that the major difference between American and Scottish culture is the use of words in different contexts. “I would say the main differences are to do with speech.... We’d say ‘bin’ instead of ‘trash can,’ ‘rubbish’ instead of ‘garbage,’ ‘petrol station’ instead of ‘gas station,’ ‘sweeties’ instead of ‘candy,’ ‘juice’ instead of ‘pop,’ ‘plaster’ instead of ‘Band-aid,’ ‘crisps’ instead of ‘potato chips,’ and ‘chips’ instead of ‘French fries’” she said. “It can get a little confusing!”
In countries like South Korea, China, and Thailand, on the other hand, the cultural differences extend beyond just everyday speech. In these countries, behavior in social situations differs remarkably. It’s important to note these differences so you don’t make a faux pas when you visit.
“Body language,” Christine Lee, a senior economics and philosophy double major, immediately identified a cultural difference between China and the U.S. She emphasized that while people in the U.S. find it normal to hug while greeting guests, this is not the norm in China. Excessive touching is not typical, and people prefer handshakes instead.
The code of conduct in classrooms in South Korea is slightly different. “The first thing I was surprised about when I came to the U.S. was when I attended classes, students crossed their legs and put their legs on other chairs in front of professors, which is viewed as rude in Korea,” Park wrote. In order to be respectful, Koreans maintain decorum in front of elders.
Eawchoowongse seconds this difference in behavior toward older people. “Thai people tend to be more polite and reserved. They also tend to be respectful to elders and would not make fun or tease them unless they are really close,” she said. “Whereas I found that in the U.S.,... a sense of humor is always a bonus, and the best way to connect with others is to approach them actively with a smile.”
Looking more closely at the differences in ways of living, Gutstadt emphasized that “South Africans … tend to have a more relaxed outlook on life.… Several of my friends working in Cape Town have a strict ‘rad waves’ policy to stop work and go surfing if the sea and sun are right.”
Overall, studying abroad is a great opportunity for students to get out of their comfort zone and experience something they have never seen or heard of before. All the students mentioned above affirm that life at Carnegie Mellon has been interesting and exciting, and all the initial adjustments, whether it’s language or weather, are short-lived. So, take a chance and discover another country..

2009-04-13,CMU,China,"Last Thursday, the School of Art was visited by Da Xiong Guo, the world-famous Chinese comic artist who was freed from imprisonment last year. In 2008, the Chinese Communist Party arrested Guo because they found his artwork offensive. 
Guo’s work has the power to summon nationalistic pride and mystery — and when his work strayed from iconic Chinese idols to present-day figures of the oppressive Chinese government and the proletariat, he was tortured for his free speech and liberal notions. After two arduous months of waiting, Guo’s friends in China and the U.S. finally came to his rescue. Guo now lives in New York City with his wife. 
As soon as he walked into the art studio, Guo immediately appealed to his fellow artists. He picked up a piece of chalk and asked one of the students to draw an apple. As a way of explanation, he said that when he was three years old, his father had asked him to draw an apple. 
Guo said he didn’t want to draw the apple, so his father drew one and asked Guo to copy it. Guo drew the same apple, but added a few more truthful embellishments that his father’s less artful eye overlooked. Guo fell in love with art, and since that moment has always sought to truthfully and magically represent the world around him.  
After graduating with a degree in commercial design from the Jilin Art Institute in China, Guo began working as a reporter because he feared that the arts would not support him financially. 
He soon quit journalism, though, finding he could never report the truth and was often misguided by a repressive Communist agenda. In 1999, Guo worked as a chief illustrator for his own studio, Qicartoon Studios. In 2000, he was awarded first place in the prestigious Shanghai Animation and Comic Competition for his comic series called “Chinese Ghost Stories.” 
This comic represented a traditional Chinese legend in an exciting and new comic aesthetic. The work was a hit with all age groups. Guo’s work carries a certain geist, or spirit of the people, and he has published over 100 titles, which have been distributed in China, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, and the U.S.
Despite his international success, Da Xiong expressed that he wasn’t clear about what the American comics market really wants. He spoke about the heroes in American comics — Superman and Batman — and how these characters celebrate the American protagonist: a “manifest destiny” go-getter with an aim to protect the public. 
However, they’re not rooted in much of a reality. America may have its heroes — John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, Thomas Jefferson — however, these characters hardly resemble the emperors of China.
American culture dominates the world and infects other nations with popular items like McDonald’s and Mickey Mouse. However, American culture is still new. Chinese culture, on the other hand, is thousands of years old, and its heroes have the added benefit of being able to represent the Chinese at large. Its history is closely intermingled with mythology. Guo’s work calls upon the mythical and iconographic national identity of China. Using the contemporary language of comics, Guo has invited the Chinese youth to rediscover their rich identity and past. 
Guo illustrated the Chinese emperors in Chinese Classics - 36 Tactics, and in another series, he represented Chinese philosophers. Each character represents a certain personality and serves as a parable for contemporary audiences. In a nation artistically and politically stripped, Guo’s works provide a didactic metaphor for each and every citizen..

2009-04-13,CMU,China,"In an effort to address rising levels of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, Congress has recently introduced the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 to try to promote the development of green technology and a decreased dependence on fossil fuels.
Jim Hansen, the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, argues that one of the major problems associated with global warming and climate change is the possibility of significant rises in sea levels. In an article in The New York Review of Books, Hansen points out that a study of the connections between temperature and sea levels can be obtained from a look at the Earth’s history. He observes that the last time the Earth’s temperature was five degrees higher than temperatures seen today “was three million years ago, when the sea level was about 80 feet higher.” If a similar temperature increase and sea level rise were to be experienced, many East Coast cities, including Boston, New York, and Washington, would be underwater, and the homes of almost 50 million U.S. citizens would be destroyed.
In order to halt the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the bill proposes that a cap and trade system be implemented on carbon dioxide emissions. This method, which proved successful in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions in the early 1990s, consists of setting a limit to the quantity of emissions from a particular group of industries.
The allowed amount of emissions is then divided up into individual permits, which are distributed to each company. Each permit gives the holder the right to emit a certain amount of the pollutant. The companies can then buy and sell the permits as needed to maintain their business. 
Ultimately, those companies that can reduce their emissions most efficiently will benefit financially. This plan allows the market to drive environmental improvement and gives companies flexibility in the manner in which they reduce their emissions.
According to Ed Perry, the global warming coordinator with the National Wildlife Federation, this plan will allow for further development of wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources. Perry stated that “the technology for these green energy sources is there, but a level playing field is not.” By making industries pay for their pollutants, there is more of an economic incentive to pursue alternative energy sources and the “playing field” is effectively leveled.
The cap on carbon dioxide emissions is complemented by a requirement set on utility companies to generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by year 2025 and the creation of an infrastructure that  will aid the transition to green technology and the creation of green jobs. 
The legislation also takes into account the strong competition between U.S.-based companies and overseas corporations by allocating money for rebates to U.S. companies facing the increased energy prices associated with this cap on carbon.
In the long run, however, Perry commented that the development of green technology in the U.S. is essential if the country is to stay competitive in energy production.
“China, Japan, and Germany are currently the top three solar energy producers,” he said. “We may very well find ourselves relying on the products of other countries for energy sources if we do not start focusing more on research into alternatives to fossil fuels.”
The cap and trade method is not foolproof, however, as pointed out by Emily Bayer, a sophomore civil and environmental and biomedical engineering double major. 
She commented that “cap and trade programs are typically difficult to regulate, and often businesses will generate exceptions to get past new regulations.” Bayer also made the point that many larger companies will “trade to obtain as many permits as possible and go on with business as usual, forcing other companies who don’t have the same resources or leverage to bear the brunt of the regulations.”
These potential problems have not gone unrecognized, and this Thursday, April 16, business, labor, and environmental leaders including Fred Redmond, the international vice president of United Steelworkers; Larry Schweiger, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation; and Congressman Jason Altmire will be meeting to discuss solutions to the current energy, environmental, and economic crises. 
The meeting will take place on  the Carnegie Mellon campus in Porter Hall 100 at 7 p.m. Everyone is encouraged to attend; as Perry stated, “Current college students are among those who will be the ones to see and live with the effects of today’s decisions about the environment.”.

2009-04-20,CMU,China,"According to the practice of Ohio Wesleyan University, literally trashing, as in throwing away, the independently run campus newspaper is acceptable if the administration believes the paper’s content reflects poorly on the school’s image. Doesn’t that sound like censorship? We certainly think so. 
So maybe this isn’t as serious as Hitler’s propaganda during World War II and the regulation and censorship of almost all the media that streams throughout China and North Korea, but these actions are still unacceptable.
The Transcript, Ohio Wesleyan’s campus newspaper, ran an article detailing a campus tradition of students counting down the days to graduation with two drinks a day at a local bar. Due to a picture of a beer bottle that was featured on the front page, staffmembers of the admissions office saw fit to trash hundreds of copies of the paper before the campus was showcased to prospective students, parents, and families. 
Censorship is never the correct choice of action for the administration or the paper. Though the paper may have portrayed the students of the university in a less-than-flattering light, the fact of the matter is that the story was true.
It is no secret that college students, especially seniors as they near graduation day, drink, and trying to hide this only misinforms the prospective students and their parents and is not beneficial to anyone. Throwing away and censoring the newspaper will not change the reality that students drink.
As a paper with no qualms about printing unbiased and sometimes critical articles about Carnegie Mellon, we appreciate the respect our administration has shown in never trashing (literally or figuratively) our issues. Even when we print controversial pieces, we do so with the intention of informing our public about what we think is newsworthy, what we think it is our duty to report.
We give Ohio Wesleyan’s administration a [censor] finger..

2009-04-27,CMU,China,"Crêpes Parisiennes is not a restaurant, nor it is a café or a bistro: It is a crêperie. 
With one crêperie in Shadyside and another one close to Carnegie Mellon on Craig Street, Crêpes Parisiennes serves up crêpes, paninis, espresso, French tea, and pastries to the local community, and Carnegie Mellon students are regular customers at both locations.
But what is not common knowledge is that the start of this crêperie is actually closer to Carnegie Mellon than its Craig Street location. 
David Handler, the co-owner of Crêpes Parisiennes, discovered his love for crêpes soon after he graduated from high school. In the late 1980s, he spent a semester in the American University at Paris, and while he was there, he noticed that crêpes were on menus everywhere, but there was no place that sold crêpes in Pittsburgh. 
Later, after working as a photographer around Europe, including five years in Paris’s fashion industry, Handler moved back to the United States and started Crêpes Parisiennes. In 1998, Handler, along with his wife Shannon Reilly, moved back to Pittsburgh and started to sell crêpes from a cart on Margaret Morrison Street, between Posner Hall and Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. 
Handler bought his first crêpe iron with the support of Reilly, who was his girlfriend then. It was right here at Carnegie Mellon that Handler first started making fresh crêpes from the cart and endured the outdoor Pittsburgh weather through its various moods.
Handler said that “through rain, sleet, snow, I was out there with my umbrella making crêpes. It was like camping every day.” Selling French crêpes seemed to be the right thing to do at that time, and the international community at Carnegie Mellon welcomed Handler’s crêpes. Later, in 2000, Handler was able to expand his business from a camping crêperie to a more permanent settlement. He bought a coffee shop that was going out of business on Filbert Street, right off Walnut Street, in Shadyside.
There, Handler worked hard to modify the coffee shop into a charming crêperie. He was even down on the ground fixing the floor. As the crêperie was being furnished, Handler guarded the crêpe iron in the Shadyside creperie while Reilly left her job as a cancer researcher to camp out at the crêperie cart on Margaret Morrison Street. Later, they closed down the cart and began to work full-time at the Shadyside location.
With the support of the Pittsburgh community, Crêpes Parisiennes opened a new location, the now-familiar haunt on Craig Street, in 2006. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without [Carnegie Mellon]. They recognized that I was doing something. [Carnegie Mellon] faculty, students, and staff supported me and turned my dream into my reality,” Handler said. So, when he was looking for a new location, Handler considered the building on Craig Street due to its proximity to the Carnegie Mellon campus. Crêpes Parisiennes was coming closer to Carnegie Mellon, the place where Handler first started selling his crêpes. At the Craig Street location, Crêpes Parisiennes added paninis and fresh baked goods to its menu, but the star of the show is still the crêpe. 
Crêpes Parisiennes serves a wide variety of crêpes, ranging from savory ones like smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème frâiche ($7.75), to dessert crêpes like the sweet maple syrup crêpe ($4.25). Every crêpe is made from the same batter, consisting of a mix of white and buckwheat flour. Handler uses the American ploy of mixing white and buckwheat flour, a method different from the one used in Paris, where white flour is normally used for savory crêpes and buckwheat flour for sweet ones. 
Because of his love for crêpes, Handler makes sure he uses quality ingredients, and respects the integrity of each ingredient. The white flour is from a Minnesotan family-owned farm that has been growing wheat and milling flour for over 150 years, and the buckwheat flour is from an organic farm in Pennsylvania. At Crêpes Parisiennes, the crêpe batter not only carries a delicious, clean flavor, but also comes with a history.
At the top of the best-seller list of sweet crêpes is the crêpe with Nutella, ($4.75, or  $1 more to add banana). Because of this, it is no surprise that there is an entire wall of Nutella stacked up along the bar at the Shadyside crêperie. Customers can also pick a crêpe with plain chocolate, but this brings up the hard decision of picking between dark French chocolate with 64 percent cacao or Belgian white chocolate. Handler uses chocolate coins directly from the package, as he wants to let the richness of his high-quality, and hard-to-find, ingredients show through. The low heat from the crêpe iron melts the delectable chocolate as the crêpe is made, and there is no added cream or butter to distract the customer’s taste buds from the goodness of the chocolate.
To cut the sweetness of the dessert crêpe, customers can add berries to any of the establishment’s sweet selections for just $1.25, and with summer around the corner, strawberry,the establishment’s blueberry, and apricot preserves ($4.25), are also available as add-ons. Handler imports these gem-colored preserves from Austria and proudly asserts that there is no added corn syrup in any of the fruit preserves, as corn syrup tends to disturb the natural taste and consistency that each fruit bears. 
On the savory side, smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème frâiche is among the top sellers. The smokiness of the blushed Icelandic salmon, as well as its ocean taste, is highlighted by the bark-colored crêpe. Savory crêpes can be paired up with a choice of savory sauce: soytang, béchamel (a white sauce made by adding milk to roux, a mixture of flour and butter), crème frâiche (a sour cream), or garlic olive oil. All the savory crêpes come with a small garden salad along with mandarin oranges and homemade champagne vinaigrette.
Handler personally prefers champagne vinegar to red wine or balsamic vinegar. 
“I like [the salad dressing] a little bit tart, a little bit acidic, and that is good for your digestion too,” he said. The champagne vinegar used at Crêpes Parisiennes, Handler said, is vinegar from the city of Reims, a city in the northeastern Champagne-Ardenne region of France. On the other hand, the term champagne normally refers to the sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France, locally within the Champagne-Ardenne region.
“The champagne vinaigrette came on the first day we opened up in Shadyside,” Handler said. The same vinaigrette is mixed every day, and the touch of sectioned oranges in the salad adds a fresh, sweet flavor to the bitter of the green leaves. This green salad is a little mid-summer garden to be enjoyed all year long.
Reilly adds her touch to the menu, too, with her homemade scones. Reilly, who normally flips crêpes at the Craig Street crêperie, bakes these scones that are meant to be eaten with tea, and as luck will have it, Crêpes Parisiennes imports a special type of tea, Mariage Frères, that is adored by tea lovers.
Mariage Frères is considered by many avid tea drinkers to be the best teahouse in the world, consistently producing high-quality French tea. As told by the Mariage Frères website, the history of Mariage Frères can be traced back to 1660 when King Louis XIV of France and the French India Company commissioned Nicolas Mariage to sign a trading agreement with the Shah of Persia. Since then, the family traded spice, tea, and other colonial goods from the East to Europe. Later, in 1845, the Mariage family set up the Mariage Frères Tea Company, trading as far as China and Sri Lanka. 
At first glance, what is the most noticeable is that the Mariage Frères tea bag is made out of muslin cloth and not paper. This is mainly because paper leaves a distinct papery taste. While other varieties of tea have sharper fragrances and tend to taste more acidic, Mariage Frères tea has a soft, velvety aroma and a true tea flavor. At Crêpes Parisiennes, a cup of French tea will set you back $2.00.
Apart from French tea, Crêpes Parisiennes also brews café au lait, a French espresso with steamed milk and light froth for $2.50. Chocolat chaud, a rich and dark form of hot chocolate, is available for coffee abstainers. Handler proudly announces that their hot chocolate was voted the best in the city. 
“There’s no syrup. We melt chocolate. We put cocoa and melted chocolate and milk and, you know, secret stuff,” he said. 
Because of the proximity of the Craig Street location to the Carnegie Mellon campus, Handler sees a very mixed crowd at his crêperie. “It’s like the UN in here sometimes....” he said. “I appreciate the nationalities.” Here at Crêpes Parisiennes, French food takes on an American twist, plays with Dutch chocolate, and is adorned with Austrian fruit preserves. 
Next time you step into Crêpes Parisiennes to savor a crêpe, take a moment to remember the journey that the meal has been through before it is set down in its final form; warm on your plate..

2009-08-15,CMU,China,"“Mai wan le! Mai wan le!” A Chinese woman hustled down the lengthy queue in front of a tiny but famous dumpling shop, known for serving up the best xiaolongbao — pork-filled dumplings that are Shanghai’s specialty — in the city. My friend Julia and I had been waiting with much anticipation but were filled with disappointment as we registered her words: The shop was sold out. The woman was handing out paper bowls to the people ahead of us, counting out the number of servings that could still be made, but as luck would have it, the last two bowls were handed to the man right in front of us.
Julia and I didn’t move. We had come a long way in an expensive taxi to Yu Yuan to taste these xiaolongbao — and now we just stared at each other, wondering what to do. Meanwhile, the man in front of us was motioning to a woman standing nearby — I assume she was his wife or girlfriend — waving his second bowl in the air and asking her if she wanted some. To our delight, she shook her head and the man then turned toward us and offered us the bowl, which we excitedly accepted and took several pictures to commemorate
the moment.
Since we were displaying quite openly that we were not native to Shanghai, our generous friend tried striking up a conversation and asked us where we were from. Now, although I have been learning Mandarin for the past two years, speaking it in a classroom and speaking it in China are two radically different situations. The Chinese don’t need to be patient with me, nor do they need to enunciate the four different tones in the language so that I don’t get
confused. They also don’t use the simple textbook sentences that I was used to. But, barring all these differences, my weeks spent in Shanghai had resulted in a drastic change in my understanding of the language. I was now familiar with making general conversation and since this entailed talking about where I was from, I was easily able to answer the question. The conversation tapered off and came to a definite end when it was finally our turn to receive a bowl of hot, steamed dumplings that Julia doused in vinegar. We grabbed
a spot on a bench by the lit-up courtyard and had our first taste of Shanghai’s xiaolongbao. It was excellent.
My trip to Shanghai was filled with many such firsts. It was the first time I was living in a country whose native language I was not fluent in, and the reality of this situation struck me the moment I stepped off the airplane at Shanghai’s Pudong airport. I was there for a four-week program to further my education in Mandarin thanks to a collaborated effort between Carnegie Mellon and Shanghai International Studies University. I had been warned by my professor at Carnegie Mellon that not many people spoke English in Shanghai, so I came completely prepared. I brushed up my Chinese and memorized the exact way to say Shanghai International Studies University Guesthouse to the taxi driver — I had been warned that if I said it wrong, he would take me to a completely different location. But as soon as the taxi driver asked me, “Nali?,” I was overcome by a fit of nervousness and mispronounced one of the words. I had to sheepishly hand him the written address to make sure he understood. 
Shanghai, which literally means “on the sea,” lies on the coast of China and is one of the most developed cities in the country. It has a fantastic skyline dotted with towering skyscrapers that light up in brilliant colors at night — not unlike New York City. Unfortunately, due to the large amount of pollution in Shanghai, the sky remains overcast with smog very often and seeing a blue sky is a rare occurrence. Not all of Shanghai is as well developed as the commercial areas, however. The city can be quite hot, dusty, and dirty.
While in the city, I often felt like I was an animal in a zoo. The Chinese stared at me like they had never seen an Indian before. Many of them chattered about me in Chinese while I smiled to myself, too afraid to call them out. Others tried to speak with me, and were quite delighted when I replied to them in Chinese. My American classmates drew crowds too. Their seemingly unnatural height and golden hair caused passersby to even bizarrely click photos of them.
While life in China took some getting adjusted to, one of the biggest adjustments I had to make was regarding food. I am a vegetarian, but that concept is pretty alien to the Chinese. The closest word I could find to describe my dietary restrictions conveyed that I could eat vegetables and fish, so most of the time I would just end up translating “No meat, no fish!” Even though I am a vegetarian, I decided to taste some Chinese delicacies and got a chance to try Shanghai’s xiaolongbao, Beijing’s Peking duck, and a famous pork dish in Suzhou. Sadly, not every experiment was very satisfactory. 
Towards the end of my trip, I actually started to think in Chinese. In one of my conversations with my mother, she asked me for a telephone number and for several seconds I couldn’t think of how to say the numbers in English. It is my dream to be fluent in Mandarin one day, and as I have experienced that the best way to learn a language is to surround yourself with it, I plan on making a trip back to China very soon..

The World Health Organization declared that a new severe form of swine flu is infecting healthy, young people and is attacking the lungs directly. Several countries are reporting that nearly 15 percent of the patients affected by swine flu need intensive care.
This new form of the H1N1 virus is far more severe than the seasonal influenza virus and can cause respiratory failure. Unlike previous cases, young and healthy people are getting infected by this virus and require extra, specialized care that can prove to be very expensive. WHO is warning countries in the northern hemisphere to be prepared for a second round of the pandemic and it also believes that the number of swine flu cases in tropical countries will soon increase.

Imaging exposes many to radiation
According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, at least four million Americans below 65 years of age are exposed to high levels of radiation because of medical imaging tests each year. Around 400,000 of these patients receive doses of radiation that are higher than the permitted radiation levels for nuclear power plant workers or others working with radioactive materials.
Such imaging tests are generally prescribed by doctors to check for the accumulation of plaque in the blood and to check how well the heart pumps blood. The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that the number of patients undergoing CT scans has increased four times over the period of 10 years from 1995 to 2005. In light of these new findings, doctors believe that soon there will be many more cases of cancer in the country.

West Nile virus migrates to Europe
Scientists have discovered the harmful West Nile virus for the first time in mosquitoes in Switzerland. Aedes japonicus has colonized an area of 540 square miles in central Switzerland. The mosquito was previously found in Japan, Korea, China, North America, France, and Belgium. However, this is the first time that the mosquito has been found in Switzerland.
The mosquito is capable of transmitting Japanese encephalitis and the West Nile virus, both of which can cause serious harm to humans and are potentially fatal. Last year, the West Nile virus killed 44 people in the United States alone.

A total of 557 people have died because of swine flu in Brazil. This is the highest number of deaths recorded anywhere in the world. Nearly 1800 people have died across the world because of the disease and 522 have died in the United States.
As of now, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and the United States have the most cases of swine flu. Argentina has the highest swine flu mortality rate — which is calculated by considering the total population of the country and the number of deaths — while Brazil has the seventh highest and the United States the 13th highest.

2009-09-21,CMU,China,"As G20 fervor spreads to campus, the Carnegie Mellon community will have the opportunity to hear Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd give a special keynote address, followed by a panel discussion of policy experts. The prime minister’s address is scheduled to take place on Thursday in Rangos Hall in the University Center at 5 p.m. Doors open at 4 p.m. to allow guests to be seated.
Rudd is the 26th prime minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and the occupant of the country’s most powerful office. He also heads the center-left Australian Labor Party on a federal level. After joining the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1981, Rudd pursued his career in foreign service at posts in the Australian embassies in Stockholm, Sweden and in Beijing, China. Throughout his political career, Rudd has been on the forefront of educational reforms, particularly those advocating the importance of teaching foreign languages in Australian schools.
Rudd is a strong proponent of policies related to climate change and aims for Australia to demonstrate international leadership in this field, according to the climate change plan he describes in a video clip on his personal website. As stated in The Australian, the prime minister has also established a commission for nuclear non-proliferation. He looks toward the G20 as a major international summit for “multilateral engagement,” as stated in the article.
Before flying into Pittsburgh for the G20 conference, Rudd will attend the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
The address is expected to strengthen Carnegie Mellon’s reputation as an international university, as the Carnegie Mellon satellite campus in Adelaide, Australia houses programs in the university’s Heinz College. An effort that began almost four years ago, the Australian campus serves as the university’s Asia Pacific education base. It currently offers two master’s degrees — the master of science in public policy and management and the master of science in information technology.
As with the speeches of President Barack Obama and former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam given at Carnegie Mellon in the past, Rudd’s speech is aimed at enriching the campus community’s experience of hearing a head of state talk about international affairs and policies.
The event is sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, the Pittsburgh Technology Council, and the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, along with the H. John Heinz III College, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon Economics Society, and the International Relations and Politics Program..

In recent decades, economic restructuring has radically reduced demand for low-skilled manual labor, and mass unemployment has become a durable, structural feature of South African society. 
Ferguson suggested that the South African experience reveals, in an extreme and clarifying form, a set of processes that are occurring in many other parts of the world and that better understanding of such processes may help us to find our way past some of the current impasses in progressive politics.

This group of 20, or G20 Summit, ran over two days, with dignitaries arriving Thursday for a working dinner hosted by President Obama at Phipps Conservatory. The Summit itself was held on Friday at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center downtown. It began at 9:30 a.m. and concluded with press conferences given by leaders from various countries at around 5 p.m., with Obama’s conference kicking off the string of meetings to follow.
Before discussing the results of the Summit, which focus on stabilizing the market and preventing another economic crisis like the one of fall 2008, Obama stressed the importance of nations’ working together to solve problems and thanked the people and the city of Pittsburgh for hosting the summit.
Many of the leaders, he said, were “so impressed with the revitalization of city” since their last visits, reinforcing Obama’s choice to hold the Summit in Pittsburgh. Another signature Pittsburgh feature the leaders were impressed by was a breakfast food.
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ate breakfast at Pamela’s in Millvale and was very pleased with the pancakes he was served.
“I’m a little resentful that I didn’t get to Pamela’s for pancakes,” Obama joked.
Despite the lighthearted comments, Obama soon explained the results of the conference, and the four main points that the delegation agreed upon.
First, he said, was sustaining recovery plans until economic growth is restored not just for the upper classes and businesses, but also for the working and middle class families who need to be able to pay their bills. “We can’t tolerate the same old boom and bust economy of the past,” he said.
To achieve this, he said, it was important to implement “tough, new financial regulations.” More transparency in business is a key element of this point. “Those who abuse the system must be held responsible,” he emphasized.
A second point of the plan ties executive pay to long-term performance rather than short-term.
The third element is to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, which will increase our energy security and decrease the “threat posed by climate change.”
The fourth point builds on Obama’s earlier remarks about nations working together and reforms the system of global economic cooperation and governance. This means that rather than only including already-powerful industrial nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin to include emerging economies as well, and a new World Bank Trust Fund will be established.
“The nations of the world share mutual interests,” he said, and stressed that they should “act on behalf of shared prosperity.”
The cooperation on which Obama spoke Friday has been seen already in the response to Iran’s nuclear facilities. Intelligence agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France each investigated whether Iran’s statements about their facilities were truthful or whether they were in violation of international laws. After they confirmed the violation, other countries, including China and Russia, joined these countries in condemning Iran’s actions.
Leaders from these countries will be meeting with Iran on Oct. 1 to try to solve the problem diplomatically, but Obama said that he would not rule out any options or possibilities for further action. “Iran is on notice. They are going to have to come clean and make a choice,” he said. The first path leads to peace, and the second to confrontation.
While these things were occurring on the international political fronts, protesters gathered outside, surrounded by swarms of police dressed in riot gear.
All week, demonstrators have gathered to protest various causes, ranging from the war to capitalism to the G20 itself. Some protesters, like those desiring to free Tibet and the oppressed Chinese religious group Falun Gong, were peaceful, but other protests became riotous and violent.
Obama was not concerned about the riots. “It’s important to keep things in perspective,” he said. “In London, there were hundreds of thousands on the streets [as compared with the just over 5000 reported to be outside of the Convention Center]. Pittsburgh deserves credit for managing a very tranquil G20 Summit.”
While the Summit may have been “tranquil” compared to other Summits, the protesters certainly caused a stir in the city. 
Throughout the course of the week, nearly 20 businesses were damaged, reportedly by the same protesters from California, and over 100 people were arrested for refusal to disperse.
In Oakland last Thursday, students gathered to protest, and police broke up the group with the use of OC gas, which is slightly different from tear gas, as it is a different chemical compound more similar to pepper spray. To revolt against police actions, students gathered again Friday and were met with equally strong riot dispersal tactics.
Twitter updates and YouTube videos gave the world a close-up look at the police actions and protests happening in the city.
Two students from Carnegie Mellon created a website that compiled the most recent videos and Tweets relating to the G20. Haris Krijestorac and Manolis Kounelakis, master’s students in information systems management, originally did not intend for their website, www.exponentialweb.com, to focus on G20. “We both have many theories and ideas about where the social web is taking the world, and we wanted to share our youthful yet academic perspective with the world,” Krijestorac stated in an e-mail.
The site was created Sept. 20, and by Sept. 24, the first day of the Summit, Krijestorac and Kounelakis began posting live updates from social websites, allowing people to follow what was going on in real time.
“We hope that ExponentialWeb will not only give us the outlet to report social web news and express our opinions on the subject, but inspire others to engage in it,” Krijestorac wrote.
This website, as well as the original sites from which the material was taken, engaged many in the events of the weekend, supplementing traditional news sources with information straight from the participants.
Whether through protests, art, or social websites, very few people managed to avoid participating in one way or another in this event..

2009-10-12,CMU,China,"Last Wednesday, a group of people gathered in the front of Margaret’s Fine Imports in Squirrel Hill — young and old, male and female, tea connoisseurs, and newcomers to the art of brewing the world’s second-most consumed beverage — to learn about tea from a master. At 7 p.m., Margaret Harris, the owner of the shop, stood behind the register, which served as a teacher’s desk, in an apron bearing the phrase: “Many have eaten here; few have died,” and began class.
Harris’ own story is as unique and vivid as the tea that she sells. Harris left her homeland, Poland, in 1985, while it was still under Communist rule. In Poland, Harris had a medical degree and was a registered nurse, but since her arrival in North America, she has opened a number of craft, candle, and — most recently — tea stores. Harris has been in the tea business for seven years and has taught others about tea for three years. By the end of October, she plans to offer gourmet deli meats and cheeses in her store as well, with some products coming all the way from Hungary and Poland. Because of her history in medicine, Harris has an extensive knowledge about the health benefits of each tea, which she includes in her classes.
Types of tea
The lecture began with introductions, and everyone voiced their favorite type of tea. Preferences ranged from Earl Grey — Harris’ favorite — to chai, and Harris’ informational lecture mentioned them all.
There are four types of tea: white, green, oolong, and black. Green tea is made solely of tea leaves, and since tea has eight to 10 times more antioxidants than any other plant, green tea is extremely good for one’s health. Green tea leaves undergo very little oxidation — the process that causes autumn leaves to turn dry and brittle after they have fallen. White tea is a form of green tea, but it is made up of only the buds and first leaves of the plant. Oolong is a traditionally Chinese or Taiwanese tea, and there are many kinds of it with various levels of oxidation. Black tea is a common Western tea that undergoes the most oxidation among the types of tea.
A type of tea that doesn’t contain parts of the tea plant is a tisane. Tisane is an herbal tea that originates from both China and the Middle East. It can be made from dried flowers, like chamomile, or seeds and roots. Another type of herbal tea is rooibos tea, which is made from a red tea bush in Africa.
Making the perfect cup of tea
During class, Harris also outlined the steps in making a good cup of tea:
Step one involves choosing a tea leaf. Leaves are always better and more natural than the ground up contents of tea bags.
Step two concerns the tea water. Tap water or filtered water is fine for tea brewing, but distilled water is definitely not. Using distilled water will cause tea to taste flat.
Step three is about temperature. For regular tea, steep at 210°C, and for green tea, at 180–185°C. All tisanes should be steeped in boiling water.
Step four is all about the timing. Black tea should be steeped for three to four minutes, while green tea should be steeped for only two.
Tracing the roots of tea
Harris also briefly described the history of tea. Most tea comes from the tea bush plant, or Camellia sinesis. One legend says that Emperor Shen Nung of China was resting in his garden one afternoon when a sudden gust of wind blew several leaves from a tree into a pot of hot water nearby. When the emperor drank the resulting mixture out of curiosity, he found that he enjoyed the drink.
Tea was first brought to England by the Portuguese, although the Dutch were also major distributors. Contrary to popular belief, tea did not become popular in England until the 18th century, when Queen Anne chose tea over beer for her breakfast — yes, downing a beer for breakfast was actually common back then. Another common misconception is that “high tea” refers to the famous British tea served in the afternoon with delicious cakes and sweets. Actually, the correct name for this famous tea, understandably enough, is “afternoon tea,” and it was invented by the Duchess of Bedford, who thought that the gap between lunch and dinner was unbearably long. High tea refers to the tea that workers would take with their dinner at the end of the day, at their “high” dinner table — as opposed to the low tea tables of that time.
A cup a day keeps the doctor away
Tea has a special importance in Harris’ life. “I think I had my first cup of tea when I was one day old. It was probably fennel tea, which they give to babies to relieve colic,” she revealed to her audience at the beginning of class. Tea has been scientifically proven to be an anti-bacterial substance and contains fluoride, so it is actually good for your teeth. Women who drink tea often have a higher bone density, and tea also speeds up the metabolic process: Oolong tea increases the speed of metabolism by 10 percent, so it actually helps people lose weight. 
But aside from health benefits, Harris sees tea as a way of creating friendships and understanding other cultures. “Knowing tea helps you to know people,” she told her class as she poured out samples at the end of class, including oolong and red tea brewed to perfection.
Through her class, Harris explained how tea influences many fields: geography, history, politics, medicine, and especially friendship. Her store, as well as her life, are testaments to this statement.

2009-10-26,CMU,China,"NASA to launch rocket on Tuesday
NASA will soon be launching a prototype of its newly designed next-generation rocket, called Ares I. The launch of this prototype will occur at 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 27 at the Kennedy Space Center. 
The first stage of the capsule will be launched on Tuesday, and this prototype also has a fake second stage capsule and crew capsule attached on top of the first stage.
Ares I was designed to replace NASA’s old fleet of space shuttles that carry astronauts to low-Earth orbit (an orbit close to Earth). 
This flight marks NASA’s first test launch for a crew-carrying rocket since 1981. However, whether Ares I will eventually replace the old fleet depends upon a pending decision by the Obama administration based on the review of a study on U.S. human space plans. 
The study claims that NASA should focus on creating a heavy-lift rocket that could take humans to areas farther in the solar system, like the moon or Mars.

Electric shock helps deliver AIDS vaccine
Researchers claim that giving brief electric shocks while administering certain experimental AIDS vaccines can cause the vaccines to be more effective. The device being used for this technique resembles a handgun and is able to give three brief electric shocks while injecting the vaccine. The electric shocks cause the cell membranes to open up briefly, allowing better absorption of the vaccine.
Scientists claim that the technique, called electroporation, will be especially useful while using vaccines made up of the pathogen’s own genetic material. Once this genetic material is injected into the cell, it can elicit an immune response in the body, thus preparing the body for future attacks by the same pathogen. In the study, a vaccine made up of four genes from an AIDS virus found in China was administered to groups of subjects, some with and some without the electric shocks. None of the subjects given the vaccine without the shock had an immune response, while all those given high doses of the shock along with the vaccine had an immune response.

Scientists find neurons that code time
A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has discovered neurons that keep track of time in primates. The team trained two macaque monkeys to perform some tasks involving eye movement. During the course of the task, the scientists discovered that a certain set of neurons fired at specific intervals after the task was started. 
The researchers concluded that these neurons were coding the time during the task. These findings were published in last week’s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
This research could be especially beneficial for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Such patients appear to have impaired time-keeping functions, as time passes more slowly for them and they have difficulty performing activities that require rhythmic coordination, like dancing.

2009-10-26,CMU,China,"Fareed Zakaria, CNN host and editor of Newsweek International, opened the Pittsburgh Middle East Institute’s second annual conference last Wednesday at the Carnegie Music Hall.
A leading analyst of international relations, geopolitics, and the global economy, Zakaria discussed the growing significance of the Middle East on the international political stage. According to Zakaria, the real solution to the Middle East crisis lies within the changing socioeconomic fabric of the region itself. “The desire to combine modernity with authenticity is the real solution to the extremity and regress in the Middle East,” Zakaria said.
Former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill introduced Zakaria as a “master at getting knowledgeable people to discuss important issues,” referring to his talk show, Fareed Zakaria GPS, a weekly CNN production on public affairs.
Zakaria dismissed the idea that capitalism faces a bleak future as a force in the world economy. “A year ago, people predicted the downfall of capitalism and a complete transformation of the world stage — as of today, well, looks pretty much the same to me,” he said.
Zakaria explained that the ordinary citizen’s fears of the economic crisis are analogous to those provoked by the swine flu epidemic. “The nature of the problem is indeed dangerous, but the government is effectively responding,” Zakaria said.
Similarly, he suggested that despite the Wall Street collapse, the government, the businesses, and the people responded to the crisis, which in turn is helping the economy swing back into shape.
Tapping into Middle Eastern affairs — his specialty — Zakaria proposed a robust capitalist solution to the woes of the region. He also discussed the decreasing impact of Islamic fundamentalism on the Muslim population, and how a shift toward a more capitalist culture in the broader Middle East can further help uproot the desire to follow an extremist agenda.
The Middle East spans southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe, and northeastern Africa, with many oil-rich monarchies — such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar — located in and around the Persian Gulf. 
The wealthy monarchies, Zakaria suggests, represent the future of the Middle East as they continue to modernize in a slow organic manner instead of booming into brutal dictatorships.
The United States fears Islamic fundamentalism without noticing that its lure in the Middle East is gradually diminishing, Zakaria said. The Middle East is awakening to the dangers of “jihad” as Muslims begin to see the futility of violence as a political tool.
“Violence is a lost political argument — Osama bin Laden can instigate terrorism but not get 5000 people out on the streets to demand his ideal Islamic society,” he said.
Along with a greater sense of awareness, the embrace of modernization is at the heart of societal progress in the Middle East, Zakaria said.
He cited Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the booming metropolitan center of the Arabian Gulf, as symbolic of the new Middle East. Along with Dubai’s strong command of commerce, its robust government, global managerial standards, and lack of corruption demonstrate the ability of countries in the Arab world to climb the socioeconomic ladder even as they hold tightly onto their religious and cultural backgrounds. “Dubai is an example of how the Arab world can have diversity and manage it well,” said Zakaria.
“The power of capitalism, trade, and modernity do not negate the forces of religion, but of religious extremity,” said Zakaria, “and the acknowledgment and understanding of this idea is the real solution to the Middle East crisis.”
During an interactive Q&A session, Zakaria also discussed the increasingly competitive relationship between the United States and China, U.S.-Iranian relations, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
On the Israeli-Palestinian clash, Zakaria said that peaceful coexistence can only be achieved when both sides realize that they have much more to gain through cooperating with each other on a political and economic level. “Israel needs to realize that moving forward with Gaza limits its potential, and the Palestinians need to understand the enormous value to them of coexisting with the Israelis,” he said.
However, Zakaria’s resolution of the conflict came across as unrealistic to Yong-Gyun Choi, a sophomore in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. “The problem here is Mr. Zakaria’s implication that people have not yet realized the value of a liberal market,” said Choi. “The assumption that if both groups were to realize the benefits of a capitalistic market in the Middle East, then they would both stop the war that has been ensuing since the creation of Israel, seemed oversimplified and idealistic.”
“It was interesting to witness a major political analyst debate such ‘hot topics,’ ” said Eduardo Benatuil, a senior economics major. “Lectures like Zakaria’s are very important because they offer not only Carnegie Mellon, but the entire Pittsburgh community, a different outlook on affairs that shape the political future of the United States and the world at large,” he said.
In 1999, Zakaria was named “one of the 21 most important people of the 21st Century” by Esquire magazine, and in 2007, his name was included among the 100 leading public intellectuals in the world by Foreign Policy. With a keen eye toward Middle Eastern affairs, Zakaria has also penned several books, including The Future of Freedom and his recent best seller, The Post American World..

2009-11-02,CMU,China,"Zhong Liang starts procrastinating every 10 to 30 minutes, because every 10 to 30 minutes he gets a coding error. As a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, he gets a lot of these errors, which leads to a lot of time procrastinating, which leads to a lot of time on Facebook.
This is a familiar story for many, especially at Carnegie Mellon, where work abounds in various forms: papers, midterm exams, projects, etc.
For Terry Zhou, a first-year math major from China, the way Chinese students take notes in class is different — they use only notebooks. But at Carnegie Mellon, Zhou mainly uses his computer. To really focus, he prints notes for class to avoid distractions. When asked if it’s better that students use laptops less in China, he said, “I think I use my laptop too much; I prefer to print something out and read it on paper, especially if it’s really hard and requires concentration.”
Zhou’s form of procrastination is spending time on Facebook. When he feels like he has spent too much of his time on Facebook, he disables his account, only to re-enable it a few days later.
In contrast, there are people like Matt Chabalko, a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering, who spends upward of four hours simply surfing the Internet. Explaining that he is most productive under pressure, he sums up his work ethic and life philosophy: “If it wasn’t for the last minute, nothing would get done.”
Then there is the exception to these rules — someone like Lizzy Madden, a senior in public policy. She works on assignments that are not due for two weeks. She said, “I usually do other work that’s not as pressing instead of doing what I’m supposed to be doing.”
She explains that her method of focusing is to change her study location often. In the transition from high school to college, she realized that she needed to use resources that would help her work consistently. She said, “I found that going to office hours stopped me from procrastinating.”
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Development center recommends moving around for 15 minutes for each hour of work to increase efficiency. Students are affected by their physical locations, the people that surround them, and their state of mind. Often, students like Madden, who have conscious realizations on how to eliminate distractions and use resources wisely, are most productive, according to Academic Development’s Fast Facts on Procrastination.
Zeynep Koraltan, a sophomore business major, calls her friends and family. S.J. Tanzer and Fiona Ryder, sophomore vocal performance majors, spend time talking to friends. Others, like fifth-year senior physics major Josh Tepper, seek out stimulation from other sources. He says that when he’s not finding fulfillment in his work, he tries to find it in other places, such as the New York Times homepage or on Facebook.
The solution to procrastination might lie in combining these seemingly opposite ideas: working with other students to satisfy a need for social interaction, while moving closer to tasks that need to be completed. Peggy Orenstein, a writer and editor on women’s issues, explains that while the Internet allows a person to indulge in a “perpetual pursuit of little thoughts,” it does not lead them to any result..

2009-11-23,CMU,China,"President Obama’s recent trip to China was, for the most part, hardly worth mentioning. You might expect a meeting between two of the world’s most powerful countries to result in statements that shape global policy. Nothing like that happened this time, at least not according to the U.S. media.
But while American media and Washington’s ambassador to Beijing, Jon Huntsman, continue fighting about what actually occurred in meetings with the Chinese administration, we will focus on what matters to us: his talk with students.
While in China, Obama was able to speak to a group of four hundred specially selected Chinese students. To an audience described as docile by ABC News, Obama talked about the future of the China-U.S. relationship, openness, and freedom of expression and religion. The students shot back with hard-hitting questions like: “Why did you get that Nobel Prize?”
According to reports, students left the room thinking Obama was an enjoyable and friendly man whose solutions might not work in China. Possibly, this reflects more upon the attitudes of the students chosen by party and university leadership to be present, or maybe this is part of a larger trend, with the intellectual youth of China believing they need to find their own ways to progress as a country. The “change” campaign that Obama ran on, led by community involvement and transparency of information, may not be the right fit for China.
While the meeting with students was originally intended to be televised nationally, it was only shown on local Shanghai stations and at “watch parties” around China, although the entire transcript is now available online.
So as America discusses at length  whether Obama pushed hard enough regarding nuclear waste and Iran, we here at The Tartan are considering these four hundred students who heard our President speak. It is their voices that will be directing the future of China..

In the ads, our current leaders apologize for failing to take action to stop the then-“catastrophic” climate change. Greenpeace has become more and more bold and extremist in its advertising; if we can still remember the spectacle that was the G-20 here in Pittsburgh, we might also recall the Greenpeace activists that dangled along with a climate change banner off our own West End Bridge, so these ads should come as no surprise.
Of course, we should assume Greenpeace is simply being fanatical, and that these apologetic ads are already outdated due to the far-reaching, environment-protecting, carbon-footprint-lowering resolutions agreed to in the harmonious COP15 meetings.
Except, oh wait, the conference was a failure. It didn’t work. No agreement was reached. No reductions in carbon emissions were agreed to. No successor to the Kyoto Protocol was created, signed, or ratified. The meeting went precisely as the Greenpeace ads suggested that a world looking back in 2020 would perceive.
On Dec. 7, the day the conference began, an exceptional declaration was sounded by 56 newspapers, each publishing the same editorial. Yes, in a journalistic world where one’s opinion is meant to distinguish your columnist, your editor, your paper from its competitors, newspapers across 45 countries together spoke with a singular voice. A voice that called for action, for steps to limit emissions, and for political bickering to be put aside. An editorial that was factual, terse, and, more importantly, a call to focus not on nationalistic pride, but on the future of humanity. There was still a hope that these politicians could come together, not to vie for their own country’s interests, but to act as representatives of the planet as a whole.
But we know this didn’t happen, and the aftermath is more telling than the meetings, as each country seems to have found another to blame. Did Denmark fail in its role as host, running secret, more exclusive meetings? Did the United States refuse to accept that as the largest carbon-emitter it needed to make the deepest cuts? Did China’s approach to negotiation destroy any hope for an open deliberation? Or, most obviously, did every government leader fail, as no agreement was reached?
The cautiously hopeful, tellingly worried voice of newspapers across the globe may not now clear their collective throat and applaud the leaders who met in Copenhagen for their progress, but must retreat into the corner, ashamed. The collective editorial must now wait until the end of this year, when the leaders come back together, for COP16 in Mexico, where they can hopefully put to paper words that can unite all of the countries present. They must create an agreement that will save a graying Obama from ever being forced to apologize to a decimated world.

2010-01-18,CMU,China,"After giving in to China’s demands for four years, Google has finally taken an extreme step — it has decided to stop censoring its search results in China.
Tired of the country’s required censorship of the Internet, Google has decided that it may be best to close its operations in China. The decision was made after the company suspected the Chinese government of hacking into the Gmail user accounts of Chinese human rights activists. 
According to a New York Times article, Google has said that it will try to negotiate with the Chinese authorities regarding censorship and surveillance issues before taking the drastic step of shutting down google.cn. However, considering the reputation of the Chinese government, a successful negotiation seems highly unlikely.
As journalists, we at The Tartan certainly promote freedom of speech and commend Google’s efforts to do the same. With sites such as YouTube frequently blocked and search engines heavily censored, China had already severely restricted the freedom of its citizens, but by infiltrating private user accounts, the Chinese government went too far.
Even with such a serious attack on users’ security, Google’s decision is unexpected after years of complacency. 
A company should adapt its policies to the laws of the country where it is situated, but not to the extent of giving up its core values. Google is a trusted name in the world, and by standing up to China’s excessive censorship of information, Google has established that it will not undermine that trust by compromising its values.
The Chinese government, as expected, is censoring news of its dispute with Google. It is ironic that while the entire world knows of Google’s decision, many Chinese remain oblivious. Without Google, China will truly be cut off from the rest of the world. While it is too much to hope for a complete reform in the attitude of the Chinese government, we can at least hope that other companies will follow Google and not give up their values. We applaud Google’s stand against censorship and hope China eases its restrictions on its people..

2010-02-01,CMU,China,"I arrived last summer in Shanghai as the individualist American most of us are brought up to be: Chinese books in one hand and the Constitution in the other. I made sure to educate myself on all the current issues of the place that would be my home for the next two months. I read about censorship issues, the Communist Party’s tortures, the disappearance of Chinese civil rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng exactly one year ago from this week (Feb. 2, 2009) after documenting victims’ accounts of physical and verbal abuse. I witnessed firsthand the week-long shutdown of Google, the moment from when Facebook was no longer available, and I had to replace YouTube, also banned, with the Chinese version Youku.
It is no longer only speculation that China may very well be taking center stage with extraordinary power and influence — it is merely common knowledge now. The United States has gradually been stripped of the international attention it is used to. However, hard set on the values that we feel have historically made the U.S. the “land of opportunity” it is, we have remained insistent on the spread of democracy dictated by Manifest Destiny: In other words, it’s not our fault God chose us to save the world.
Hillary Clinton sure seems to think so, as in a speech a couple of weeks ago, she listed China among the nations that engage in massive censorship of the information they make available to the public and thus pose a threat to international security. She went on to urge the Chinese government not only to conduct investigations on the recent attacks on Google, but also to make the findings available to the public. Is it not perhaps a tad pretentious of Clinton to expect the Chinese government with its centuries of history to have a spontaneous epiphany: “You know what, Hillary, I hadn’t thought of that.... Thanks for showing us the light.”
An official Chinese newspaper commented on Clinton’s speech several days later, calling it “a part of the U.S. campaign to impose its values and denigrate other cultures by exploiting their societies’ vulnerabilities....”
We all agree that everyone deserves to have access to the truth; nevertheless, could it also be possible that the Chinese government acted negatively due to feelings of public humiliation? And perhaps we’ve found the problem.
Last summer in Shanghai, my teacher — native Chinese — explained to us one day in class that among the many social priorities of Chinese society, one proves as true today as it did hundreds of years ago: “saving face.” “Face” refers to the perspective you build of yourself within public opinion — it is the image we construct of ourselves before others. My teacher went on to explain that in China, there is no greater sign of disrespect than publicly humiliating another. Obama promised in his campaign to improve U.S.-China ties, but we should be careful that upon removing the fly from our friend’s forehead, we don’t strip off their face in the process.
It seems clear to me at first sight that the recent Google.cn dispute was inevitable: The threat to the Chinese government’s control seems to be directly proportional to the growth of the population and the development of its society. In today’s globalizing international community, where open access to the international network and socioeconomic progress seem to go hand in hand, it’s only a matter of time before the steady development of Chinese society grows too much for the inflexible skin of communism to contain.
Like most Americans, I was brought up assuming my natural rights to free speech and the chase of my own dreams — cultivating my individuality. It never occurred to me that it might not be the case for everyone; we often fail to remember that the founding fathers didn’t tour the planet: Different countries have unique customs and laws. In the case of how each individual society develops in the specific way that it does, history does not always repeat itself.

2010-02-15,CMU,China,"For finding information quickly, search engines have become an integral part of our lives.
Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. alumnus Qi Lu has a mission to improve that experience for Internet users through Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, which was launched in June 2009. 
Lu, president of Microsoft’s Online Services Division since late 2008, is heading the company’s venture into the search engine market and, simultaneously, the competition against Google.
Raised by his grandparents in a poor, rural village in China, Qi Lu attended Furan University in China, completing his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science. Lu was noticed by a Carnegie Mellon University professor at a lecture, and, as a result, traveled to the United States to obtain his Ph.D. 
According to Mahadev Satyanarayanan (Satya), Lu’s Ph.D. advisor, Lu quickly became known for his work ethic, humble personality, and dedication to his studies.
“At the time when he was here as a student, he concentrated on his Ph.D. research and his thesis. He was focused and very driven,” Satya said.  “The qualities that people have stay with them, regardless of what their roles are in industry and academia.”
Upon graduating, Lu worked as a research associate for Carnegie Mellon, then as a research staff member for IBM before beginning work at Yahoo! in 1998. 
Formerly the executive vice president of Engineering for Search and Advertising Technology at Yahoo!, Lu is no stranger to competition with Google. Despite Google’s hold on search engine use, Lu is determined to advance Bing as a search engine capable of providing help in decision making, in addition to developing improved accuracy.
Unlike Microsoft’s previous  experience with static software and computer innovation, development of Bing instead must adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
“The pace at which innovation happens in this search engine world happens so fast that you need to think and act differently,” Satya said.
Although Bing’s development has only begun, Microsoft’s search market share has grown from 8 to 11 percent since its inception, a promising sign of Lu’s efforts — though Google still has over 60 percent of the market share. These gains primarily took space belonging to Yahoo! and other lesser-used search engines, but they are a positive sign for Microsoft’s investment in Bing.
Though they are competitors in the market, students at Carnegie Mellon recognize the unique connection between Google and Microsoft, both as workplaces for graduates and as forces on Carnegie Mellon’s campus — offering grants, facilities, and funding faculty and sudent research. 
“I think it’s really interesting, since we just built the Gates building on campus with the donation from Gates and Hillman [Foundation]. Our campus is really diverse with Google and Microsoft both being active here,” said first-year CIT student Bianka Roy.
“I think it’s really neat,” said first-year business administration major Emily Lee. 
“Obviously, right now, people like Google better and don’t really know what Bing is, but I feel like, with the  developer being a CMU grad, it could get really big on campus. If I  had known Bing was by a CMU grad, I would probably use it.” 
Microsoft and Lu will face years of work in developing the Bing search engine, but according to his mentors, Lu is more than capable of that task. 
“He is one of the most driven people I have ever known, and his determination to make Bing a success is remarkable,” said Randal Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science..

2010-02-22,CMU,China,"Last summer, I studied abroad in Shanghai, China for approximately two months. Other than suffering from Facebook withdrawal, all in all, China was definitely a good study abroad experience for me.
Even though I am an American, I was able to explore China much more discreetly as a tourist than most Americans would have. I am a Chinese heritage student, so physically, I look just like a typical Chinese citizen. This made touring the country much easier. Caucasian students fascinated the Chinese and most heads would turn at the sight of them. This part I was happy to miss out on, since I am not keen on extra attention from strangers. Some locals would even take pictures of them, some with their permission, others without. For my personal preference, I was glad that I was able to tour different parts of China without drawing too much attention.
Even Asians that were not Chinese were drawn out. Most American people cannot tell a Chinese person apart from a Korean person or a Japanese person. However, most Asians can tell different ethnicities apart. One of my Korean classmates was just walking along a shopping street when one of the salesmen started talking to her in Korean to try to get her to buy his products. In general, because I am ethnically Chinese, it made bargaining a lot easier since salespeople did not assume that I was foreign. Once bargainers know that their customer is foreign, they will automatically bump up the price unnecessarily high. This makes bargaining a hard-earned skill, which can end in feeling very satisfied if you are able to get a good deal.
Of course, touring China was not my main objective when I decided to study abroad this summer. My main motive was to improve my Chinese reading, writing, and speaking skills. By taking Chinese class every day of the week for hours at a time, I think I definitely improved my reading and writing skills. What helped my speaking the most was interacting with people in the streets, bargaining with salespeople, and in general, just being in China. I agree with the thought that if you really want to learn a language well, you should go to the country and live there for a couple months and immerse yourself in the language. I am glad that I went to China because I did what I went there to do: improve my Chinese.
Before my trip, I would rarely speak out in Chinese, because even though I understood the language pretty fluently, I was not able to form the sentences in my head quickly enough. I always had to think of a response in English, translate it in my head to Chinese, and then finally attempt to say it out loud. To be honest, I was a little ashamed that my speaking was so broken, since I grew up in a Chinese-speaking family. One of my experiences in China exemplified these feelings completely. I was in a taxi, on my way to some tourist spot, when the taxi driver tried to make conversation with my classmates and me. He could tell that I was ethnically Chinese, and he questioned why I still had to learn Chinese. He told us a story about how his nephew, who grew up in Kentucky, was able to speak Chinese fluently and asked why I could not do the same. I was not sure how to answer this question. After that encounter, it made me even more motivated to learn to speak, read, and write fluently in Chinese.
This trip was a mixture of realizing my shortcomings as a non-fluent Chinese heritage student and experiencing what it feels like to live in China on my own. I was pushed to improve my Chinese by myself and by a simple conversation with a taxi driver. At the same time, I was also able to explore my Asian roots, through lessons of history and touring the country. Overall, my experiences in China proved to be extremely beneficial; I was able to truly unveil a whole new part of myself..

2010-03-01,CMU,China,"Less massive dark matter discovered
In the Soudan mine of Minnesota, two experiments — the Cyrogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMSII) and the Coherent Germanium Neutrino Technology (CoGeNT) — have yielded results that may lead to new information about the size and sensitivity of dark matter, which is thought to be the most abundant form of matter in the universe.
Two weeks ago, CDMSII discovered particles resembling dark matter in the mine. The underground mine is known for its lack of particle activity, meaning there are few subatomic particles in the atmosphere that one would find in abundance at the earth’s surface. CoGeNT reported they observed similar dark matter particles with a smaller mass. Confirmation of the CoGeNT results would, according to physicist Juan Collar, “shift attention to experiments that are sensitive to lower energies,” since detection of the particles occurred at the lower energy sensitivities of the detectors.
Skepticism concerning results has been strong. The less massive CoGeNT particles do not match up with dark matter being investigated by space satellites. The CoGeNT experiment itself may also be faulty, since it is less shielded and more susceptible to unrelated radio waves than the CDMSII.

TigerText creator makes texting private
Following the revelation of golfer Tiger Wood’s numerous affairs and his subsequent apology last week, former recruiter and headhunter Jeffrey Evans responded by creating the TigerText iPhone app, launched on Feb. 25.
With the app, users who may not want their received text messages to be disclosed to others can store them in the TigerText server and set a certain time limit for the message lifespan. After the time limit has expired, the message disappears from both phones and the server. Recipients can see the texts, but they cannot respond. Any incriminating messages, therefore, can be deleted from existence.
Evans denies any claim that the phone was designed for cheating spouses, or that it was named after Tiger Woods in the first place. He designed it primarily to allow iPhone users to have more control over their privacy. Pointing to a ruling by the European Union in 2006 that phone and Internet providers would hold onto texts for a certain period of time, he claimed that the app was directed toward lawyers and business executives.
Whether this app was a practical investment or, as Time puts it, simply “stupidity insurance” remains to be seen.

China and Google have a standoff
China has threatened to shut down Google’s operations inside China due to Google’s decision to reduce censorship on its Chinese website. The situation began when, in late 2009, a series of Internet attacks against several U.S. corporations, including Google, was found to originate in China. The attacks targeted not only the companies, but also the e-mail accounts of several Chinese human-rights activists. In response, Google declared that it would stop restricting searches on its Chinese language search engine, prompting threats from the Chinese government.
Both powers have considerable influence. Google, according to Rebecca MacKinnon of Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy, has a large enough presence “to define the standard operating rules of the Internet.” With the freedom of ideas available online, Google could very well combat any authoritarian regime.
China, however, has had a history of restricting Internet access through a list of blocked IP addresses known as “The Great Firewall.” Although the bandwidth is reaching maximum capacity in the country, China’s circumvention could find any number of unfavorable IP addresses.

2010-03-22,CMU,China,"The following is an account of one student’s adventure through Europe over winter break.
Dec. 29 (Budapest, Hungary):
Overnight trains are very difficult to enjoy without a sleeper. Border patrol at 5 a.m., the extreme heat of the Romanian trains, and the lack of leg room can get on a person’s nerves. My friend Jae and I got to the station at around 10 a.m. Budapest time. Our smartest decision at the train stations was to buy a 24-hour transport pass; all day we hopped on and off the metro and tram lines only caring about our next destination. It was also a nice feeling having the local currency on hand. We took the metro, which had only three lines, and the tram to our hostel. In some locations, like at Heroes’ Square, you go down approximately 15 stairs and there is the metro platform! It was very accessible — if only London’s metro was similarly convenient. The Budapest Opera House was splendid inside — adorned with gold everywhere. I think that was my first time in an opera house, and it was everything I had come to imagine. I kept placing the characters from Jane Austen’s Persuasion, Anne and Frederick, in the audience or Edmond Dantès in one of the boxes using the opera as a social opportunity. My favorite part of the opera house tour was the historical connection. The opera house was built in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the ruling family based in Vienna demanded a less-grand opera house be built in Budapest so as not to compete with Vienna’s own city theater. The tour guide said that the Budapest Opera House was more beautiful but smaller. Jae and I joked among ourselves that we would have to go to Vienna to compare — and we actually did.
New Year’s Eve (Vienna, Austria):
The New Year’s celebration in Vienna was so active and exciting. We started our Old Town tour at St. Stephen’s Basilica, the most prominent building in the area. As a unique tradition for New Year’s in Vienna, every vendor sold items related to pigs: miniatures, statues, pins, and hats. There were 11 stages spread out over the old town for entertainment, and people, mostly older couples, celebrated by dancing near the stage front — congo lines were spontaneously being formed. Pig hat aficionados gathered for pictures and laughs, mothers boogied with their children, and young folk felt the rhythms of new-age music DJs. Something I found unexpected was the overwhelming number of American songs being played, for example Train’s “Stand By Me.” I liked the freedom of breaking into dance, walking with a beat, acting easy and blending in with others who were full of only joy on that festive night. I was struggling to learn new German words — I had asked a few times how to say “happy new year,” but I still can’t remember how. Walking through the streets of the Old Town was beautiful. The path of celebrations was denoted by lights and banners above the pavement. Fireworks were set off everywhere and I couldn’t avoid thinking of home during this night. I was frustrated that I didn’t know the words to “Auld Lang Syne,” but my friend Stanley and I decided to whistle along all night.
Jan. 2 (Vienna, Austria):
One positive thing about traveling is that one learns how one interacts with various people. In museums, do you walk behind other viewers or quickly in front of them? Do you let someone in front of you in the queue or feel like you’ve “earned” that spot? Do you welcome unexpected conversations with a band of peaceful protesters against destroying a park? Do you have the patience to withstand hours of, in my mind, unnecessary photography? I hear traveling is a way to becoming more aware of yourself, and that notion of exploring the world is a Western mindset.
Jan. 3 (Salzburg, Austria):
Sliding down snow banks on the only sled I had — my back — lightened my spirits. The untainted snow in Salzburg tasted like carrots somehow, a sweet tinge to the snow that clung to fences and leaves.
Jan. 7 (Ceský Krumlov, Czech Republic):
Early rise, prepare a to-go breakfast, say goodbye to my friend Ping, and run to catch our bus to Ceský Krumlov. Jae walked fast and got us to the station on time. After a three-hour bus journey, we made our way to the Old Town and had a traditional Chinese lunch. We watched the town Christmas tree get taken down, de-limbed, and chopped up. This was quite funny to watch as tourists in a quaint town. We relaxed here because we had a lot of time before sunset and not much to see since we had missed a few tours already. Walking around the town was exciting. Cobblestones and little alleyways, monastery gardens, and brightly painted houses filled Ceský Krumlov. Red roofs and snow were everywhere. There was a castle up on a hill that was surrounded by a bear moat. (The bears were indoors today). The castle was decorated, not with actual stonework or sculptures, but with painted imitations. The walls were painted with images of stone, detailing, shadows, frescoes, and exterior siding. From afar the effect was believable, but from up close it was simply hilarious. The painters even changed the direction of the shadows on the “stones” for actual lamp positions. We walked through the castle and out the other side, arriving at a large field. My friend Stanley said that it reminded him of China, but to me it was the Pennsylvanian countryside — small field, trees, and small rounds. The days passed like this: “Oh that street looks exciting and new — do we know where it goes?” “No, does it matter?” “No.” “Okay, let’s go!” “Oh, wait. Let me take a photo first.” 
There is nothing like touring Europe..

2010-03-22,CMU,China,"In the fading noise from the closing ceremonies of the Olympic games, the Paralympians compete. But after two weeks of focused international attention, the media seems to move away from sports competition back to the commonplace: the economy, new technology, celebrity gossip, and ongoing war. Often the Paralympics are lost in this return to normalcy.
For us, it took a gallery of incredible images from this year’s X Paralympic Winter Games to even give thought to the 506 athletes who competed in Vancouver and Whistler this past week. A photograph of Haitao Du, a cross-country skier from China, pictures him competing in the 20-kilometer cross-country race, with no poles and no arms. A photograph from the podium of the men’s slalom standing event shows Australian bronze-medalist Cameron Rahles-Rahbula with one leg; German silver-medalist Gerd Schonfelder with only one arm; and New Zealand gold-medalist Adam Hall, who suffers from spina bifida. A shot of the United States’ Patrick McDonald getting ready for his team’s wheelchair curling game just begs the question — how do they even do that?
It is a testament to the ability and perseverance of these athletes that the Paralympics can even exist. These men and women have overcome disabilities that society views as completely debilitating and are taking part in an event that defines them as some of the top competitors in the world.
Originally a portmanteau combining “paraplegic” with “Olympic,” the global governing body of the games has re-oriented the title to replace paraplegic with parallel. They are supporting the ideal of the Paralympics being a co-event with the Olympic movement, not a sideline occurrence. And this is apparent to those who pay attention to the games. These are incredible performances of athleticism that unfortunately seem to have fallen out of the spotlight.
We want these Olympians to be granted the same respect as their peers whom we watched, eyes glued to televisions and monitors for days. They are every bit as qualified and have often come from unimaginable places to reach their dreams. They deserve our attention as much as the Olympics that fills mass media.
So, for the same reasons as for the Olympic games, give the Paralympics a look next time they’re on — to see compelling athletes representing their countries, their competitive spirits outshining any obstacles that may have been placed in their way.

2010-04-19,CMU,China,"Last Thursday, entrepreneur and budding writer Stephen Greer spoke to Carnegie Mellon’s Entrepreneurship Club, sharing his business experience and his new book, Starting From Scrap: An Entrepreneurial Success Story.
In Starting From Scrap, Greer recounts his story of almost 20 years in the scrap metal recycling business in Asia. A Pennsylvania native, he graduated from Penn State in the early 1990s, but found that jobs and internships were scarce due to the recession. So in 1993, after hearing from a friend that the Asian market was booming, Greer set out on a mission to succeed abroad.
“I couldn’t find the jobs I wanted in the United States,” said Greer in Thursday’s lecture. “A friend told me that he had a friend in Hong Kong and that there were so many business opportunities in Asia’s booming economy. I knew my dad had a lot of free airline miles he’d been saving up, so I asked him for a free ticket to Hong Kong.”
Greer got the ticket, headed to Hong Kong, and was soon immersed in a business market that was strikingly different from what he had experienced in the United States.
“Hong Kong is a very entrepreneurial town — everyone in one way or another is their own boss,” Greer said. “I became completely caught up in that and fell in love with the city.”
However, Greer’s entrance into the Asian market wasn’t without its flaws. He started his own business, registering it as “Hartwell Pacific,” because, as he said, “Hartwell was my middle name, and I decided to use it because I didn’t want everyone to know that I was the only one involved in my business.” From there, he began to search for his place within Hong Kong’s booming economy.
“I looked at anything and everything: Christmas ornaments, wood, hairnets, work gloves. There was a world full of opportunity; I just had to choose something and go for it,” Greer said.
Greer eventually landed a deal with scrap-metal suppliers in Asia, initiating his entrance into the scrap metal and recycled metal business. There he found success, first in the sales of scrap metal and, eventually, in adapting his company to also recycle used metal, melting it down and reforming it into new stainless steel.
With this adjustment, Greer’s business soared, opening eight operations in seven countries in one and a half years. As he put it, “By 28 I was a multi-millionaire, which was of course a good thing.” 
In 2008, after achieving a turnover of $250 million, as well as selling Hartwell Pacific to Australia’s Smorgon Steel Group and Smorgon Steel, he resigned from his position with Hartwell Pacific and became a senior adviser to Oaktree Capital, a global investment management corporation.
However, financial gain, Greer stresses, is not his ultimate concern. “Success is living the life you want to live on your terms — and I’m not talking about money. The reality is that there is a limit to how much money can improve your happiness. But, if you find something that you like and that you’re passionate about — that will take you a long way,” Greer said.
Entrepreneurship Club member and Tepper graduate student Justin G. Shaka introduced Greer as having an “important outlook on entrepreneurship across the globe.”
This holds true for many of the students in Entrepreneurship Club, as Greer’s lessons are especially applicable in today’s global market. The current economic recession bears some similarities to the recession in the early 1990s, when Greer first arrived in Hong Kong. 
According to Greer, periods of recession can drive further exploration and valuable risks. “It’s a hard time to find a job in today’s poor economy,” Greer said. “But it’s also a great time to start your own business. Bad economies can be great times to be entrepreneurs.”
Greer also expressed the valuable business lessons he learned due to his experiences across the globe. “It’s a big world — a global economy — and people need to be thinking about how they, and how their country, fit into that.”
These thoughts are echoed by Marc Faber, world-renowned economist and author of the Gloom, Doom and Boom Report. In his review of Greer’s book, he wrote that Greer “proves with a fascinating account of his business life that there are even more opportunities in Asia as countries such as China, India, and Vietnam open up and liberalize.”
Greer’s book is available now and has been listed on the South China Morning Post Bestsellers List..

2010-04-26,CMU,China,"When faculty members leave Carnegie Mellon, it is often instructive to reflect on what they’ve achieved throughout their tenure at the university. Indira Nair, who will be retiring from her position as vice provost for education after 32 years of service at Carnegie Mellon, is no exception.
Nair was born in Trivandrum, Kerala in southern India. Since her father was a member of the army, she moved a total of 10 times before completing 12 years of education. She attended the Institute of Science in Bombay, completing her bachelor’s degree in physics. She then moved to the United States and received her master’s degree from Kansas State University and, later, her Ph.D. at Northwestern University.
Nair first arrived in Pittsburgh with the intention of pursuing a career as a high school physics teacher. After spending several years teaching not only physics but also other sciences, including chemistry and geology, she took a small job in the engineering and public policy department here at Carnegie Mellon. Eventually, she joined the Office of the Provost and accepted her current role as the vice provost for education.
At Carnegie Mellon, the provost is the chief academic adviser at the university and is one of the most powerful positions outside the university’s president. The provost oversees all of the faculty and deans in the various schools. One of the major offices underneath the provost is that of the vice provost for education, which has several organizations of its own working beneath it.
“The curriculum itself is divided on a department level, but I look at common needs,” Nair said from her office in Warner Hall. “[I ask my department] what can we do to enhance that experience.”
Beneath Nair is a host of different organizations aimed at making education an integral part of the school and community. The Leonard Gelfand Center, for example, is part of the vice provost’s responsibility and focuses on educational outreach. “Carnegie Mellon reaches 10,000 students every semester,” Nair said. One program within the center is C-MITES, helping to foster math and science skills in gifted students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Classes are taught during the summer for these students, and in the years to come, students from Qatar will also begin attending these classes.
Other important offices under Nair are the assistant provost for graduate education and the director of Undergraduate Research and Fellowship Resources.
Nair has helped organize several large projects aimed at enriching the undergraduate experience. 
One of these programs, Odyssey, is aimed at college sophomores and what they will do with their scholarship to fulfill their citizenship duties. The faculty nominates students that they find to be intellectual seekers and host a three-day workshop right before spring semester.
Another project is the acclaimed University Lecture Series, which runs year-round. Every Monday and Thursday, the faculty invites accomplished individuals — sometimes faculty, sometimes guests — to give a lecture about whatever topic they are currently working on. A recent speaker, Allan Meltzer of the Tepper School of Business, discussed the Federal Reserve and money supply in the United States.
Nair has also made revolutions in courses offered at Carnegie Mellon, beginning with a course titled India Today, a weekend course worth only three units but requiring over 40 hours of class time and writing papers. Iit was first created in fall 2008 in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, and the class studies different countries every year, including China, Brazil, and Russia. “These countries are considered the most emerging countries today,” Nair said.
Qatar has also been a target of interest for Nair since she arrived. Her course Global Issues, Local Solutions, created in the spring of 2009, addressed the question of how to solve global problems depending on a country’s current economic, political, or geographic situation. Recently, Carnegie Mellon hosted the Global Issues, Global Solutions conference, which further addressed these issues.
Nair’s role as chair of the University Education Council has also been influential. The council’s role to approve university-wide courses has been an important one; thanks to Nair and the council, interdisciplinary classes on urban farming and materials science, energy, and the environment are now available.
Nair has a great respect for interdisciplinary action. “Different disciplines are different lenses,” Nair said. “The same thing you’re thinking, someone else is thinking from a different perspective.” To help with interdisciplinary relations, Nair helped to organize 1905 = mc2: Photons and Relativity, a course focused on studying how different ideas in science developed.
Other faculty members have praised Nair’s influence across all areas of the university. “Indira’s service to the Pittsburgh and global community, to science education, and to Carnegie Mellon’s history and its future are immeasurable,” said Provost Mark Kamlet, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release.
“Her passion is  contagious,” said history professor Nico Slate. Slate, who first met Nair in August 2009 through other faculty members of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, found a mutual interest in India and undergraduate education. Several of the students in one of Slate’s history courses raised funds for an environmental project in India, and the money was donated in Nair’s name. “It’s been a real honor working with her,” Slate concluded.
For the students she is leaving behind, Nair offers these words of advice: “Look around and find opportunities.” She points to the rising number of Carnegie Mellon students taking a foreign language as a positive sign of inter-school participation. She also advises acting on these opportunities. “If you have an idea,” she asserted, “you can find a way to carry it out.”
After retiring, Nair plans to move to New Mexico to be closer to her two daughters. She said she plans to do much “thinking, writing, and reading.”.

2010-04-26,CMU,China,"Over the years, the nuclear disarmament process has gained great momentum, with the two Cold War powers — the United States and Russia — showing strong resolve to reduce their vast nuclear stockpiles. On April 14, world leaders concluded a two-day summit on international nuclear security. While President Obama was quick to deem it a step forward, his argument is anything but convincing.
Though Russia and the United States renewed their vows at the summit, Obama has had great difficulty in bringing nations such as China, India, and Pakistan to the negotiating table. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was afraid that there would be demands for Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so he just stayed home. Iran was not invited and held its own International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in protest.
While it is important that Russia, the country with the world’s largest stockpile, is continuing the disarmament process, without support from every nation it will be impossible to achieve the lofty goal of complete disarmament. And the problem that we face today is not of legality but of mixed messages and poor diplomacy. The Iran issue serves as a great example of the hypocrisy of America’s approach to the problem.
Israel has maintained a (not-so-)secret nuclear program for about 30 years now and, while there have been whimpers of complaint, America has generally accepted it and moved on. Never do we hear of American politicians berating Israel for flouting international regulations or breaking IAEA rules. 
Another country with nuclear ambitions is India. After years of mistrust and burdensome sanctions, George W. Bush finally accepted that India was not going to abandon its nascent nuclear program. Amid much controversy, a civilian nuclear deal was finally signed in 2008, despite India’s being a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. International rules were bent to make way for common sense.
And now it looks like Obama is getting drawn into another pointless legal battle, using sanctions when they make no logical sense. Just because Iran is a theocratic and unstable country does not mean they do not have the right to possess nuclear weapons. No amount of legal maneuvering and international condemnation will change Iran’s mind. Nuclear development has become a matter of national pride, and all the taunting is only serving to strengthen their resolve, allowing leaders like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to keep their public emotionally charged.
While the summit was a good way for Obama to display his commitment to world peace, until the focus of nuclear disarmament policy is shifted from enforcing legal requirements to understanding international motivations, we will remain years away from a nuclear-arms-free world.

2010-08-23,CMU,China,"The ancient Chinese believed that an energy, called “qi,” flows through the body and maintains health. The energy moves through pathways in the body called meridians. If this flow were disrupted, it would result in ill health or disease. To restore the correct flow of energy, the Chinese would insert needles at certain points along these pathways, a technique known as acupuncture. As explained in an article on www.MayoClinic.com, acupuncture originated more than 2,000 years ago in China and over the past 30 years has become a popular medical tool.
Today, acupuncture involves inserting thin metal needles at various points throughout the patient’s body. Although the theory of qi and meridians, still believed by traditional Chinese practitioners, is not widely accepted among Westerners, studies have shown that acupuncture is useful for a variety of medical conditions. Acupuncture has been known to help patients with osteoarthritis and to ease the feeling of nausea after chemotherapy. It also can act as a painkiller for several conditions including headaches, migraines, pain after dental surgeries, and even labor pain.
Although the exact mechanism by which acupuncture works is still unknown, certain theories have been made. According to an article on www.MedicineNet.com, scientists believe that the needles might stimulate certain sensory nerves and cause a series of effects. One possible effect of this nerve stimulation is the release of opioids produced in the body. Opioids are a class of chemicals that act as painkillers; one of the more well-known members of the group is morphine. The human body produces certain endogenous opioids or endorphins, which bind to receptors in the brain and help reduce the feeling of pain. Studies have shown that if chemicals that counteract the effects of opioids are administered during acupuncture, the acupuncture treatment has no effect.
Another theory that has been proposed is that acupuncture helps stimulate the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland regulates the release of a variety of hormones that travel through the body. Hence, stimulation of this gland could cause a multitude of different effects on many parts of the body.
Acupuncture has also been known to alter the regulation of blood flow in the body.
Although there is some concrete evidence proving the effectiveness of acupuncture and the science behind it, some people still believe that acupuncture has no real effects on the body. According to a study published online this month in the Arthritis Care & Research journal, patients who received traditional Chinese acupuncture treatment and those in the control group, who had “sham” acupuncture treatment, reported similar after-effects of the treatment. The “sham” acupuncture treatment consists of inserting needles at random points throughout the body that are not the correct centers for stimulation.
Although this study suggests that traditional acupuncture treatment has no effect on the body, many scientists doubt the effectiveness of sham acupuncture as a control. Traditional acupuncture practitioners place needles at points specified by the ancient Chinese. The scientific basis for such placement is still unknown. In sham acupuncture, the needles are placed at points not specified by the ancient Chinese. However, since there is such little understanding of the importance of the specific needle placement points, scientists believe that placing the needles at any point could cause positive results. Therefore, for studies concerning the effectiveness of acupuncture to be more accurate, a better control needs to be designed..

2010-08-23,CMU,China,"Hong Kong surprised me with its beauty.
When I first learned I would be spending two months of my summer doing an internship in Hong Kong, I imagined a grimy city akin to Shanghai. Don’t get me wrong; I love Shanghai. But I would never associate the word “scenic” with it. 
However, Hong Kong had a combination of mountains, skyscrapers, and sea that took my breath away as soon as I stepped out of the airport. Looking out of my office building from the 47th floor, I could glimpse a fantastic view of the picturesque harbor, the steel and glass of downtown Hong Kong, and hilly islands in the distance floating on the blue South China Sea.
The city is a great place to be young. My weekends were packed with nights out at the numerous bars and clubs in Lan Kwai Fong, shopping trips to everything from Louis Vuitton stores to cheap-as-dirt-but-need-to-bargain shops in Mongkok, and customary visits to popular tourist spots around the city. Lan Kwai Fong, or LKF as it is more commonly called, is the most popular nighttime hangout spot. Spanning just a few streets, the area is closed to traffic at night, allowing people to walk around freely among the various clubs and pubs. I loved the atmosphere in LKF at night — everyone was dressed up in their bling best, intoxicated, and having a good time. Mongkok — with its popular Ladies’ Market — proved to be my favorite shopping destination. Everything from cheap tops to jewelry to accessories was on sale — and thankfully I had a native Hong Kong friend to bargain for me in Cantonese.  
Hong Kong is all about the views. You can go up Hong Kong Island’s tallest mountain, Victoria Peak, in a tram and catch a glimpse of the glittering buildings at night. Take a ferry across to Kowloon Island and walk along Star Avenue for a view of the skyline up close and lit up in a daily light show. Take a trip to Lantau Island and see the spectacular Big Buddha statue perched on top of a hill from a cable car. And while there are many, each view never fails to disappoint.
Hong Kong is also perfectly situated for further exploring Southeast Asia. During my time there, I made two trips to the glitzy casino city of Macau. If Hong Kong is the Eastern New York City, Macau is the Las Vegas. With its own Wynn, Venetian, and Sands casinos, Macau proves to be the ultimate gambling destination of the East. I’m not much of a gambler, but I still enjoyed the glamour of the casinos. Beyond the casinos, the city’s Portuguese architecture is also worth a look.
Hong Kong culture comes off as strongly cosmopolitan, with the high foreign population and abundance of Western brands everywhere. But if you dig deep — and make some helpful Hong Konger friends — it’s hard to overlook the distinct Chinese culture. Make sure you get a taste of both worlds, because their coexistence is exactly what makes Hong Kong so unique.
One of my favorite parts of traveling is tasting the local fare. My food adventures let me sample a wide range of cuisines: delicious Hong Kong staples like wonton noodle soup and egg tarts in tiny street shops, tasty dim sum lunches at a quiet tea house and a bustling family-style restaurant, and Taiwanese dumplings and Korean barbecue. Hong Kong’s international culture also expanded my restaurant choices. Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, and Mediterranean food all graced my plate while dining at fancy restaurants in the culturally diverse area of SoHo. 
Life in Hong Kong proved to be perfect for a 20-something working and living alone. It was fast-paced, with the right amount of adventure and excitement balanced by lazy Sunday mornings. I fell in love with the city the moment I saw it, and after two months there, I can’t wait to plan my trip back..

2010-08-23,CMU,China,"Although the weather seems to be holding steady at “too hot,” my version of summer draws to a close today as the fall semester begins. So with that, here’s a recap of some of the bound-paper artifacts that I have stumbled upon throughout the sunny season.
The House of Tomorrow — Peter Bognanni 
Growing up in the tourist spectacle that is a geodesic dome, under the tutelage of one’s grandmother, an original devotee of R. Buckminster Fuller, leads to a life that would never be mistaken for normal. Through his grandmother’s stroke, the protagonist is opened to a new world of punk music, cigarettes, girls, and a friend with a transplanted heart. A light summer read, built on the foundation of one of America’s quirkier intellects.
Reality Hunger — David Shields 
I can’t heap enough praise on the palimpsest of lies that is David Shield’s Reality Hunger. His “manifesto,” which is just a list of stolen fragments rearranged to describe how both fiction and non-fiction are simply no longer sufficient for our digitally enhanced future, is a mind-warping trip that you will want to take more than once. Keep an eye on Shields.
Deathbird Stories — Harlan Ellison 
Summer is always a time to return to a classic, and with Ellison as one of the original imaginative writers, his Deathbird Stories are a clever, modern (cough: 1975) rethinking of gods, mythology, and the human condition. Stories such as “Basilisk” and the namesake “The Deathbird” remain as interesting as I believe they must have been 35 years ago.
Designing Obama — Scott Thomas 
This Kickstarter project is a worthy attempt from the design director of the Obama campaign, Scott Thomas, to catalog and bind the design evolution and artistic response to the brand that became America’s 44th president. This coffee table-style book shows, once again, that Kickstarter works, print isn’t dead, and Obama galvanized the artistic community possibly more than any other group in the breadth of support he received.
The Invisible Bridge — Julie Orringer 
Orringer’s sprawling epic about a young Jewish Hungarian architecture student living in Paris in the 1930s (guess what happens), is a beautifully detailed, romantic study of the era and an achievement completely disparate from her more surreal short story collection How To Breathe Underwater. While not receiving as much praise or media hype as David Mitchell’s The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet or Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom (see page A9), Orringer’s first novel is just as deserving.
The Imperfectionists — Tom Rachman 
My favorite novel told in short stories of the summer, The Imperfectionists recounts events in the intertwined lives of several staff members of an international newspaper on the decline. A study on the modern “decline” of journalism, the real lives behind the printed word, and how an empire is constructed, the tales are told with both humor and levity. Rachman’s debut novel is one of a string of successes that has helped elevate the book’s editor, Susan Kamil, to become publisher of the Random House and Dial Press imprints.
And if you have an insatiable hunger for literature, here are a few more: 
China Mieville’s The City & The City
Paul Harding’s Tinkers
Geoff Dyer’s Out of Sheer Rage
Stieg Larsson’s Millenium trilogy

Currently the most successful Thai film to be released in the United States, this 2005 martial arts film centers around a Bangkok youth named Kham who leaves his home and embarks on an adventure to Australia to retrieve his two elephants, stolen by an international Thai Mafia. In Thai culture, elephants stand for both peace and war-readiness. If Kham wishes to attempt a successful rescue, he must learn from the elephants and utilize his muay Thai fighting skills. Fun fact: the style of fighting depicted in this, “muay” or “muaykodchasarn,” roughly translates in English to “elephant boxing.”

2010-10-04,CMU,China,"The year is 1933. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announces the New Deal to recover from the Great Depression.
The year is 1961. President John F. Kennedy announces that Americans are going to the moon within the decade.
The year is 2010. President Barack Obama announces... what, exactly? His intention to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” or maybe pass national health care. But these are not the kind of grand, long-term plans that will drive Americans and their government for the next decade. Until we can find such a plan, we as a nation will find it impossible to maintain a competitive advantage over countries such as China that are making big bets in technology and infrastructure.
Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been the only true global superpower, and it took upon itself the role of international policeman. Since 2001, the War on Terror has drained our resources and become one of the government’s top priorities. But as we have poured our resources into Iraq and Afghanistan, we have lost sight of other internal goals. 
We support corrupt governments with foreign aid but leave our own people in poverty. We need a commitment to developing infrastructure, to bringing 21st-century technology to the entire country. We need long-term goals that will inspire a generation of American youth.
In a New York Times column last week, Thomas Friedman (author of The World Is Flat) compared the United States’ investment in Afghanistan to China’s investment in infrastructure and cutting-edge technology. His conclusion: “The contrast is not good.”
Friedman is right. China is investing in renewable energy and high-speed rail, and its (mostly) command economy means that these investments can be supported by the force of its authoritarian government. Among the advanced technologies Friedman discusses are electric vehicles. China has made such cars one of its “industrial pillars.” But while China and Europe are focusing on innovative technologies for transportation, the United States seems to be making little progress. 
Sure, political leaders make speeches promoting renewable energy and high-efficiency vehicles, but until their words are backed by broad efforts, we will only see incremental developments. And while I do not intend to advocate China’s style of government control for America, history shows that our free-market principles and relatively limited government do not stop us from making big bets that have big payoffs. Today, however, we are not willing to make the investments or the sacrifices necessary to achieve these grand goals.
It may be that the United States has outgrown its period of accepting great challenges. We may be too cynical, too skeptical of our government to take big risks. When President George W. Bush tried to channel Kennedy and announced that NASA would return to the moon and continue to Mars, few people thought there was any chance of making his seemingly arbitrary deadlines. Many doubted the goals would be achieved at all. As the last few months have shown, we skeptics were right.
Truthfully, though, a literal moon shot is not what the country needs right now. We need something even more audacious: a genuine change in the lives of Americans everywhere. The age of Kennedy and Roosevelt, when great dreams led to great results, seems to be behind us. Yet if we are to maintain our standard of living, we have no choice but to begin dreaming once more. We must not be afraid to take risks. We must not be afraid to fail. We must not be afraid to make our own future.

2010-10-11,CMU,China,"With only three weeks until the 2010 congressional elections, signs have cropped up all over the city to remind voters of this upcoming event. The advent of television attack ads, red and blue campaign posters, and daily poll results in every form of media reinforce the importance of voting, especially for voters aged 18–25, who historically have had the lowest percentage turnout. Last Saturday, Hamburg Hall 1000 was crowded with students eager to hear several politicians voice their support for Dan Onorato and Joe Sestak, the Democratic candidates for Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial and Senatorial races, respectively. The highlight of the event, however, was the arrival of actor Matthew Morrison, a renowned Broadway performer and current star of Fox’s hit show Glee.
The rally started with the introduction of Richard Fitzgerald, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus (’81) and an Allegheny County Council member. Fitzgerald’s strong demeanor and passionate speech emphasized Onorato’s accomplishments to date and also expressed his opinion that the Republican Party’s agenda to “turn back the clock” on issues such as health care, green technologies, and women’s rights. The GOP, associated with “big money” and Senatorial candidate Pat Toomey, would also abolish the middle class, Fitzgerald claimed. Young people, he added, are the key to winning this election. “We’re a blue state. There are 1.2 million more Democrats than Republicans. The only way we can lose,” he said, speaking to the students in the crowd, “is if you don’t vote.”
Next on the lineup was Congressman Mike Doyle, who represents the 14th District of Pennsylvania. Doyle stressed that the GOP was a stubborn party that refused to find middle ground with “seemingly sensible Democratic policies” regarding health care, tax cuts for small businesses, tax incentives for companies, and green energy jobs. “Let’s create some clean-energy jobs in the country; let’s be a leader in the energy revolution taking place; let’s not follow China.... Republicans said no,” Doyle said, pacing the stage. 
Doyle also compared the two candidates’ track records: Sestak was an admiral in the navy; Toomey was a derivatives trader on Wall Street and has ties to China. 
According to Doyle, the GOP is outspending the Democrats 8:1 in this campaign. “The way we beat money is with people,” he said. “If we show up, we win. It’s that simple.” But like in Fitzgerald’s speech, just 10 minutes before, his main message was clear: A large voter turnout among young citizens is the key to winning the election.
The final speaker of the rally, Matthew Morrison, entered the room to standing applause and enthusiastic responses from the audience members. Morrison, who flew on a red-eye from California to campaign for the Democratic candidates, stressed the importance of voting and injected seemingly Glee-inspired words of wisdom regarding LGBT hate crimes and personal empowerment into his speech. “I’m here to speak to you as a young voter,” Morrison said. “As young Americans, we can speak louder than any one individual voice. We, the youth of America, can shape the future of this state and this country.... We need to find ways to work together.” 
Among the topics Morrison touched upon, education, respect, and tolerance were his focal points. Morrison chose to help campaign for Onorato and Sestak because he is a supporter of the Democratic Party and its policies, and he feels electing such officials is “important to the grand scheme of things.” 
Election Day, Nov. 2., is quickly approaching. According to www.politico.com, the most recent polls (Oct. 5, Muhlenberg College/_The Morning Call_) show that Onorato is currently trailing Republican Tom Corbett in the polls 47 to 36 percent. The same poll shows Sestak trailing Toomey 45 to 38 percent..

2010-10-11,CMU,China,"A number of Republican primaries this year have been won, not by mainstream GOP-supported candidates, but by so-called Tea Party candidates supported by that organization. While a number of opinions exist in the Tea Party establishment, there are several particularly radical candidates who have made it into the national spotlight. We find these politicians’ popularity disturbing, and so we have catalogued some of their bizarre quotes, opinions, and actions. After all, no argument we can make will be more damaging to these candidates than their own words.
Urquhart wants Americans to believe that Hitler invented the separation of church and state. He said while campaigning: “So the next time your liberal friends talk about the separation of church and state, ask them why they’re Nazis.” So, why are many Americans Nazis? Probably because of Thomas Jefferson’s letter to the Danbury Baptists, which says, “The whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.” 
“Hi, I’m Carl, and I’m angry. I want to be your governor.” Truly an inspiring way to begin a speech.
Yes, Paladino is angry. He is angry at the New York Post for sending “goons” to photograph his daughter. He is angry with his “despicable opponent,” who he claims has been unfaithful to his wife. He is angry with President Obama, so he has forwarded e-mails of the Obamas Photoshopped as a pimp and a prostitute and distributed a video of an African tribal dance titled “Obama inauguration rehersal.”
Paladino reported that he was able to negotiate the freedom of Syracuse University’s chancellor during student protests after the 1970 Kent State shootings. Friends have said this event has been exaggerated; one called it “an urban legend in his mind,” and a Syracuse history professor said that the entire story was completely fabricated and that no hostages were ever held. 
On his website, Paladino advocates that, if he were elected, “any able-bodied New Yorker on unemployment or welfare will join the Dignity Corps” — the Dignity Corps being a new program where prisons would be converted into “work centers.” Here they will learn “how to earn their checks, and personal hygiene.”
Angle’s angle so far has been to not settle on any issues. She tried to block adding fluoride to water, but then stopped. In a 2006 interview, Angle was against alcohol (or any drug) being legal, but she took that viewpoint back recently. She of course wants to repeal the federal “Obama-care” health program, but she also either wants to shut down, “transition out,” or “personalize” Social Security, depending on the day. She has said that the United States should withdraw from the United Nations because it “continually threatens U.S. sovereignty.” The UN does, after all, have crazy ideas about the “fraudulent science” that is global warming. 
On the note of science and education, Angle stated in a radio interview that she wanted to shut down the U.S. Department of Education, asserting that it was unconstitutional. Furthermore, she has continued to be a champion of “Second Amendment remedies” — that is, the right to bear arms — as a response to losing at the ballot box. 
O’Donnell’s latest ad begins with the statement “I am not a witch.” We appreciate this clarification, as she makes clear she never joined a coven, just dabbled in witchcraft. But this perennial candidate has more strange statements in the closet than the media seems to be able to cover. She has stated that condoms spread AIDS, that masturbation is committing adultery, and that evolution is a myth. In 2006, she said she was privy to classified information about China’s strategic plans to take over America. 
For O’Donnell, there seem to be no limits: Possibly her craziest statement uncovered so far is, “American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans with animals and coming up ... with mice with fully functioning human brains.” 
While also following party lines being of being opposed to “Obama-care” and abortion in all instances, Paul holds the less-common view of not supporting the entire Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Had he been given the chance to vote for it, the Senate candidate confirmed he would have done so anyway, but he does believe that “a free society will abide unofficial, private discrimination, even when that means allowing hate-filled groups to exclude people based on the color of their skin.” 
Evidently discrimination is fine with Paul, provided the government looks the other way..

2010-10-11,CMU,China,"As I was watching the newest episode of The Big Bang Theory last Thursday night, I found myself both entertained and dismayed. This was not a result of that amusing show, but of a commercial — specifically, an attack ad vilifying Republican Senatorial candidate Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. The ad is unbelievable in the way that only political propaganda can be. Somehow, political strategists believe that appealing to the basest instincts of the American electorate will help candidates be elected. And though it pains me to say it, they are probably right. Yet, this anything-goes, ends-justify-the-means philosophy is embarrassing. It demeans politicians, and it demeans the electorate. We should demand a higher standard from those who want to lead us.
For any of you who have not yet seen the attack ad targeting Toomey, here are some highlights of that xenophobic diatribe. A Photoshop cutout of Pat Toomey is framed against a background of the Chinese flag. Soon, he’s joined by an equally incongruous-looking cutout of an unnamed “Hong Kong businessman” who has the unforgivable goal of “growing the Chinese economy.” The ad moves on to its logical conclusion, suggesting that “maybe [Toomey] oughta run for Senate... in China.”
I am not sure if that last one is even supposed to be funny. But then again, I also don’t understand why the entire ad is supposed to be persuasive. Go to YouTube, search for “moved pat toomey,” and see for yourself.
To give a brief background on the ad in question, it was sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which is the quasi-official organization that supports all such candidates. It is operated by the national Democratic Party but has no official ties to the government. In this capacity, the DSCC funds campaigns nationwide, including that of Joe Sestak, who is running against Toomey. This attack ad is called “Moved,” referencing the fact that, according to the Washington Post, Toomey lived and worked in Hong Kong for a year.
What puzzles me most about this ad is who its intended audience is and why they would be convinced by such a bizarre argument. Political campaigns have two goals: convincing the electorate to want to vote for their candidate, and then actually getting supporters to the polls. The electorate is often split into three groups: liberals, moderates, and conservatives. And while all of these definitions are simplifications, they still don’t explain this ad. Conservatives are not going to vote for Sestak over Toomey because of an over-the-top attack ad. Liberals are already voting for Sestak. And moderates, the swing voters, are as often repelled by an attack ad as attracted to it.
It seems as if the only reasonable purpose for the ad is to get liberal voters angry at Toomey and ready to go cast their votes for Sestak. Clearly, the Sestak campaign and the DSCC don’t think that Sestak can inspire voters on his own merits. I’m not expecting a Barack Obama-style “Change We Can Believe In” groundswell, but a candidate should be more than just the least bad alternative.
I wish that the “Moved” ad was an anomaly, that it was the last resort of a failing campaign or a fringe group. But it isn’t. Attack ads are a staple of election years, and hardly any candidates will run a campaign without them. Although the anti-Toomey ad was the most recent outrageous example that I saw, there is no shortage of anti-Sestak ads on the other side that are just as bad.
What is most absurd in this whole situation is that there are plenty of legitimate arguments against Pat Toomey. Despite defending him from misguided character assassination, I disagree with him on virtually every issue and fervently hope he does not win Arlen Specter’s current Senate seat. But I do not believe that appealing to xenophobia is the best way to defeat Toomey’s campaign. Instead of saying that he should run for Senate in China, explain how his voting record shows his radical conservative views — even more so than Rick Santorum. Explain how he has a 13 percent rating on civil rights issues from the ACLU. Explain how he has a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. Explain how he has voted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and how he has opposed measures to promote conservation and alternative energy. And explain how he supports an amendment to the United States Constitution banning same-sex marriage.
Given Toomey’s radically conservative views, the Sestak campaign should not have to resort to such laughable arguments. With politics in America as viciously partisan as they are, reasonable people should support those candidates who prize their achievements over their opponents’ faults. They should not be taken in by cheap attacks. They should examine the issues and vote for the candidate that will support their beliefs.

2010-10-25,CMU,China,"Project helps teach children in rural areas across China
According to researchers at Carnegie Mellon’s Mobile & Immersive Learning for Literacy in Emerging Economies (MILLEE) Project, mobile phone-based games could provide a new way to teach basic knowledge of Chinese language characters to students in underdeveloped and rural areas of China.
The results are based on a study that examined two specific mobile learning games. The preliminary tests were conducted with rural children in Xin’an, part of the Henan province in China. 
“We believe that the cooperative learning encouraged by the games contributed to character learning,” Matthew Kam, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute and the MILLEE project director, said in a university press release. “The results of our studies suggest that further development of these games could make inexpensive mobile phones important learning tools, particularly for children in underdeveloped rural areas.” 
As a part of this project, MILLEE researchers analyzed 25 traditional games played by children in China to identify different aspects of the games, including cooperation between players, songs, and handmade game objects. They then took these results and applied them to the development and design of the two educational mobile phone games used in the Xin’an study.
Students help in creation of animation for ABC show
The design team of the ABC network show, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, recently approached Carnegie Mellon for help in creating a segment for an episode. Students and faculty from the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) were asked to work with ABC over the summer to create an animation of the demolition of a Hamburg, Pa. house for an episode that aired yesterday at 8 p.m.
“Usually on the show, they send the family away on vacation for a week and the first thing the design team does is tear down the old house in some spectacular way,” ETC master’s student and team member Freddie Sulit said in a university press release. 
“This particular home, however, has historic value because it was built out of logs that were over 300 years old.”
Rather than taking the usual route of destroying the home, the cast and crew dismantled the various components of the home, attempting to salvage and reuse available materials. 
Instead of the usual demolition footage, the show’s design team imagined turning the transformation of the home into an animated fairy tale with the family as the main characters.
The team who created the show’s final animation included a producer, director, five artists, and three consultants. .

2010-10-25,CMU,China,"Chinese authorities have been outraged over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Liu Xiaobo, a dissident who is currently in prison in China. From summoning the Norwegian ambassador to discuss the award to putting Xiaobo’s wife under house arrest, the Chinese government has openly expressed its opposition to the Nobel decision. This attitude has once again proven the Chinese government’s reputation of having a complete disregard for the freedom of speech of its citizens.
In a much-needed move against the current government’s policies, a group of retired Chinese government officials and academics sent a letter last week to the government demanding complete press freedom in China. In the letter, the group stated that the Chinese government’s censorship over the press was in violation of the Chinese constitution. The letter stressed the need for reforming China’s current political system and saw freedom of speech as the first and most important step towards this end.
Although the letter was sent three days after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, there is no evidence that directly links the letter to the award. However, even if unrelated, it is a welcome message. It is encouraging to realize that those who were once the core of the Communist Party in China believe in freedom of speech. The letter is also an indication that some Chinese officials believe the current government has gone too far with its restrictive policies.
It is high time that the Chinese government ease some of its controlling policies, and we believe this is a positive step forward. Although it is naive to hope that the Chinese government actually carries out all the policy changes suggested in the letter, we hope government officials realize that their current policies are detrimental to the progress of the nation..

2010-11-01,CMU,China,"The month of November has just begun, and this means that National Pomegranate Month is here!
The pomegranate is pretty much the greatest fruit ever. First of all, it looks and tastes awesome. Eating a pomegranate is like getting the chance to experience Mother Nature at her best. She clearly outdid herself compared to her more mediocre works such as Niagara Falls or coral reefs. Second, pomegranates can do wonders for your health. An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Well, a pomegranate a day will supply you with a rich dose of heart-healthy antioxidants, help reduce blood pressure and the risk of blood clots, fight dental plaque, and may help prevent cancer. In some countries, pomegranates are popular because of their ability to prevent wrinkles and improve skin condition — they are estimated to contain an amount of antioxidants that considerably surpasses the amount contained in green tea and red wine. You think it sounds too good to be just a plain old fruit? You’re not alone in that. In fact, the pomegranate is actually categorized as a “superfruit” by the ACAI Health and Nutrition Resource Center because of its exceptional nutritional benefits combined with its unbelievable taste. Let’s see an apple try to compete with that.  
Also, the pomegranate has also historically been acknowleged as a symbol of fertility. It’s basically a red sac filled with an abundance of seeds — that image should speak for itself. With that image in mind, it’s easy to see how the pomegranate is also considered an aphrodisiac. While this is one of the fruit’s more risqué qualities, it is frequently associated with the pomegranate because of its sensual red color and its associated with Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Did you know that some people believe the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden actually might have been a pomegranate? Eve probably found out about its antioxidants and cancer-preventing qualities and was willing to get kicked out of the Garden of Eden just to get a taste. If you still need more convincing of the sheer awesomeness of this superfruit (as if the term “superfruit” isn’t convincing enough), there was a belief in ancient China that eating a lot of pomegranates could make you immortal. If there was an award for being awesome, looks like Dumbledore would have some serious competition.   
Despite the countless reasons why the pomegranate is the greatest fruit ever, it is true that eating one can be a bit of a hassle. A simple trick to make the process a little smoother is to cut the pomegranate through the rind in several places — without cutting into the seeds — and soak the fruit in a bowl of water for five minutes. This will make it easier to break apart the seeds, and before you know it, your taste buds will be going on a delicious adventure of sweetness with subtle tart undertones. so eating a pomegranate will taste awesome, improve your health with its fantastic nutritional value, make you beautiful by preventing wrinkles because of its overabundance of antioxidants, boost your libido, and might make you immortal. And you thought your iPhone could do it all. 
With your newfound appreciation of pomegranates, you are probably looking for a fun way to celebrate National Pomegranate Month — well, look no further! There is a myth that all pomegranates have exactly 613 seeds, so the next time you get your hands on this amazing fruit, try counting all the seeds!

2010-11-22,CMU,China,"Murder writing can be a dangerous business. For one thing, as murder mystery author Harriet Vane finds when she discovers a dead man’s body on a beach while vacationing, it can make an innocent woman look very suspicious, especially if she’s already been tried for murder once. 
For another, as Dorothy L. Sayers knew while writing Have His Carcase, it can be very difficult to make a plot feasible and enigmatic without relying on a deus ex machina, a “god from the machine” wherein a seemingly inextricable plot is abruptly solved thanks to an unexplained, godlike intervention. However, in true Sayers fashion, Have His Carcase avoids this pitfall neatly and comes off as a thought-provoking and dazzling addition to Sayers’ Lord Peter Wimsey series. 
What makes Sayers’ books different from most murder mysteries is the amount of detail that she puts into her work and the style in which she presents it: She neatly avoids the grittiness of a gory scene, though still getting across crucial points, and she makes descriptions palatable for readers who are less interested in what a cut throat looks like than in who did it.
Sayers also takes risks with her writing by basing mysteries around existing places, as she did with an artists’ colony in Scotland in her previous book The Five Red Herrings, and in Have His Carcase, where the murder takes place at a beach near a resort town, with the body of evidence quite literally about to be taken out by the tide. 
The book opens on Vane, the mystery writer who was accused of murdering her long-time beau in String Poison and cleared by Wimsey, who has fallen in love with her. Again, Vane is accused, but thanks to her detective acumen, she had taken as many pictures of the body and collected as much evidence as she could before high tide washed it away. 
For the bulk of the book, Wimsey and Vane must work together off the clues Vane found as the police dredge the bay of the small resort town for the body. Along the way, they must confront the difficulties of rising and falling tides, the lack of footprints along the sands, the fact that the deceased looks like he committed suicide, and the ludicrous allegations of the wealthy widow the deceased had intended to marry. 
The book is comical but never unbelievable: Sayers’ plot has all the twists and ingenious turns of a real-life caper gone astray, headlined by characters so well-developed and full that it’s jarring to remember that they’re fictional. 
Though the book does have a comic element — police unable to find the body after relentless searching, Wimsey’s constant requests for Vane to marry him, and a plot to restore the Russian czardom — it also addresses darker concerns just as unabashedly. Wimsey finds that Vane’s room has been searched and eventually explains that he’s been acting like a lovesick admirer in order to secretly help clear her name without arousing suspicion. 
Vane confronts the expectations for women as she observes the deceased’s intended bride being ridiculed for attempting to remarry at her extreme age, and the way Vane herself is being treated as a potential suspect, branded as a dangerous and intelligent female. The characters develop slowly but truthfully through the series, and that is what perhaps gives Sayers’ work its greatest appeal. 
Though deciphering out codes and finding holes in alibis is fascinating, perhaps Have His Carcase's greatest strength is how Sayers manages to coax out a complicated plot without losing the reality of her characters in the process. As always, a triumph..

Aspiring toward well-roundedness, Bard College in New York has instituted a new graduation requirement: a mandatory science class. The liberal arts college’s president, Leon Botstein, created a program called “Citizen Science” in order to diminish the “profound lack of scientific literacy” in non-technically focused Americans. The program is intensive and immersive, requiring six hours of lab daily for three weeks. Bard College aims to combat the United States’ falling academic standards in science and math, which rank it lower than countries like China, South Korea, and France.

Laser pointers negatively affect pilot performance
The Federal Aviation Administration released data on 2,836 reports of lasers being aimed at airplanes in 2010. This poses a great danger to the pilot because the sudden, intense beam of light shone into the dark cockpit can induce temporary blindness or distract pilots. The FAA’s administrator is contemplating a public awareness program, or a ban on lasers if extreme measures are required. Many of the incidents involved lasers that are far more powerful than the law allows, furthering the cause for legislative action.

Betelgeuse approaching supernova
The star Betelgeuse is approaching gravitational collapse. Stars radiate electromagnetic radiation in the form of light and heat by using fuel at their cores, such as the hydrogen in the sun, and performing nuclear fusion. Once a star begins radiating more energy than it produces, its mass decreases and it begins to collapse into itself due to its core’s own gravitational pull. When Betelgeuse collapses, which could occur as early as 2012 or as late as a million years from now, it will explode in a supernova millions of times brighter than the sun, and will create constant daylight on Earth for a few weeks.

Ancient pterosaur fossil and egg discovered in China
Scientists located a 160-million-year-old pterosaur adult fossil and egg belonging to the Darwinopterus species. This finding is especially significant for revealing the gender of the fossil (female) and thus allowing paleontologists to draw conclusions about physical variations between male and female pterosaurs. Pterosaurs were airborne reptiles that lived concurrently with dinosaurs, but are more closely related to extant reptiles like crocodiles. These animals laid soft-shelled eggs, which were most likely buried in the ground.

Johns Hopkins researcher studies brain activity 
Charles Limb of Johns Hopkins University has been studying the brains of rappers engaged in freestyling for over 10 years. When freestyling, the rappers in the study activated their medial prefrontal cortex, which is important in self-expression and individualism. Simultaneously, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex decreased activity, which led to less self-censoring and planning of actions. The rappers also showed an intensification of visual activity in the brain even when their eyes were closed, possibly signifying a link between the brain’s implementation of sight and a person’s creativity.

2011-01-24,CMU,China,"We read with alarm the controversial article “Why Chinese mothers are superior” published by The Wall Street Journal two weeks ago. Amy Chua, a successful Yale Law School professor, author, and Chinese mother, presented audiences with an excerpt from her upcoming book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, detailing exactly what the article title suggests in a rather arrogant and close-minded fashion. 
At first glance, the glowing accolades Chua says her daughters have received for their piano prowess, perfect grades, and being great at life in general would intimidate the average bystander. But what we see in this praise is just one facet of success. Chua’s parenting ways do have merit, and stereotypes often have a kernel of truth, yet Chua’s article is just a self-serving glorification of herself.
To be fair, the entire “Asian parent” stereotype does have wide acceptance and an impressive track record. Singapore, South Korea, and Japan consistently compete for the top spots in science and math test scores, with up-and-coming China not far behind. While Asian-Americans make up only 5 percent of the population in the U.S., their presence is disproportionately represented in universities. But before we give Chua and her stereotype too much credit, how do we explain that Asian-Americans — especially young Asian-American women ages 15 to 24 — have the highest suicide rate in America out of all minority groups? Unyielding pressure to succeed may have tragic consequences.
Chua’s blunt glorification of Asian parenting cannot justify itself with her or her children’s success. One nasty line, “Western parents have to struggle with their own conflicted feelings about achievement, and try to persuade themselves that they’re not disappointed about how their kids turned out,” is just one example of racism and arrogance combined with an inflated self-worth. Parenting is one of the most unconstrained jobs there is, and each parent instills diverse values that he or she deems vital to healthy growth, both physically and mentally. Condensing an 18-year stretch into a formula is not smart at all, but rather pessimistic — strict parenting, no independence, and a nothing-but-perfectionism attitude suggests that Chua does not believe she can raise two “successful” daughters by being nothing short of a tyrant, but also that she thinks that only by imposing mental duress and pressure will anyone find happiness. At the very least, she could be tactful..

2011-01-31,CMU,China,"Perhaps your New Year’s resolution — to go to the gym every day, or to spend less time on Facebook — hasn’t been going as well as you hoped. Well, luckily, there is another new year approaching to give you the chance to renew your resolutions. This year, the Chinese New Year takes place on Thursday, Feb. 3.
The date for the Chinese New Year varies each year, as it is determined by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, rather than the Western world’s Gregorian calendar. The Chinese New Year, sometimes referred to as the Lunar New Year, usually occurs on the second new moon after the winter solstice. This upcoming year will be the Year of the Rabbit, which occurs every 12 years. People born in the Year of the Rabbit are said to be artistic, gracious, lucky, and soft-spoken.
The Chinese New Year is not exclusively a Chinese celebration; it is also celebrated in many other Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In Vietnam, the Year of the Rabbit is translated as the Year of the Cat, due to the similarity between the Chinese symbol for rabbit and the Vietnamese word for cat.
According to Chinese legend, the first Chinese New Year celebration came about as a result of a small village’s attempt to rid itself of a mythical beast called Nien. Nien would come to the village the first day of every year and terrorize the village by devouring their livestock, crops, and children. One year, the villagers noticed that a little child wearing red had scared Nien away; they realized that the beast was afraid of the color red. Therefore, the following New Year, they hung red paper lanterns all around the village and put red spring scrolls on the doors and windows. They also lit firecrackers, with hopes that the noise would further scare the beast. From that year on, the villagers never saw Nien again.
The Chinese New Year has a host of traditional practices, such as giving the younger generation red envelopes containing money. Wearing red is a common practice, as is setting off fireworks. Dragon and lion dances are also common; the aggressive faces of either animal, performed to the deafening sounds of symbols, are intended to ward off evil spirits.
There is a large Chinese community present on Carnegie Mellon’s campus; last school year, 600 graduate and undergraduate students were citizens of China, according to Carnegie Mellon’s 2009–10 Factbook. Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) is one organization designed to help to these international students. “[The organization] helps new students start their lives in Pittsburgh, build a better community for Chinese students and scholars and contribute as a multicultural student organization at Carnegie Mellon,” according to the association’s website.
Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) is another student organization geared toward students of Chinese heritage; it hosts events throughout the school year designed to promote Chinese culture in the larger university community. One of its upcoming events is “One Night in Beijing,” an evening filled with Chinese cultural performances and Asian food. For those interested in emceeing the event, ARCC will hold auditions this Saturday at noon. In addition, groups interested in performing at the event should email  Allison Ko (asko@) by Feb. 7.
Chinese New Year at Carnegie Mellon
Given the size of Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese community, it should not come as a surprise that there are multiple events happening on campus in order to celebrate the Chinese New Year. This past Saturday, ARCC hosted a dinner with authentic Chinese dishes in honor of the holiday. “50 or 60 people were there.... They had a lot of good food and served us a lot of authentic dishes. Last year they had a lot of different performances before the dinner,” Cindy Wang, a junior in the Tepper School of Business, said.
The Chinese Studies program is also hosting a celebration of the new year this Friday at 5 p.m. in Porter Hall. The event will include Chinese food, a talent show, calligraphy demonstration and practice, Chinese games, and karaoke.
In addition, the Lunar Gala, named in honor of the Chinese Lunar New Year, traditionally takes place on the weekend of the Chinese New Year and begins with a celebration of Chinese culture. Last year, the gala began with three dances performed by members of the Oriental Star Dance School and displayed paper lanterns and served Chinese dumplings as a nod to Chinese culture.
Chinese New Year in Pittsburgh
Although Pittsburgh might not be the first city that comes to mind when one thinks of globalization and diversity, Pittsburgh in fact has a vibrant Chinese community. According to GlobalPittsburgh.org, waves of Chinese immigrants have been coming to Pittsburgh since the 1960s to settle down and study. The Pittsburgh Chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA-Pittsburgh) promotes Chinese culture throughout Pittsburgh and organizes groups such as the OCA Youth Performance Ensemble, which is a teenaged ensemble that performs Chinese dances and other Chinese folk arts.
OCA-Pittsburgh is hosting a banquet in honor of the new year on Feb. 17 at the Syria Shriners Center in Cheswick. The banquet, which has been an annual event since the 1980s, will include a lion dance from the OCA Youth Performance Ensemble, an Indian Bollywood Dance, and a Japanese Taiko drum performance.
Closer to Carnegie Mellon’s campus, the University of Pittsburgh’s Chinese American Student Association and the Vietnamese Student Association are hosting a new year’s celebration featuring games, a fashion show, and Chinese and Vietnamese food.
If you would rather celebrate the new year on your own time, there are plenty of Asian restaurants scattered about Pittsburgh. On Craig Street alone, there are multiple Chinese restaurants. Orient Express is right next to Starbucks on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street. Lulu’s Noodles is beloved for its bubble tea, but further up the street there is also Little Asia, where the food is inexpensive and more authentic than the other two restaurants.
In Shadyside there is China Palace, where one can get a large variety of high-quality food at a reasonable price. If you can afford a slightly higher price range, try going to Soba, a more modern restaurant in Shadyside. Through Feb. 3, the restaurant is offering a special Chinese New Year menu that includes a four-course meal for $35.
For Asian food that isn’t necessarily Chinese, the Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill serves authentic Taiwanese and Thai food, in addition to bubble tea, all at a reasonable price.
Whether you are of Chinese heritage, have an interest in Chinese culture, or are merely looking for an excuse to indulge in some delicious Chinese food, the upcoming Chinese New Year is a holiday rich with heritage that provides an opportunity to celebrate the new year once more..

2011-02-14,CMU,China,"While a large portion of our food supply is harvested from the land, there also exists an important underwater component of farming. On Feb. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a suggested procedure to the federal government about the future of American aquaculture, or the farming of aquatic organisms for human consumption and other uses. The NOAA, in a public statement released on its website, said that such practices could improve nationwide food production, advance technological innovations, and create jobs in coastal regions. Neither the argument for aquaculture, nor the resistance it has met by many who favor safer aquatic environmental practices, are new developments.
Modern aquaculture grew out of millennia-old practices of sea harvesting and fishing. After World War II, it became seriously considered as a viable source of food. Aquaculture in the 20th and 21st century took place primarily in Asia — over 70 percent of global aquaculture activity was in China in 2002, following forty years of growing business. In 1970, aquaculture made up 3.9 percent of worldwide fish production, and in thirty years, that number had risen to 27.3 percent. Three of the largest distributors of aquaculture products are Costco Wholesale Corporation, the Kroger Corporation, and Sysco Corporation, one of the largest food distributors in the world. According to an article about genetically engineered salmon in the Washington Post on Aug. 2, the global aquaculture market totaled over $86 billion.
There has been criticism, however, pointing to poor green practices in implementing aquaculture. A common cause of complaints against aquaculture is its effect on the natural populations of fish wildlife. Salmon and shrimp culturing is especially harmful, as reported by a publication on the Providence College website. Fish wastes, antibiotics, and uneaten food involved in this type of aquaculture increase algae and phytoplankton growth, which depletes the water of its oxygen levels.
SeaWeb, a nonprofit organization, suggested that the development of more carnivorous fish creates unsafe ecological conditions for the rest of the ocean, especially since many of these aquaculture farms need to be located directly on the ocean coast. Salmon and shrimp, being carnivorous, require the protein of other fish in their diets, sometimes up to three to five pounds worth of feeder fish. This creates a net loss in protein, since the salmon and shrimp are consuming more meat than they are producing.
There are potential environmental benefits that result from aquaculture. The same Providence College article suggests that catfish, tilapia, and freshwater carp are capable of converting harmful organic waste into fish meat that these fish can use to survive. Mollusks, clams, scallops, and oysters actually help reduce the deleterious effects by consuming the phytoplankton that deprives the water of its oxygen.
Some supporters point to aquaculture as a potential solution to the problem of non-native species, which can cause significant harm if introduced to a foreign environment. Aquaculture has the potential to raise species of marine organisms that find the natural environment uninhabitable in a secure closed system, in which all water and waste are analyzed for pollutants before being released. That way the marine organism, which could be harmful to the natural environment, will be restricted to the closed system and die out if exposed to the environment. 
The debate over the NOAA’s policies will continue as the organization opens up commentary to the public for the next 60 days. However, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco has summarized the ultimate goal of both sides of the argument: “As we rebuild wild fish populations, we recognize the world’s demand for safe, healthy seafood will continue to grow.”.

2011-02-14,CMU,China,"Super Bowl commercials, a yearly advertising highlight for many viewers, generally attract a great deal of attention. This year, one particular advertisement made a big splash. Groupon, a U.S.-based company that offers discounts to users from different local restaurants and companies, angered and offended viewers with its ad.
During said ad, actor Timothy Hutton appears to be bringing awareness of an international travesty to light. He looks to the camera and says, “The Tibetan people are in trouble. Their culture is in jeopardy.” Then the camera zooms out to show a Himalayan restaurant in Chicago, and in an enthusiastic tone, Hutton adds, “But they still whip up an amazing fish curry!”
Hutton then talks about a 50 percent discount he and other Groupon users received from the Himalayan restaurant in Chicago. Not only did this ad succeed in bringing American consumerism to a whole new level, but it also trivialized the plight of the Tibetan people. 
We think the ad was shallow and thoughtless, in addition to having little relevance to the purpose of the advertisement: to entice viewers to buy discounted merchandise.
The ad, which originally garnered criticism from Super Bowl viewers, has since become an international issue, as its humor fell flat with Chinese Internet users. Tibet has long been a source of domestic and international conflict for China ever since the country took over the region in 1951. As a result, much of Tibet’s unique Buddhist practices, cultural events, and spiritual traditions have been outlawed. Following an uprising in 1959, the Dalai Lama was forced into exile along with many of his followers.
Groupon claims the ad was created with the intent to generate support for the Tibet Fund, an organization that aims to preserve Tibetan culture. Similarly, Groupon’s other two ads, which featured Cuba Gooding Jr. talking about whales and Elizabeth Hurley talking about Brazil, were also meant to raise money for Greenpeace. All three ads were allegedly created to encourage viewers to give through a donation-accepting website, savethemoney.org. The site, however, was never mentioned in the ads and was taken down on Friday.
An ad that makes light of a country’s 50-year-long struggle against a ruling power is certainly not in best taste for Groupon, a company that has been attempting to enter the Chinese market for some time. Groupon Chief Executive Andrew Mason has apologized, pulled the ads, and promised a less-polarizing approach in future commercials. 
While we at The Tartan certainly cannot support Groupon’s misguided attempt at irony, we are grateful that the company has owned up to its mistakes, and we hope it will make smarter advertising decisions in the future..

2011-02-21,CMU,China,"Recently, young adults have been taking advantage of the opportunity to travel, as the number of students studying abroad has been on the rise. Carnegie Mellon’s Office of International Education (OIE) and its study abroad office offer 43 university-sponsored programs in 26 countries, providing various options for students.
Last year, a total of 488 Carnegie Mellon students traveled abroad, just under half of whom went through Carnegie Mellon’s own study abroad programs. The opportunity is becoming more common, as this number is almost double the number of students who studied abroad in the 2005–06 school year.
Although there has been a recent decrease in students spending an entire academic semester abroad, there is an increase in students traveling over “short-term” periods, such as spring and winter breaks.
Jaycie Galbraith, one of the two coordinators of Carnegie Mellon’s study abroad and exchange programs, gave some insight into the usual decisions of students pursuing a global experience.
“Most students go abroad during their junior year,” Galbraith said, “but we’re seeing increasing numbers during the sophomore and senior year.”
She also said that it’s “a common misconception” for students to believe that they can’t go abroad because of the restrictions of their major. Galbraith stated — and the statistics support her assertion — that students from every major offered at Carnegie Mellon have studied abroad this past year.
Though the word “study” is included in the term studying abroad, students agree that the experience should not be solely academic.
“I would caution people ... from overloading ... during their semester abroad,” said Peter Hendrickson, a junior policy management major who studied in Cape Town, South Africa.
The Tepper School of Business and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (H&SS) make up half of all students going abroad. Though it requires careful planning and consultations with both major-specific and study-abroad advisers, the possibility should not be ruled out for anyone.
Zach Stockwell, a junior information systems major who studied in Copenhagen, Denmark, said that he’d encourage students to study abroad “in a heartbeat.”
As far as destinations go, Europe is the most popular destination, with 155 of the 488 students venturing there, while 30 went to Oceania. A total of 51 countries were represented, including some non-traditional countries such as Nepal, Cyprus, and the Cook Islands. China was the most-visited country with 45 students, followed by Germany with 29 and finally South Africa with 27.
Although the opportunity to study abroad created new opportunities for students, they couldn’t help but miss a bit of home. “Mexican food,” said Stockwell, was what she missed most.
“Peanut butter ... and the lack of mosquitoes,” added Karalyn Baca, a senior Hispanic studies major who studied in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Despite any homesickness, most students look back on their time abroad as an absolutely positive experience.
Financial constraints can often make or break a decision regarding studying abroad. But students should know that there is help available, both internally and externally. 
Through Carnegie Mellon alone, there are 22 scholarships, funds, and grants for traveling abroad. 
Going through non-university-sponsored schools might not have a great amount of aid available, but external organizations often have their own scholarships and awards solely for students in that program. Students can receive a stipend from the university if they use a university-sponsored program. Covering necessary goods like meals and housing, the stipend can be an incentive to go through a the university’s program. An added benefit of these programs is that all Carnegie Mellon financial aid will carry over.
In short, studying abroad is an option for all students at Carnegie Mellon, regardless of their college or major. There are dozens of locations and financial options, so if there’s an interest, there’s a possibility.

2011-02-21,CMU,China,"The Chinese government will stop at nothing to censor its people. In particular, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter continue to be a main target for government censorship.
With the government’s “Great Firewall” selectively blocking Internet traffic to the outer world, China’s censorship is comprehensive and incredibly complex. Not only does China censor more content than other countries, but officials also remain deliberately ambiguous about what content is being censored and why. There is no transparency and no communication between the government and its citizens, limiting how people can debate or fight the established system.
In an attempt to keep its people happy, the Chinese government created its own heavily monitored social networking sites based on Facebook. These sites, though accomplishing the goal of connecting people across the vast country, are not an improvement from or an adequate compromise to the firewall. They are still completely under the government’s control, which leaves their users little freedom. The government still has the authority to censor and block whatever content it chooses on these sites.
There is hope for the Chinese people, however. Rising against the oppressive nature of the government, they have found ways to subvert authority. Although the costs are high, some Chinese Internet users have begun using Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to get around the country’s firewall. VPNs are traditionally used by businesses to give employees secured access to their corporate networks because they use private proxy servers that encrypt data.
Taking advantage of the VPNs, the Chinese people have found a way to subvert Internet constrictions. The VPNs allow Chinese users to anonymously browse and explore the Internet with unbounded freedom, and — most importantly — without censorship of any kind. 
This loophole opens up access to the actual sites of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for anyone in China to enjoy. As a result, China’s Facebook usage has exploded; the number of users has septupled between January and February of this year. 
The Chinese government cannot censor every piece of information from its people. The futility of trying to control the amount and type of information received by the public, when technology is constantly creating new ways to obtain that information, cannot be clearer than in the Chinese people’s use of VPNs. 
With the outer pressure of world news and the inner pressure of the Chinese people, we doubt that the government will be able to keep up its repressive censorship policies. We applaud the ingenuity of the Chinese people and their efforts to express themselves and their opinions despite heavy government intervention..

2011-04-25,CMU,China,"Study suggests southern Africa as language source
In an article recently published in Science, a biologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand has concluded that human language originated in southern Africa. Quentin Atkinson, the author of the study, used a mathematical model to trace common linguistic features back through time, much in the same way scientists trace the evolutionary history of organisms. While the oldest language tree that has been constructed so far — the Indo-European family — goes back 9,000 years, it is predicted that language itself originated between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.

Chimpanzees sacrifice initiative for conformity
Researchers at Georgia State University determined that in a social environment, chimpanzees would follow a dominant leader even when it meant receiving a worse outcome. In a situation with one dominant female and four subordinate chimpanzees, the subordinates mimicked the female’s actions. This occurred even though the other chimps had been trained to work towards a better reward. The lead researcher, Lydia Hopper, has theorized that the value of maintaining social alliances may outweigh the immediate value of a better reward.

Postpartum depression more likely in fall, winter
A study by researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden suggests that women who give birth between October and December may be twice as likely to develop postpartum depression than new mothers in the rest of the year. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, involved over 2,000 Swedish women. Because of Sweden’s high latitude and high variation in sunlight between summer and winter, the authors believe these seasonal effects may be less pronounced in other regions.

Biologists study disease-resistant mosquitoes
Andrea Crisanti and Austin Burt, molecular biologists at Imperial College London, are developing techniques to spread disease-resistant mosquitoes in the wild. Scientists have been working for some time to manipulate mosquitoes’ genetic code to avoid the transmission of diseases like malaria. Crisanti and Burt’s approach used a homing-endonuclease gene (HEG) to spread a genetic modification among a population of mosquitoes. HEG is a so-called “selfish” gene, which spreads rapidly through a population.

2011-09-12,CMU,China,"Last spring, along with several other Carnegie Mellon students, I participated in the Washington Semester Program at Georgetown University. The experience was nothing short of incredible — I loved being surrounded by people who were so interested in and informed about politics, policy, international affairs, and all the other topics centered in D.C. Being able to witness national and international events first-hand, such as the government’s near-shutdown and the announcement of Osama bin Laden’s death, was an amazing learning experience that will influence the rest of my academic and professional career.
My internship was probably the most important part of my experience in D.C. I worked at the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a government agency formed in 2005 by President Bush to distribute foreign aid in a more impactful way and to hold governments more accountable than USAID’s model. I worked in the Department of Private Sector Initiatives, which works to encourage public-private partnerships in our invested projects and encourages American companies to make investments that would allow the impact of our projects to continue, even after MCC had used up all its funding for the project.
Specifically, I worked on projects in Namibia, Malawi, and Ghana. I was most involved in the Namibia project, which focused on Indigenous Natural Products (INPs). These products, mostly roots and fruits, can only be found in certain parts of Southern Africa and are often gathered by Namibian women to earn extra income. MCC was asked to help figure out some potential methods of streamlining the supply chain of gatherers, aggregators, exporters, and importers. I conducted research on which U.S. markets would be the easiest and most profitable to enter (for example, many of these INPs could be used in cosmetics, various food products, herbal medicines, or as components of industrial processes). After gathering the information, I gave a presentation on barriers to entry into each of these markets and possible marketing strategies for each of these markets.
One really cool part of my internship was getting to attend conferences and meetings led by international development professionals from all over D.C., especially those focused in African agricultural development, which was my boss’s specialty. I learned a lot about the roles of governments, banks, small and large farmers, agricultural businesses, and technology in agricultural development, but mostly I learned just how much I didn’t know about the subject. I hope to make my future career in economic development, so this internship was an eye-opening experience that taught me a great deal about how governments and NGOs interact with developing countries.
In addition to the internship, the academics at Georgetown were great. My favorite parts were having constant access to high-quality (and often famous) guest speakers and the intriguing field trips. I also really enjoyed the independent research project, where I got the chance to research a topic closely related to my internship and hopefully to my future career, which was the role of China in African development. And, despite having never heard of “public diplomacy” before getting to Georgetown and being unsure how I ended up in such a class, I ended up really enjoying my academic seminar on the topic.
Public diplomacy refers to the government’s efforts to shape the public’s opinion of the U.S. in foreign countries. in In my public diplomacy class, I learned about how the U.S. conducts its public diplomacy and got to interact with people from interesting, diverse backgrounds, such as Voice of America, the Department of International Information Programs, and the Art in Embassies program. We also got the chance to visit various embassies to find out how they conduct their own public diplomacy in the United States, which was my favorite part of the course.
I even got a summer internship in the public diplomacy field, and spent the summer working in the Office of Public Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador. That internship was lots of fun and hugely informative, and my Washington Semester experience really allowed me to hit the ground running when I got to El Salvador. The information I picked up in D.C. about embassies, the Foreign Service, and public diplomacy was invaluable and made my transition to working in El Salvador much smoother. While I was there, I even got to visit an MCC project site and sent pictures back to my old boss in D.C.
I sometimes get a little nostalgic for the time I spent in D.C., but I know I’ll be back there again in the future. After such an awesome semester there, I know I won’t be able to stay away for too long..

2011-09-19,CMU,China,"Strolling into narrow alleys between fancy skyscrapers in China, it is not hard to notice the reddish character “Chai” painted on the old houses, which means “pull down.” The destiny these buildings will face, as “Chai” suggests, is demolition. This might not sound special, but it means a lot to those residents who are moved forcibly by the Chinese government and real estate companies.
The story of the documentary Meishi Street, screened in Margaret Morrison 203 last week in conjunction with the “Global Cities, Model Worlds” lecture, involves the protest of a “nail household,” a Chinese phrase for a house whose owner refuses to let it be demolished for the sake of modernization. As a part of Beijing’s modernization plan, Meishi Street, an old street in Beijing where Zhang Jinli lives, is under threat of being turned into a business area.
While most of the residents choose to compromise, Zhang refuses the displacement because he doesn’t want to leave the place he called home and because the government’s compensation offer is unfair. In protest, Zhang hangs banners and national flags on his house, writes petition letters (but never gets responses) and even sings aloud to attract public attention. However, the saddest point in the documentary comes when security guards request that Zhang to stop all of his protests. Not only is Zhang going to lose his home, he is deprived of the right to even protest about it.
In the movie, there are three parties involved: the government (represented by security guards and officials), the real estate companies (removal companies), and the residents. One might think that the government would speak for the people, or at the very least remain neutral, but the reality in China is almost the opposite. Residents have nowhere to seek help. So the banners hung on the street by the Chinese government saying “Demolition and removal in strict accordance with laws” seem exceptionally unnecessary — after all, residents have no other choice.
Despite frustrating results after all of Zhang’s efforts, the positive side we can gather from the movie is that Chinese people have begun to gain awareness of rights which they have been deprived in the past. They now know they can protest and, most importantly, should protest in a legal way, as Zhang did.
The movie winds up with a sad but thought-provoking ending. According to Mahatma Gandhi, “Housing is a right.” The movie rouses the audience to think about how we can popularize this right and resolve the conflict between modernization and citizens’ right to a home..

2011-09-19,CMU,China,"This past Thursday afternoon, Pittsburgh Biennial artists Sarah Ross, Ryan Griffis, and Lize Mogel gave a lecture titled “Global Cities, Model Worlds,” shedding some light on the oft-observed, but seldom discussed, impact of global “mega-events.” These events, such as the World’s Fair and Olympic Games, profoundly transform their host communities. Insightful and entertaining, the presentation did a fabulous job of analyzing the massive socioeconomic footprint created by the confluence of such vastly diverse cultures, accounting for both the positives and negatives.
Consider, for example, the Olympic Games. Originally an Ancient Greek test of strength and endurance, the Games were revived in 1896 by French academic Pierre de Coubertin. Griffis described Coubertin’s philosophy as “civilizing people by competition.” While his words may seem a bit archaic, Coubertin’s underlying belief in the profound impact of the Games still resonates in modern Games. The 2008 Beijing Olympics required close to a decade of planning, so much so that Mogel likened the effect to the creation of an “Olympic village, or a global city” — a sprawling and seemingly self-sustaining city-within-a-city, equipped with infrastructure, banks, labor, and security forces. Griffis noted that these efforts were by no means futile, that the Beijing Olympics constituted not only a “physical mega-event, but a heavily media-sponsored visual one, attended by hundreds of millions of viewers around the world.”
The World’s Fair, described by Griffis as “an international harmony of commerce and culture,” is another colossal global expo. After a visual presentation of several cities’ world fairs, the presenters emphasized a core idea in their research: the theme of global progress, particularly conveyed by the host city. Mogel evidenced this notion of a “progressive vision of global utopia” by giving the example of San Francisco’s 1939 International Expo. The city took the progressive undertones of the event to heart, building both the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges for that very purpose. The fair itself was held on the man-made Treasure Island, a public project once again undertaken for the sake of progress. Mogel concluded that these events have immensely “developed the city, especially in the years following the fair.”
The final portion of the presentation turned the rest on its head: What is the downside to these mega-events? The presenters returned to events in China, this time to discuss the 2010 Shanghai Expo. Attended by over 70 million people, the event was undoubtedly amazing. However, as Ross put it: “While the event put Shanghai on the map, there’s a lot we didn’t get to see.” In planning the expo, over 3.65 million square meters of property were demolished, displacing hundreds of thousands of families in the process. Those that resisted this forceful eviction were referred to as “nail households,” since the properties stuck out like nails in the ruin. Griffis concluded that these mega-events provide a sort of media shield for host cities, overshadowing blatant violations of civil rights with gaudy “manifestations of the progressive vision.”
The “Global Cities, Model Worlds” talk gave both illuminating evidence about the power of these mega-events and raised questions about the negative effects of their associated progress. The most amazing part about the lecture was that it just examined the tip of the iceberg; nobody can cover in one hour a history full of events whose impacts lasted centuries. However, even this brief introduction is incredibly thought-provoking; what if a mega-event came to Pittsburgh? How would it impact the city, for better or for worse?.

2011-09-19,CMU,China,"I am afraid of several things in modern American society — global warming, the national deficit — but nothing scares me more than the prospect that a political representative from the hyper-conservative Tea Party could quite possibly be elected into the presidential office within my lifetime. That being said, watching the CNN/Tea Party GOP Presidential Debate on Sept. 12 was like watching a seemingly endless compilation of every horror movie George Romero has ever directed, while standing in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the North and South Korea — horrifying.
The eight candidates at the the CNN/Tea Party GOP Presidential Debate, hosted by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, touched on all of the important topics during the broadcast. 
Topics of discussion within the two-hour debate included taxes, 9/11, oil dependency, taxes, healthcare reform, taxes, taxes, the HPV vaccine, taxes, and more.
The most popular topic, if you couldn’t guess, happened to be taxes. Each candidate proposed drastic tax cuts, and yet all of them expressed intentions to reduce the deficit. The candidates’ methods of reducing said national deficit, however, were almost always absurd or unspoken. For example, former Georgia congressman and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated that there is enough waste and swindling in government to balance our national budget without actually cutting any of the funding that finds its way to legitimate beneficiaries.
Former United States Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman also proposed a plan when it came to leading economic growth. “This country needs to wean itself from its heroin-like addiction to foreign oil,” said Huntsman. However, Huntsman later admitted to opposing the taxing of the consumption of oil, a measure that would in fact work to wean our dependence off foreign oil. Increasing domestic production, an idea that nearly all Republicans favor (including Huntsman), simply won’t succeed, because the U.S. doesn’t have enough oil within its territory to appease consumption rates. The majority of candidates danced around their deficit relief plans, leaving me with the impression that these candidates would either drastically increase the national deficit or propose devastating spending cuts they were obviously too afraid to mention in their campaigns. 
During the debates, each candidate was asked what he or she would do about the 45 million uninsured Americans, to which the group replied with a call for the end of Obamacare and the creation of “health savings accounts.” Texas Congressman Ron Paul — commonly referred to by media outlets as the original “godfather” of the Tea Party — attracted a lot of media attention when he argued that a healthy uninsured man who experiences a medical catastrophe should “assume responsibility” for his lack of coverage, insinuating that uninsured Americans should die for their insurance faux pas.
Following this statement, Paul then argued that churches would rescue the uninsured.
Perhaps the scariest moment of Paul’s statement was when the crowd cheered. As Chicago Sun-Times writer Richard Roeper asked in his Sept. 13 article, “politics aside, what kind of person cheers death?” Writer David Dayen of the FDL Newsdesk concluded his analysis of the Tea Party’s take on insurance with the following advice: “don’t get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.” While the Tea Party constituency is known for supporting limited government and personal responsibility, CBS’ Robert Hendren points out that it was in fact the president most adored by Tea Party members who signed the COBRA Act of 1986, which helped lead to the institutionalization of health care costs. “A healthy young American who doesn’t have health insurance suddenly needs emergency care,” said Hendren. “Federal law requires that that care is paid for. That law was passed in 1986, which means it was signed into law not by Mr. Obama or even Bill Clinton, but by Ronald Reagan.”
The biggest applause of the evening came from Gingrich’s statement referring to President Obama and his healthcare reform as “scary for the American people.” 
Both former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and Texas Governor Rick Perry called for healthcare reform; however, they refused to say whether or not they would undo the Medicare prescription drug benefit enacted under President George W. Bush, a massive benefit that Santorum voted for while in office.
The House of Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a woman that I would normally regard as the Al Capone of the Tea Party mafia and possibly my least favorite person in the world, withheld her usual Palin-esque anti-gay slander to deal a low blow to Rick Perry, pointing out that a certain drug company made millions of dollars off of a 2007 mandate which required Texas schoolgirls to receive HPV vaccinations.
After the broadcast ended, most media outlets searched for a ‘winner.’ Personally, I think they’re all losers, but if I had to pick one I guess I’d have to agree with Andrew Sullivan, a columnist for The Daily Beast. “Clearly the crowd loved Perry the most,” Sullivan wrote. “God help us.”

2011-10-10,CMU,China,"William S. Dietrich II, the former steel executive who recently announced a donation of $265 million to Carnegie Mellon, died this past Thursday, according to the John A. Freyvogel Inc. funeral home in Shadyside. The cause of death was given as complications from cancer. Dietrich was 73 years old.
Born in Pittsburgh, Dietrich made his fortune by transforming his father’s small steel warehouse and distribution business, Dietrich Industries, into the nation’s largest manufacturer of light metal framing for the construction industry. When Dietrich Industries was sold to Worthington Industries in 1996, Dietrich remained a director until 2008.
Dietrich was an active member of the Pittsburgh community; he served on the trustee boards for a variety of local institutions, including Carnegie Mellon, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, the UPMC Health System, and the University of Pittsburgh. 
Dietrich was also an author of many political and global history books. His recent works include In the Shadow of the Rising Sun: The Political Roots of an American Economic Decline and Eminent Pittsburghers, a collection of his essays. Before his death, he had been writing another book with the working title American Recessional: The U.S. Decline and the Rise of China.
Dietrich’s position on the boards of both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh reflected his commitment to fostering higher education in the Pennsylvania region. He also supported local universities with substantial monetary contributions.
On Sept. 7, Dietrich announced that he would be making a $265 million donation to Carnegie Mellon in the form of a charitable remainder trust. “This university puts Pittsburgh on anybody’s world map of great research cities,” Dietrich said at the celebration of his donation in September. “Brilliant people come here as students and faculty, and their presence in our community adds something extraordinary.”
University President Jared Cohon reflected on the event. “Since we all knew his days were numbered, the day of the announcement of his gift was not only a day to say thank you, but it was a way to say goodbye as well,” he said.
Near the end of September, Dietrich also announced his donation of $125 million to the University of Pittsburgh, the single largest gift in that school’s history. He was an alumnus of Pitt, having earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science there.
Each university renamed one of its academic colleges in honor of one of Dietrich’s parents. 
Carnegie Mellon renamed its School of Humanities and Social Sciences after his mother, Marianna Brown Dietrich, while Pitt’s School of Arts and Sciences will be renamed the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, after Dietrich’s father.
Dietrich is survived by his daughter, Anne Elizabeth Diemer, and nephew Kenneth Cascarella.
A private service will be held for Dietrich’s immediate family.
Cohon sent out an official school-wide announcement Friday afternoon giving his condolences and expressing his sympathies. “We have lost a great friend. May he rest in peace,” Cohon said in the email.

2011-10-17,CMU,China,"Earlier this summer, much of sports nation focused on one thing: the NFL lockout. Now that the NFL is back in business, it seems as if the “other” lockout has gone overlooked by many. I’m talking about the NBA lockout — you know, the one that has the first two weeks of the regular season already canceled. Given that the NBA is considering canceling the whole season, why hasn’t this lockout gotten any publicity whatsoever in the media?
I understand that the NBA does not have as great a following as the NFL, but since it is one of America’s four major sports organizations, I feel that some people actually care. However, I think the problem with the NBA lockout is that it doesn’t seem like the players care. All this talk about playing overseas has made the fans think that the players would almost rather play in places like China, Turkey, and Italy. In fact, a ton of players have already signed to play overseas, such as Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili — even Kobe Bryant has considered taking his talents overseas.
Not only are there games overseas, but there are also private league games that stars such as Kevin Durant have played on street corners and in gyms across the country. These leagues, some of which are run by celebrities, most notably the famous rapper “The Game,” have brought the superstars even closer to the fans and have been sources of amazing entertainment. Durant scored over 60 points in one of these scrimmages, and the Bulls youngster, John Lucas III, put up over 50 points in a game. 
This is “street” basketball at its best, with the best talents returning to the place where they learned basketball to put on a show. As if this weren’t enough, a game featuring Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, and other superstars, organized by Anthony, was just played, and it was a great success.
Another huge reason the NBA lockout doesn’t seem like a big deal is because it is nowhere close to being resolved. It is such a big deal that both sides won’t compromise, and it almost seems impossible that they will get this season underway. 
Apparently, the owners have been offering a deal that is nowhere close to the compensation that the players normally get, which is around 57 percent of basketball-related revenues. For much of last year, the owners complained that a majority of teams actually lost money during the NBA season, which I believe is false.
It’s clear that the owners are simply milking information in order to maximize their own profits, with no care for what the fans think about the league.
Adding to the problem is the fact that David Stern, the NBA commissioner, does not know how to handle the situation. Throughout the past three to four months, Stern has done nothing but add fuel to the fire by attacking the players and openly stating that the two sides are far from compromise. As if this were not enough, Stern has been setting deadlines for the two sides, but by the time the deadlines came, he had done very little to make enoughprogress to avoid the cancellation of games.
It is almost as if this thing is a huge joke, and Stern has no control over what is going on. We know it’s a sad day when the supposed leader of the league has no power.
All in all, we’re looking at a year in which we have no basketball, and while many of you probably do not care, it’s still a huge loss of entertainment to a good portion of society. I’m not sure what I’ll do in early May when I can’t root against Lebron James and the hated Miami Heat. On the bright side,  I won’t have to choose between watching the NFL, NHL, and NBA, since those games won’t overlap..

2011-10-17,CMU,China,"GigaPan print art on display in Gates, Hillman buildings
Several GigaPan prints from the exhibit at last year’s Fine International Conference on Gigapixel Imagery for Science will be placed on permanent display in the Gates and Hillman centers within the next week.
A reception as well as a walking tour to celebrate the newly installed pieces, titled “Panoramics and Precision,” will take place Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. and will begin on the fifth floor.
The works on permanent display will include Naoko Matsubara’s “Solitude,” a series of woodcuts inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s Walden; Stephanie Jenouvrier’s GigaPan image, “Penguins at Cape Crozier”; Molly Gibson’s “Barnacle,” an image created with a scanning electron microscope modified with GigaPan technology; Richard Bryant’s print of “Eagle’s Nest, Jubbah, Saudi Arabia”; and Chris Fastie’s “Bergamot and Hummingbirds, Vermont.” The pieces will be scattered throughout the Gates Hillman Complex.
The pieces were selected by the Gates Hillman Center Art Committee.
Three additional GigaPan prints are on display in Newell-Simon Hall. These pieces include Jason Buchheim’s “Galapagos Bait Ball of Salema,” Rurik List’s “From Sierra de en Medio,” and Andrew R. Deans’ and Matthew A. Bertone’s “The Big Four.” These pieces are, like the works in the Gates Hillman Complex, dispersed throughout the building’s floors.
ECE professor inducted into AAAS, intellectual society
Edmund M. Clarke, FORE Systems University Professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering, was one of the 179 national leaders who were inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) at a ceremony in Cambridge, Mass. last Saturday.
The official ceremony included the traditional signing of the Book of Members by participants such as Paul Simon, singer-songwriter; David Page, geneticist and director of the Whitehead Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Ei-Ichi Negishi, Nobel laureate and chemist at Purdue University.
The AAAS is one of the nation’s oldest intellectual societies. It is also an independent research center that draws from its members’ expertise to analyze and study science and technology policy, global security, the humanities and culture, social policy, and education.
Last Wednesday, Clarke gave a keynote address at the ninth International Symposium in Taipei, Taiwan. His address focused on automated technology and verification analysis.
On Oct. 26, he will present another keynote address at the Computing in the 21st Century Conference, hosted by Microsoft Research Asia and Tsinghua University in Beijing, China..

2011-10-31,CMU,China,"Pausch Bridge light shows designed by students, dean
The Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge showcased student-developed lighting designs, as well as a light show by School of Computer Science Dean Randal E. Bryant, last Thursday as part of Cèilidh Weekend.
The four student teams’ light shows will continue to be exhibited on the bridge for many months. 
Each student designed their shows with a different theme: “Fusion,” “A Day in the Life,” “Twitterbridge,” and “Time in Motion.”
The shows were created for a class on interactive expression and programming that was taught for the first time this semester by Cindy Limauro, a professor of lighting design in the School of Drama; Christopher Werner, an adjunct instructor of lighting design; and Eric Paulos, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
“The student shows embody the spirit of Randy Pausch in exploring unknown territory, taking risks, and creating a dynamic experience for the campus community,” Limauro said in a university press release.
In addition to the four student-designed Bridge lights, Bryant designed a show called “One Sort or Another,” a visual exploration of sorting algorithms. 
He used rectangles of different colors to represent items of different value, and his light show displays the effect of rearranging the items to put them in order. Bryant designed his show to use various sorting methods and different ways of partitioning the bridge lights into rectangles to generate thousands of sequences.
Washburn to participate in engineering symposium
Newell R. Washburn has been invited to attend the Frontiers of Engineering Education Symposium hosted by the National Academy of Engineering. 
Washburn is a Carnegie Mellon assistant professor in the departments of chemistry, materials science and engineering, and biomedical engineering.
The symposium will take place in Irvine, Calif., Nov. 13–16, and over 60 engineering researchers and educators plan to attend. According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, the program will focus on “teaching, project-based learning, active and self-directed learning, assessment of student learning, and innovation in education.”
“This is a wonderful opportunity and a great way to network with some of my research colleagues nationwide,” Washburn said in the press release. Washburn also hopes that engineering and science students will become interested in applying what they are learning in the classroom to the real world.
Edward F. Crawley, the chair of the symposium’s planning committee, stressed the importance of today’s engineers addressing the lack of leaders in their field.
The conference comes at a time when the United States is producing many fewer engineers than before. According to the National Academy of Engineering, fewer than 5 percent of bachelor’s degrees awarded in the United States are in an engineering field, compared to 44 percent in China..

2011-11-14,CMU,China,"The Chinese Student Association (CSA) hosted the Chinese Cultural Late Night in the University Center on Friday night.
The highlight of the event was a show by the band Free Bullet, comprised of six Carnegie Mellon students — two from mainland China, one from Taiwan, one from India, one from Korea, and one from the U.S.
Besides the live concert, CSA also offered free bubble tea, Chinese board games, and karaoke, one of the most popular entertainment activities in China. However, due to certain technical problems, the karaoke equipment did not work. 
“Through this event, we hope to spread Chinese culture, to make CSA a more active club, to make Chinese culture more mainstream in this school,” said Chang Qi, a junior mathematics major and the organizer of the Late Night event. 
She explained that last year’s Chinese Cultural Late Night was a combination of traditional and modern culture, but this time CSA focused more on modern Chinese culture, as evidenced by the Chinese pop music.
Jiaxing Yu, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said, “It’s a nice try to reach out for CSA, and people are really interested in this. Except for the not very Chinese band performance — otherwise it would be perfect.”
Since most of the songs Free Bullet played were American pop songs, several students said that they enjoyed the music, but did not know that it was specifically a Chinese Cultural Late Night event. 
Elliot Rosen, another first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said, “I had no idea, really. I was just there for the music. I didn’t know it was a Chinese culture thing, even though nearly everyone was Chinese ... but the music was good because I don’t see live music that much.”
Free Bullet was formed one month ago, according to the band leader, Pei Pang, a senior mathematics major.
“The thing is that we are a new band,” Pang said. “We tried to get all the connections we have to have shows. I’m very familiar with CSA.... Actually my old band played for them last year, but definitely the new band is better than the old band. It’s just a revisit to the show.” 
Pang also mentioned that it was hard for his new band to play Chinese pop music because the group is so international. 
“If we play a Chinese song, it’s probably kind of sad to [non-Chinese members],” he said. Yet Pang said they might incorporate more Asian or Chinese elements into their music in the future. 
“My drummer actually mentioned that he wants more exotic elements in the songs,” he said. “He thinks it’s pretty cool.”
Chinese Cultural Late Night is just one of the events celebrating Asian Heritage Month throughout November. There will be a Taiwanese Culture Night in the University Center on Nov. 19..

2011-11-21,CMU,China,"A university press release announced on Monday that Carnegie Mellon has formed an academic partnership with Sun Yat-sen University in China. The partnership is the next step in a series of international expansions.
Located in southern China in the city of Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen University will be the site of a new joint graduate program in electrical and computer engineering that will offer master’s degrees and doctorates, beginning in 2013.
As described in the official announcement email, the goal of the new joint institute of engineering is to “deliver world-class education in engineering, perform cutting-edge research and development, and find solutions to real-world engineering problems.”
Pradeep K. Khosla, the dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, described the new program in greater detail.
Located in Guangdong province, Sun Yat-sen University is at the heart of China’s “electronics belt,” as Khosla described it. The dean described his aspirations for the program, stating, “Our goal is to position [Sun Yat-sen University] as one of the top places for engineering in China.”
Jian-Gang “Jimmy” Zhu, an Instutite of Electrical and Electronics Engineers fellow, director of the Data Storage Systems Center, and professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering, was directly involved in the founding of this new program.
“China needs R&D forces,” Zhu said. “The Chinese higher education system is struggling to get graduates with a high enough quality of training for innovation.” He said that the new Carnegie Mellon partnership is the “next step” in achieving this goal.
First-year electrical and computer engineering major Chidimma Onwuegbule tentatively supported the new program, stating that it was “a good move, but some things need to be addressed.” She expressed concern regarding the political state of China and the effect it would have on this program. “Without the freedom of information, there is no guarantee that the quality of education from this program will be the same as here,” she said.
Khosla said that he was comfortable with setting up a partnership in China, stating that Carnegie Mellon had been in contact with the U.S. State Department prior to this deal and that “total intellectual freedom” had been guaranteed to researchers and students in the engineering program.
Khosla admitted that, if he were to be involved in the founding of a humanities or social sciences program in China, he “might be hesitant.” 
But he emphasized that Carnegie Mellon is “not developing an entire university” and claimed that social and political restrictions would not have an impact on engineering work.
Senior economics and professional writing double major Caroline Roper, the president of Carnegie Mellon’s Amnesty International chapter, was unsure. 
“In the past, greater economic growth has been correlated with more equitable human rights, but I don’t know if that can be assumed,” she said. “Nations can be distracted by economic development.”
Roper said she sees the program as slightly better than the newly announced Rwanda program, due to China’s better overall standard of living as well as an alleged smaller possibility of the products and research being developed from the new Chinese partnership program being used for military applications.
“Just because two countries may have different political and philosophical outlooks doesn’t mean they can’t have an economic connection,” Khosla contended. 
He promised that Carnegie Mellon “will see significant benefits” from the partnership, including approximately $25 million in new research funding.
“The university can’t afford to graduate someone who cannot operate globally,” Khosla said. 
The program is one means of further connecting students to different cultures, and Khosla spoke in favor of greater cultural training for undergraduate students.
While the partnership with Sun Yat-sen University opens up many new opportunities for Carnegie Mellon, some contend that its announcement was not widely publicized. Roper said that she wanted to know more about the program.
“The administration could do a better job of informing people,” she said..

2011-11-21,CMU,China,"Catching Ghost Particles in Oil and Plastic: The NOvA Experiment
Monday at 3 p.m.
Allen Hall 318, University of Pittsburgh
Luke Corwin, a post-doctorate fellow at Indiana University, will present and discuss his recent research in the field of neutrinos and particle physics, emphasizing the NOvA experiment.
Corwin will discuss neutrinos in detail, as well as how he believes they are some of the most mysterious particles in the known universe. 
Neutrinos are fundamental particles that weakly interact with other particles, and as a result are sometimes referred to as ghost particles. According to Corwin, particle physicists are actively trying to solve many unknowns about neutrinos, such as which neutrino type is heaviest and how they change from one type to another.
After his preliminary discussion on neutrinos, Corwin will delve into a talk about the NOvA experiment. This experiment is one of the latest generation of neutrino detection mechanisms being built to find out more about the particles. Currently, the mechanism is under construction at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in northern Minnesota. It will consist of a near and far detector composed mainly of PVC extrusions and scintillating mineral oil. Corwin’s lecture will review the motivation, current status, and future plans for this experiment.

2012-01-30,CMU,China,"Exposure to PFCs could reduce immune response
A recent study suggests that exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) can reduce immune response to vaccines. These compounds have been used for decades and are most commonly found in nonstick coatings and food packaging. Studies in animals have already suggested that PFCs suppress immune response, but the effects of PFCs in humans have not been well understood. 
The study, led by researchers at Harvard University, examined how children with high levels of PFC exposure responded to vaccinations. The results showed that five-year-old children with higher PFC levels had weaker responses to diphtheria vaccines, suggesting a possible link between PFC exposure to an underdeveloped immune system. The EPA is already taking measures to eliminate certain PFCs in manufactured products.

Magnetically responsive soaps could aid in oil spill
Chemists at the University of Bristol in the U.K. recently developed magnetically responsive soap that can potentially be used to clean up oils without leaving behind harmful residues. To make the soap, the researchers dissolved iron particles in water that contained chlorine and bromine ions, common materials found in household cleaning products. The soap molecules contain metal centers, which allow them to be controlled by magnetic fields. 
Using magnets, researchers were able to pull the soap through layered solutions of water and oil and demonstrate a simple way to recover the soap from the bulk solution. The physical properties of most soaps are controlled by temperature and pH, so the addition of magnetic functionality introduces another design parameter for creating new soap compounds.

New definition of autism is more stringent
For the first time in 17 years, the American Psychiatric Association is reassessing the definitions of autism and related disorders. Researchers from Yale University have performed a preliminary analysis on the potential impacts of this new definition  of autism by assessing data from a 1993 study on children and adults with autistic disorders. They determined the fraction of those individuals that would no longer be considered autistic under the proposed definition. 
Their results showed that 55 percent of high-functioning individuals would no longer qualify as autistic under the new definition, whereas only 25 percent of those previously diagnosed with “classic autism” would no longer be diagnosed with autism. Narrowing the criteria for autistic disorders would make it more difficult for individuals to qualify for health, educational, and social services.

North Star slowly fading away in the night sky
The North Star, also known as Polaris, may be shrinking according to a group of German astrophysicists. Over 160 years of observations suggest that the star, which sits over the North Pole because of its alignment with the Earth’s axis, may be shedding an amount of gas equivalent to Earth’s mass every year. The scientists measured the star’s pulse — the length of time between periods when the star grows dimmer and brighter. The data show that since 1844, the star’s pulse has been decreasing, on average, about 4.5 seconds every year. The changing rate is higher than what would normally be assumed to match the standard model for stellar evolution, suggesting that the star may actually be shrinking.

Apple posts $13 billion in profits from latest quarter
Apple Inc. recently released figures for its first quarter earnings, which shattered sales records in several categories. Apple executives are “very happy to have generated over $17.5 billion in cash flow from operations during the December quarter,” according to Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer. 
The reported net profit of $13.06 billion this quarter is over twice the reported profits from last year, and several products have experienced growth in sales. A record 37 million iPhone units and 15.4 million iPads were sold this year, which rounds out to 128 and 111 percent, respectively, in unit gains compared to the previous year. The success of the iPhone as a smart phone and portable audio device comes at the expense of the iPod, which was the only product line to experience a decline in sales.

China to finally set cap on carbon emissions
The Chinese government has called for seven cities and provinces to set caps on their greenhouse gas emissions. This is the first time the Chinese government has ordered any absolute caps on emissions, previously setting “carbon intensity” targets. This act is one of the first concrete steps that the country has taken  to address climate issues. 
Thus far, the Chinese government has delayed in setting a national cap on greenhouse gas emissions, citing the need for prioritizing economic growth. Rather than placing an absolute cap on emissions, targets have instead been set in terms of an amount of greenhouse gas per unit of GDP. The current five-year plan requires the country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent per unit of GDP.

2012-01-30,CMU,China,"“If you shut up and listen, maybe you’ll learn something,” The Onion's head writer Carol Kolb said, beginning her talk in McConomy Auditorium last Monday.
Sarcasm was to be expected from Kolb, the previous editor-in-chief of The Onion, a satirical newspaper. The Onion was established at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1988 by Tim Keck and Chris Johnson. 
Since then, it has become a national publication with an online edition and a television program. Kolb became involved with the paper after establishing herself through other comedy projects during her time at UW-Madison.
Inspiration for The Onion comes from serious sources. “I just read the news,” Kolb said. “Either making fun of what’s in it or actually just making fun of the business of news and how flashy everything is and how dumbed down some stories are.” The amount of real research that goes into each article or video for The Onion varies with the writer’s familiarity with the subject. If, for example, a writer knows little about how a bill is passed, some research will be done on the bill before he or she writes the article. 
The only news programs that are not targets of The Onion’s satirical comments are ones that are already satirical in nature. “You want to make sure you’re coming up with your own ideas,” Kolb said. The satire of The Onion does have a history, however, of not being recognized as such. News sources from China’s Beijing Evening News to Fox News have reissued The Onion’s stories as true.
Despite the success of The Onion, the worry of falling flat still crosses Kolb’s mind. “Even more than we want things to have a point, we just want to make people laugh, so that always is a fear of just sort of making something too heavy-handed or not funny enough,” Kolb explained. “That’s always the hardest thing, having a point and making it be satirical but also having it be fun and silly.”
There is one worry that Kolb does not have, however. “There certainly are people out there who don’t find it funny or find us offensive, and we just kind of don’t care. Don’t read us, then.” With the anything-goes style of The Onion, nothing is off limits. However, Kolb noted that the publication does think about who it’s making fun of before they make a joke. “[The] 9/11 issue was a good example. We didn’t want to offend anyone,” she said.
The one topic that people get sensitive about, Kolb said, is animals. In response to an article titled “Puppy Bowl Marred by Tragic Spinal Injury,” The Onion received an intensely negative response. “ ‘You went too far when you covered this,’ ” Kolb said, in the words of the critics. “Not when you made fun of cancer, or you made fun of the troops...” In 2007, The Onion introduced the Onion News Network (ONN), a mock news program. “We definitely did have to re-learn what we were doing,” Kolb said. “We couldn’t just do what we did in the paper. We looked into modern 24-hour cable news.”
One major difference is the lack of the “stodgy voice” the newspaper has. Instead of looking to precision in journalistic formality, the program is designed to be flashy and eye-catching.
“It kind of has to be,” Kolb said. “Especially when we were doing video, we found it just had to be a little more engaging. It’s enjoyable to read something, but I think watching video, you need it to keep grabbing your attention — otherwise you’re going to turn it off.”
The ONN continues to grab viewers’ attention. The show has been renewed for a second season on IFC, thanks to “nine billion viewers across 811 countries,” according to Kolb. 
Many members of Carnegie Mellon’s satirical newspaper readme were in the audience. Emily Forney, a senior linguistics and Russian studies major and editor-in-chief of readme, said that she related to one of Kolb’s comments that  anything can spur satire, including a simple comment from the writer’s mother. Joe Selinger, a junior chemical engineering major and writer for readme, noted a difference between the articles he writes and those of The Onion. “Our articles do a lot of more college-related humor,” Selinger said.
Kolb shared advice for aspiring satirists in the audience. “Try to think of something new. A new format or a new voice or something,” she said. “When I started writing, as compared to a few years of writing, the difference was huge,” Kolb said. “You just have to write a lot and get people to read it who will be critical of what you’re doing and actually say, ‘That’s not funny,’ or ‘That’s not good,’ and then just keep doing it.”.

2012-02-13,CMU,China,"China’s authoritarian government is as tense a topic now as it was 60 years ago. Various activist groups’ attempts to modernize China into a democracy only increase the tension.
Last Friday, these tensions were pushed even further when Zhu Yufu, one of the founders of the federally unrecognized Democracy Party of China, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for circulating a poem titled “It’s Time” online. He is accused of writing this poem to rally democratic activists to promote an uprising in China.
From an American perspective, Zhu should have the rights to free speech and the press.
Freedom of speech is an innate liberty to humanity that should not be repressed.
The alleged subversion of state power not only has a grave overtone, but it is also difficult to repeal, especially with a criminal record.
Zhu was imprisoned twice before this incident: once from 1999 to 2006 for helping the foundation of the Democracy Party, and again from 2007 to 2009 for pushing a police officer.
In a nutshell, the law states that anyone who tries to defame the government in order to undermine its authority will endure a long prison sentence.
This includes even the most minor of offenses, like a blog article, or in this case, a poem.
Zhu’s poem suggests that the Chinese citizens should assemble to attempt a rebellion against the authoritarian party, like the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia early last year, that resulted in the ousting of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The Jasmine Revolution argued for fair and equal rights, and it expanded into Egypt.
Zhu insinuated that the Chinese activists should cause a similarly effective uproar to fight for democracy.
It may not be the prettiest or cleanest campaign, but in the face of such opposition, great measures are often necessary to ensure freedom of speech.
If Zhu had written this poem in America, a lawsuit and a trial would most likely not even be considered. It’s a simple classification of freedom of expression, a right that should be extended universally. In America, the implications of China’s regulations on freedom of expression seem unjust.
The Chinese government plays by a different set of rules, a set that Zhu’s actions clearly break. Zhu attempted to undermine the government and therefore broke the law. In China, it is just another example of committing a crime.
Perhaps the Chinese government will someday reach a compromise and accept such democratic values, but for now, the words of Abraham Lincoln come to mind: “The best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly.”
The best way to repeal Zhu’s sentence and fight for democracy might be to revolt, or it might be to play the game and wait for the other team to lose its footing..

2012-03-05,CMU,China,"Artificial womb lets scientists observe embryonic growth
A team of researchers at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom have created a new device made from soft polymers that mimics the mammalian uterus. With this technology, researchers are now able to continuously observe the growth of embryonic cells outside of the womb through to the eighth day of development, a huge improvement from the previous four-day limit that forced scientists to return these cells back to the mother’s womb. 
Because of this technology, scientists are able to directly observe the continuing changes in embryos after four days, including the crucial formation of the head. This breakthrough is part of a larger effort at the university to learn how the development of the human embryo can teach researchers methods for repairing the human body.

Memory chip uses light, not electricity, to store data
Researchers at a Japanese telecom company have built an optical random access memory (o-RAM) chip that uses light, rather than electricity, to store data. Each memory cell in the o-RAM is a nanoscale light-capturing crystal capable of channeling light in very small spaces. Varying the intensity of light through the chip allows each crystal to switch between transparent and opaque states, modeling zeroes and ones. 
While the technology is still a ways off from use in conventional desktop machines, researchers are hoping that it can help speed up the sluggish performance of internet switches that manage traffic between high-volume servers, since light travels much faster than electric signals.

NASA falls victim to numerous cyber-attacks
NASA was the victim of 47 sophisticated cyber-attacks in 2011, according to a report the agency released last week. These attacks have allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to employee credentials, the control systems of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the security codes used to operate the International Space Station, among other things. In total, the agency reported 5,408 incidents that “resulted in the installation of malicious software on or unauthorized access to its systems” in both 2010 and 2011. 
These developments come at an unfortunate time for NASA, as Americans continue to assess the roles the expensive agency should or should not play in future explorations of the final frontier.

Despite mid-age slump, elderly people sleep best
A telephone survey of more than 150,000 adults suggested that, aside from a slight decline during a person’s 40s, sleep quality on the whole actually gets better with age. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, focused on asking a large sample of randomly selected people questions about the quality of their sleep. Since these responses were mostly the opinions of the participants involved, researcher Michael Grandner offered a possible explanation for the data.
“Even if sleep among older Americans is actually worse than in younger adults, feelings about [sleep quality] still improve with age,” he said.

Jurassic fleas eight times larger than modern fleas
A fossil of a prehistoric flea from the Jurassic era was recently uncovered in China. At 20.6 millimeters (nearly one inch), the 165-million-year-old flea was eight times bigger than the modern flea, and still manages to dwarf even the largest living flea, which comes in at only 12.6 millimeters. These prehistoric fleas also had vicious, straw-like mouths with serrated edges — perfect for biting into the hides of the dinosaurs they lived on. 
“It really appears as though they were specialized for working their way into some heavy hides, such as those on dinasaurs,” Michael Engel, a co-author of the study, said in an interview with New Scientist. Unlike modern fleas, however, the prehistoric flea had poorly developed legs, and thus was incapable of jumping.

Space tourism company tests new spaceship
Virgin Galactic, a space tourism company under the Virgin Group corporation, is aiming to test fly its new SpaceShipTwo spacecraft this year. Commercial suborbital passenger service will give riders a few minutes, at an altitude of about 68 miles, to experience zero gravity and view the Earth set against the backdrop of outer space. The service could commence as soon as next year, company officials said last week. Nearly 500 customers have signed up for these $200,000 rides in the six-passenger, two-pilot ship. 
“We would like to be the first to do this, but we’re not in a race with anyone,” chief test pilot David Mackay said. “This is not a Cold War-era space race.”

2012-04-09,CMU,China,"Particle collider running with more power
Geneva’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator on Earth, resumed operations last week after a few months of inactivity. The experiments, which began last Thursday, reached record-breaking energy levels of 8 trillion electron-volts. The LHC will be active until November, when it will be upgraded over the following 20 months. The upgrades will give the collider a top energy of 14 trillion electron-volts.
One of the primary goals of the LHC, and of this year’s experiments in particular, is to find evidence of the Higgs boson. Sometimes called the “God particle,” the Higgs is a theoretical subatomic particle that may be the reason why matter has mass. The hunt for the Higgs has been a focus of physicists for years, with experiments at the Tevatron, another collider located in Batavia, Ill., giving inconclusive evidence of its existence at the end of last year.

New link found between CO2, global warming
Research on carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature during the Pleistocene ice ages (2.5 million to 11,700 years ago) has provided additional evidence that carbon dioxide levels and global climate are linked. A team led by scientists from Harvard University, Columbia University, and Oregon State University extrapolated core-ice samples from the Antarctic to establish a global record of surface temperatures.
In previous studies, it appeared that carbon dioxide levels rose after temperature increased, leading climate skeptics to question the role of carbon dioxide in climate change. This recent report shows that rising temperatures both correlated with and lagged behind increases in carbon dioxide concentrations. The researchers concluded that increased carbon dioxide levels explain much of how the planet was able to warm up from the last ice age.

DARPA challenge aims to involve humanoid robot
According to industry sources, the next Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge will require teams to build humanoid robots able to work in industrial disasters and rough terrain. DARPA is a division of the military that pursues cutting-edge research, with famous results such as ARPANET, part of the original internet. 
The Grand Challenge is a competition funded by the agency in which teams must complete a specified scenario. Previous competitions have included urban and desert races for automated vehicles. Carnegie Mellon’s Tartan Racing won the 2007 urban challenge.
In the new challenge, teams will have to construct bipedal, humanoid robots that can operate with only supervisory control. Robots will need to drive a utility vehicle, unlock a room with a key, enter the room, and cross a debris-strewn floor. After this, the robot must climb a ladder and interact with a pump and valve.

Scientists find feathery dinosaur in China
Paleontologists in China’s Liaoning province have unearthed fossils of the largest feathered creature ever discovered, called Yutyrannus huali. This dinosaur weighed 1.4 metric tons, or over 3,000 pounds, and was about the length of a school bus. It lived about 125 million years ago.
Fossil evidence suggests that the species was covered entirely with feathers. However, researchers are not sure exactly what purpose the feathers had since the creature’s size made flight out of the question.
Because the dinosaurs lived in an area with an average temperature of 50°F, the cold-blooded creatures may have needed additional insulation. Although paleontologists previously thought large body size excluded feathers, recent discoveries of medium-sized feathered dinosaurs, and now Yutyrannus huali, present new possibilities.

Human Genome Project moves to Amazon
The 1,000 Genomes Project, an effort of the National Institutes of Health and the largest database of human genetics, will be moving to Amazon’s cloud services. Although the genetic data was previously available online, it was costly and it required interested scientists to have powerful computing resources. Amazon hosting will drastically cut costs for researchers in terms of both access and analysis.
The 1,000 Genomes Project actually includes genomic data from 1,700 individuals, with 900 more samples being added this year. One of the project’s goals is to enable research that more accurately predicts disease based on genetic factors. Two-hundred terabytes of  genetic data will be transferred to Amazon — an amount so large that it would require  30,000 DVDs’ worth of storage. The transfer is part of a larger government-wide initiative to make large datasets more widely available for analysis.

Google announced that it is testing Project Glass, a set of augmented reality glasses that include a clear display that sits above the right eye.  The built-in display technology can stream information to the lens, and the wearer can interact with the device through voice commands. Potential uses identified by Google include visualizing maps, taking photos, and video conferencing.
Although rumors have existed about Project Glass for months, the development team made the first official announcement on Google+ last week. The devices run a version of the Android operating system used on smartphones, and they also have GPS and motion sensors. Although the glasses are not yet for sale, Google plans to test them with the public.

2012-04-09,CMU,China,"Fragrant smells, bright colors, and chirping birds await visitors of the Phipps Conservatory Spring Flower Show. Described as “a trip around the world” on the Phipps website, the month-long show offers plenty of variety to engage patrons of all ages and tastes. From interactive displays to tranquil spots, this year’s show lets viewers escape the hustle and bustle of campus in exchange for some peace and quiet.
The main atrium includes large, brightly colored, stick figure-esque pieces of art, adding to the show’s playfulness and serving as a nice introduction to the bombardment of vibrantly colored flowers to come. Another piece of artwork in the atrium includes cut outs of the flags of each country represented in the show: the United States, Greece, France, the Netherlands, China, Sweden, the French Polynesian Islands, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Germany, Holland, and Ireland.
Housed in the Serpentine Room are tulips representing Holland and the Netherlands. Shades of bright yellows, oranges, and purples combined with the room’s tall ceilings allow for a beautiful view of the tulips lining three of the walls. Amid signs describing the flowers of the region stand large, wooden, brightly painted tulips with pairs of clogs fastened to the bottom of the tulips for decoration. The exhibit is made possible in part by the Distinctively Dutch Festival. Supported by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the Distinctively Dutch Festival focuses on bringing contemporary art, performance, and culture from the Netherlands to Pittsburgh in exhibits like this one.
Some rooms have themes set in a broader context than just a country, like the orchid room. Boasting hundreds of orchids of different shapes, colors, smells, and sizes, winding along a small river swarming with koi fish, the room includes educational signs for visitors answering the question, “What is an orchid?” According to the signs, the orchid is a member of the largest and most advanced blooming plant family, and there are approximately 35,000 orchids and 80,000 orchid hybrids throughout the world.
The exhibit honoring Japan is outside, unlike the majority of the other exhibits. Away from the hum of other patrons and secluded on a corner of the roof, the exhibit features a variety of bonsai trees set on wooden tables, a small waterfall running through the middle, and more swimming koi fish.
The exhibits for China and France are organized to be observed, as opposed to most others that can be walked through. The China exhibit is outfitted mainly in red and gold, described by the accompanying placard as colors of good luck and good fortune for the year to come. The France exhibit includes tables and chairs reminiscent of a Paris street café and was topped with a miniature Eiffel Tower.
The exhibit representing London includes a bright red, life-size telephone booth. Upon further examination of the flowers in the room, patrons will notice they are specifically arranged by color to resemble a large British flag. Other features to watch for include an interactive fountain in the room on Greece and a children’s market with plastic food to teach younger guests about eating locally and choosing healthy options.
The Tropical Forest India exhibit will be at Phipps for the next three years and focuses on sustainability. Larger in size and scale than any other exhibit, the room features winding paths and displays intended to replicate actual Indian markets. According to Phipps employee Kara Gilbert, “They sent two people from the horticulture staff to India for research. They were there for five weeks, I think, so they did a lot of research throughout different sections of India to represent the plants that you see here.”
Gilbert also explained the process behind getting exhibits in and out of Phipps. Before the summer show, there will be a two-week blackout period while old plants are taken out and new plants put in their place. In the case of the India exhibit, about 80 percent of the plants from the previous forest were removed to make room for the new forest. The removed plants are either saved for use in later exhibits, or composted for use with the new plants.
Gilbert thanks the volunteers for the speedy turnover in new exhibitions. “We depend a lot on our volunteers,” she said. “Our volunteers are wonderful, they come in and help rip out plants and plant new ones.” Thanks to the work of these volunteers and the Phipps staff, the Spring Flower Show offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in an around-the-globe adventure of nature.
The Spring Flower Show will be on display until April 15..

2012-04-16,CMU,China,"Amid the jovial chaos of Spring Carnival, the Carnegie Mellon Filmmaking Club is offering an opportunity to take a three-hour breather and gain some insight into the world of student filmmaking. The Loop: Carnival Film Festival 2012 will take place in McConomy Auditorium on Friday at 2 p.m. and will feature a selection of short student films.
The festival primarily serves to showcase and promote student films, although it’s also a tribute to the art of filmmaking. The festival’s title pays homage to the zoetrope, a device dating back to ancient China that creates the illusion of animation with a circular projection “loop” of moving images.
Beyond the historical context, the title also has a symbolic meaning: Like the rotating images of a zoetrope, the film festival cycles through different periods in the history of filmmaking, incorporating both the old and new. As the title suggests, this festival will take a back-to-the-basics approach, showcasing silent films and other tributes to movie-making techniques.
The Filmmaking Club, a student organization on campus that creates and educates about student films, has devoted many hours in preparation for organizing and hosting the event. Members of the club, who hail from a wide range of fields of study, learn key skills and work together on collaborative projects, several of which end up in the festival.
“We all come together and use our skills to make a really, really cool project,” said club president Benjamin Welmond, a senior art major with a focus in film.
Besides showcasing student work, the festival also strives to raise awareness for a little-explored activity on campus. Though the Filmmaking Club plays a central role in the festival, organizers of the event seek to expand interest in filmmaking to all students.
“It is our hope to reach out to more members of the CMU community,” said Hannah Polack, a sophomore professional and creative writing double major and public relations manager for the festival.
By attending the festival, viewers will also gain an appreciation for the extent of the work that goes into filmmaking. For the students who produce these films, making movies is often harder than it seems. “There’s so much more than just a camera and a script,” Welmond said.
According to Welmond, the filmmaking process is tedious and difficult, and many students encounter failure before creating a successful film. The results can be highly rewarding, however. “It’s hard, but eventually you’ll make it if you keep trying,” he said.
The students whose work will be on display this Friday will surely experience this sense of gratification from seeing their films on the big screen and from introducing other Carnegie Mellon students to the nature of their work in filmmaking..

2012-04-16,CMU,China,"Phillip H. Scanlan, the Australian consul general in New York, visited Carnegie Mellon and gave a lecture last Tuesday on the future of Australia in a changing world. 
Scanlan focused on the future of the G-20 and how Australia’s position in the world will change as its neighboring developing nations like Indonesia advance economically.
Scanlan said that Australia is shifting its strategy from that of a big economy to that of a consistent high performer. According to Scanlan, Australia has thrived economically, but will soon be surpassed by its neighbors because of their higher populations.
Scanlan believes that the solution to this problem is global engagement. He said that if Australia works with its neighbors to promote cooperation in the southwest Pacific, it could create an economic environment where each nation benefits from each other’s growth through the free flow of ideas, people, and trade.
In order to promote international cooperation, Scanlan founded the non-governmental organization Australian American Leadership Dialogue to bring together young leaders from the U.S., China, India, Australia, and other nations to network and form a spirit of partnership and collaboration. 
Scanlan has continued his efforts toward international cooperation as consul general through the New York Young Leaders program. The program gives young leaders the opportunity to discuss issues behind closed doors, free from the pressure of internal politics or other political and cultural norms that stand between their nations.
Master’s student at the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management Amy Badiani, who attended a luncheon with Scanlan on Wednesday, spoke positively of the program. “Because of [the program’s] nature behind closed doors ... young leaders have actually created change,” Badiani said.
Scanlan said the goal of constructing networks for leaders of various nations is to solve global issues multilaterally. Scanlan pointed to climate change, intellectual property reform, immigration, and the fight against human trafficking as global problems that require mutual cooperation to find and execute solutions. According to Scanlan, while unilateral action can improve the situation for one nation, without international accord, problems simply shift across borders.
Students who attended the lecture and luncheon seemed to find Scanlan’s ideas interesting. “I think it was good that he visited CMU, because he was able to convey Australia’s role in global politics,” Badiani said.
“[The lecture] was informative,” said Carmen Easterwood, a senior economics major. “He seems like a really intelligent guy.”.

On April 6, reports of the story broke from Chenzhou, a city in China’s Hunan province. A teenager with the surname Wang wanted an iPhone and an iPad. The black market wanted a kidney. Five people helped 17-year-old Wang surgically remove his kidney.
This black market deal was a clean-cut procedure. It wasn’t as though a handful of felons carved out his kidney with a pocketknife; there was a professional on board.This group included a practicing doctor in addition to criminals, such as transplant organizer He Wei, who turned to crime after accumulating gambling debts. The group is currently being charged with “intentional injury.”
The procedure collected 220,000 yuan, approximately $35,000. Wei distributed the money amongst the accomplices and medical officials who helped with the procedure. Wang received 22,000 yuan, approximately $3,500, in exchange for his kidney.
Exchanging an organ for cash is simply stupid, especially when the reason is to buy an iPhone and an iPad. Under special, extreme circumstances, selling an organ could be justified. But selling a kidney to satisfy the need to keep up with the latest technology trend is not a necessity, and it’s definitely not worth the medical risk.
Besides, what happens when the iPhone 5 comes out? There are only so many organs to go around for Apple products.
As shocking as it seems that someone would just sell his kidney in order to keep up with new technology, the most mind-blowing part of this story is the fact that Wang only received 10 percent of the profits from selling his kidney.
He was completely ripped off. Obviously he can’t cut labor costs, but in the grand scheme of things, to receive such a small amount for such a huge procedure is not quite fair. Sure $3,500 is enough to pay for the iPhone and the iPad, and still have plenty of cash left over for fun Apple accessories, but is that really enough to suffice for the loss of a perfectly healthy kidney?
The moral of the story is that if you’re going to sell your kidney, be smart and demand more for it — just kidding. 
The real moral of the story is that desperation for the latest and greatest technology is unhealthy. 
Wang’s desire for Apple products is an example of extreme consumerism, and it represents the extent to which people try to keep up with the latest fad. 
Wang physically harmed himself to keep up with technology trends, and in the process, he lost a kidney, a deal, and his dignity..

2012-04-23,CMU,China,"The recent Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, has drawn media attention because of the Secret Service scandal. Unfortunately, what was discussed at the summit has not received as much scrutiny by the U.S. media. The event had no major achievements and, as usual, the Latin American countries stood united in pushing the U.S. to recognize Cuba.
This summit, however, differed from others because the push for Cuba’s recognition and future invitation to the next summit was led by Colombia, the United States’ closest ally in the region. This is surprising, since the Colombian president is a moderate conservative, not known for any communist sympathies. The U.S. needs to reform its policies and work with the suggestions of regional leaders like Colombia in order to achieve true progress.
The current U.S. administration needs to either recognize Cuba — thus ending a policy that injures U.S. influence and respect south of our border — or continue our embargo on Cuba in order to win the swing state of Florida. President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia pointed out as much, stating that the current administration will fold on the issue in three years, presumably after the presidential and midterm elections have passed, when President Barack Obama does not need to appeal to the Cuban-American vote in Florida. Opening trade with Cuba would benefit the U.S. economy, especially southern Florida, and thus benefit the current administration, since the U.S. historically was Cuba’s No. 1 trading partner. Currently, we lag far behind China, Canada, and the Netherlands in terms of trade with Cuba.
The second unique aspect of the summit was Santos’ leadership in the push for ending or at least modifying the U.S. War on Drugs. Drug production in Colombia has decreased over the past six years, yet total drug production in Latin America has remained unchanged, with drug cultivation simply shifting borders. The war on drugs in Latin America is another failing policy for two reasons: It does nothing to affect the so-far inelastic demand in the U.S., and the criminalization of drugs creates a black market premium. Both of these reasons draw the criminal underworld throughout the Americas into the drug trade. Because of this, drug production moves from regions with U.S.-backed anti-narcotic operations to regions lacking such aid.
Colombia’s leadership on both of these issues matters to the U.S. not only because of its status as an ally, but also because — over the past decade — Colombia has risen from a near-failed state suffering a three-sided civil war to a rising star and a regional leader. Although the U.S. has had a questionable past with Latin America, we still can have a role to play if we work with our allies and support decisions made by democratic leaders of all political stripes in Latin America, even if those choices are out of line with U.S. foreign policy.
The candidate that wins the next presidential election will have to compromise with our southern neighbors, or see relations cool with  them. Nicaragua and Ecuador boycotted the summit in protest, and if no change is made by the U.S., several more nations will join them in three years..

2012-04-30,CMU,China,"In the original 1960s television series Star Trek, all one had to do was ask the ship’s computer a question and it would automatically search through every book ever written to find the relevant information for the answer. This is what Gloriana St. Clair, Carnegie Mellon’s dean of University Libraries, hopes for the future of libraries.
St. Clair, 72, has watched over Carnegie Mellon’s books for nearly 15 years. Her lengthy career will come to a close in June 2013, as she plans to retire and spend time on her own research endeavors. Throughout her time at Carnegie Mellon, she has not only managed the books in Hunt Library, but also millions of others around the world.
Since 1999, St. Clair has been working alongside colleagues in the School of Computer Science to digitize millions of books. Digitizing books is “the direction society is going in,” according to St. Clair, who has worked in the library business since 1963. With Carnegie Mellon computer science professors Raj Reddy, Michael Shamos, and Jaime Carbonell, St. Clair developed the Million Book Project. Collaborating with several U.S. partners and a broad coalition of libraries and computer scientists in India and China, the project digitized over 1.5 million books and made them free to read on the internet.
Since her undergraduate days at the University of California, Berkeley, St. Clair has had an interest in the intersection between technology and printed texts. She originally received her bachelor’s degree in English in 1962, but the job market pushed her toward a career in library sciences. “I was sitting outside a class, waiting for it to start, and there were few other people standing there,” St. Clair said. “They were talking about going to library school because there weren’t very many jobs for people in English, and there were a lot in library studies. And I thought, ‘Hmm. I could do that.’ ”
A master’s in library science is mandatory for any practicing librarian. The field is interdisciplinary. Library science utilizes management; information technology; education; collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and political economy of information.
St. Clair received her master’s degree from UC Berkeley in 1963. “And at that time, it was one of the top three schools,” she said. “Generally, you could get jobs in academic libraries, in public libraries, in special libraries, and children’s libraries.”
For her library sciences degree, St. Clair specialized in technology. “I was kind of focused on academic libraries and on science and technology,” she said. “So as soon as I finished the program, I immediately got a job as a cataloguer at the Water Regional Center Archives at Berkeley.”
It was this initial emphasis on the technological aspect of library sciences that spurred St. Clair’s interest in the digitization of books during the rest of her career as a librarian. She has held 13 different positions, working across multiple institutions, such as Pennsylvania State University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Oklahoma. As the digital age came into focus and she began her work at Carnegie Mellon, St. Clair immediately found a niche for her interests.
“Raj Reddy was the dean of computer science when I came here as head of the library. I went around to all the deans to talk to them about what their needs were and what they wanted from the library,” St. Clair explained. “I went to him and walked in, and said, ‘The future of libraries is digital.’ So we talked for an hour, and then he sent his colleague Mike Shamos over to meet me and make sure that I was a true believer that we should digitize books and they should be free to read.”
This moment marked the start of what would become the Million Books Project, something St. Clair is very proud of. It began as a “proof of concept” project — she and her colleagues started by digitizing 1,000 books to see if the concept was feasible. The team then moved onto larger numbers and collaborated with international partners.
“So then I became a director of Universal Libraries, which was a project that [Reddy] had ongoing, and we were interested in how we could manage to digitize a million books,” St. Clair said. “We started out by convening a bunch of librarians from states that don’t get as much National Science Foundation money as other states, and that didn’t work out. So he began to work internationally and work with his colleagues in China and India, and we started two Million Books Projects, one in China and one in India.”
Currently, the project in China has managed to digitize approximately 2 million books, while the project in India digitized about 300,000.
According to St. Clair, the Million Books Project was in part the inspiration for the Google Books program, which has digitized about 20 million books.
“The power of digitization is knowledge,” St. Clair said. She cited the story of a current Carnegie Mellon student who is getting his Ph.D. in English. St. Clair explained that his dissertation was on Charles Darwin, and she had helped him use digitized copies of Darwin’s books for his research. 
“All of Darwin’s books are digitized and searchable through Google Books, and he doesn’t need to read every single page; he can use key words to find the bits of information he’s interested in,” St. Clair said.
This is St. Clair’s goal for the future of libraries. She hopes that someday “people all over the world will have the information they need because of digitization.”
As for libraries being potentially threatened from such easy and accessible knowledge through digitization and the internet, St. Clair isn’t worried. She remains confident that neither libraries nor librarians will ever go out of business. 
“They will always have a use as long as books need to be paid for, as long as people need help sorting through information, as long as people need help differentiating between good and bad information,” she said. “People will always need libraries.”.

2012-08-19,CMU,China,"To the surprise of very few, the U.S. had the most fruitful Olympic scores of participating nations, finishing with a whopping 104 medals and bringing home a total of 46 gold medals.
The 2012 Olympic games saw the U.S. bounce back from its 2008 gold medal count of 36, second to China’s 51. 
Although the U.S. won the total medal count in Beijing, winning both the gold count and total count was a nice improvement from four years ago.
Although the U.S. was successful in this year’s Olympics, there were a few disappointing performances for the red, white, and blue.
In men’s beach volleyball, Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhauser — the reigning gold medalists from the Beijing Olympics — looked poised to bring back another gold for America. But in an early round, they were beaten in straight sets (21—17 and 21—19) by Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo of Italy. 
Rogers said before the match that he was playing on a sore hamstring, and it showed. He only registered 11 of his 29 swings as kills and recorded just 13 digs in the two matches. 
Dalhauser’s performance was subpar as well, with just 10 kills and one block — low numbers for arguably the best player in men’s beach volleyball.
The other American team, Jacob Gibb and Sam Rosenthal, made it to the quarterfinals before losing 2-1 to the bronze-winning Latvian team of Martins Plavins and Janis Smedins.
The U.S. also couldn’t live up to its expectations in men’s gymnastics. Previously considered one of the best, the American team failed to grab a medal while the Chinese team dominated the events. “There’s definitely a disappointment,” U.S. captain Jonathan Horton said, as reported by the Associated Press. “We’re one of the best teams in the world.”
After finishing seventh on pommel horse, the men’s team was bumped down to last place. However, their excellent performance on the rings put them back into medal contention. Unfortunately, John Orozco’s fall on the vault did the Americans in.
“I fell on my butt,” Orozco told the Associated Press.
Despite the handful of disappointing performances by U.S. athletes, Americans were overwhelmingly successful in a majority of the other Olympic events.
The U.S. team dominated Olympic basketball, going 8–0 and winning by an average of 32 points per game. The team met Spain in the gold medal match, just as it did in the 2008 Olympics.
This was an aggressive game, but the U.S. managed to pull away and win 107–100. This marks the last Olympic game for superstar Kobe Bryant and head coach Mike Krzyzewski. “Can’t believe the games are over, seems like yesterday we were walking into the stadium with nerves of excitement and dreams of Gold,” Bryant told the Associated Press.
In women’s beach volleyball, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings took their third consecutive gold, after winning in 2004 and 2008, setting an Olympic record. In the gold medal match, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings beat the other American team, April Ross and Jennifer Kessy, in straight sets, winning 21–16 in both.
It did not come as a surprise when the U.S. team dominated the pools, winning 16 golds in swimming and 31 total swimming medals. Competing in a total of 24 events, Michael Phelps won four gold and two silver medals in this year’s Olympic games, setting Olympic records and bringing his career medal count to 22 and gold medal count to 18.
At the young age of 17, American swimmer Missy Franklin led the women in medals with five total — four gold and one bronze. “I can’t believe you just did that!” Phelps told Franklin after she scored gold just 15 minutes after qualifying for the 200-meter freestyle final.
The 2016 Summer Olympics will held be in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and with the abundance of young athletes like Franklin and men’s swimmer Ryan Lochte, as well as a cluster of young basketball talent, the U.S. is poised to dominate the field once again..

2012-09-10,CMU,China,"Coming from anyone else, the phrase, “As an individual, you can be more powerful than a whole country,” would seem hopelessly naïve.
But for Ai Weiwei, Chinese artist, dissident, and the subject of the recent documentary Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, this statement is not only obvious fact — it may as well be the motto for his life’s work.
Never Sorry, currently playing at the Harris Theater in Downtown, chronicles Ai’s life and work in protest against an oppressive political regime. Famed for his incendiary and often profane artistic voice, Ai frequently found himself at odds with the Chinese government — from publicly criticizing the 2008 Beijing Olympics to investigating the deaths of thousands of schoolchildren in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Although it does not focus on Ai’s artistic ventures, Never Sorry perfectly balances political context with Ai’s rich personal story.
Created by first-time director Alison Klayman during her time as a freelance journalist in China, the film has won several international awards, including the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and Official Selection at the Berlin International Film Festival. According to the documentary website, the film aims to highlight a digital-age dissident who inspires on a global scale through a combination of art and politics.
Never Sorry slowly draws out Ai’s character over the course of the film. While the documentary centers primarily on his political work, the filmmakers also grant viewers insightful glimpses into the man behind the work, including a particularly poignant response to an interview question, a touching conversation with his mother, and a flash of defiance when he recounts his latest brush with the police. The result is a rich and compelling portrait of Ai: a humble yet stoic 55-year-old man, deeply burdened by his activism but duty-bound to continue it.
The disappointingly few artistic pieces featured in the film are powerful and fascinating: His 1997 work “Coca-Cola vase,” for example, features a Neolithic vase (over 3,000 years old) with a simple Coca-Cola logo painted across the front. Though certainly an act of defiance against the current Chinese establishment, this piece has important artistic merit, even when removed from the political context.
By defaming something so ancient and culturally sacred, Ai has raised a highly provocative and artistically valid question: Are some objects so sacred as to be untouchable? Or are all objects simply objects? Amid the more dominant political elements of the film, messages like these — which are also important to understanding Ai’s life and work — are often lost.
Although the film does not fully explore all aspects of Ai’s life and work, Never Sorry strikes a good balance between condemning the Chinese government and praising one of its dissidents. The film is far from pure propaganda, and yet throughout the documentary we are constantly reminded of the grave context surrounding Ai’s work. Amid this commentary, the filmmakers are also able to flesh out Ai’s fascinating and oftentimes elusive character. In this way, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is in equal parts a compelling portrait of a daring artist and a criticism of the oppressive circumstances that surround him.
Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry will be playing at the Harris Theater (809 Liberty Ave.) through Sept. 13..

2012-10-15,CMU,China,"In recent decades, significant advances in particle physics have been made through experiments conducted by particle accelerators. While the most well-known and talked about accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there are many other accelerators around the world, including the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC) and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Virginia — all of which Carnegie Mellon professors have worked with. 
The LHC is a gigantic particle accelerator that lies 100 meters underground between the borders of Switzerland and France. It accelerates protons or lead ions inside its circular track, which then collide head-on at high energy levels. The particles created by these collisions are then analyzed in detectors.
“Carnegie Mellon has been involved in the design and construction of the CMS,” said physics professor Helmut Vogel, one of several faculty members working with the LHC, in reference to the Compact Muon Solenoid detector. “We also helped write the software and build part of the hardware. We are now involved in data analysis.”
One of the main goals of the LHC is to detect the elusive Higgs boson, a particle theorized to give other particles mass. However, many of the particles that the LHC seeks to discover, including the Higgs, have lifespans that are much too short to leave tracks in the detectors. Instead, scientists use simulations to predict the decay products of such particles, and look for these in the detectors.
“We have found something that in some ways behaves like the predictions for the Higgs, although we don’t have the amount of data yet to tell with high precision,” Vogel said. Further research supporting this newly discovered Higgs-like particle would prove that the current model of how the world works is correct. 
Meanwhile, a different type of particle physics experiment is going on at the BEPC in China. While the work being done at the LHC is referred to as the “energy frontier,” the BEPC focuses more on the “intensity frontier.” Instead of searching for the existence of undetected particles, precision measurements of particular known particles are studied to test how well their behavior agrees with theoretical models.
“Electron-positron collisions are used to produce various bound states of charm quarks,” wrote Carnegie Mellon physics professor Roy Briere, who collaborates with the BEPC, in his research statement. Data from this collider will answer important questions, such as the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. 
In Virginia, the Jefferson Lab is probing the behavior of quarks. Michael Darcy, a junior physics major who interned with the lab over the summer, described the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, the lab’s particle accelerator: “It accelerates electrons with superconducting radio-frequency cavities around a racetrack-shaped tunnel.”
“Jefferson Labs currently has three running experimental stations called Hall A, B, and C,” he said, describing the lab. “Electrons from the beamline can be split into these three different rooms and each room has a different kind of particle detector in it.” A fourth hall is currently under construction and will be used to perform the GlueX experiment, for which physics professor Curtis Meyer is the spokesperson. GlueX aims to discover exotic mesons — a postulated but yet-undiscovered type of meson made of two quarks and two anti-quarks. 
So why is it important to spend time and money on these immense projects? Vogel gave two reasons.
The first is cultural: “What is the benefit of knowing the Earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around? It is knowledge that contributes to the culture of society. Even if it has no direct impact on building a better microwave, or better cars.... It is valuable knowledge.” 
His second reason is more practical for those seeking a career: “Particle accelerators are immensely complicated apparatuses that take people with very sophisticated skills to build. These experiments are training a new generation of people with enormous skills that are very marketable, and very sought after, in many fields.”.

2012-10-15,CMU,China,"The National Endowment for the Arts’ 2009 report “Reading on the Rise” said that 47 percent of adults read at least one work of fiction in 2008. Not even half of America made it through a single short story that year, and that statistic is considered an improvement.
But we do read. We spend our time online: watching videos, browsing photos, and reading text online. From Facebook statuses to online news to our favorite nearly pornographic e-book, we are probably reading more words than ever; they simply aren’t coming from literary classics or the nation’s poet laureate. And if anything, the last decade has shown that we can collectively come together and read, from community-based big reads and one-book projects to the thermonuclear success of a single boy wizard.
None of this is wrong: Reading and writing — online or not — and developing tastes are important, even if these tastes are shared with our 450 million closest friends. But for voracious readers, there is a constant goal to expand one’s oeuvre, to find something new. So it’s worth a look when, each year in autumn, the Swedish Academy places the Nobel crown on the head of their most recently glorified author.
This year, the prize went to Mo Yan, a Chinese fiction writer who is probably utterly unknown to most American readers. His work, unlike much contemporary Chinese fiction, has been translated into English, largely because of Howard Goldblatt’s more than two decades of translating Chinese writers. Because of this, you could start reading one of Mo’s books now. Seriously, don’t let the rest of this article get in your way. Start with Red Sorghum or Life and Death are Wearing Me Out. You can even get the latter on your Kindle or e-reader of choice.
Many people have had their views of the Nobel Prize handed to them wholesale by the media, and think that these prizes are simply political gestures. Particularly resentful Americans believe that the Swedish Academy’s stubbornness to reward the best of our own country’s writers means it should be ignored. Politics are certainly at work in these awards, but the Academy still manages to select writers of fiction that is absolutely worth reading. The 2008 laureate Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio’s stories are terrifyingly depressing. Doris Lessing, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, defined whole genres. John M. Coetzee, the 2003 laureate, is one of our best living writers.
Politics are obviously involved. China can now proudly claim a Nobel Prize and at the same time happily continue pretending that the prizes its nationals won in 2000 and 2010 never happened. Arguably, Mo deserves the award for that alone: He has managed to successfully write oft-satirical novels, which are widely banned; has gained global acclaim; and yet remains in good standing with the Chinese government.
For example, take The Republic of Wine — an engrossing novel that rotates between detective Ding Gou’er and the short stories of Li Yidou. Between the fantastical elements of investigating baby cannibalism, audacious displays of government corruption and debauchery, and the uneven talents of a young writer, Mo is able to guide us through a tour of food and drink in China. Right from the lady trucker opening, Mo proves that he can spin a tale that delights, while providing a greater social commentary.
But consider these literary awards as recommendations from some very well-read friends. You may now go read Mo’s work, or, if you are a holdout, peruse the National Book Award finalists or wait until the Man Booker Prize is announced tomorrow. Awards will keep coming, the books will keep piling up: Read one..

2012-12-03,CMU,China,"With a new semester approaching, most Carnegie Mellon students are finalizing their schedules. For those students who still need one more class, foreign languages are a trend that seems to be increasingly worthwhile.
According to a Modern Language Association (MLA) enrollment survey, more than 1.6 million undergraduates who attend American colleges and universities this year will take at least one foreign language class at some point in their college careers. That works out to a national average of 9 percent per university. Susan Polanski, the head of Carnegie Mellon’s modern languages department, said that at Carnegie Mellon, it’s 52 percent.
According to the MLA, interest in language study has been steadily on the rise since the late ’90s. Executive Director Rosemary G. Feal said in an MLA press release, “Students increasingly see their futures taking place in a multilingual world, and they want language preparation to help them function in that world.”
Which foreign languages are American undergraduates studying these days? While 70 percent pick one of the three historically most popular languages — Spanish, French, or German — those who want to try something different will find a long list of languages to choose from. And that list is growing.
The study of Portuguese, in particular, is gaining popularity. According to Ana Paula Carvalho, the University of Pittsburgh’s Portuguese language coordinator, one out of two Latin Americans speaks Portuguese, as it has always been an important language. But now Brazil is the sixth largest economy in the world, which has led to more demand for Portuguese speakers in both business and international relations.
Carvalho has seen not just an increase in enrollment in Portuguese courses at Pitt (which now offers a minor in Portuguese), but also a broadening awareness of Brazilian culture, particularly music, dance, and food. Pitt’s Brazil Club — the Brazil Nuts — becomes more active each year, recently hosting an annual Brazil festival.
Last summer, Carvalho led a group of 14 Pitt undergraduates in a unique study-abroad program in Brazil.
“Over six weeks, the students conducted research studies in Brazil. They didn’t take classes. They set up interviews and used questionnaires, and then they finalized their research papers after they returned to Pittsburgh,” Carvalho said. Students in the group were majoring in engineering, linguistics, and political science, and there was even one student from the dental school.
Carvalho said, “Fourteen students were chosen out of 50 applications, and all of their expenses were covered.”
Another language that students choose to study is Mandarin Chinese. Enrollment has risen in U.S. universities from 34,000 in 2002 to 61,000 in 2009. Polanski illustrated how Chinese language studies have expanded. At Carnegie Mellon, there were five students studying Mandarin Chinese in 1992. Polanski said, “Initially we hired a tutor, and the courses were taught through distance learning. Today, over 300 students fill 23 sections of Chinese language courses at Carnegie Mellon.”
Mark Dyehouse, a sophomore Chinese and physics double major, had the opportunity to take three years of Chinese in high school. Unlike many students who take Chinese language classes, Dyehouse has no Chinese heritage.
“I began to find the many facets of the language, culture, and history fascinating,” he said. “I visited China and Hong Kong for a few weeks last summer, which intensified the hold that the language had on me.” He would like to become fluent and to potentially use his Chinese language skills to conduct research in physics.
Many Pittsburghers’ roots are Slavic, so it makes sense that Pitt’s department of Slavic languages and literature offers Russian, Polish, Slovak, Ukrainian, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Czech, and Bulgarian. Those languages are also taught during the summer, with Hungarian and Turkish added to the mix.
“In addition,” said Christine Metil, director of the Summer Language Institute, “for the next three years, Pitt will host the Baltic Studies Summer Internship, the only program in the country to offer Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian.”
The U.S. government is always looking for speakers of “critical languages,” a constantly-changing list tied to areas of conflict in the world. According to the American Councils for International Education website, in 2006, the U.S. Department of State, along with the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, set up the Critical Language Scholarship Program to “expand dramatically the number of Americans studying and mastering critical-need foreign languages.”
This year, 631 critical language scholarships (out of over 5,200 applicants) were awarded for the study of Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bangla/Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Punjabi, Russian, Turkish, and Urdu. 
The scholarships cover all costs, including travel between the student’s home city and program location, orientation costs, visa fees, and room and  board.
“Critical languages” are often not taught in college language programs. Claude Mauk, the director of Pitt’s Less-Commonly-Taught Languages Center, knows all about that: “This center, which is part of the Linguistics Department, began in the 1960s, mostly for graduate students to help with their research. Now it’s mostly undergraduate.”
The assortment of languages offered through the center changes often, but at the moment, the list includes Farsi, Swahili (the only truly African language taught at Pitt), American Sign Language (ASL), Arabic, Modern Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Irish Gaelic, Swedish, Icelandic, Turkish, Vietnamese, and Quechua (a language spoken in the Andes).
Of all of the languages in which the center provides instruction to undergraduates, Arabic has had the highest gain in percentage of students since 2002.
“In the fall of 2001,” Mauk said, “Arabic was fourth as far as student enrollments. It was behind ASL, Irish Gaelic, and Swahili. By spring of 2002, the number of Arabic student enrollments doubled. In 2009 the number of students enrolled was 352, up from 75 in 2002. And this was after Carnegie Mellon started their own Arabic language courses.” If not for budget cuts, it would likely be much higher.
The field of careers for critical language speakers is growing. Do you speak Ibo/Igbo (spoken in Nigeria)? How about Assamese (spoken in northeast India)? If you do, the U.S. government has translator job openings right now. Becoming a translator generally requires more than an undergraduate language degree, but even a passing knowledge of another language can be useful for travel or perhaps as the basis for a completely different career.
Erin Taylor is a junior math and linguistics double major. She is fluent in French and Spanish, and studies Italian at Carnegie Mellon. “I’m looking into a minor in language technology. I’d like to use my knowledge of the structure of languages to work in artificial intelligence, perhaps in code breaking.” And someday she’d like to learn Tagalog, one of the predominant languages spoken in the Philippines..

2012-12-03,CMU,China,"Jeannette Wing, head of Carnegie Mellon’s computer science department since 2004, announced that she is leaving the university in January to take a job as the head of Microsoft’s international research labs.
Wing, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been working at Carnegie Mellon for the past 27 years. She began her college career at MIT as an electrical engineering major; Wing said she only became interested in the field of computer science when she took a required course in the subject and “fell in love with it.”
According to her page on the computer science department website, Wing’s general research interests are “in the areas of trustworthy computing, specification and verification, concurrent and distributed systems, programming languages, and software engineering.” She has served in a number of roles since coming to Carnegie Mellon, including associate dean of academic affairs and head of the computer science Ph.D. program.
Wing said that as the head of the computer science department, she oversees all of education and research the department’s faculty and students participate in.
“Certainly I help manage the education programs, the Ph.D. program; [I] help manage the undergraduate program,” she said. “As far as the research goes, it’s really helping to guide the faculty in looking out for new research directions and hunting opportunities, so basically I stay in the background and cheer the faculty on and support them in any way I can.”
According to Randy Bryant, the dean of the School of Computer Science, Microsoft has been “wooing [Wing] on and off for all this time, and I guess this time they finally convinced her to go.” Bryant has known Wing for over 30 years; they were graduate students together at MIT and, after graduating, arrived at Carnegie Mellon within a year of each other.
Bryant praised Wing for her leadership ability within the computer science department: “Her first impression she gives of you is she’s just full of energy and excitement. She just gets everyone fired up, and everyone really believes in her.”
Bryant also highlighted Wing’s positive influence as the head of the computer science department.
Between 2007 and 2010, Wing briefly left Carnegie Mellon to serve as the assistant director of the computer and information science and engineering directorate at the National Science Foundation (NSF).
When Wing came back, Bryant said, she used what she had learned at the NSF to “try and bring in some new faculty members who would be doing work in areas different than what we were doing.” As an example of this, Bryant pointed to the hiring of Emma Brunskill, currently an assistant professor of computer science.
Frank Pfenning, a professor of computer science and a colleague of Wing’s, agrees with Bryant on the pleasures of working with her: “There are many attributes that make it exciting to work with her; I think one of her strongest attributes is her dedication, her energy and her enthusiasm and, in scientific terms, her total commitment.”
Pfenning, too, has worked with Wing for many years. As department head, Pfenning said, Wing was adept at gauging the department’s needs and allocating resources. “She has a complete sort of sense for what the department needs and what we need as we’re moving forward. She’s very good at setting priorities and making sure these priorities are put into practice,” he said.
Generations of Wing’s students have known her as the “dragon lady,” based on a photo of her performing a Chinese sword dance that she learned in Xi’an, China. As department head, Wing is still interacting as much as she can with students.
This semester, she co-taught 15-150, Principles of Functional Programming. Wing said she enjoys the class because of her long-standing interest in functional programming. “It got me into computer science. I love the material; I just want to convey my own passion for this material to the students.”
When asked what advice she would give rising computer science students at Carnegie Mellon, Wing said, “Follow your passion. Find something that you’re really interested in and go for it. Believe in yourself. The students are smart here; there should be no lack of confidence.”
Pfenning and Bryant say Wing will be sorely missed. “Of course it’s a big loss to CMU. It’s impossible to replace her, that’s for sure,” Pfenning said.
“I think she’s been very inspirational to people; we’re really sad to see her go,” Bryant said.
Wing is sad to go, but excited to take on the challenges Microsoft will offer her. “I will always love Carnegie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon is my family,” she said. .

2013-01-21,CMU,China,"The familiar brown apartment building located on 214 S. Craig St. has recently become home to KBox, a karaoke house and business venture. 
It’s purpose is to strengthen the Asian community of Pittsburgh.
The idea of the karaoke house was conceived in the fall of 2011 in Finger Lakes, New York, when 12 Chinese students — nine from Carnegie Mellon and three from University of Pittsburgh — were brainstorming a place in which Chinese students in need of a cultural haven could gather. 
What began as an effort to gather Chinese students evolved into an attempt to bring together students from all Asian countries. 
One year later, their idea came to life through the founding of KBox.
Inside the KBox building, rooms are decked with the latest sound systems, plush couches, and LCD TVs.
One of the co-founders, Huiman Tan — a Ph.D student in engineering and public policy — wanted a place where “Chinese students can gather, socialize, relax, re-connect with their culture.”
Other co-founders include ’11 alumna Min Luo, information management systems master’s student Pei Xiong, master’s student in the Language Technologies Institute Duo Ding, Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute Hua Zhong, and Ph.D. student in the Language and Technologies Insititute Long Qin.  
“Students from China find it difficult to make friends in the U.S.,” said Tan. “They seek other Chinese students and familiar sources of entertainment.... So we came up with KBox, because Chinese people love to sing, and creating a place where they can gather to do that makes it easy for Chinese students to meet other Chinese students.”
The rest of the co-founders agreed with Tan that Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Scholar and Student Association was not enough of a social hub for them to interact with other Chinese students, since they only “organized parties dedicated to major, traditional Chinese holidays.”
After a trial opening in August 2012, KBox officially opened up to the public on Sept. 16, and is now a growing business venture.
Their mission statement is to “create an entertainment house where students from all cultural backgrounds can gather to sing in private karaoke rooms,” Tan said.
“With more than 90k songs — 76k Chinese songs and 15k English songs and 8k Korean songs — we hope to make it a haven not just for Asian students but also for students who just want to blow off steam.”
Coming up with the idea of a karaoke house was only the first step.
After solidifying their idea, the founders had to find a location for a karaoke house, buy a building, receive a building permit, and find a contractor.
Having found a house on Craig Street after three months of searching, the co-founders then faced problems receiving a zoning permit from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Building Inspection, a necessary requirement for opening business in the building. 
Tan said that the trouble with receiving a zoning permit which lasted for two months was enough of a dilemma for her co-founders and her to think that “their project would be killed.”
According to Tan, the founders had issues with Oakland’s building inspectors, since there weren’t enough hired inspectors to check all of the buildings in the area, including theirs. After research in building codes, Zhong “was able to argue his way with the license officer to get a license for starting a business in their building on South Craig Street,” Tan said.
“[KBox] had no money to hire lawyers like other big entrepreneurs, so Zhong studied [the] building codes of several states.... It took a lot of effort, research, and perseverance for Zhong to get a license to set up a karaoke house in our building,” Tan said.
They continued to face more issues with the building, they needed to find a cheap contractor in Pittsburgh who could rebuild the interior of the rundown building. 
“Despite most of us being computer science majors, we designed the building plan and submitted it to our contractor. We did everything, from the soundproof walls to the interior decorating. We raised a total of 20K, which came from our pockets to redesign the interior,” Tan said.
In regards to future plans, Tan said, “We plan on expanding KBox to take on partnerships with local Asian restaurants in Squirrel Hill, as well as extending sponsorship outside of CMU. We also want to attract a larger population of students from other schools like Pitt and Duquesne; that way, there will be a wider web of connections.”
When asked whether KBox seems like a good social hub for students, first-year decision science major Steven Wang, a Chinese-American student, said, “Yeah, I think KBox is a good place to reconnect with your cultural roots if you’re Chinese since you can meet up with other Chinese friends, but at the same time I would go to KBox just to sing even if I wasn’t Chinese.”
When asked if KBox added to diversifying Chinese community life on campus, first-year computer science and math double major Jichao Sun said, “It seems unique. It’s not your average Chinese student association club.”
KBox hopes to continue expanding their business in order to attract people who want to sing American, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese music. 
“We now wish to popularize KBox to all students and not just Asian students,” Tan said..

2013-01-28,CMU,China,"When more people currently live on the planet than ever before, should we institute laws that regulate how many children people should be allowed to have?
According to the United States Census, at the time this article was written the population of the United States was 315,213,798 people, while the population of the entire world clocked in at 7,061,807,441 people. Comprehending the existence of that many people is extremely difficult, if not impossible. 
As one might expect, this extraordinary milestone elicits a variety of responses from our massive and excitable species. The two most dominant arguments in this case are between those who believe that this population explosion will eventually lead to environmental and social catastrophe, and those who believe that overpopulation is not the true problem — distribution of available resources is.
Fear of population size is nothing new. Thomas Malthus, an English economist, published a pamphlet on the evils of population growth in 1798. Malthusian fears were reawakened in October 2011, when the world population officially surpassed 7 billion. Professor Paul Elrich of Stanford University is the modern crown prince of panicking, and his book The Population Bomb predicts massive famines and widespread death if population is not held in check. Elrich told the progressive news site Raw Story that “nobody, in my view, has the right to have 12 children or even three if the second pregnancy is twins.” He suggests laws to limit the number of children people are allowed to have. 
This suggestion is completely ridiculous. Limiting the number of children adults can have is not only insulting, it is deeply impractical, and would almost certainly be unfair. Rinku Sen, president and executive director of the Applied Research Center, also told Raw Story that these laws could be circumvented by the wealthy. Sen also discusses the possible impact these laws could have on minorities, and she’s right to be concerned. Determining who can have children under what circumstances is a slippery slope, and a perfect playing field for the nastier sides of any given culture to come out. A prime example of this phenomenon is China, where the one-child law led to an increase in female infanticide and gender-selective abortion. 
If population must be limited, a far better suggestion would be to increase the availability of reliable birth control. Susan Wood, interim chief executive of the International Women’s Health Coalition, argues in The New York Times that “another essential strategy is to invest in the largest population ever of young people entering their reproductive years, 85 percent of them in developing countries ... with comprehensive sexuality education, combined with health information and services.” An increasingly massive population means a population filled with young people. In order to slow population growth, young people need to know how to avoid pregnancy. Heterosexual intercourse is always going to carry the risk of pregnancy, but that sex does not have to result in children. People are not going to stop having sex, even if they cannot support the children that they might produce. 
Not everyone believes that the population growth modern Malthusians fear is so catastrophic. Dominic Lawson of The Independent argues that “there are not (and never will be) too many people for the planet to feed.” The article goes on to argue that the world has enough agricultural produce and the technology to feed everyone, but that technology is not implemented effectively. In the same article, Joel Cohen, professor of earth and environmental science at Columbia University, says that “those who say the whole problem is population are wrong. It’s not even the dominant factor.” So, the problem is distribution, not supply. The idea that the planet generates enough food to feed every person on the planet, and yet people still starve, is insane. 
Laws to limit population growth are both impractical and absurd. Ensuring better universal access to birth control would be a much better idea, as would improving our methods of food distribution. Instead of worrying about how many people will live on the planet in the future, we should be worrying about how to feed all the people who live on the planet now.

A new analysis conducted by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute found that domestic cats have been killing more wild birds than scientists thought. America’s domestic and feral cats kill between 1.4 billion and 3.7 billion birds per year, a number that is drastically larger than the previously estimated 500 million.
These numbers were determined by studies assessing the hunting habits of cats in the United States. The result from calculating the percentage of cats that live outdoors, the percentage of household cats that are occasionally allowed out, and the amount of hunting a cat will normally do when outside was “alarming.” Conservationists have tried capturing and neutering wild cats, but the process has been too time consuming and expensive.

Wristwatch to help combat sexual violence in India
In response to the string of violent gang-rapes of female bus passengers in New Delhi and Gurdaspur, Indian officials are developing an innovative wristwatch that can help protect women. The watch’s main feature is a button that sends a text message to close relatives and the nearest police station. 
A GPS inside the watch will determine the wearer’s location and a small camera will record for 30 minutes after the button is pressed. The prototype for this wristwatch is due to be released in half a year. While rape-prevention technology is a step in the right direction, some are skeptical on how effective it will be. 
“I don’t think this will make any difference in controlling rape cases,” said Sehba Farooqui, a women’s rights activist in Delhi.

South Korea launches first successful satellite
After three failed attempts in the past four years to launch a civilian rocket, South Korea launched its first space rocket carrying a science satellite last Wednesday. While previous launches failed within minutes, this rocket, named Naro, successfully entered orbit. 
However, South Korea is still far behind its rivals, China and Japan, in space efforts. While South Korea is capable of producing satellites, it has relied on other countries to put them into orbit. South Korea plans to build a rocket on its own by 2018 and eventually send a probe to the moon. South Korea’s rocket program is an issue of contention with neighboring North Korea, which is included in the United Nations’ sanctions for launching long-range rockets.

Storm on Saturn travels the globe; then swallows self
Scientists from NASA’s Cassini mission recently published a paper detailing a 267-day-long storm on Saturn. The storm was tracked by Cassini’s radio and plasma wave subsystem and imaging cameras. It erupted at the 33 degrees north latitude and moved west, covering 190,000 miles and wrapping around the planet. Unlike terrestrial storms that run into mountains and other topographic features, causing them to die out, Saturn’s storm traveled all the way around the planet — unimpeded by any land features — until it reached where it began. At this point, the storm ran into itself and mysteriously dissipated, putting an end to one of Saturn’s longest-running storms.

2013-02-18,CMU,China,"Many people would agree that food is one of the great pleasures of life. However, one of the principle tools we use to eat — our teeth — are poorly rewarded for the work they perform. In return for their work in crushing food and enabling us to eat all sorts of delicious substances, they are attacked by acid and dental bacteria. Fortunately, toothpaste can help mitigate the harmful effects that can befall teeth. This commonplace substance contains many ingredients that give it its potency and make it so essential to dental health.
According to researchers at New York University, toothpaste is not a recent invention; humans realized long ago the importance of keeping teeth clean and healthy. This substance originated about 6000 years ago in several forms. In China, twigs, flower petals, salt, water, and bones were mashed and put on the end of a sharp bamboo leaf to apply to teeth. In Egypt, salt, pepper, mint leaves, and iris flowers were mixed into a paste and used. In India, twigs from trees known for special dental properties were chewed upon and rubbed against teeth. All these methods led to healthy teeth that did not suffer from dental problems.
Now, let’s brush up on the science (pun intended) behind dental problems with some help from dental.net. Our teeth are made of layers; the outermost one is comprised of hard enamel. This hard substance protects the softer inside and nerves of our teeth. When taken care of, this enamel can last us an entire lifetime. However, modern-day diets that are extremely high in sugars and carbohydrates can cause several dental problems.
Sugars and carbohydrates release sulfur molecules that are responsible for dreaded bad breath. In addition, these substances are consumed by bacteria living in the teeth and enable them to multiply quickly. These bacteria release acids that eat away at enamel. If the enamel erodes, it exposes the nerves underneath which can lead to extreme pain and discomfort. Also, if the acid keeps building up, it may reach the root and render the tooth useless. The bacteria that cause all these problems live in plaque and food debris in our teeth. Toothpaste can help remove these bacteria, helping to prevent several dental problems.
According to thefactsabout.co.uk, one of the most well-known ingredients in toothpaste is fluoride. This element is naturally found in several foods like tea, fish, vegetables, and fruits. It is necessary for healthy teeth as it helps draw in minerals like calcium to the enamel and helps repair the tooth. Fluoride also attaches itself to weakened parts of the tooth, which keeps the tooth stronger in the future. These properties of fluoride are also the reason it is added to water supplies, and has been instrumental in improving the dental health of most people in the last few decades.
In addition to fluoride, toothpastes also contain other common materials. Toothpaste can contain abrasives, which help remove plaque and polish the teeth. These abrasives need to be able to scrub away harmful substances without causing permanent damage to the tooth enamel. 
Toothpaste also contains detergents, which give rise to the foam created while brushing. Toothpaste manufacturers also give importance to the texture of toothpaste. Humectants are the substances used to ensure that toothpaste stays moist and doesn’t dry out while in the tube. Thickeners are used to make the toothpaste stick together when squeezed from the tube and stick to the brush. Finally, preservatives and flavors ensure that toothpaste stays fresh and is enticing to users no matter what their taste preferences might be.
With the variety and styles of toothpaste available to us today, it is possible for everyone to find a type suited to their exact needs. The various benefits of toothpaste make it an essential part of our lives. Now, if only we could all floss regularly too..

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
The Hobbit is Peter Jackson’s long-awaited return to Tolkien’s Middle Earth. He has a solid cast, some returning members, and his reliably beautiful cinematography — but why such a God-awful movie? Of course, the first reason is that it favors technology over narrative. The discussion surrounding the film is never about Bilbo; it’s about the brilliant CGI and 48FPS projection rate. Though I appreciate the goofiness of the opening (so much singing and plate tossing), the injection of comic timing courtesy of Martin Freeman, and the somewhat more prevalent levity, there’s only so many deus ex machina I can take: Gandalf apparently can stomp his staff and cause everyone in the room to fall down. Those endless swirling helicopter shots of people crossing mountains have returned, and it’s impossible for me not to giggle at (subtitled) orcs furious at “elvish filth” and “dwarfish scum.” It’s ultimately patience-testing and not nearly as thrilling as intended. But you can go for the special effects.

Jackson’s take on the Shire is considerably more happy-go-lucky than Tolkien fans might expect; the fireworks are grand, but life for the Hobbits is strangely akin to an Irish jig. Despite the Shire’s exaggerated sense of joy and normalcy, Jackson has stunningly authenticated Tolkien’s mythic landscape. Blue waters wash against flowery green pastures. There is a sense of belonging here, as if we’ve finally stumbled across that old friend we’ve only seen in dreams and read about in the thumb-worn pages of Tolkien’s novels. At three hours, Fellowship of the Ring soars, its pitfalls miniscule when compared to the jaw-dropping splendor of its remarkable set pieces.

2013-04-01,CMU,China,"Activists protesting organ harvesting in China, as well as activists from the Human Rights Campaign, have begun regularly appearing on campus this past week.
In particular, the issue of alleged organ harvesting in China is both incredibly important to discuss and deeply complex. 
However, perhaps the methods activists are employing to bring attention to this issue could be re-evaluated.
One of the activists’ most common locations is the main entrance to campus — the first step on the stairs facing Forbes Avenue. This position requires most students to pass them on the way to class. 
While this minor inconvenience is not a huge issue, it discourages students from being receptive or active listeners. If a student is running late to class, stopping to talk to a person with a flyer can seem trivial and irrelevant.
The other major problem with the activists’ campaign is the actual content of their flyers. The content borders on sensationalism in its attempt to raise awareness. For example, the front page of the organ harvesting protesters’ handout depicts a little girl in the rain holding a sign that reads “Killed for their belief.”
Furthermore, the content of the flyer — specifically the explanation of Falun Gong — serves as an attempt to sway religious beliefs.
Page six of the packet has an in-depth description of the faith, as well as several charts depicting health benefits for practitioners, as “many people just like you take up the practice of Falun Gong and experience health benefits.” This attempt at conversion is so obviously partisan that it detracts from the overall issue at hand.
Public activism always has its issues — people are often too busy to connect with activists, even for extremely important causes. Because of these difficulties, organizations choosing to promote their causes on campus must strike a balance between enthusiasm for their cause and respect for the busy schedules and various beliefs of students who pass them on their way to classes..

2013-04-15,CMU,China,"Study looks at the brain to determine music preferences
A recent study explained what processes in the brain shape people’s taste in music, and also helped predict what types of music they will buy. Participants of the study underwent Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while they listened to 60 new pieces of music and reported how much they would be willing to pay for each. The results of the study revealed that the nucleus accumbens, the region of the brain that forms expectations as to what may be pleasing to an individual, determines whether a piece of music is pleasing or not.
Depending on how pleasing the listener deems the music, the nucleus accumbens interacts with the auditory cortex, the area of the brain that stores information on the sounds an individual hears. Though everyone experiences the same brain processes when choosing music, each person has different musical tastes because everyone has a uniquely shaped auditory cortex. The researchers also said that musical preferences are partially shaped by an individual’s past experiences.

Researchers study addictiveness of potato chips
A research team at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany performed a study on rats that revealed likely causes as to why potato chips seem to be more addictive than other foods. In the study, rats were given choices between their standard animal chow and three other types of food, including potato chips. Although they ate relatively equal amounts of each, they pursued the potato chips more enthusiastically. Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI), which was used to map the rats’ brains, showed that the reward and addiction centers of the brain were most active when eating the potato chips.
These results showed that while fat and carbohydrates were a partial explanation for this, there had to have been another factor, as the rats’ animal chow also contained these ingredients. If scientists can find the molecular ingredient that makes chips so pleasing, healthy but less desirable foods could be injected with this ingredient to make them more appealing. However, there has been no proof yet as to how this can be done.

Magic mushrooms might help treat depressed patients
David Nutt, Professor at Imperial College London and president of the British neuroscience association, has recently been given £500,000 to conduct a clinical trial regarding the uses of psychedelic mushrooms — commonly known as “magic mushrooms” or “ ’shrooms” — to cure depression. Nutt claims that psilocybin, an ingredient in nearly 200 species of psychedelic mushrooms, can turn down areas of the brain that are overactive in depressed individuals. 
A depressed individual would need an amount of psilocybin equivalent to five psychedelic mushrooms. Nutt’s study would involve 60 patients and would use a synthetically manufactured version of the ingredient. At this time, however, current drug laws and restrictions make it difficult for Nutt to gain access to psychedelic mushrooms. In addition, very few hospitals are licensed to use the drug, so even if the study were to be successful in showing that psychedelic mushrooms assisted depressed individuals, it would be difficult to bring about widespread use of the treatment.

Archaeologists find remains of dinosaur embryos
An international research team lead by Robert Reisz of the University of Toronto Mississauga in Canada recently discovered some of the oldest dinosaur embryo fossils ever found. The fossils, roughly 190 million years old, were discovered in southwest China. The remains belonged to the Lufengosaurus, a species of dinosaur that would have grown to 30 feet in height. The fossils were preserved at different stages in the development process. Analysis of the remains, along with information about fully-developed dinosaurs of the same species, revealed that this species developed quickly in the embryo stage and after hatching, and that the embryos discovered were killed by a flood.

Scientists make transparent brains for easier study
Scientists at Stanford University have created an innovative method to study the brain: By replacing the fatty lipid membranes surrounding cells with an acrylamide mesh, they effectively developed a way to make brain tissue transparent. While lipids scatter light, acrylamide mesh does not — yet it still keeps the molecules in place. This method allows researchers to study the inside of the brain without cutting it into slices. This is a valuable advancement because it does not require chopping up axons, which scientists were unable to study before. While the method was developed in mouse brains, the team has also tested it on post-mortem human brain tissue.

2013-04-15,CMU,China,"McConomy Auditorium was about half-full with students and faculty members last Tuesday afternoon. Despite the mixed ages and ethnic backgrounds, one thing these attendees had in common was their interest in economics — and of course, in comedy. But then, who wouldn’t be up for a good, educational laugh over intelligent jokes? After all, we go to Carnegie Mellon.
Cheers and applause went to Yoram Bauman, who called himself “the world’s first and only stand-up economist.” Bauman graduated with a B.A. in mathematics from Reed College and went on to the University of Washington for his master’s degree and Ph.D. in economics. His goal is to “spread joy to the world through economics comedy; to reform economics education; and to implement carbon pricing — preferably through a revenue-neutral tax shift involving lower taxes on things like working, saving, investing, and higher taxes on things we don’t like (e.g. carbon).”
From his introduction until the very end of the show, Bauman was constantly in character. He did not let the fear of offending someone get in the way of his jokes. For example, he started the show by showing off his capitalism shirt he bought in China. The political irony immediately captured the crowd’s attention.
He went on to share his experiences from his recent visit to Beijing. Bauman roused further excitement with his Chronic Hyperinflation in Hell theory drawn from Chinese belief, explaining it as a “drastic increase in money supply which we called ‘M4.’ ” The crowd loved the intelligent pun and correlation to economic money measurements “M1,” “M2,” and “M3.” His explanation of the Chinese tradition of burning joss paper for their ancestors — and how that causes hell to be filled with money — struck a chord with the culturally diverse audience.
Bauman later incorporated one of our favorite technologies of the day — apps — by exploring the new way of transferring money. His punch line was definitely one to stick: “There’s an app for everyone — even the dead ones.” He went on to jest about how Chinese tradition believes in magic and Social Darwinism, but not Darwinism.
Bauman then poked fun at the contradictory Singaporean policy of calling themselves liberal, when at the same time, the government has its fingers at everybody’s throats. “ ‘Uh-oh, be careful. Don’t talk about politics, race, religion, the government, or people named ‘Lee.’ Don’t say anything that might offend anybody,’ ” the comedian said, quoting the Singaporeans he had encountered. 
Later on, Bauman talked about his own career and about how he got to where he is now. “I’m a little embarrassed to say that my video has recently just got a million hits,” he said. “It’s surprising ‘cause I’m not a Korean pop star or anything.”
Some of Bauman’s last jokes involved his explanation of different perspectives from varying types of economics through “S*** Happens.” He first made the distinction between microeconomics ad macroeconomics. The former stresses that the price of “s***” is determined by supply and demand; the latter simply expresses, “Oh, s***!” He went on to define classical macro, Keynesian macro, neo-Keynesian macro, neoclassical synthesis, econometrics, environmental economics, supply-side economics, behavioral economics, and the Australian School of Economics.
“People always wonder why economics always seems so confusing,” Bauman said. “It’s because they do not want you to figure out that the entire economy is empty.” Though Bauman makes fun of economics and the system a lot, it takes someone knowledgeable and familiar with the field to make one-tenth of the jokes and comments that he made..

2013-04-15,CMU,China,"Three decades ago, Jimmy Zhu came to Carnegie Mellon University from China to study in the United States. Today, he is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and is helping to establish a graduate school in China — the Joint Institute of Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University. Carnegie Mellon is hiring employees for the Chinese university and is exporting much of its curriculum to the school.
Carnegie Mellon University is not the only university attempting to establish universities or partnerships in China. 
The University of Pittsburgh is developing an undergraduate engineering program at China’s Sichuan University that is estimated to enroll students by 2014. The University of Michigan, New York University, and Duke University are also forming partnerships with universities in China.
University collaborations across borders make clear how small the world is. The Tartan commends Carnegie Mellon University and Jimmy Zhu for their efforts to introduce curriculums and institutions that could both give Chinese students advantages in the global marketplace and universities a more prominent standing internationally.
This trend of partnering with foreign universities establishes invaluable global connections. As the officials at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon hope, the university’s involvement in China could create pathways for business partnerships on a global scale.
According to Trib Total Media, Guangzhou, the area where Sun Yat-sen University is located, is considered a “major enterprise zone in southern China” but does not have its own engineering program. By partnering with Sun Yat-sen University to develop an engineering program, Carnegie Mellon University is introducing education that may benefit this area’s citizens and, in turn, make them more willing to establish connections with the university.
By decreasing the gap between countries and increasing collaborative efforts, universities create more opportunities to provide students with educations that could benefit the global marketplace for both Chinese and American students..

Researchers stripped a rat’s kidney of its cells and repopulated it with new ones, showing that a bioengineered kidney can function in a similar manner to a normal one. Dr. Harald Ott of Harvard Medical School took the kidney of a rat cadaver and removed its cells by putting it in detergent. This process left behind only the extracellular matrix and collagen that acted as a scaffold for cells. Ott then repopulated the kidney with neonatal rat cells and human red blood cells. The bioengineered kidney was then reinserted into a live rat.

Mystery surrounds Chinese bird flu
With 82 cases of a new bird flu in China, public health officials are trying to determine how the virus is spread. The virus, H7N9, has been detected in poultry, pigeons, chickens, and ducks. The World Health Organization, however, stresses that some of people infected have not had contact with birds. There is also little evidence that the virus is spread between humans.
The outbreak in China has killed 17 people and hospitalized many more with severe respiratory problems. Most of the human cases have occurred near Shanghai, although two isolated incidents have been found in Beijing.

Mice and humans enjoy being carried
According to a report published in Current Biology, both human and mouse infants calm down simply by being held by their parents. The researchers believe that this calm may be advantageous for the survival of both the parent and infant; it is much easier for parents to escape a predator with a baby in a trance-like state.
The scientists attached a heart monitor to 12 human babies and observed them while their mothers sat them up, placed them in a crib, and carried them. The babies immediately relaxed when picked up by their mothers. Similarly, the mice infants relaxed and had a decreased heart rate when carried by their mothers.

Scientists question cause of drought 
Climate change was probably not the cause of the 2012 droughts in the U.S. midwest, according to a report released by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Some climate scientists have questioned this conclusion.
The NOAA scientists ran computer simulations in order to determine why forecasts failed to predict the droughts. Their simulations inferred that the droughts would have occurred regardless of global warming, and instead blame it on natural variability in the atmosphere. Some climate scientists disagree, saying that the climate models used were insufficient.

2013-04-29,CMU,China,"The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust held its quarterly Gallery Crawl on Friday. The Gallery Crawl is a grand tour around the galleries, shops, studios, and restaurants of Pittsburgh’s Cultural District and is free and open to the public.
The Gallery Crawl features an eclectic selection of venues, artists, and performers designed to reflect the lushness and variety of Pittsburgh’s flourishing art scene. It includes both professional and amateur works of art and performance, as well as the wares and services of independent local vendors and businesses.
With nearly 40 stops to see and even more events to visit, the Gallery Crawl was completely overwhelming. It is impossible to cover all of the events even in four hours. Throughout the night, there were restaurants filled with activity, music filling the streets, and people rushing in and out of venues; it is almost the exact picture you would think of if asked to dream of a city.
The venues that inspired the atmosphere of the night were just as important as the aura of the Gallery Crawl. There were some truly awe-inspiring works on display. For instance, in the Wood Street Galleries, Gregory Barsamian’s exhibition Memento Mori features a dozen or so fascinating and dark machinations. Using strobe lights and spinning kinetic sculptures, Barsamian is able to create a new creature altogether, a sort of mesmerizing Frankenstein of sculpture and film. Based on his dream recordings, Memento Mori features works that are dark, intense, and surreal. There are paper worms writhing around in tiny rooms, paper bags breathing in and out, and human hearts turning into birds.
Another incredible exhibit is Tony Tasset’s Magnolias for Pittsburgh, an outdoor installation on the corner of Seventh and Penn avenues. Magnolias features a deceptively simple concept that nonetheless manages to stun: two bronze magnolia trees placed in a landscape with a few live magnolia trees and some ivy.
At first sight, it is almost impossible to tell that the flowering magnolias are indeed fake; each petal of every flower had been individually hand-painted and the tree itself had been cast from a hand-sculpted replica. The trees, with their fresh, eternally blooming pink flowers on dark black boughs, exude an ethereal sense of beauty that becomes even stronger the moment you realize the trees are not real.
Another highlight of the evening was the Night Market, a gathering of local Pittsburgh vendors to display their wares. There was an incredible variety of vendors there, selling food, jewelry, beauty products, art, clothing, accessories, and more. The Night Market was an amazing opportunity to see the creativity and workmanship of these local artisans and buy souvenirs.
Yet another major component of the Gallery Crawl was familiarizing audiences with the local community. The Gallery Crawl itself required attendees to venture into restaurants and buildings all around the Cultural District and invited exploration into what the city had to offer. There were also a number of venues dedicated to showcasing work from students in schools around Pittsburgh, as well as from local artists and businesses.
One of the venues that featured the most student work was the Trust Arts Education Center, which displays the works of Pittsburgh public schools students, grades K–12. There is an undeniable charm in the works of some of the younger students: a sense of innocence and imagination, filled with bright colors, smiley faces, and the occasional sense of great artistic promise. Among the older students, there is a more refined sense of creative expression and a wide variety of subject matter, ranging from marriage to race to transportation. After a few hours of seeing professional artwork, it was relaxing to look at the work of these younger artists.
Other venues were focused on exploring a certain concept or theme in their exhibits. For instance, the SPACE gallery— partnered with the mentoring program Strong Women, Strong Girls (which has a branch at Carnegie Mellon) — featured Mean Girls, an exhibit designed to raise awareness of bullying among girls in America and to encourage positive social change. Another venue, the August Wilson Center for African-American Culture, celebrated and honored the vivacity and diversity of African-American culture in Pittsburgh.
On perhaps a less sociopolitical note, there were also medium-specific venues such as the ToonSeum, which features the work of cartoonists and animators. The ToonSeum is part museum and part comic book shop, a combination that would excite any cartoon aficionado. Featuring political cartoons, Sunday-morning newspaper comics, and animated movie stills, the museum takes visitors on a lovely little trip down memory lane to rediscover the magic of cartoons and animation and appreciate the medium in a new light.
The evening also featured a number of performances and musical acts. For instance, the Arcade Comedy Theater, which specializes in alternative and improvisational comedy, continually held brief, bite-sized snippets of improvisational comedy throughout the night. Also, its neighboring venue, Harris Theater, played regionally made short films shown on a loop.
Pittsburgh public school students also put on a number of performances. Between the Trust Arts Education Center and August Wilson Center there were student musicals and choir performances, a fashion show, and plenty of dance shows.
The Gallery Crawl is a unique opportunity to experience what Pittsburgh has to offer in terms of culture and entertainment. The only complaint it raised was that it is only a one-day event; it would be more successful if it spanned over two days. During the Gallery Crawl, there were many performances that played at the same time, making it impossible to see the events all in one night.
Anyone who lives in Pittsburgh should go see the Gallery Crawl at least once. No matter the person, the Gallery Crawl will have something to please them. But most importantly, it is an integral part of the city experience. There is a tangible thrill of excitement and grandiosity up and down Liberty and Penn avenues, with music and activity infused in the evening air, as you pass the shops, restaurants, and bars on an art excursion..

In Looper, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis play the same dude, divided by time travel — one’s the hero, the other’s the villain. Writer/director Rian Johnson has an inspiring faith in love — in this case, showing that it can drive someone to evil. The film’s virtue is in its pure strength as both a genre-based product and a vessel for human observation. Looper has a few interesting things to say about time travel, but it has more poignant insights on sacrifice, morality, and fatherhood. It’s an intensely interesting picture that will one day be recognized as a pillar of science fiction.

Last year’s media frenzy surrounding Zero Dark Thirty mostly centered around its depiction of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

Jessica Chastain turns in an explosive performance as Maya, a CIA agent who spearheaded the bin Laden investigation. A series of great supporting performances, a tense and forceful screenplay, and a final 50 minutes that will glue you to your chair make this a political procedural not to be missed, and one of the best pictures of 2012.

Since it’s a Disney musical, she is required to carry along a colorful pair of animals of different species — in this case, a dragon and a cricket. Mulan lacks the memorable songs of The Lion King or Aladdin, but is markedly improved by a level of visual splendor rarely achieved in animation..

Scientists produce edible meat from cow shoulder cells
The future of food has taken a new direction with the invention of lab-grown meat. Mark Post, a Dutch researcher from the University of Maastricht, has pioneered a way of growing meat using stem cells (cells that can differentiate into tissue-specific cells) from cow shoulder muscle. The cells were multiplied in a nutrient solution and put in petri dishes, where they grew into muscle cells and formed strips of muscle fiber, a process which was developed through a $325,000 project.
A five-ounce burger was made from 20,000 strips of fiber, breadcrumbs, salt, and some natural colorings. While the lab-grown burger received subpar ratings in its taste test, it has introduced the idea of cultured meat to the world.

Robot uses slime to express different set of emotions
Ella Gale, a researcher at the University of the West of England in Bristol and the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, has discovered a way of using slime mold to give emotions to robots’ faces. Slime mold, although unicellular, is able to find the quickest path to food and has even shown signs of having memory. 
Gale has developed a way of expressing emotions on a human-like robot face by hooking up the robot face so that its expressions are controlled by electrical signals. These signals are produced when slime mold shies away from light or moves towards food. Because slime mold produces electrical signals as it moves across electrodes, Gale and her team were able to assign different emotions to different signals.

Researchers look into evolution of the X chromosome
The X chromosome has typically been considered the “female” chromosome, and the Y the “male.” This would suggest that since the second X chromosome in females is disabled, its evolution was slowed down and its genes would be similar in most mammals. 
However, recent studies show that it is not only the Y chromosome that contains the genes responsible for sex determination, male development, and male fertility. Rather, the X chromosome has been found to contain genes that are only active in tissue that is destined to become sperm. After sequencing human and mice X chromosomes, geneticists discovered that there are a lot of unshared genes between the human X and mouse X, indicating that the X chromosome may have undergone evolution.

Dolphins respond to unique sounds of their own name
It is a well-known fact that dolphins communicate with each other with clicks and whistles. However, a new observation has been made: Dolphins actually respond selectively to signature whistles, the same way a human being would respond to someone calling their name. This finding is one of the first examples of naming in mammals and suggests that there is a parallel between dolphin and human communication. 
Biologists recorded signature whistles and played them, along with computer-synthesized distortions of them, through a hydrophone in Scotland’s eastern coast. The wild bottlenose dolphins ignored unfamiliar whistles while whistling back to their own signature whistles.

2013-08-19,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon faculty members continue to succeed when they leave academia. Recently, three former computer science professors — Rick Rashid, Peter Lee, and Jeannette Wing — benefited from the revamping of Microsoft Research. 
Lee is the head of Microsoft Research after previously leading Microsoft’s U.S. research operations; he took over for Rashid, who is now a member of Microsoft’s Operation Systems group.
Randal E. Bryant, dean of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science, described Microsoft Research: “Microsoft has a separate research laboratory.... It’s one of the largest corporate research laboratories in the world, and they have branches that span literally across the whole world.” Bryant estimated that MSR has about 800 people working for it. Branch locatons include Redmond, Wash.; Mountain View, Calif.; Cambridge, Mass.; Cambridge, England; and Beijing, China.
Wing noted the similarities between Microsoft Research and the world of academia. “Companies usually have research labs, but Microsoft Research is a little different from any other company because it really supports basic research, much like the kind of research that is done at academia. We’re very open about what it is we do — we publish openly,” she said.
“The difference of course between Microsoft Research and an industrial research lab and an academic institution is that we are funded by the company, Microsoft — we’re actually a very small part of that company,” Wing said. “But it also enables researchers at Microsoft Research access to have an impact on the company, impact on the product and services that Microsoft produces.”
Still, researchers have academia-like freedom to choose the problems they work on, Wing said.
Bryant discussed the former professors’ departures from Carnegie Mellon. “First to leave was Peter Lee, and he got lured away, and then Jeannette got lured away last January. Both of them had been heads of the computer science [department]. Both of them were really great, both in their research and their teaching, and Microsoft was eager to have them. And recently — about a month ago — it was announced that the former head of Microsoft 
Research, Rick Rashid, was stepping aside, and Peter Lee was going to take over his position. And then Jeannette is sort of his deputy.”
Rachid was a senior faculty member who left the university around 1992, Bryant said. “At the time Microsoft didn’t really have a research organization, and Bill Gates decided they really needed one and he chose Rick Rashid and recruited him ... and he’s been doing great with it.”
Wing was a longtime Carnegie Mellon faculty member. “I started at Carnegie Mellon in 1985, as an assistant professor ... and during that time, I’ve been department head twice, spent a couple sabbaticals away from Carnegie Mellon, and I also served at the National Science Foundation for a few years,” she said. 
Wing, who left the university in January, takes over as corporate vice president of Microsoft Research.
On the dynamic between herself and Lee, she said, “We are like partners. We run all of Microsoft Research together. For the most part, he and I are running Microsoft Research jointly. We make joint decisions about budget and hiring and policies and so on.”
The concept of becoming a leader at Microsoft Research did not seem impossible to Wing. About her transition from faculty member, Wing said, “I think it was really natural. In academia, a professor is required to write proposals for funding research for himself or herself or for his or her students, and always coming up with new ideas: looking ahead, looking to the future … and first and foremost, advancing the students’ art. I think it’s natural for a faculty member to move into a research management position where you’re doing overseeing in an organization that itself is doing that.” 
Wing’s experience in guiding the computer science department also helped with the transition. “For me, I also think it’s natural because as department head, I’m representing all areas of the wing, not just my own research,” she said. “In my position at Microsoft Research, I am representing all areas of computing and beyond. So there are other science and engineering areas that I represent, and it’s all about pushing the state of the art, much like in academia.”
For Bryant, the recent news is bittersweet. “We’re sorry to see them go. It means we’ve lost some very great faculty members, but we have a new head, Frank Pfenning. He’s doing an excellent job, so we’re pretty confident that we’ll be able to continue on.”.

Slime mold, although unicellular, is able to find the quickest path to food and has even shown signs of having memory. 
Gale has developed a way of expressing emotions on a human-like robot face by hooking up the robot face so that its expressions are controlled by electrical signals. These signals are produced when slime mold shies away from light or moves towards food. Because slime mold produces electrical signals as it moves across electrodes, Gale and her team were able to assign different emotions to different signals.

Researchers look into evolution of the X chromosome
The X chromosome has typically been considered the “female” chromosome, and the Y the “male.” This would suggest that since the second X chromosome in females is disabled, its evolution was slowed down and its genes would be similar in most mammals. 
However, recent studies show that it is not only the Y chromosome that contains the genes responsible for sex determination, male development, and male fertility. Rather, the X chromosome has been found to contain genes that are only active in tissue that is destined to become sperm. After sequencing human and mice X chromosomes, geneticists discovered that there are a lot of unshared genes between the human X and mouse X, indicating that the X chromosome may have undergone evolution.

Dolphins respond to unique sounds of their own name
It is a well-known fact that dolphins communicate with each other with clicks and whistles. However, a new observation has been made: Dolphins actually respond selectively to signature whistles, the same way a human being would respond to someone calling their name. This finding is one of the first examples of naming in mammals and suggests that there is a parallel between dolphin and human communication. 
Biologists recorded signature whistles and played them, along with computer-synthesized distortions of them, through a hydrophone in Scotland’s eastern coast. The wild bottlenose dolphins ignored unfamiliar whistles while whistling back to their own signature whistles.

2013-10-07,CMU,China,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) announced last Friday in an assessment of the state of the climate system that it is “extremely likely” that mankind has caused climate change. In a 2007 assessment, the same U.N.-sponsored panel called it “very likely.” Their assessment of a diverse array of factors, such as ice and snow volume, sea levels, and greenhouse gas concentrations, led them to conclude that global warming is manmade. While this information isn’t new, it is still jarring.
Even more concerning is the question of how man will cope with global warming. Surely mankind — creator of the wheel, discoverer of electricity, and inventor of the computer — will be able to cope with this challenge.
Global warming is a fact that has been proven again and again; therfore, it must be addressed immediately. This current climate trend is not an Earth-warming cycle, because carbon dioxide levels are higher than ever. People have never dumped so much waste into the atmosphere before because they have never before used so much fossil fuel. 
Even by the skeptics, however, the fact that people are destroying the environment cannot be rejected. Deforestation in Southeastern Asia, environmental monetization by China, and American reliance on oil all contribute to the fact that people are depleting resources at an unsustainable pace while destroying delicate equilibriums that hold the planet together. In light of all the effects of human consumption of natural resources, the dire impacts of global warming are only a small step away.
The IPCC says that action must be taken now. Their reports indicate that climate change could easily exceed the 3.6˚C limit change that the U.N. has concluded the world must remain below in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, according to CBS News. Beyond this point, there may be no return. 
Of course people, myself included, have the tendency to procrastinate. The carbon in fossil fuels that people have burned into carbon dioxide will stay in the atmosphere for centuries, and it can’t exactly be caught and stuffed somewhere. People cannot simply stop burning carbon immediately, either; they are finding gas reserves everywhere, and they are highly dependent on oil. Newly developed techniques of getting oil only increase the rate at which people can use fossil fuels. 
Each year that people delay cutbacks, they lower the probability that the IPCC’s goal of remaining below a 3.6˚C change will be reached. The probability of reaching that goal would have been 67 percent had governments started passing laws ordering emission reductions in 2011, and the reduction would have needed to be around 3.7 percent a year, according to theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss in The New Yorker. If cutbacks begin in 2015, the reduction will have to be around 5.3 percent a year, says Krauss. The point is that action needs to be taken now.
It is worth clarifying that the people discussed in this article only live in countries where resources can be harnessed and used. What about the other half of the world, where clean water is hard to come by, and connecting to electricity is a near-miracle? Have people collectively diminished their chance to improve standards of living? 
A conundrum that faces policy-makers, economists, financiers, and scientists is how to develop the emerging markets in nations that have not yet reached the technological sophistication of countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. 
How do countries of the first world help others develop without further damaging the climate and its fragile balance? The storms and floods that global warming bring will affect the agriculture of developing nations, where agriculture is perhaps one of their main industries. Without a sustainable agricultural sector, a country cannot advance in terms of productivity and standards of living. People in countries of the first world have a moral obligation to aid those they have affected. They have to save what they can, not only for future generations, but also for the people in the present they have impacted..

2013-10-14,CMU,China,"An article published in last week’s issue of The Tartan titled “Address global warming to sidestep dire effects” stated that people of first world nations must aid those whom they have affected, seeing as first world nations have contributed most of the pollution that is perpetuating global warming.
But who is to blame for this climate change? Most would point fingers at these so-called first world nations and with due cause. According to CNN, 20 percent of the world’s wealthiest nations are responsible for 80 percent of global emissions. Meanwhile, the one billion poorest people in the world are responsible for a mere 3 percent of global emissions. 
Evidently, wealthy nations contribute most to environmental degradation while developing countries are doomed to experience the worst effects of climate change. In fact, University of California, Berkeley professor Richard Norgaard said on CNN that the environmental debt the world’s wealthiest nations owe to the poorest exceeds the estimated third world debt by over $4 billion.
However, when discussing environmental degradation, individuals must be considered above nations. Carbon footprint levels do not travel with national identity, but they might very well come paired with a person’s income.
Developing nations such as China, India, and Brazil are producing millionaires at increasingly higher rates. The rise of these new rich, coupled with the expansion of middle classes in developing countries, has dangerous implications for the environment. Increases in standard of living — modeled after Western consumer culture — must be tied inexorably to high levels of consumption. In addition, the two most prominent developing countries — India and China — are home to over 35 percent of the world’s population, according to the International Business Times. There is real immediate danger in these nations aiming to live like Americans; population blog Per Square Mile says that if everyone did, we would need about four planet Earths.
Ultimately, many environmental problems are beyond the scope of a single nation. Policing the world’s greatest common resource — the ocean — is impossible without collaboration, and who can say where one nation’s air stops and another’s begins? Most other limited resources only fall under the jurisdiction of a nation through the luck of geography. All efforts to save the environment must therefore be collaborative, with countries working together to salvage the only planet they will ever have.
Still, many developed nations have a habit of standing apart from the pack in negative ways. The United States is notorious for bowing out of international environmental treaties, most memorably the 1997 Kyoto Treaty for reducing carbon emissions. America was one of few industrialized nations not to ratify, and the treaty suffered a serious blow to its clout without the backing of such an internationally crucial player.
Clearly, developed nations must tackle their own lacking environmental policies before citing any kind of moral obligation to help developing countries rise to their level. This idea of a moral obligation suggests that the United States and similar nations intrinsically know much better than the leaders, scientists, and activists of a nation what is best for their nation’s development, which is hypocrisy on an extreme scale.
America remains the nation with the largest carbon footprint per capita by carbon dioxide emissions — a position it has held without shame for decades, according to Postconsumers.com. Although China takes first place for carbon emissions overall, China is distinguishing itself as impressively progressive in dealing with the environmental consequences of rapid industrialization. No other evidence can better disprove the insulting idea that developed nations somehow owe developing countries their expertise on matters of environmentally sustainable progress.
Perhaps placing blame is pointless. It certainly wastes time that could be better spent by taking a hard look at how our own actions are impacting the environment. After all, if individuals can hold great responsibility for degrading the environment, they also have the power to enact lasting positive change..

2013-11-04,CMU,China,"Scientists aim to stop development of ‘superbugs’
According to a study conducted last month by the Centers for Disease Control, antibiotics continue to be overused and overprescribed. This has contributed to the development of “superbugs.” In fact, a recent epidemic at the National Institutes of Health took six months to control.  Despite this, pharmaceutical companies have scaled down research into the production of new infection-fighting drugs due to the narrow profit margin. As a result, the Department of Health committed to provide the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline up to $200 million over the next five years for research.

Robots becoming more human-like and autonomous
Recent scientific efforts aim to enable robots to begin collaborating with humans and operating without direct human control. Current goals in the field of robotics include making robots more “human shaped” to enable them to more gracefully maneuver human environments, and developing algorithms to make robots more aware of their environments and less dependent on direct control.
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a robot which can sense forces on its arm and ultimately may serve as an aid for physical therapy patients.

Study shows video games improve various functions
According to a study conducted at Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Charité University Medicine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus in Berlin, playing video games can enhance brain functions such as memory formation, strategic planning, spatial orientation, and fine motor skills. The study involved two groups: One played video games for 30 minutes a day for two months, and the control group did not play any games. An increase in brain matter — specifically in the right hippocampus, right prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum — was observed in those who played video games.

Startup develops 3-D printer for consumer market
Pirate3D, a startup in Singapore, is developing an inexpensive 3-D printer for the consumer market that is scheduled to be sold starting in December. The printer will be available online and at certain retail outlets. It will be displayed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. The printer is available in both black and white and color, but not much detail is available yet on how it works.
The company also hopes to profit by creating ways for independent developers to sell software and designs for 3-D printers. The company was able to raise $1.4 million on KickStarter in less than one month, which according to co-founder Roger Chang should last for the next year. The printers will sell for $700 in stores and $500 online.

Antarctic reserve receives frigid reception
Negotiations held in Australia regarding the creation of a 500,000-square-mile marine reserve in the waters off  Antarctica failed this week. The reserve was proposed by the United States and New Zealand, and was to be built in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. Though the area’s ecosystem helps sustain thousands of species, the construction of the reserve faced opposition by China, Ukraine, and Russia due to concern that it would cut off their fish stocks and undermine their fishing industries. Aquatic life in Antarctic waters account for 10 percent of the fish population, and a number of these scientists urge taking measures to protect them. China indicated that it may be open to a future agreement, while Russia and Ukraine still question justification for the reserve.

Students develop device to stop school shootings
A group of students from Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington, D.C. have attempted to address the prevention of school  shootings. The 10-student team, led by math teacher John Mahoney, developed DeadStop, an inexpensive, lightweight device that clasps onto the hinges of classroom doors to stop intruders from breaking into classrooms. Due to school safety regulations, schools cannot have doors which lock from the inside. DeadStop would be stored in the teacher’s desk, and would be clasped onto the door as soon as a warning of an armed intruder was issued. The group hopes to patent the device and have it cost no more than $15.

2013-11-04,CMU,China,"Former Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke at the Carnegie Music Hall last Tuesday at an event hosted by the American Middle East Institute. 
The talk was titled “Diplomacy: Persuasion, Trust and Values,” and Powell devoted his time to addressing his four Es: the economy, energy, the environment, and education.
Powell was born to Jamaican immigrants in Harlem  and went on to become a four-star general in the military. In 1987, Powell was selected to serve as President Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser, and then served as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton before being appointed as secretary of state for President George W. Bush.
The event drew a considerable audience, nearly filling the venue. Simin Curtis, the president and CEO of the American Middle East Institute, opened the event. 
Powell’s speech was the conclusion to a day-long business conference on energy and water hosted by the Institute. Numerous Middle Eastern dignitaries attended the event, including former Egyptian ministers, Libyan Deputy Minister of Oil and Gas Abdulbari Arousi, as well as what Curtis described as “the crème de la crème of American CEOs [of] water and renewable energy [companies].”
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett introduced Powell and remarked that “The tradition of the soldier-statesman dates back to George Washington,” referencing Powell’s military service, and after reading quotes from Powell’s writings and interviews, added, “Powell is an emblem of what America does well.”
Powell then took the stage, complimenting the American Middle East Institute, saying, “They understand the importance of understanding cultures of different people in different parts of the world.”
He spoke of the value of economic activity in Middle Eastern development, remarking, “When you think about what happens in the Middle East, it’s not just about wars and conflicts.” Powell recalled anecdotes 
from his diplomatic experience, highlighting the desire for jobs and work in that area of the world.
Powell praised the value of “the creation of wealth, not that just goes to the top of the pile, but that brings us up from poverty,” recalling when he toured China shortly after the Cultural Revolution. “I could see that these people wanted a better life,” he said.
“What does it take to industrialize? Energy.” Powell added that in the near future, “energy will be so in demand that anything that can be produced will find a market.”
Powell spoke favorably of natural gas extraction from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale deposits, claiming that shale gas put the state “in a unique position to supply energy.” He added, “but we must do this in a way not to destroy the environment.”
Powell spoke of how Pennsylvania’s economy used to rely on petrochemicals and manufacturing, but has improved its environmental conditions. “It’s now education and medicine here in Pittsburgh more than manufacturing.”
Drawing on his modest background when speaking about education, Powell said, “It isn’t where you start in life, it’s where you end up.”
Powell admitted that he did not have the best high school grades, but “I went to school and college without it costing my parents a dime.” 
He praised the decision of New York tax payers to choose to fund the education of low-income students, adding “I think every community in America should make that kind of commitment to education in America.”
He continued, “We need to educate our youngsters for a different kind of economy: a more sophisticated one, where education matters now more than it ever did before.”
Powell also went on to share some personal stories throughout his time on stage. “I have to be candid with you,” he began, “at this point in my life and career I’m just glad to be anywhere.”
He described that leaving his position as secretary of state was a difficult transition. “I’ve been out of government for a few years, but I still think about it,” and jokingly offered the advice, “If anyone else in this room has any kind of difficulty in their 70s, buy a Corvette.”
In addition to a new car and several major lifestyle changes, Powell said, “I’m probably as busy now as I ever was. It’s just a different kind of busy,” describing his speaking tours and work in venture capital.
His speech then turned to current events, with Powell emphatically warning, “I don’t want to get into an argument about Obamacare. I don’t know enough about it. I have socialized medicine from the military and I’m happy with it. But we need to make sure everyone has access,” continuing on to say it was unacceptable that a country as wealthy as the United States had people without some kind of access to health care.
Powell then addressed Congressional gridlock and political polarization. “What I say to my friends in Congress is you guys are in big trouble now,” he said. 
He stressed the importance of compromise, referencing the extreme compromises in the Constitutional Convention, “They even had to compromise on the awful, horrible issue of slavery.”
“If they could sit there for just a few weeks and come out with our Constitution, tell me why Congress can’t sit there and compromise on a budget.”
He continued to be critical of government spending, and Congressmen “not realizing the books have to balance.”
Powell revealed that he now only watches foreign news sources, and criticized the polarization caused by networks such as FOX and MSNBC. He concluded his remarks on Congress by saying, “When I was young I saw leaders in Congress then. There aren’t any now.”
Powell told some illustrative stories about leadership and organizational management, and also addressed the current state of American security. “We are no longer in the kind of danger we were before 9/11, but we need to maintain our safety without showing the rest of the world that we’re scared,” adding, “We can’t let that happen or the terrorists win.”
Questions submitted prior to the event asked Powell of his opinions on the National Security Agency (NSA) spying scandal and Iraq, amongs other topics.
On the NSA, Powell said, “We have a great capability in the NSA and other security organizations. Sometimes we need to listen in on our allies. But this will come back our way,” adding, “You’d have to make quite a case to me, if I were still in government, on why we need to listen in on Angela Merkel’s cell phone.”
Addressing whether Iraq is better off than in 2003, Powell responded, “Yes, it no longer has Saddam Hussein terrorizing its people.”
Powell concluded his talk with some general remarks about America’s place in the world. “We’re still number one, but in a different kind of way. We have to be understanding.” With respect to conflicts such as those in Syria and Egypt, Powell advised, “America should not believe we have a magic solution for these problems.” He added that “we not interfere until other countries are ready to receive it.”
Powell referenced his parents’ immigration to America, and told stories about his encounters with immigrant workers in America. “As long as we remain an open country… we will continue to lead this world that wants to be free.”.

India launched its first rocket to Mars last Tuesday with the goal to complete the mission using less money than other nations have previously. Successful missions to Mars thus far have been completed by the United States, the European Union, and Russia; China attempted an unsuccessful mission two years ago. India’s probe costs only 4.5 billion rupees ($73 million), which is a fraction of the cost of NASA’s upcoming Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. It has also been designed to orbit Earth six or seven times to build up momentum before being slingshotted to the red planet, in order to save fuel. The rocket is scheduled to enter Mars’s orbit by next September.

Discovery of Higgs only brings more mysteries
Joseph Lykken, a theorist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and Maria Spiropulu of the California Institute of Technology, conducted research that predicts that sometime in the distant future, a minuscule quantum fluctuation will cause the Higgs field to drop to a lower energy state. Since the Higgs field permeates all space, this seemingly small change would destroy reality as we know it in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, this is but one of many theories that have developed after the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson, which seems to have caused more mysteries than it’s solved.

Biologists study single-cell reproduction
While almost all multicellular organisms have evolved to reproduce using single cells, such as eggs and sperm, why this method became so universal has long puzzled scientists. To study this trait, University of Minnesota postdoctoral fellow William Ratcliff and associate professor Michael Travisano have transformed a single-celled algae into a multicellular one that reproduces with single cells. Many scientists assumed that single-cell reproduction evolved much later than multicellularity, but their study yielded surprising results: Single-cell reproduction arose at the same time as multicellularity.

Worldwide starfish deaths stump scientists
Starfish populations worldwide have fallen prey to the “seastar wasting syndrome,” which causes starfish to lose their arms. This disease usually occurs if the starfish is wounded or becomes too dry, and it grows infected lesions that lead to its arms falling off. While this disease usually only occurs to one or two starfish within a population and is not often lethal, millions of starfish from populations around the world have not only contracted the disease, but are unable to recover from it. While unusually warm waters may be a cause, the real culprit of this outbreak is yet is to be discovered, and scientists are unsure how long it will last.

2013-11-11,CMU,China,"Timothy Lavin, an editorial board member of Bloomberg, published an article
 in late August titled, “Why I Hate Pandas and You Should Too.” Having carried a panda cub in my youth in the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and seen two cubs mature in Hong Kong’s Ocean Park, I cannot help but to disagree with Lavin because his arguments and interpretations of declining panda populations and evolution are misled.
Lavin calls for pandas to be let go — for humans around the world to leave pandas alone to slowly die off. He states, “Darwinism isn’t for crybabies,” and points to their sluggish natural breeding habits as the main reason for their decline. To a certain extent, he is right. Pandas have trouble reproducing: The Washington Zoo had to resort to artificial insemination to get their pandas to produce offspring. Lavin then points to the biological structure of pandas, saying that eating bamboo all day is speeding their own demise. He also calls attention to the costliness of maintaining a panda. Canada spent $10 million last year on maintaining pandas and paying China to rent them, as all pandas are owned by China.
He then brings up and mocks China’s efforts to reintroduce the species into the wild: “Researchers dress up in preposterous panda costumes ... hoping to fool cubs into thinking they’re a relative.”
First off, Levin’s statements lay close to the topic of eugenics and all the atrocities that come along with that, but many of his facts are facts. Yes, the panda is ill-adapted. It has the body and teeth of a bear, yet it eats bamboo all day. This habit is where Lavin got his facts wrong. From a simple, cost-benefit analysis, it’s clear that it is more efficient for a panda to lie around all day and grab bamboo — the fastest growing grass in the world — than for a panda to chase prey around a forest or claw at a river. Pandas, in some ways, are lazily efficient.
What about Lavin’s fact about breeding? It’s a little off as well. It is incredibly hard for researchers to understand the mechanics and general aura for animals to breed. Cheetahs do not breed well in captivity. Pandas don’t either. It’s a fallacy to blame pandas for not breeding well; it’s just that humans haven’t discovered the entire process and life cycle of the giant panda, as it is incredibly hard to find one in the wild. Why is it hard to find them in the wild?
Humans have disturbed habitats like no other organism. They have destroyed the colorful biodiversity all around them, and that’s why pandas are stuck in captivity. It’s the only option for them until humans take giant leaps in researching the life cycle of the giant panda. Extensive human incursions into the panda habitats in the Minshan Mountains in China have threatened around 40 percent of the population, according to Conservation.org. By saving the panda, we are also saving the biodiversity of the habitat around pandas.
It is imperative to protect biodiversity. Darwinism should not refer to animals dying off but to the incredibly diverse array of lifeforms on this planet. So no, Darwinism is not a harsh truth that we have to face, but something we’re supposed to embrace. We must embrace pandas as a diverse species like no other. It would be an incredible waste if let the only species of giant panda die off. Furthermore, pandas survive in a rich, diverse environment. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), by saving the panda, we are also saving the natural balance of the ecosystem. Pandas have disappeared from these environments, and their numbers are slowly on the decline. Researchers are racing to find out how to best reintroduce pandas into the wild and preserve this fragile balance.
The seas all around us are devolving because of humans. We have reached too far and fished too much, and nature is paying the price. Coral reefs now become green algae-infested murky depths, and entire food chains have been disrupted. Rainforests around the world have been devastated by deforestation. According to the WWF, 17 percent of the Amazon has been lost in the last 50 years. Deforestation leads to a loss of biodiversity and heavy erosion, which heavily changes water patterns within the landscape, and can heavily impact even more organisms. For pandas, there are so little left that the main habitat is the Minshan Mountains, which houses 45 percent of the wild panda population. That 45 percent represents around 720 pandas. We need to protect pandas because we have to protect what we as humans have left.

2013-11-18,CMU,China,"On Nov. 11, Typhoon Haiyan ravaged and tore into the Philippines. The typhoon made landfall near the city of Tacloban, and some estimates point to an initial death toll of 4,400, largely from Tacloban. Haiyan stormed through the Philippines and damaged many other cities, whose people are worried that aid will come only to Tacloban.
Some foreign powers are trying to help the Philippines. The Philippines occupy a strategic area in the Pacific, far enough to elude China’s influences but close enough for conflict. Earlier in August, China and the Philippines argued over control of a small group of islands called the Spratly Islands. The Philippines, along with Japan and South Korea, have been on the receiving end of China’s recent aggressive claims for surrounding islands in the South China Sea.
While China has the ability to help those affected in the Philippines, the nation has made itself seem like a sulking rival, seemingly unable to help out when, in reality, it is able to.
In response to Typhoon Haiyan, the United States sent the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, filled to the brim with relief supplies, while Japan is set to embark on its largest relief effort yet. Even the British, who don’t directly touch the Pacific, are sending their own aircraft carrier.
Meanwhile, the Chinese are donating a total of $1.6 million, far less than any of the above operations. This figure only appeared after their initial donation of $100,000 — a measly sum for such a large, prosperous country. The donation contrasts with China’s major investments in a few select African countries and their large relief effort after the Pakistan earthquake.
China’s initial sum of $100,000 is a reflection of current relations with the Philippines and will reflect horribly on their part. Moreover, the only substantial aid reaching the Philippines is from the Red Cross and other countries right now. China’s strategic location would allow the country to give the Philippines the most aid.
Additionally, if Chinese aid workers were willing, they could perform relief work of the highest order. China would benefit from these efforts because they would look like strong leaders and could help to diffuse territorial disputes and tension.
The U.S. once colonized the Philippines, and ill-feeling toward the U.S. has largely abated within the country since then. The U.S. may be trying to maintain these now good relations with its sizable aid package and impressive warship, which carries helicopters to deliver food and medical kits to remote areas.
China, however, seems to be happy with where relations stand with the Philippines. Hence, it has contributed a negligible amount of aid, adding to chilled relations. Generally for countries, especially those that go through monsoon season on a regular basis (like Singapore, Malaysia, and China), a notable way to aid the Philippines would be to send workers, engineers, and architects to further enforce and strengthen any infrastructure that remains. These efforts would help the Philippines minimize storm-related damage in the future. However, China has not provided this type of aid.
In the next few days, it will be intriguing to see how China continues to respond. Will the change in aid from an initial $100,000 donation to a $1.6 million donation reflect an upward trend in aid sent to the Philippines, or was the increased donation the last of China’s aid?

2014-01-20,CMU,China,"Jessica Zhang, a professor of mechanical engineering, has been named a winner of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in recognition of her development of computer imaging and analysis for boats. She has been specifically awarded for the development of computer algorithms that create novel geometric modeling and analysis programs for Navy ships and other vessels. Her research is adaptable to numerous diverse applications.
The PECASE, founded by Bill Clinton in 1996, is awarded annually by the former U.S. President in order to recognize the achievements of relatively young researchers. 102 recipients of the award were named on Dec. 23, 2013. In a statement regarding the PECASE recipients, President Obama said, “The impressive achievements of these early-stage scientists and engineers are promising indicators of even greater successes ahead. We are grateful for their commitment to generating the scientific and technical advancements that will ensure America’s global leadership for many years to come.”
Zhang said, “For this award, there’s a lot of information about it already out there — a lot of news about it. It’s the highest honor for us, the junior faculty. It takes more than one year to go through the nomination process. So, I’m really happy to get it.”
Each recipient of the PECASE is backed by a particular government department or agency; Zhang’s research is supported by the U.S. Department of Defense. Her programs are used in simulations to validate the quality of the Navy’s craft designs and to analyze them for any potential issues, especially in the early stages of design. Zhang’s work helps meet the Navy’s ongoing need for better ways to inspect their designs.
Zhang’s work, however, can be applied to more than ships. When asked about the scope of her research, she said, “The fundamental research is all based on building computer models. The model can be the boat, can be the ship, can be the submarine, but it can also be the heart, be the brain.”
A significant portion of Zhang’s work is in the field of biomedical imaging. She has developed new technology that is similar to that used by the Navy, but is used to produce geometric images of everything from the external human body to internal organs and biological components at the molecular level. This work has various applications in computational biomedicine and engineering.
Yet the potential applications of her research do not stop there. Zhang is interested in expanding her technology into many other uses. “I like all of the technology development — the things that give us new problems,” she said. “I like computation — to build computer models. Those can be useful for many different applications. We have a lot of potential with many other applications that we haven’t had a chance to work on yet.”
Zhang grew up in China, where she attained her bachelor’s degree in automotive engineering and her master’s degree in engineering mechanics at Tsinghua University in Beijing. She then moved to the U.S. and earned a second master’s degree in aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics and a Ph.D. in computational engineering and sciences from the University of Texas at Austin. She was then hired as an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, and is now an associate professor.
When asked why she chose to work at Carnegie Mellon, Zhang said, “CMU provides a super interdisciplinary research environment. We are small, but sometimes small is beautiful. It provides a great place for interaction. You can easily talk to people, people here all are very friendly and easy to collaborate with. CMU is very high-quality; it has very high standards for everything.”
Zhang currently teaches courses about computational engineering methods, including 24-658: Computational Bio-Modeling and Visualization.
“I like to interact with students,” she said. “Right now, computation skills are becoming more and more important for our engineering students.”
Outside of university life, Zhang is married and has two daughters, one who is 8 years old and another who is 20 months old. Her husband works in the Genomics Proteomics Core lab at the University of Pittsburgh.
“Right now, my main hobby is playing with my children. [I enjoy] having time to take them places — to museums, to the science center, to the zoo,” she said. 
Zhang loves spending time with her family at the neighborhood’s interesting and educational places, such as Phipps Conservatory and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Every year, Zhang also looks forward to taking her children to Spring Carnival..

2014-01-20,CMU,China,"In December, China clamped down on the Bitcoin movement, prompting many Chinese financial institutions and websites to stop using the currency as payment. Bitcoins are a great idea — an international e-currency that cuts out middlemen, protects consumers and benefits producers. The only problem is that some governments believe they are perfect for criminal activity and provide a whole new landscape to criminals interested in money laundering or fraud. If Bitcoins are ever embraced on a larger scale, governments need to provide the right amount of regulation to catch crime, while also encouraging the use of Bitcoins to reap the benefits of the currency.
Bitcoins have been quite the craze lately, as they have many attractive and often lucrative aspects. First, there’s the secretive, anonymous coder who uses the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose idea for virtual currency stemmed from a distrust of monetary systems in the 2008 economic crisis. No one really knows Nakamoto, and the coins’ creator has only communicated with certain members of the Bitcoin community. Slowly but surely, Bitcoin has gained prominence and its value has since skyrocketed.
A second attractive aspect of Bitcoin is that users can cut out greedy middlemen in transactions, allowing consumers to directly transact with producers. Third, and quite bluntly, the value of Bitcoins have slingshotted into space, with some worth more than $800 each as of Jan. 16, according to Bitcoin Charts, depending on which exchange is used. 
Finally, many see Bitcoin as the future’s currency and, perhaps, as the criminal’s dream. The Bitcoin’s anonymity and lack of regulation give money launderers the perfect vehicle to shuffle large amounts of money around, in theory.
This final characteristic of Bitcoin was one of the main concerns that lawmakers and enforcers had when Bitcoin became a trending topic online. Theoretically, money can be stored by buying Bitcoins with cash, and storing Bitcoins in virtual wallets gives criminals increased mobility to move their funds and use them cleanly. On the other hand, Bitcoins aren’t private; transactions can be traced via the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network and, although it is possible to see where Bitcoins change hands, it is not possible to concretely find an individual behind a transaction.
However, in order to liquidate the Bitcoin, most exchanges require some sort of identification. This caveat creates just as much hassle for any money launderer using cash in an attempt to escape taxation or the authorities. In fact, according to Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in an interview with The New York Times, cash is still preferable to Bitcoins for criminals. Bitcoins don’t have a high enough transaction volume to act as a camouflage for money launderers using the currency to store their money. Also, considering the amount of volatility in large amounts of Bitcoin, criminals have a lot to lose if they try to money launder with Bitcoins.
China, the world’s second largest economy, is trying to cut its losses in the case that Bitcoin’s fortunes deteriorate. According to Forbes Magazine, the Bitcoin’s rise in value can be traced, to an extent, back to China’s rising use of the currency. Additionally, according to The New York Times, Bitcoin is “essentially a kind of special virtual commodity.” The fact that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value like gold or silver, and no government to back it up, makes it a currency based on speculation from users.
China is perhaps making a move to stop Bitcoin from being used in ordinary places like restaurants or even online stores, and by extension, trying to stop any financial dependence on a potential Bitcoin bubble. The Bitcoin will be hard to stabilize, especially considering how decentralized it is without a controlling body. 
Even though operating without a controlling body is perhaps the entire point of the Bitcoin, inflation of the currency is not controlled in the same way U.S. dollars are. Steady prices are a driving factor for consumers to consume. If Bitcoins become more popular and their prices swing radically up and down during short periods of time, as they are prone to do, small businesses, like restaurants, won’t be able to cope. 
In the end, the Bitcoin remains a new idea and a symbol that our financial systems need a revamp, but it is nowhere near flawless. If people were to use it widely, they would provide criminals with the perfect circumstances to launder money and commit fraud. However, if Bitcoin is over-regulated, its entire purpose as a perfect floating currency will be for nothing as consumer use diminishes.

2014-01-27,CMU,China,"If you were to go back in history and meet with the explorers and navigators of yesteryear, they would probably be wielding — at least one — magnetic compass. Whip out your compass app on your smartphone, and they’d probably be flabbergasted — well, with that and your time machine. But how has the compass worked to help everyone from ancient Chinese seafarers to today’s Boy Scouts of America? And how exactly does that timeworn technology work in your iPhone?
First, we’ll go over the magnetic compass. This trustworthy piece of equipment has been around since 200 BCE, according to William Lowrie, a professor emeritus at ETH Zurich. Navigators started using this compass regularly on land and sea closer to 1000 CE, in present-day China. The standard magnetic compass of the 20th century is made up of a magnetized needle in its heart with a face showing cardinal directions — north, south, east, and west. The needle is mounted on a surface with low friction so that it can easily turn; if held flat, one end of the needle will point toward magnetic north and one to magnetic south.
The compass is able to determine north and south due to the magnet’s interaction with the Earth’s magnetic field. The cause of the magnetic field is not completely known, but geologists have made hypotheses regarding the phenomenon by analyzing the layers of the Earth. The Earth is made up of an outer crust, followed by the upper mantle, the inner mantle, the outer core, and then finally the inner core at the very center. The inner core is made up mostly of molten iron, but the very center of the inner core is under so much pressure that the iron becomes solid, according to howstuffworks.com. It is believed that the rotation of the Earth and the immense heat from the core cause the iron to move in a rotational pattern. This rotational pattern may be the source of the magnetic field that we see on Earth. The field produced is very weak, however, which is why the needle on the compass needs to be very lightweight and on a surface with minimal friction.
As expected with any technology created over two millenniums ago, the compass has its issues. First, it has to be completely level to work — making it rather difficult to use on something like an airplane. Also, a magnetic compass can take a long time to correct itself. Another confusing thing is that the magnetic north pole is actually the geographical south pole (and vice-versa).
So if the traditional needle compass works because of a small magnet, how do the compass apps in phones work? As it turns out, the smartphones do have a small magnetometer, which can measure the Earth’s magnetic field. This information is combined with an accelerator inside the phone. The accelerator gets information regarding the phone’s position in space. It is able to pinpoint the phone’s position from solid-state sensors within the phone that can measure their tilt and movement. The information provided by these devices means that the compass app can display cardinal directions no matter which orientation the phone is in, according to the algorithmic software development company Sensor Platforms.
Whether using a 200 BCE  compass or the compass app on the iPhone 5S, the Earth’s magnetic field is the key to having reliable directions. Now, if only Apple could develop a moral compass app..

2014-01-27,CMU,China,"In Daxing, a suburb of Beijing, there is a curious building that is called a rehabilitation center. It is quite literally used to treat Internet addiction.
The facility is meant to be a solution for Internet junkies, whose population has risen dramatically thanks to the widespread availability of cheaper Internet and the popularity of online games, such as World of Warcraft and League of Legends.
According to The New York Times, the facility in Daxing boasts a 70 percent success rate. What does this treatment include? Well, it’s much like military school summer camp. Students are kept in dorms, guarded by adults. They abide by a strict schedule of physical activity and careful diets. Some are even periodically put on medication. On the whole, the camp is designed for patients to strengthen their bonds with reality.
In this day and age, Internet usage is everywhere. But at what point does Internet use cross into addiction that requires psychiatric help? It’s a very thin line that is somewhat arbitrary. Internet addiction camps exist to help Internet junkies reconnect, not to a laptop, but to life. Life outside the computer is something that educators need to start addressing. There are skills, values, and traditions to be sought outside of an LCD monitor, like physical activity, social interaction, and books — classic elementary school values that can be lost if computers are used in a casual fashion in education systems.
Imagine this: a student visits University Health Services. They don’t know anyone there, and they’re waiting for a doctor. Five minutes pass. What do they do? They pull out their phone and browse Facebook, their email, sports scores, and so on. They go on the web. Does this cell phone usage count as Internet addiction, or rather the more scientific name, Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD)?
Where’s the line between Internet use and Internet addiction? According to a CNN interview with Dr. Charles O’Brien, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, any withdrawal anxiety or stress as a result of lack of Internet use can be considered IAD. In the end, adults need to make sure that children use the computer in moderation to avoid addiction.
So who usually suffers from IAD? Mainly, it’s people who obsessively play the aforementioned online games. In fact, many popular games are played on a professional level and include perks like sponsorships and television deals. Along with China, South Korea is considered to be at the forefront of treatment, especially because it deals with such high levels of both amateur and professional gaming. According to CNN, 8 percent of South Koreans between the ages of nine and 39, and 14 percent of those between the ages of nine and 12, suffer from IAD. Video games are becoming ingrained in the culture of South Korea and, as a result, it encourages Korea’s younger generation to start playing at an early age. Gaming gives children stimulation and determination, but there’s a point where children play too often and become too engaged. This addiction is why they need to learn in the classroom that the computer is a tool, not something to be dependent on.
If IAD is a real thing, how can it be stopped? The only reason IAD is a legitimate problem is that in countries like the United States, it is too simple to access the Internet. In fact, according to the Department of Education, nearly 97 percent of public schools in the nation have at least one computer per classroom. This number makes it so much easier for children to learn through multimedia teaching methods.
On the other hand, ease of access makes it very easy for kids to start playing online games. The reason IAD has boot camps in both China and South Korea is that these countries have high labor force participation. Since it is pretty normal for both parents to work high-intensity jobs, children’s Internet use often goes unregulated.
Perhaps introducing technology at a higher level of education might be a solution, for the United States, China, and Korea. The reason these rehabilitation centers work is that they force children to exert themselves in physical activity and other actions that don’t rely on technology.
So, why shouldn’t schools emphasize physical education, such as competitive sports? If children don’t want to participate in sports, then schools should start special interest clubs that involve the arts. Not only would this emphasis lead to a healthier youth, it would also steer children away from addictive gaming and toward more productive activities. Technology is most definitely a blessing, but society cannot let it hamper the development of our younger generation..

2014-02-10,CMU,China,"Every two years, the world convenes to celebrate the best every country has to offer at the Olympic games. The athletes spend their entire lives training for sports that go unseen except for two weeks every four years. The biggest, fastest, and strongest in each country train for the love of the game. Except for a lucky few people, these athletes won’t suddenly become household names and make a living off of endorsement deals. The athletes, the true competitors who play for pride and honor — not money and fame — are supposed to be what the games are about. 
The Olympics are intended to be the ultimate show of world unity, with countries setting aside conflict and ideological differences to compete as equals. Nowhere else would Israel and Iran walk side by side, but every year, the Olympics become a soapbox for political and economic commentary. Much like China six years ago during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, Russia wanted to use these games to showcase their country to the rest of the world. Instead, the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics has been ripe with controversy, further solidifying many of the stereotypes the rest of the world holds against Russia.
The most talked-about issue coming into Sochi was Russia’s homosexual propaganda ban. At a time when many countries are slowly moving toward the legalization of same-sex marriage, Russia signed a controversial law banning all forms of homosexual propaganda in an attempt to limit the exposure of the nation’s youth to this immoral lifestyle. 
Given the explicit non-discriminatory aspect of the Olympics, this legislation sent shockwaves through many of the major winter Olympic competitors, including the United States. This instance was not the first time the United States and Russia had played out political disagreements in an Olympic forum. 
The United States and 64 other countries boycotted the 1980 summer games, held in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. In retribution, the Soviets led a boycott of the 1984 games, hosted by Los Angeles. 
What is lost in these instances of politics interceding sports are the opportunities of hundreds of athletes. Many of these athletes trained their entire lives for one moment, one chance to earn the pride and respect of their nation and the world, but had it all taken away because of political posturing. 
It’s fine to talk about Russia’s conservative social standards, or the plague of corruption that ran the budget of the Sochi Olympics to over four times its original $12 billion budget, or even the shoddy construction that forced one American bobsled team member to break down his bathroom door when the lock got stuck. 
But let’s not forget the true purpose of the Olympics. The Olympics are a celebration of the human race, a display of triumph over nature, pain, and even each other. 
Whatever political overtones the media may try to place on these games, the focus should ultimately be on the athletes. 
Just try and keep that in mind the next time President Barack Obama has a 30-minute interview during what is being advertised as Olympic Games coverage, or another reporter tweets a picture of a shoddy Sochi hotel room. 
These games are about the athletes — a celebration of their life’s work and their chance to earn the pride and respect of not only their nation, but humanity as a whole..

2014-02-10,CMU,China,"One of the most talked-about commercials from this year’s Super Bowl was not a comedic one from Budweiser or Geico, but what was meant to be a moving and inspiring video from Coca-Cola. The company's advertisement depicted Americans of various ethnic backgrounds singing ""America the Beautiful” in seven foreign languages. While many people saw the commercial as representative of the diversity and heart of America, many were outraged by the idea of it.
Following the airing of the commercial, hashtags such as #boycottcoke and #f***coke quickly made it to the top of Twitter’s trending list. Critics of the commercial expressed their dissatisfaction with Coca-Cola in statements such as one Twitter user's prominent comment “Nice to see that coke likes to sing an AMERICAN song in the terrorist's language. Way to go coke. You can leave America.” Traditionalists argue that true Americans speak English.
It is sickening that people try to take a message of hatred out of a commercial with a message of unity. After all, almost all Americans descend from people that were once immigrants of a foreign country. 
Many conservatives, such as former congressman Allen West (R-Fla.), have expressed their dismay at the commercial. In a blog post on his website, West described Coca-Cola as a ""company as American as they come"" and stated that this “truly disturbing commercial” was a sign that ""we are on the road to perdition."" 
What is scary is that the West actually believes that increased diversity and acceptance of others is leading America to some form of eternal punishment. By making such a statement, he is violating the principles of his own Christian religion and insulting the reputation of those that are truly religious by those principles. 
The controversy caused by this commercial is completely ridiculous. Coca-Cola's decision to air the commercial was a logical one, as they have recently received criticism for being a major sponsor of this year’s Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia, a nation that recently legislated strong anti-gay laws. Coca-Cola's commercial, with its inclusion of people from diverse backgrounds, as well as the first gay couple to be shown in a Super Bowl commercial, showed that the company does not support discrimination against any culture or lifestyle.
Additionally, critics of this commercial are wrong to claim that English is the official language of the United States. Yes, English dominates all industry and media in America. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 60 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home, and 7 percent exclusively speak a language other than English.
Does the fact that this 7 percent does not speak English make them less American than you or I? America does not have a universal culture, but an array of cultures from around the world. This array of cultures is what makes our nation different. When conservatives associated the foreign languages spoken by the people in this commercial with illegal immigration and terrorism, they essentially insulted all members of cultural communities, such as Chinatowns, Germantowns, and countless others. These communities embody the heritage of the people living in them, and how are they any less American than the small homogeneous communities of Caucasians or African-Americans speaking English? America is not a Caucasian community, nor is it only a Chinatown or Germantown. America is a melting pot.
Over the past century, America has made extensive progress in civil rights and equality. However, the fact that many still associate a single language with the nation shows that there is progress still to be made and that many are reluctant to change. Perhaps if Coca-Cola airs the same commercial in 20 years, people will simply see it as another ordinary, uncontroversial commercial, or better yet, as an accurate representation of this nation. .

2014-03-03,CMU,China,"From 1955 to 1972, the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States captivated the world and inspired a generation. From the Russians launching Sputnik 1 on Oct. 4, 1957, to the United States landing Apollo 11 and the first humans on the moon on July 20, 1969, the limits of human exploration and scientific accomplishment were pushed to bounds never before seen.
Now, NASA has slowly crumbled due to budget cuts and, unfortunately, space exploration has lost its former buzz. The governments of the United States and Russia have stepped down from the podium, setting the stage for the next pioneer of the universe: the private sector.
Companies like Google and SpaceX have incentivized some of the brightest minds in the world to tackle the challenge of space exploration in part by offering prizes for reaching milestones. Google’s Lunar XPRIZE is the latest competition, with almost 20 private companies entered. This prize awards over $30 million in winnings to companies able to achieve specific goals pertaining to lunar exploration. The grand prize is $20 million to the first team that can successfully land a rover on the moon and navigate 500 meters with it.
However, before the final countdown to the moon begins, Google will award $1.75 million in Milestone Prizes to companies that can demonstrate technical goals in landing, mobility, and imaging. Last week, two of the 19 teams entered in the competition were announced to qualify to potentially receive awards in all three categories. One of them is Carnegie Mellon’s spinoff company: Astrobotic Technology Inc.
The Team
Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh-based company run by John Thorton, has a 12-man team, some of whom are Carnegie Mellon students and faculty. Headed by Red Whittaker — Fredkin University research professor of the Robotics Institute and director of the Field Robotics Center — they lead the work on the lunar rover and provide significant contributions to the mission.
Speaking about the vision Astrobotic follows, Thornton said, “A big part of our mission is democratizing space and the moon. It is about creating the moon as the next continent to the world. It is about bringing the moon closer to all of us. We need to learn to live off of this planet. We need to identify where the resources are and harvest them. We need to create an off-Earth economy and start to spread into space.”
Carnegie Mellon’s goals are also as spectacular in nature. “Carnegie Mellon never does anything just for a prize,” Whittaker said. “There is always a higher purpose. It will be to build a future of space robotics. All technological challenges are the same in that way. There was a time when the world didn’t believe a computer could defeat a human chess champion, and so Carnegie Mellon went after that. Space is the next destination and it is a substantial technological challenge. Whether you look at computer chess playing, flying in the early days, driver-less racing, or moon exploration, there is nothing easy about it. You don’t do these things because they are easy.”
Since the beginning of space exploration, there have only ever been two robots that have traversed the lands on the moon; one of them came from China and the other came from the Soviet Union. However, these missions were both carried out with extensive amounts of resources and time. Illustrating the monumental accomplishment Carnegie Mellon students and faculty are chasing, Whittaker said, “The Soviets and China each put more than a decade into [their missions]. If you count the people that touched it, there were hundreds of thousands. Moreover, the money is in the billions. You have to think, by comparison, very highly of this community [at Carnegie Mellon] that doesn’t have that decade and doesn’t have those billions and doesn’t have that army of hundreds of thousands getting it done.”
The majority of the work on the rover is done by Carnegie Mellon students enrolled in the course 16-865, Advanced Mobile Robot Development. While this class only meets officially once a week, the members of the team invest hundreds of hours each month into perfecting the design and building the rover to ensure that everything will go smoothly for when the launch day comes. During the class, Whittaker stressed the necessity of attention to detail when he said, “Imagine if you had only one shot in all of eternity to get your dream done. You can’t leave anything for granted.”
While many people on the team are upperclassman and graduate students with years of experience, there are also many younger members learning on the job. Jake Tesler, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, joined the course last semester with little to no experience in robotics. However, with work and guidance, Tesler is now making contributions to the avionics that go behind the rover. 
The Mission
Whittaker maintained that while $20 million cashed into the bank would be gratifying, the true excitement lies in the exploration of the moon. Whittaker said, “It is authentic exploration. XPRIZE pays you for driving around in the dirt anywhere you want to go. However, that’s not enough for us. We go for the discovery, for the science and for the exploration.”
“There are very real motivations,” he continued. “One of the reasons the moon is our destination is because of the exploration of the pits. These pits are holes which collapsed in. The things that are new on the moon are the water, the ice, and the pits. For decades exploration has looked at rocks, dust, and gravity, but has missed all together the great prize [the pits]. The pit of interest is the size of Heinz Field and as tall as the Statue of Liberty. Many hypotheses for life on extraterrestrial bodies suggest that would likely exist underground. Additionally, one of the collapsed walls has a ramp and so there are some wild scenarios, of course, for what could explain this.”
The current goal for the team commanding the mission is to land the rover on the moon, drive it 500 meters to collect the XPRIZE, and then begin exploration and examination of the pit. This is a scientific discovery that has never been accomplished. The last generation was able to find pride, joy, and inspiration in NASA’s mission to land on the moon. While NASA may no longer be the force that it once was, Astrobotic could be the hero of this generation. Employees, students, and faculty at Carnegie Mellon and Astrobotic are working to accomplish a potentially game-changing goal that could inspire generations to come, and prove that not only is there so much left to accomplish, but also that if you reach high enough for huge dreams, you can grab them..

2014-03-24,CMU,China,"As of last Thursday, the eighth annual Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is officially in full swing. Under this year’s theme of “Faces of Work,” the festival features a number of films from around the globe that all focus on workers and, often, their struggle for a better life. The festival, which began last Thursday night with a screening of the Polish film Walesa. Man of Hope and held its campus premiere on Friday with a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, will continue through April 5. Most screenings will take place in McConomy Auditorium.
The festival’s theme is in dedication to the life and work of influential Carnegie Mellon professor Paul Goodman, who passed away due to a stroke in early 2012. At Carnegie Mellon, Goodman pushed to expand international university projects in technological and environmental research, especially in developing countries in Asia and South America. 
According to the festival’s website, Goodman was an avid filmmaker who produced over 20 documentaries demonstrating “how global development and technological expansion are changing the nature of workplace demographics and methods of production” by highlighting the “important but often overlooked work of individuals such as a nurse, a factory worker, a glass blower, a fisherman, and a women’s rowing team.” Several of his works will be screened along with other films over the course of the festival — including Shipbreakers, for which Goodman posthumously won the Best Producer of Documentary Film Award at the 2014 Madrid International Film Festival.
Opening night Thursday at the Regent Square Theater included the screening Walesa. Man of Hope, directed by Andrzej Wajda. The film tells the true story of Lech Walesa, a common shipyard electrician who becomes embroiled in the workers’ rights movement of Poland, eventually becoming the leader of the Polish trade union, Solidarity. In this position, Walesa was able to negotiate significant concessions for workers from the communist regime. Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his efforts and was elected the first president of Poland following its independence in 1989. 
The world of Walesa. Man of Hope is a vivid nightmare: a Soviet-bloc country where the police beat and arrest citizens on the flimsiest suspicion and tanks roll through the streets. Indeed, when Walesa leaves home, he often hands his wife his watch and wedding band and instructs her to sell them if he doesn’t come back. Interspersed with documentary footage of the actual Polish riots and demonstrations that took place over the course of the 1970s, the film is a compelling narrative, focusing on Walesa as both an unlikely political leader — his talents for leadership coming not from books, but, as he says in the film, from ”knowledge of Poland and its people” — as well as a family man who struggles to provide for both the monetary and emotional welfare of his wife, Danuta, and their six children even when he is being paraded through the streets as a hero. Danuta Walesa was in attendance at the screening.
The film’s handling of Walesa’s private life occasionally slips into a whitewashing of the beloved figure — frequent verbal hints at the man’s dirty secrets or ill treatment of his wife are never explored — and the toll his efforts have on his family, especially Danuta, are given a very surface-level treatment. The depiction of the public Walesa, however, is where the film soars. One can’t help but feel moved watching him lead the workers’ strikes. Walesa truly was a natural-born leader, and the film perfectly captures that aspect of the man.
Before the film, Danuta Walesa gave a brief introduction of the film, in which she stated that “[the film] is more a creation of the director than a documentary ... in which you will be able to see the people struggling for their freedom.” She also addressed what was surely on everyone’s mind: the obvious relation between the political struggle in Poland depicted in the film and the current bloody revolution and ensuing political battles in another former Soviet nation, Ukraine. In a brief Q&A session after the film, Danuta Walesa fielded many questions regarding her husband’s life and legacy and how it has shaped many of the recent protests against totalitarian governments. In response to an audience member who asked if there was a moment that she realized the Solidarity movement was big, she responded that she was “only just coming to realize” how big it was.
The festival’s campus opening night on Friday featured a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, directed by Ralph Vituccio, an instructor in the Entertainment Technology Center, and produced by Paul Goodman. The film focuses on Indian migrant workers who dismantle decommissioned ships along the beaches of Alang, highlighting the terrible conditions in which the impoverished men perform this dangerous job. A panel discussion was held afterward with Vituccio, Shipbreakers cinematographer Tom Clancey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette assistant managing editor Mark Roth, and University of Pittsburgh professor of political science Michael Goodhart. University of Pittsburgh professor of global studies Roger Rouse served as moderator.
Keeping with the festival’s theme, Shipbreakers details an industry that requires virtually no electric power, but runs almost exclusively on manual labor. Much of the work is performed using brute force — there are many instances of a hammer and chisel being put to work against steel and iron — and the lax enforcement of workers’ rights and environmental regulations makes the occupation a virtual death sentence. While Alang is not the only site of this industry, virtually all privately-owned ships are dismantled in similar shipyards in developing countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan.
During the panel, Vituccio said that “many workers were reluctant to talk to us” due to the risks involved with publicly denouncing the shipyards. Therefore, he said, each worker who did speak had “incredible courage” in basically putting his life on the line by speaking to “people he’d never see again.”
The stories these workers tell are harrowing, to say the least. Among tales of men being crushed to death by falling steel, many of the workers complain of the smoke they are forced to breathe due to the lack of proper masks. Workers are largely unaware of the kinds of toxins to which they are exposed — many of them have been outlawed since the 1970s, but are still present in the ships being dismantled. Interviews with workers and managers reveal a large disparity in how the situation is viewed. One shipyard manager even insisted that because there were trees growing outside his office, that meant there was no environmental problems. “Greenery means no pollution,” is how he put it. 
The conditions in Alang are contrasted with the same industry being performed in Brownsville, Texas, where Mexican migrant workers dismantle U.S. government-owned ships according to strict environmental and safety standards. A chilling visual compared the workers in India wearing a simple cloth tied around their faces while workers in Texas performed the same task wearing a complete Hazmat suit and mask. 
While the film made a good case that the practice of ship recycling should follow the strict regulations followed in the United States, Clancey pointed out in the panel that the wages paid were “high for Mexico, but are extremely low by U.S. standards.” He also mentioned that ships are only dismantled in such a highly regulated fashion in Texas because they are owned by the U.S. government and, therefore, have to be dismantled in that manner according to EPA regulations. They are forbidden from being sold to private shipyards in developing countries.
The two films featured in the opening of “Faces of Work” are signs of good things to come in the festival. One thing is certain: Both films leave one with a greater appreciation of working conditions in the United States. After witnessing men beaten to within inches of death for protesting for their right to collective bargaining, or a man working nearly 20-hour days breathing in hazardous chemicals, recent protests over the wages of McDonald’s workers certainly lose some fire. While certainly present, this effect, however, isn’t the point of “Faces of Work.” Indeed, many Americans were in similar situations during our own Industrial Revolution. As Vituccio explained in his introduction to Shipbreakers, the goal of the film was to “focus on the burden of the common worker,” whether that be a dockyard worker in China or a gas station attendant in New Jersey. The films of “Faces of Work” demonstrate the past, present, and future struggles of men and women all around the world; celebrating their successes as well as mourning the losses felt along the way. 
“Faces of Work” will be hosting screenings through April 5. More information can be found at cmu.edu/faces.

2014-03-24,CMU,China,"Obama’s presidency may as well have eight months left. Now even Nate Silver, former New York Times statistics whiz, is predicting that Republicans are more likely than not to win control of the Senate in 2014. 
If that happens, President Obama’s last two years will be a brutal struggle against Congress with little to show for the first six years of his presidency but a stimulus of questionable efficacy and a healthcare act that's hurt more people than it's helped.
Let’s take a look at the races in 2014. One must remember that Senate seats go up for election every six years, which means that the Senators up for re-election in this cycle are the same ones who won in 2008, a wave election year for Democrats. As a result, Democrats are defending 21 seats and Republicans are defending only 15. In a Senate where Democrats control 55 total seats and Republicans control the remaining 45, Republicans only need to pick up six seats in 2014 to gain the majority.
Of the 36 seats up for election this year, some are totally safe, as popular incumbents are seeking re-election in states that generally vote for their party. John Cornyn (R–Texas), a two-term incumbent, probably won’t lose, just as three-term incumbent Jack Reed (D–R.I.), whose race is currently uncontested, won’t lose. 
Eliminating those seats leaves us with Democrats defending eight competitive seats and Republicans defending two — still not a pretty outlook for the president’s party, especially considering that Republicans are defending two seats in Georgia and Kentucky, two solidly Republican states.
Exacerbating this situation for Democrats is a retirement wave where many of their most popular incumbents are retiring from senatorship after serving multiple terms. Montana, a state that Mitt Romney carried by double digits in 2012, is losing veteran senator Max Baucus (D–Mont.), who has decided not to run in 2014, instead assuming the role of ambassador to China. Even though the fundamentals of a Senate election in Montana favor Republicans, a superstar candidate like Baucus whose name is well known and who polls exceptionally well, would make this a tough pickup for Republicans. 
Without the benefits of incumbency to influence the election, two fresh names on the ballot will likely fall prey to the state’s fundamentals, which favor Republicans and the most statistically significant factor in midterm elections: the president’s approval rating, which is hovering around a markedly low 43 percent.
Democrats have a similar situation in West Virginia, where Jay Rockefeller (D–W.Va.) decided not to run for re-election, putting a state that’s been hit the hardest by Democrats’ regulation on coal, safely in Republican territory. Add South Dakota to that list, and already Republicans are looking at three easy pickups, shifting the Senate landscape to 52 Democrats and 48 Republicans.
The next wave of possible Republican pickups comes form a group of Senators in traditionally red states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. This is where Obamacare and the toxic political atmosphere for Democrats comes into play. Mark Pryor (D–Ark.), Kay Hagan (D–N.C.), Mark Begich (D–Ala.), and Mary Landrieu (D–La.) are already fending off advertisements labeling them as the deciding vote for Obamacare.  Recent polling puts their chances even with or slightly below their potential Republican competitors, as primaries aren't over yet. However, as we’ve seen in every election, a party’s candidates always suffer in polling during their primaries, so expect those four Senators’ races to sway a few additional points toward Republicans as primaries come to a close.
If Republicans pick up three of those four seats, they’ve already won the majority and that’s not even counting other potential pickups. Superstar Scott Brown (R–Mass.) just announced his candidacy in New Hampshire after moving there early this year, Carl Levin (D–Mich.) retired, and though Michigan is a traditionally liberal state, it is quite possible that Republicans will nominate a better candidate than Democrats and carry the race.
Additionally, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) just retired, and a high-quality Republican candidate could put a state whose most famed newspaper, the Des Moines Register, ended 30-plus years of endorsing Democrats to endorse Mitt Romney in 2012. Finally, Al Franken (D–Minn.) won a highly controversial race in 2008, and barely walked away with the victory. Obama additionally only carried the state with 52 percent of the vote in 2012. Now that the landscape is much more toxic to Democrats, a Republican pickup is not out of the question.
So what happens if Republicans do pick up the Senate? Obama has had a great time being able to paint Republicans as obstructionists, as his agenda has been primarily opposed by a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, which polling concludes is likely to stick around in 2014. If Republicans take over the Senate, Obama's whole “one half of one house is opposing my agenda” narrative turns into “one man against Congress.”
If history is any guide, the American people generally don’t like presidents that defy the will of Congress, as it stings of tyranny. Obama’s agenda will be effectively dead, and he’ll be forced to comply with the will of an adversarial Congress, or be defined as an inflexible, imperialistic ideologue for abusing his veto power. Either way, Obama’s days of creating and pushing an agenda are over, and the president whose candidacy marked the self-declared “moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal” will be reduced to nothing more than a lame duck..

2014-03-31,CMU,China,"Over the past few weeks, as events in Crimea and Ukraine continue to make daily headlines, many have claimed that we are witnessing the rise of the next big geopolitical conflict since the Cold War. Some have made an even more extreme claim, saying that this crisis marks the return of the United States and Russia to the Cold War.
It is hard to believe now that the entire struggle in Ukraine was started by protests in the streets. There has been little word on the status of Russia’s relationship with ousted former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. All eyes are focused on Russian troop movements on the Ukraine border. 
Maybe Russian President Vladimir Putin sees this conflict as a continuation of the Cold War. Putin described Russia’s annexation of Crimea as retribution for “a deeply-held grievance about what he considers to be the loss of the Soviet Union.” As hard as it may be, the United States must lead the so-called Western powers in an effort to tear down the barriers between East and West that have existed since the Cold War.
There are many reasons to support this belief. After all, Russia is trying to bulldoze its way into Ukraine and exert its influence, which has waned ever since the rise of the European Union. Since much of Europe is dependent on Russian natural gas, Russia sees no reason to filter itself and no reason to hold itself back. Putin — always the cunning but brash diplomat — is clearly pushing forward, as reports estimate that 40,000 Russian troops have gathered at the border.
Though a resurgence of the Cold War implies an escalation on the military scale for all nations involved, this criteria has become inaccurate. The world has become much too interconnected and too globalized to have a true Cold War. In fact, just this past week, Obama has been in the Hague and elsewhere in the Netherlands, trying to tie up treaties and deals to denuclearize the world. Obama’s idea in doing so is to secure weapons-grade radioactive material in a manner safe for both the people and the environment, and safe from terrorist thieves. 
Many leaders, especially those who lead smaller nations like Singapore, have reacted to such a summit with relief. As Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong stated, “We would like the work to continue, but we have to consider how, [and] what is the most appropriate way the leaders can get involved,” according to Channel NewsAsia.
It all goes back to the question: who decides who gets nuclear power? As the world evolves to accommodate more and more people, countries are increasingly turning to nuclear power as their “sustainable” energy source. Singapore — a nation with developed infrastructure but lacking nuclear power — is just one example of a major Asian economic hub and productive power that could easily shift toward nuclear energy.
But how is the world supposed to denuclearize itself while facing an increasing shortage of resources? Moreover, how can the world accomplish denuclearization when Russia, one of its counterparts — the one with the most sizable nuclear arsenal of all — has actively partaken in an act of nuclear aggression? Conferences like these are extremely important, but with the United States and other Western nations pursuing a policy of sanctions — which don’t accomplish much — it is hard to see Russia holding ties with such a conference.
President Obama faced backlash when he condemned Russia this past week, but according to The New York Times, he pressed too far forward, and justified the use of force in Iraq, a war that is constantly berated as being imperialistic. Sanctions seem to be the first step in a diplomat’s handbook. They immediately place countries on different sides, as if sanctions lead to isolation, which leads to war. This logical chain of events is hardly wrong — just look at North Korea. After sanction upon sanction, the small Asian state is as alienated as ever.
What the United States needs to do is to maintain its leadership position in condemning Russia. However, while the United States continues to pursue a policy of squeezing Russian leaders out with some sort of economic siege, the world heads closer and closer to Cold War-like relations. 
Still, as the conference in Hague has shown, the world has become much too weaponized and sensitive to the risk of nuclear warfare to ever fall into another Cold War-like nuclear standoff. Meanwhile, Russia — large and distant — has become much too insensitive to ever simply agree to nuclear sanctions. Sanctions will only make relations between Russia and the rest of the world colder, and even if Russia settles with the West, relations will likely be as weak as ever.
In order to strengthen relations with Russia, the United States should look to China, another nation that cannot afford to be alienated by the United States. The United States must, in the long-run, seek better relations with China. As hard as this may sound, the relationship between China and America must extend beyond trade.
China has long admired the United States’ international superiority, but the United States has long eyed China with suspicion. China, as one of Russia’s closest allies — if you can even call them that — has the key to unlock Russia from being a massive, mysterious nation to a more relenting nation that might just be open to negotiations. 
The United States must look past sanctions and pick up Russia along the way, perhaps through China. The conference in the Hague just shows how important diplomacy is, while also showing that the world must avoid alienating any major power, including Russia..

2014-04-07,CMU,China,"It’s almost been a month since the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was declared lost, and almost two weeks since it was officially declared to have crashed in the South Indian Ocean. 
As numerous planes scour the seas for any sign of wreckage or debris, we — the onlookers — have followed the news story from the start. We have seen the countless theories surrounding the flight, including everything from the pilot and his co-pilot, stolen passports, hijackings, and the Illuminati.
It is important to follow current events, yes. They make us well-informed citizens and enable us to participate in a public dialogue with our friends, professors, and whomever else we meet. But there comes a point when we are overloaded with information from the press. The press has reached maximum capacity when it comes to Flight 370.
In the past month, I have received more than 10 mobile pings that have said, “Potential debris spotted in Indian (or South China Sea) Ocean” or some other variant. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, CNN reporter Martin Savidge has spent the past month or so in a flight simulator testing Flight 370 theories, inspiring the Twitter trending hashtag #freemartinsavidge.
Despite the extensive media coverage, there have been few significant developments in the past month regarding the flight. These developments have included, first, that the flight had disappeared; second, that it has been declared lost in an area in the South Indian Ocean using satellite data, complex calculations, and the Doppler effect; and last, that there have been possible debris sightings close to the area where the plane is believed to have passed through.
But as each day passes without confirmed sighting of the wreckage, the media — CNN in particular because of its wide, expansive coverage — has resorted to excruciatingly aggravating extrapolation. In fact, one headline on CNN even read “Was Flight 370 a Zombie Plane?” There have been theories — none of which are substantiated in any way — regarding terror plots, hijackings, and a secret message from the plane before it vanished. Not only is CNN covering the story this way, but the other “Big Two” — Fox and NBC — have joined in, perhaps in an effort to boost television ratings in an era where news is more mobile and Internet-based.
I’m not saying that the CNN or news outlets should not be covering Flight 370. In fact, there are some fascinating stories behind it. For example, Malaysia’s public relations and general management of the flight’s disappearance have been criticized internationally. Therein lies the potential for a story with concrete facts and credible sources, one that would not be an extrapolation.
However, on the other side of the TV are viewers obsessed with finding this flight. Something within our human subconscious is drawn to such tragedies, and the surrealism of a plane crash contributes to our fascination. Flights, which used to be considered a luxury, are now considered to be essential. Air travel has connected the world by making it so much easier to traverse.
As a result of this accessibility, there is a sense of security, ease, and comfort, even, to be traveling in a metal bird thousands of miles above the ground. Then, an incident like Flight 370 comes along and disrupts our confidence in such a sense. As a result, we are compelled to understand what went wrong, and how Flight 370 differed from the millions of others. 
That being said, there are several issues with the way the “Big Three” — CNN, NBC, and Fox — have been capitalizing on this innate public interest in the doomed flight. The outlets, by throwing speculations and extrapolations, have left us confused and lead us to question their authority and integrity on such relatable, high-profile incidents..

2014-04-14,CMU,China,"Recently, Texas District Judge Suzanne Covington ruled that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice must inform the attorneys of two death row inmates of its new source of pentobarbital, the substance used for lethal injections. However, the Texas Supreme Court put Covington’s order on pause, stating that the issue must be studied further.
Texas was forced to find a new source of lethal injections after companies from foreign countries opposing the death penalty — which are nearly all of those in the developed world — refused to continue to sell the ingredients for this killer substance. While the rest of the world continues to move away from totalitarian forms of punishment, states like Texas continue to uphold them.
America, the “Land of the Free,” remains in fifth place for the most executions worldwide, behind China, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, if one were to only count Texas’s 16 executions last year, discounting the 23 others nationwide, America would only drop two slots on the international scale. This fact means there are only six countries reported in the world, besides the United States, that carry out more executions than Texas.
Therefore, the recent debates come to a bigger question. Does the fact that nearly every other developed nation in the world opposes the death penalty, and therefore refuses to sell us ingredients for our lethal injections, mean that perhaps we should move forward and follow the world’s example?
An argument cannot even be made that it is cheaper to simply kill someone than imprison them for life. According to Fox News, “a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole.” According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, “the additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons … is $90,000 per year per inmate. With California’s current death row population of 670, that accounts for $63.3 million annually.” Therefore, Fox News is not exaggerating when it says, “Every time a killer is sentenced to die, a school closes.”
Because the death penalty increases state spending, is a blatant violator of the Eighth Amendment, and represents a totalitarian view that the rest of the developed world has already abandoned, why continue to support it? The buzz created by this case is not simply a question of whether a person has the right to know how the state is killing its citizens; it is a question of whether or not the state should have the right to do so at all.   .

2014-04-28,CMU,China,"One Night in Beijing, the annual Chinese cultural performance show held by ARCC (Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture), was held on Saturday night.
This year, the theme of the show was “Pig Tales,” which featured an overarching skit billed as “an original sequel to the famous Journey to the West.” Journey to the West, of course, is one of the most well-known stories in Chinese literature, featuring the adventures of Sun WuKong, the Monkey King, and the other disciples of a Buddhist monk, who travel from China to India on a pilgrimage. The skit follows the story of Zhu Bajie, the comical pig-man disciple known for his laziness and gluttony, who must serve time tending to a temple after he commits a number of misdeeds.
While at the temple, Zhu Bajie, played by sophomore information systems major Daniel Song, forms a friendship with a taciturn girl named Huan Meiling,  played by senior international relations and politics and Chinese studies double major Sandra Yeh, who is being hounded by literal demons. Bajie must also face harsh rebukes from the deified Chinese general Guan Yu, played by junior mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Calvin Chan. The Monkey King also makes an appearance as a comically adorable version played by junior computer science major Joy Lin.
The skit had a number of humorous touches, including the use of “oh my Buddha” instead of “oh my God,” as well as a subplot about the Bandit Queen, who finds the Monkey King sexy, much to the dismay of her husband.
The skit also segued into the performances well, with each performance complementing a portion of the skit. The performances themselves surveyed the landscape of Chinese culture, from its ancient roots to modern times.
One of the best performances of the night included “You Know You Love Me, I’m Your Bad Boy,” a performance led by the Bandit King as he tried to impress his wife into loving him again. A dance to the song “Moonwalk” by Taiwanese boyband JPM, “I’m Your Bad Boy” was a smooth but energetic dance performance that showcased effects such as silhouette lighting. The dancing was choreographed well enough to be a music video for the actual song.
Its companion performance “Fragile Falling Flowers and Breakups,” was a graceful fan dance that touched on the same themes as “I’m Your Bad Boy.” Together, the two songs offered female and male perspectives on love and breakups. 
Also notable was the showing of Carnegie Mellon alumnus David Hsu’s (CIT ‘06) short film, “Fate,” about a girl who loses her boyfriend in a freak automobile accident, but gets a chance to reverse the death — at a price. The film features many Carnegie Mellon-centric locales and references. At one point, Hsu worked in a reference to The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch.
Many other performances also featured fan dancing, Chinese folk songs, and C-pop. The Ballroom Dance Club made an appearance in the performance “Toxic Tango,” a dance to the Britney Spears hit. At one part of the show, Princess Anna from Frozen teamed up with a sea deity to sing “Let Part of Your World Go,” a mashup of the hit songs from Frozen and The Little Mermaid.
The show also featured performances with uniquely Chinese instruments and objects, such as the Chinese yo-yo, the Chinese qin (a traditional stringed instrument), and lion dancing — dances in lion costumes traditionally performed during Chinese festivals.
One Night in Beijing was a show that brought together a multitude of talented performers from the Carnegie Mellon community and a variety of influences from Chinese culture. It was a great show for anyone with a connection to, or interest in, China..

2014-08-15,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon University celebrated another mile- stone in international education last month.
The university’s Rwanda campus (CMU-R) graduated its first class on July 24, when 22 students received master’s degrees in information technology during a ceremony at the Serena Hotel in Kigali, Rwanda.
Carnegie Mellon opened its Rwandan campus in 2012, becoming the first American university to offer master’s degrees in Africa taught by full-time, resident faculty. CMU-R currently offers a master’s degree in information technology, which, according to the university’s website, covers topics in information and communications technology including “mobile applications, information security and networking, and software management, as well as critical business areas such as finance, operations and entrepreneurship.” Beginning this August, the university will offer a joint master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering with the Pittsburgh campus.
Four of the graduating CMU-R students visited Pittsburgh last semester and took part in a classic campus tradition: painting the fence.
“We wanted to paint Carnegie Mellon in Rwanda and the link to our website on the Fence so that more people can learn about CMU’s presence in Rwanda,” Merab Twahirwa, the student speaker at the graduation ceremony, said in a Carnegie Mellon press release.
Twahirwa also spoke of the current development in Eastern Africa, saying, “Rwanda is an exciting place to know, and Africa is growing fast. IBM, Phillips, and GE are already setting up offices there.”
Bruce Krogh, professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of CMU-R, said of the recently graduated class, “They’re pioneers.... It’s terrific. I really feel great for the students.”
“The first semester is quite an adjustment for them,” Krogh continued. “American accents are difficult for them to understand among English accents.” Krogh also said that Rwandan education is typically more rote, and that the critical thinking and problem solving inherent in the Carnegie Mellon curriculum was new to many students.
“It was really more challenging for them,” said Michel Bézy, associate director of CMU-R and distinguished service professor of engineering and public policy. He highlighted students’ 80- to 90-hour work weeks, saying, “The work is not even anywhere close to what they’ve had before.”
“The requirements on the students are very different,"" Bézy continued, mentioning that “plagiarism is very common in Africa; even some professors do it.” CMU-R graduates had to make major adjustments in both dealing with the workload and creating quality work, according to Bézy.
Graduate Andrew Kinai (E ‘14) said in the release, “I always tell people, if you can come to CMU in Rwanda, it’s a big opportunity. The way the courses are structured, it’s relevant in terms of where we are in Africa today.”
“They are all now going directly into work,” Krogh said, noting that a few students are pursuing Ph.Ds. “More than half have jobs, and half had been working, left their job to do a master’s for two years, and went back to these jobs.”
However, Krogh also spoke of potential challenges in the East African job market, saying that “putting 22 CMU master’s students in the job market in Kigali is quite a bump.”
“It’s going to take a few years for them to realize the quality of our students,” Bézy said, explaining that professors regularly meet with human resource directors at many of the major companies operating in Africa, and CMU-R holds job fairs to place students.
In terms of future goals for the program, Krogh said, “our big challenge is tuition.” Carnegie Mellon tuition is the same worldwide, and despite the Rwandan government providing a 50 percent scholarship to East Africans, the cost of a CMU-R degree is still high, according to Krogh.
“Another goal is to get the student diversity we’d like to see,” Krogh said.
He explained that, out of the most recent graduating class, 21 of 22 were Rwandan. “We’d like it to really become a regional, if not international location.”
Steps toward this goal are being taken, however.
Two Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh students are traveling to the Rwandan campus to finish their master’s degrees in electrical and computer engineering this semester, and one Rwandan student studying information technology is coming for his fall semester at the Pittsburgh campus this year.
Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus also recently celebrated 10 years in Education City on the outskirts of Doha, Qatar’s capital. The campus opened in 2004 with 41 students in two programs and now offers biological sciences, business administration, computational biology, computer science, and information systems programs.
In 2012, Carnegie Mellon partnered with Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China to launch a joint graduate engineering program, called the Joint Institute of Engineering.
Sun Yat-sen and Carnegie Mellon at the same time launched a complementary program, the Shunde Inter- national Joint Research Institute, with the Shunde People’s Government of Foshan in Foshan, China..

2014-09-09,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon is looking to find out how the brain affects human behavior through its latest initiative, BrainHub.
On Aug. 26, the university announced the launch of BrainHub during a discussion with faculty and research partners. The university stated in a press release that it will work with a variety of home and international partners to create tools to study how the brain and human behavior are linked.
The initiative aims to bring insight into a variety of areas related to the brain, including cognition, learning and perception, and brain disorders like Parkinson’s disease, according to the release.
“As an initiative, [BrainHub] seeks to link people who are connected with different parts of campus who may or may not in some cases have been previously engaged in research related to neuroscience, brain science — to try and bring their expertise to bear on questions that are relevant to brain function,” said Nathan Urban, interim provost and Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz distinguished professor of life sciences.
For example, a person interested in engineering may be applying a data analysis process in an electrical engineering context, but may be able to apply that process to answer questions about the brain, Urban said.
Key first steps of the initiative will be to develop better tools for recording neuron activity and properties, as well as computational tools and approaches for better analyzing and understanding the link between what the brain is doing at a specific time as it yields various behaviors, according to the release.
“The belief is that there are people at Carnegie Mellon who have developed these kinds of technologies in one application area, and we want to understand how they can be leveraged in another application area,” Urban said.
As part of the initiative, Carnegie Mellon said university deans plan to recruit 10 or more new faculty members specializing in the brain sciences in various departments and “establish new sources of ongoing support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,” according to the release.
To jumpstart the new initiative, Carnegie Mellon has secured $75 million of initial commitments over the next five years from various funders, including the Hillman Foundation, RK Mellon Foundation, Dietrich Foundation, and Kris Gopalakrishnan, the co-founder of business consulting company Infosys, among others. 
The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation also represent a large portion of the funding, according to Urban.
Notable partnerships for the BrainHub initiative include Sun Yat-sen Univesrity in Guangzhou, China for its work with Alzheimer’s and autism, the University of Warwick in Coventry, England for its specialty in digital health, Oxford University’s International Brain Mechanics and Trauma Lab and the Indian Institute of Science, which has a brain institute initiative of its own, according to the Carnegie Mellon release. Carnegie Mellon will also work with long-time collaborators at the University of Pittsburgh.
In 2011, Carnegie Mellon partnered with Sun-Yat-sen University to create a joint graduate and engineering program, the Joint Institute of Engineering in China. Carnegie Mellon and Sun Yat-sen celebrated the launch of the program in late 2012. In July, Carnegie Mellon signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Warwick for a $10 million collaboration in data collection, analysis, and processing.
Urban said the short-term goals of the partnerships are to identify common areas of interest to develop further.
“There was a strong desire to have mechanisms for establishing these kinds of [connections among universities] and creating these kinds of joint projects, and we want to let the faculty who are engaged in this, drive that in terms of what directions they take,” Urban said.
Carnegie Mellon’s move to create new tools and methods to further study the brain is part of a larger trend of university research regarding the brain. In April 2013, President Barack Obama unveiled the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, a government initiative to better understand the mind and uncover new ways to cure, prevent, and treat brain disorders.
As part of the initiative, the government said it would provide approximately $100 million in investments through various government organizations for scientists to acquire needed tools for research.
In response to the initiative, many universities have begun their own brain research initiatives. 
For example, the University of California, San Diego in May 2013 introduced the Center for Brain Activity Mapping to develop new tools for recording the activities of neurons in the brain and to conduct brain-mapping experiments. In June, the state of California provided $2 million in funding from its $156 million 2014-15 state budget to jumpstart the university’s research in brain-mapping. The funding was California’s first allocation from a statewide research grant program known as the California Blueprint for Research to Advance Innovations in Neuroscience (Cal-BRAIN). Cal-BRAIN is a direct response by the state of California to President Obama’s initiative.
Urban said that Carnegie Mellon’s BrainHub initiative is unique from other university initiatives because of Carnegie Mellon’s international partnerships and its focus on drawing upon people in various disciplines.
“There’s a lot of focus for us in trying to bring in people who are from, say, computer science or engineering into the fold. We really think ... there’s a lot of opportunity for pushing the field forward rapidly by bringing new approaches, new technologies, [and] new tools to bear, Urban said..

2014-09-22,CMU,China,"White House to fight antibiotic resistance
Though the problem of antibiotic resistance has troubled hospitals and communities for decades, new genome-sequencing technologies that inspect bacterial genomes can be used to sketch out a molecular family tree, which could provide researchers with more data regarding antibiotic resistance. To support genome-sequencing technology and develop a new national strategy to fight resistant bacteria, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Sept. 18 recognizing antibiotic resistance and creating a task force to combat the issue. The order came as a response to a report released on the same day by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology encouraging further research on this topic. The White House also announced a $20 million prize for the development of rapid tests that can identify antibiotic-resistant infections.

Single dose of antidepressant changes the brain
SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) are one of the most common kinds of antidepressants prescribed. However, it is unclear what the exact effect of the drug is on the brain. A recent study conducted by Julia Sacher of the Max Plank Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences suggests that a single dose of antidepressant not only dramatically changes brain connectivity but also does so in a matter of hours.
In the study, participants were monitored in a brain scanner as they were allowed to let their mind wander for about 15 minutes and then monitored again after taking a single dose of escitalopram, better known as Lexapro. By comparing 3–D images of connections occurring in the participants’ brains, the researchers found that one dose of Lexapro reduces the level of connectivity in most of the brain.

Theory of relativity applicable to superheavy elements
Researchers have recently created the first chemical compound whose behavior can only be explained with Einstein’s theory of relativity. Researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany have combined the 106th element of the periodic table, seaborgium, with six carbon monoxide molecules. Although other superheavy elements have never exhibited relativistic behavior before, this one seems different. As the team measured its volatility and reactivity, the values were similar to those for compounds of molybdenum and tungsten — which are in the same group as seaborgium in the periodic table — with carbon monoxide. This behavior can agree with the theoretical model only if Einstein’s theory of relativity is taken into account. The researchers plan to perform further tests on heavier elements to test such relativistic effects.

New materials used for computer processors
A recent processor designed by researchers from several universities around the world uses phase change materials (PCMs), which may be able to change computers in the future. The calculations performed by most electronics today are carried out by silicon-based logic devices. However, PCMs have the advantage of being able to reversibly switch between two electrical states in mere billionths of a second. These materials have the potential to make the processing speed of future computers 1,000 times faster than they are now.
PCMs were first developed in the 1960s and were used in optical-memory devices. But now, they have begun to take the place of traditional silicon-based memory in some smartphones. As it turns out, PCMs-based processors use less energy, making them not only faster but also more environmentally friendly.

Study reveals effect of artificial sweeteners on body
Researchers have found that artificial sweeteners may disrupt the body’s blood sugar regulation, thus causing metabolic changes that can lead to diabetes. Even though previous studies on the effects of artificial sweeteners have had conflicting conclusions, this report has earned many positive responses from scientists. The researchers performed experiments on mice to back up their assertion that the sweeteners change the population of bacteria in the digestive system.
A control-group experiment found that there was little change in the mice that drank water or sugar water while mice that received artificial sweeteners developed a clear intolerance to glucose. However, at present the scientists still cannot explain how the sweeteners affect the bacteria and what exactly results in the changes from the glucose metabolism.

World population to reach 11 billion by mid-century
Most estimates in the past 20 years predicted that the human population would grow to around 10 billion by mid-century, a number that now seems to be an underestimate. It was previously assumed that the decline in birth rate in Africa is occurring at the same pace as declines in other regions (for example, Asia). However, it turns out the rate of fertility decline has slowed (and even reversed) in some African countries in the last 15 years. 
At current rates, scientists believe Africa will likely become as densely populated as today’s China. As Hans Rosling, an international health researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, expects, the world should prepare for at least 11 billion people by mid-century.

2014-09-29,CMU,China,"Externalities are the extra costs and benefits to a party that did not foresee them. Externalities may represent something very simple, but, on the grand scale of politics and international relations, they present a unique and systematic way of looking at the UN’s recent talks regarding climate change. This year, some of the world’s largest polluters, namely the United States and China, have made key changes in environmental politics.
Domestically, President Barack Obama has been widely documented for flexing his executive power, leading by example, and treading his own path. Although this behavior has been met with controversy, it seems as if he is willing to take the global community further into climate conversation. China, with new president Xi Jinping, has finally taken steps to clean up its own backyard, at a time when Beijing’s smog levels are reaching hazardous and unbearable levels. This year, Xi Jinping and his cabinet formally “declared war on pollution,” according to Reuters. This declaration comes after years of China calling itself a “developing economy,” which demanded a slackened restriction on emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.
In the game of politics, it seems like most nations see proactive climate change policy as a competitive disadvantage, bringing with it extra taxes, less production, and more risky investments in research and development. One way externalities can be cut from the economy is to realign interests. The world needs this realignment regarding environmental economics. 
According to Columbia University Professor Scott Barnett, governments “keep coming up with ideas like pledges, which imply that you can, by some kind of central planning, ordain a collective outcome, and the world doesn’t work that way.” He also stated that the UN has “not found the means to change the incentives to get the countries to actually adopt limits, essentially on emissions.”
One way to realign environmental and political interests would be to create an independent body to fund research and development while monitoring the situation on a global scale. The result would be a coalition fund, made up of governments, businesses, financial and development banks that are ready, according to the UN, to “mobilize up to $200 billion” toward environmental interests. The UN, in creating this coalition fund, has built a new body that has interests different than those of an independent state or business.
Obama has also called upon himself, his cabinet, and the United States to lead the world in fighting climate change. Additionally, in his speech at the UN, he called on China to take on a greater role in the fight. China has already begun to fight pollution on a domestic level, providing itself with a platform to join the United States in leading the effort to slow climate change. 
Both nations have wasted valuable time in squabbling over the “responsibility” of global climate change, but only now have they both adopted a direction in policy. Moreover, although some countries have already adopted significant policies, like Switzerland and Singapore, the United States and China must start taking decisive action if there is to be any significant action on a global scale, both because of the scale of their emissions and because they should serve as policy-examples for developing economies.
However, both the United States and China face significant hurdles in getting the effort started. Despite climate change rallies drawing around 400,000 supporters to New York, where the UN Climate Summit was being held last week, climate change remains an issue that does not particularly concern the majority of voters. CNN states that only 24 percent of Americans “list climate change as a national problem that they worry about ‘a great deal.’” Moreover, China’s large, sprawling, and corrupt system of Communist Party officials suggests that any comprehensive, across-the-board climate change policy would be met with ineffectiveness and inaction.
Ultimately, both countries are taking steps to change the game of environmental politics, but both also face further challenges in leading the charge against climate change..

2014-10-06,CMU,China,"Last week, the university announced that Henry Hillman donated $5 million to Carnegie Mellon’s nascent BrainHub initiative.
Hillman, referred to in a campus-wide email as a “renowned Pittsburgh philanthropist,” has donated funds to Carnegie Mellon in the past to support the construction of the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies.
“The Hillman gift will provide new endowment funds to help support presidential graduate fellowships in areas broadly connected to brain research,” the email said. “It will also provide seed grants, through CMU’s ProSEED program, for innovative research projects that will connect faculty from disciplines across CMU.”
The Henry L. Hillman Foundation, according to its website, is “dedicated to improving the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania.” Hillman inherited much of his money from his grandfather, a Pittsburgh steel tycoon and the founder of the Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical Company, according to Business Insider.
“Understanding how the brain works is among the great challenges of the 21st century, with results that promise to improve human health and well-being in dramatic ways,” said President Subra Suresh in a press release. “Carnegie Mellon can make a unique and distinctive contribution to this global effort by bringing together our strengths in neurobiology, computation, data sciences, human learning and behavioral science to create urgently needed research frameworks, tools and technologies, and by working in close concert with the network of BrainHub universities around the world.”
Carnegie Mellon launched the BrainHub initiative in late August; the initiative includes plans to expand Carnegie Mellon’s brain research in several different ways.
As part of the initiative, according to the initial press release on the subject, the university plans to hire 10 or more faculty specializing in brain research across various departments and fields. 
BrainHub will focus on developing better tools to measure neuron activity in the brain and computational methods for analyzing brain activity to understand the link between activity in the brain and the body’s behavior. Hillman is one of many sources of funding for BrainHub. According to the press release on BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon has secured $75 million in initial commitments from organizations like the R.K. Mellon Foundation; Dietrich Foundation;  Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of business consulting company Infosys; and others.
“The gift will help support the training of the next generation of brain researchers on a global scale,” the university press release says. “As part of BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon scientists will work with university partners from China, India and the United Kingdom, and the Hillman gift will be matched with other sources of support for BrainHub.”
BrainHub is meant to pave the way for new methods of measuring and analyzing brain activity, as Carnegie Mellon scientists work with other top brain researchers.
Some of BrainHub’s global partners include the University of Warwick, which has expertise in the field of digital health; Sun Yat-sen University, whose medical school is clinically experienced with autism and Alzheimer’s; Oxford University and its International Brain Mechanics and Trauma Lab; and the Indian Institute of Science, which has its own brain research center..

2014-10-06,CMU,China,"For the last few years, Hong Kong has readied itself for the ongoing debate and protests that have raged through the city’s business district of Central.
Occupy Central, a movement dedicated to civil disobedience and organized by professors, lawyers and members of the clergy, was already hyped up last summer. Many writers and witnesses have referenced the Tiananmen Massacre and the tragedy that unfolded during China’s last large civil disobedience occupation. However, it is important to note that while the possibility of a crackdown is not negligible, China faces a unique set of constraints from the international community that limits its hand. Last time, China was in the midst of its “dark ages,” not the economic juggernaut it is today.
A sudden change in tactic on the part of the Hong Kong government reveals the new approach being implemented by Beijing and Hong Kong. A week ago, video footage of crackdowns on violent protesters showed tear gas canisters being hurled into large crowds. As a Hong Kong resident myself, it never would have crossed my mind that extreme political unrest reminiscent of the Arab Spring was occurring in Hong Kong.
It is important for people to know about the events unfolding in Hong Kong, a city that has long served as the bridge from Eastern to Western worlds. While the bulk of China’s population lives below or on the poverty line, Hong Kong’s citizens enjoy a much higher standard of life, equal to that of the United Kingdom or Iceland. 
Additionally, the future of the small territory offers valuable insight into the future of China. The way in which China reacts in the coming weeks, apart from its expected condemnation of the protests, will give hints of China’s long term political future. 
As a student from Hong Kong, I am often asked what Hong Kong actually is. Is it an independent city-state like Singapore? I always reply with “it’s part of China, but Hong Kong keeps a separate government.”
This is officially called the one-country, two-systems government as outlined in the Basic Law, the de facto constitution of Hong Kong. The Basic Law was written when Hong Kong transitioned from British colony to reclaimed special administrative region of China. As a result of this history, Hong Kong was once a prized possession of both Britain and China. It served as the gateway for the Chinese to sell their goods and for the British to gain access to the lucrative, emergent markets in China. However, the rise of Shanghai as China’s own financial hub in the last decade or so has dimmed Hong Kong’s importance. While Hong Kong remains a major city that many corporations focus their operations on, it is not as indispensable as it used to be.
The Basic Law also guaranteed Hong Kong a large amount of autonomy in affairs not concerned with national defense or foreign diplomacy. This autonomy formerly meant that Hong Kong would be able to hold its own elections in 2017. Each citizen would receive one vote, and candidates would be nominated from Hong Kong by the Hong Kong people. This was the vision many Hong Kong citizens had harbored. However, the Chinese government disagrees, and released a statement over the summer saying it would only allow Hong Kong elections under the condition that the candidates be approved by the mainland. Clearly, “universal suffrage” isn’t very universal in the Chinese government’s vision.
Hong Kong has prized itself on being Asia’s “World City.” Although competition may have diminished the city in terms of economic might, it remains a pearl that has been long prized by both Eastern and Western cultures. As a result, it prides itself on being Asia’s best place to live, work, or do business. It has accomplished this all under the one-country, two-systems rule. Many people recognize this and are proud of this fact, and consequently, economic progress for them also means political progress — specifically, democratization.
Many critics in Hong Kong and China point out that Hong Kong already enjoys a high degree of autonomy and should not be complaining. But changes in China’s hierarchy, as well as their plan to “allow” universal suffrage point to the fact that Hong Kong may be going backward in terms of political organization. 
Xi Jinping, China’s new president, has been shown to be a strong, decisive leader and is very much focused on a consolidated, executive office in China. His quick movement to dismantle the corrupted elite offices in China, as demonstrated by the capture of Zhou Yongkang over the summer, paints a picture of a powerful and determined leader. Recognizing this, the people of Hong Kong fear that the elements that made Hong Kong so dynamic may soon disappear, especially as China tightens its grip around the city. 
Going forward may be a tall order, but in the eyes of Hong Kong citizens, the Umbrella Revolution is the only thing stopping them from sliding back down..

2014-10-13,CMU,China,"“We cannot give short shrift to the humanities and social sciences,” retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter told a standing-room only McConomy Auditorium last Friday.
Souter delivered his lecture, “The Heart of the Matter: The Humanities and Social Sciences for a Vibrant, Competitive, and Secure Nation,” as part of the John and Mary Lou Lehoczky Lecture Series in the Humanities and Social Sciences. 
Souter was brought to Carnegie Mellon with the help of the university’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIRP) and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, an organization that supports humanities research and education in the U.S., accoding to its website. 
Souter was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush after a career in the state courts of New Hampshire, and retired from the Supreme Court in 2009.
After University President Subra Suresh introduced him, Souter, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, made a case to listeners that the U.S. should put greater stress on the humanities and social sciences as the foundation of education.
“A lot of this is going to be obvious,” Souter said about the points in his lecture. “But I want the obvious to be on the table.”
Souter opened his lecture with a story about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States. Taft, Souter said, was able to think about problems in different ways — one of the main benefits that Souter said a liberal arts education provides.
Souter used a quote by poet John Donne as the first piece of evidence in his lecture: “No man is an island.”
Souter pointed out how different experts in different fields of the humanities — from psychology to theology — would interpret the quote, saying that “Your perspective is going to affect how much you look at the question, just as much as it affects how much you look at the answer.”
Throughout his lecture, Souter stressed the importance of different perspectives. An education in the humanities, Souter said, gives people the ability to look at a question or problem from different angles, with different perspectives.
Julia Eddy, a junior decision science major, agreed with Souter’s emphasis on the humanities. “I think it was really valuable. I used to not put a lot of value in the humanities,” Eddy, who recently switched her major from electrical and computer engineering to decision science, said. “Since I just switched my major from engineering to the humanities, the lecture really resonated with me.”
Sophomore mathematics major Ryan LaPré had similar thoughts about Souter’s lecture. “In general, I agree with Souter in that a vital part of the future of education should focus on the intersection of a social sciences-based creativity, as well as some application of technology,” LaPré said. “Especially at a school like CMU, where we promote this mindset in our curriculum and programs.”
Souter closed his lecture by comparing the U.S. to China, which recently surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest economy, according to the International Monetary Fund. China, Souter said, is laying a foundation in humanities for a future of smart economic decisions while the U.S. lags behind..

2014-10-13,CMU,China,"This past week, plans were announced to build an oil pipeline of massive scale that would connect Alberta’s energy-rich oil sands to the Canadian Atlantic coast just northeast of Maine. This pipeline is in response to a frustrating lack of a decision from President Obama regarding the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would take the same oil through the United States to Louisiana and Kentucky refineries. The new pipeline, called Energy East, is more than twice as long as Keystone, carries a third more oil, and is a great example of how the desires of the market always come to fruition, regardless of legal impediments.
Obama hasn’t made a decision on Keystone because he’s been battling environmental criticisms from the left, while also facing flak from the right about letting those concerns prevent Keystone’s construction and all the jobs that it would create. Additionally, Keystone supporters tout that having a consistent source of energy from our friendly northern neighbor would reduce America’s energy dependence on the increasingly unstable Middle East. As a result of these competing concerns, Obama has deferred making a decision on Keystone for six years while oil demand, especially from the emerging markets of India and China, continues to skyrocket.
Oil companies aren’t going to forgo a significant market opportunity because of political challenges and, as a result, we now have Energy East, which is worse for the environment and creates a number of Canadian jobs, but no American jobs. In essence, Obama’s indecision has created a situation that is, by all measures, much worse than if Keystone XL was approved.
This type of situation is inevitable if politicians attempt to thwart significant market demand. Another example is the current state of the drug market in the United States. Because drugs are illegal, drug users are pushed into increasingly dangerous situations. Often, they don’t get the drugs they want and experience adverse effects. Cartels in Mexico have created significant challenges for the Mexican government and raised a multitude of humanitarian issues for the United States with the recent immigration crisis. If drugs were legal, these problems would disappear.
Another well-publicized example happened in Ireland, when the Irish government attempted to reduce the amount of trash that Irish citizens generated by making people pay a tax on collection of more than two bags of trash. Instead of curbing their consumption, the Irish simply started burning their trash, which was worse for the environment and led to a lot of fire-related deaths and accidents. The environment was worse off, and Irish hospitals were overwhelmed with burn victims, which increased healthcare costs, and diverted medical resources away from people with other problems.
Instead of trying to alter the most convenient way for market demand to be met, countries looking to generate positive outcomes from this market demand should seek to work within the system, rather than thwart it altogether. If drugs were legal but heavily regulated, not only could drug users get safe drugs, but organizations like Narcotics Anonymous could find a way to reach drug users and guide them out of addiction. Instead of penalizing trash creation, rewarding recycling has been much more fruitful for countries looking to promote sustainability.
With this oil pipeline, a similar tactic should be implemented. Oil is already very heavily regulated and taxed. Maybe Keystone XL should be approved, but an additional tax could be levied on the associated oil refineries and the money could be used to purchase carbon offsets to assuage environmental concerns. That’s just one idea, and it’s definitely not perfect, but that outcome would be far more desirable to all parties than the Energy East solution. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so it’s better to work within the system than against it..

2014-10-27,CMU,China,"“We’re going to play a little game tonight. We’re going to pretend this is Monday night football, and I’m the quarterback,” Jodi Picoult, author of many well-known books including My Sister’s Keeper, said as she took the stage to applause at the Carnegie Music Hall as part of the Literary Evenings’s Monday Night Lecture series.
Picoult, addressing a sold out auditorium on the heels of the release of her new book Leaving Time, spoke to the audience about the research she does for her works of fiction. Doesn’t fiction mean that a story is made up?
While Picoult writes stories that come from the inner machinations of her brain, she often bases them around real-world things that need to be experienced to be properly explained to readers. And boy, were her experiences eye-opening. Although I’ve never read a book by Picoult, she has convinced me to try one out this winter break.
Picoult first related the research she performed for her book Second Glance, published in 2003. In the book, the narrator, Ross Wakeman, comes to Comtosook, Vt. when Abenaki Indian tribe land is being eyed for a shopping mall. If the tribe proves it was a burial ground, the mall cannot be built. Ross, a ghost hunter, comes to the town as its people are being haunted and finds out that the ghost is someone he is falling head over heels for.
To write this book, Picoult not only had to research the Abenaki tribe, but also the Vermont eugenics program, a program in which the Abenaki were forced to disband or go underground as the government sterilized them so that they could not reproduce.
Additionally, Picoult spent some time with real ghost hunters, the Atlantic Paranormal Society in Rhode Island. “If some of you have seen the TV show on the Syfy channel, Ghost Hunters, it was those guys. I knew them before they were famous. They were just ... plumbers doing this on the side,” Picoult said.
“So at the time I was going ghost hunting, my oldest son was about eight/nine years old, and he was terrified of ghosts,” Picoult continued. “So here I am going, ‘Honey, there’s no such thing as a ghost,’ and then packing my bag to go ghost hunting.”
Picoult next related the research she performed for The Storyteller, a book about a woman who is confided in by a former Nazi commander living in America who wants her to help him die.
To understand what she was writing about, Picoult talked to numerous Holocaust survivors, including survivors of concentration camps, death marches, and the ghettos. In one story Picoult told, a boy named Bernie pried a mezuzah from his doorway as he was taken from his home.
Last but not least, Picoult explained the research that went into her latest book, Leaving Time.
The book touches upon elephants’ expression of grief, which the protagonist’s mother studied before she disappeared. “Ultimately, this is a book about how the people who leave us never really do,” Picoult said. “And I began to dive into the world of elephants, knowing I was going to use it as a metaphor, so tonight what I’m going to be telling you about is everything you wanted to know about elephants and more.”
Picoult explained that she worked with a neurobiologist to understand the human brain and then learned how it was similar to and different from elephant brains. She then went to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, as well as Botswana, to work with researchers who track elephant migration patterns. Picoult said that elephants are recognizable by voice, tusks, hair, and ears. No two elephants have the same ears. She also explained that elephants have complex brains capable of remembering, feeling pain and loss, and learning. Elephants also won’t leave each other behind, according to Picoult. Picoult culminated her talk about elephants by relating the importance of ending poaching.
Picoult doesn’t just live in the world; she experiences it. From her talk, it is apparent that she’s not afraid to ask someone for help in order to understand what they are an expert on. What better way is there to learn than to ask someone who is itching to share what they know? Picoult seems to have mastered the art of delving wholeheartedly into another person’s story to understand where they come from or why what they do is so important to them. And what better outlet to relate what she learns from her ability to immerse herself than in a book?
But why does Picoult write fiction about such controversial issues when she could write nonfiction to give her readers the cold, hard facts about a topic she has researched? Certainly, nonfiction wouldn’t mesh the facts with fiction by its very nature. Picoult explained as she finished her lecture:
“There’s something that fiction can do that nonfiction cannot,” Picoult said. “A lot people will not address a controversial subject in nonfiction, but they pick up a novel, and they think they’re being entertained, and almost by accident, by the time they close that last page, they realize they are being forced to re-evaluate whatever opinions they have when they started the book.... Where I believe that nonfiction has the obligation to chronicle the past and what has happened, fiction has the opportunity to change minds, change the future, and change the course of what will happen.”

2014-11-17,CMU,China,"Whooping cough booster shot safe for pregnant women
Researchers from the Health Partners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis, Minn. have determined that pregnant women can safely get a Tdap booster shot during pregnancy without increasing the risk of their having problems during birth. The Tdap booster shot protects against tetanus, diptheria, and pertussis, also known as whooping cough.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women receive the Tdap booster during the last few months of pregnancy in order to protect themselves against pertussis, and also provide protection for the newborn, which is otherwise unprotected until eligible for the shot at two months old.
The results of this study have been published in the Nov. 12 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.

New technology improves lung cancer detection
John Roeske, a professor of radiation oncology at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, along with a team of researchers, has developed new technology that allows for improved detection of early-stage lung cancer during radiation therapy.
The technology combines the current method of dual-energy imaging with fluoroscopy, which allows for enhanced visibility of tumors. The researchers believe this new technology could be cost-effective for hospitals because the combined approach would require new software and, therefore, would not require the hospital to replace their current X-ray machines.
Roeske and his colleagues have patented this technology and recently presented this research at the annual meeting of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology.

Jupiter’s Great Red Spot caused by ultraviolet light
Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. have discovered that Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is caused by chemical decomposition due to sunlight. Using ultraviolet light to simulate the sun, they discovered that breaking down ammonia and acetylene, two chemicals known to be found on Jupiter, produced a color similar to that of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. 
The researchers also determined that this color is greatly dependent on altitude. The Great Red Spot’s extremely high altitude allows for ammonia particles to be higher in the atmosphere and, therefore, closer to the sun, which facilitates the break down of ammonia and acetylene. This decomposition is also promoted due to the vortex shape of the Great Red Spot, which traps ammonia particles in a single location.

Serotonin shown to mediate pain and itch in mice
Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have determined that serotonin, a chemical messenger produced in response to pain, is also involved in the regulation of itch.
The researchers found that mice with decreased serotonin levels didn’t respond as much to itch-causing irritants as mice with normal serotonin levels. They discovered that mice’s response to itch is regulated by A1 and gastrin-dependent peptide receptors activated by serotonin. When a mouse scratches an itch, pain causes the release of serotonin. This release activates the two regulatory receptors, which cause the mouse to again experience an itch. Researchers believe this mechanism explains why, excluding immediate relief, scratching increases itchiness instead of reducing it.

U.S. and China commit to carbon emission cuts
On Wednesday, Nov. 14, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China announced their commitment to achieve specific cuts in carbon emissions. 
President Xi Jinping declared that China’s carbon emissions would peak around 2030. President Obama announced that, by 2025, the United States would cut emissions by at least 26 percent from 2005 levels.
Despite these concrete goals, experts still say these cuts are not enough to prevent an increase in global temperature of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is thought to be the point at which global warming will become irreversible. These targets are precedents to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference set to begin Nov. 30. 
So far, no other countries have announced specific plans to reduce emissions.

Link between depression and infectious disease
In a recent paper, Turhan Canli, associate professor of psychology and radiology at Stony Brook University and the director of Stony Brook’s Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Center, has suggested that major depressive disorder (MDD) be considered an infectious disease.
He supports this suggestion by noting that patients with MDD exhibit behavior that suggests an illness-related cause, that parasites, bacteria, and viruses can alter emotional behavior, and that microorganisms greatly affect physiology and genetics. Canli proposes that research on depression should be shifted toward explicitly defining the link between MDD and infectious disease.

2014-11-17,CMU,China,"Net neutrality debate continues
This week, the long-standing conflict between media conglomerates and the Federal Communications Committee (FCC) was reignited in public forums when President Barack Obama formally vocalized his support for net neutrality. Net neutrality essentially treats the Internet as a public utility and protects it from regulation by media corporations such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast. Companies such as these, with a large interest in competitive pricing and consumer rates, are attempting to gain an advantage over the market by significantly slowing or even completely cutting off Internet services to consumers who are not subscribed to their service or offering deals to content providers (such as Netflix) to expedite content to consumers. Obama’s support puts pressure on the FCC to create regulations for what he has called “an open Internet” and has prompted national debate over government regulation of a public market and whether or not the Internet should qualify as a utility.

Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama traveled to China to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding climate change and what the two countries could do about it. After long talks, they eventually agreed to target problematic greenhouse gas producers and cut emissions by 2030, the first significant move from China to decrease national emissions. A few days later, the U.S. Postal Service announced that its database had been hacked by Chinese hackers, who stole the information from hundreds of thousands of postal workers. The information included names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and work dates. No consumer data was leaked.

2015-02-02,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon’s a campus known for embracing quirkiness, but some of us still have appearances to maintain — not all of us want to be upfront about our appreciation of anime, and in my case it’s usually pretty easy. Generally, I’m not impressed by the bulk of Japanese broadcast animation; they tend to strike me as kind of trope-y and formulaic. Even if there are interesting designs or story flourishes, another show about the machinations of a student council or the passion-based fighting style of a cyborg is something I can’t put up with for too long.
So that’s why I’m so glad that something like Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure exists.
While there are older animated adaptations of the acclaimed manga by Hirohiko Araki, the latest run is jam-packed with visual charm and a great sense of style. Heavily stylized openings accompanied by delightfully hokey original compositions embrace the over-the-top attitude of the series show with arresting color palettes and some impressively detailed character animation that might just be CGI, but looks like nothing else.
It’s an indicator of what happens visually during the show as well. Every character in this show is built like a Greek statue, and there’s a goofy tendency for them to strike body-building poses when they deliver important lines. In scenes of heightened peril or emotion it’s not uncommon for the colors to shift shades enough that everything gets purple overtones or, in the case of the most recent episode, a villain is shown in shades of green as he stalks one of the heroes.
The series tells the story of a multi-generational struggle between the Joestar family and the immortal Dio. A deliciously evil and eminently quotable villain, Dio is transformed by an ancient stone mask from a malicious London street urchin out of an Austen novel into a bloodthirsty vampire. He partners up with the likes of Jack the Ripper and builds an army of the undead in a small British village.
The only one who can stop him is perfect gentleman Jonathan Joestar (called Jojo, as is the protagonist of every subsequent season). He’s taught an ancient martial art by an Italian baron named Zeppeli that allows him to “imbue his punches with sunlight.” Joined by Robert E. O. Speedwagon, he confronts the vampire and manages to seal him away.
Oh, did I mention that most every character in the show is named after an American musician or song from the ‘80s or ‘90s? Because there is literally a character named ACDC. He’s a bad guy from the second story arc. In this arc, Jonathan’s grandson, Joseph, is traveling the world to fight the ancient civilization of incredibly buff men who created the mask that transformed Dio. He teams up with a Nazi cyborg and a few other outrageous fighters to defeat this new threat, culminating in a fight inside an active volcano off the coast of Italy.
The current season is about Joseph and his stoic, tough-guy, half-Japanese grandson fighting their way across southern Asia alongside a serious Egyptian fortune teller, a manic French duelist, and another Japanese high schooler who likes to hang out poolside... in his school uniform. They’re trying to reach Cairo after Dio re-emerges, but this time, instead of using ancient martial arts, everybody gets a physical manifestation of their force of will called a “stand.”
The fighting in the later seasons becomes a little faster paced, and while there’s still has a lot of exposition about attacks and powers, things are kept fresh and visually interesting, and fights don’t usually last longer than an episode. It’s somewhat offset by a number of long narrations about some of the exotic locales visited by the group, explaining local customs or tourist attractions.
Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is a completely ridiculous and utterly fun watch that either bucks the trends of a lot of anime or embraces them so wholeheartedly that they seem interesting again. If you’re looking for 75+ episodes of something to watch that looks good and is unabashedly silly in a way that’ll recapture some of the joy of your first exposure to “Japanimation,” look no further..

2015-02-02,CMU,China,"See CON side of this debate here.
President Obama made history in India last week by becoming the first United States president to attend India’s Republic Day Parade as its chief guest. Held every year on the 26th of January since 1950, Republic Day commemorates India adopting its constitution to become a democratic republic.
Traditionally, the chief guests at these parades have been the heads of India’s old allies. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took on the role in 2014, French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007. As such, President Obama’s attendance signals a new era of strong alliance between India and the United States that will be highly beneficial to both countries.
Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed to enjoy each other’s company. From joking about how little sleep they get as heads of state to hosting a joint radio broadcast, they reveled in the attention of the Indian media circus, providing sound bite after sound bite. Modi referred to Obama as “Barack,” and spoke expressively about how he and Obama shared a personal chemistry. Obama, not to be outdone, greeted his audiences with a “Namaskaar” and found the time to try his hand at a famous Bollywood movie dialogue. As such, both Obama and Modi pulled out all the stops to create an image of intense personal camaraderie.
Grand gestures aside, the visit also included measurable progress. Both nations have similar concerns — from China’s assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region to terrorism in the Middle East and the threat of Climate Change — that were finally addressed as a team.
Several of these issues were addressed through a Joint Statement. In an oblique reference to China, the statement “affirmed the importance of safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over flight throughout the region, especially in the South China Sea.” The United States needs a strong regional partner to contain China to effect its  ""rebalance to Asia"" policy. For India to stake a credible regional claim of its own, it needs an ally as powerful as the United States.
On the topic of terrorism, Obama and Modi “stressed the need for joint and concerted efforts, including the dismantling of safe havens for terrorist and criminal networks, to disrupt all financial and tactical support for networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis.” India and the United States have both been victims of horrendous attacks from these organizations. Any kind of cooperation — from the sharing of intelligence to co-ordination of troops and equipment — is mutually beneficial.
The most substantial progress, however, was in clean energy. Massive hurdles in a dormant Indo-U.S. civil nuclear deal, signed in 2008, were cleared. An overreaching nuclear accident liability law in India was worked around through the establishment of a multimillion-dollar insurance pool.
A United States requirement that all nuclear exports to India be tracked in real time was waived since it was considered intrusive. This clears the way for Indian and United States companies to work together to set up nuclear power plants throughout India. This is very good news for energy-starved India, large parts of which receive electricity for less than the whole day, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is also very good news for the United States, now well positioned to become the primary supplier of India’s massive energy modernization drive. Finally, reducing India’s dependence on coal-fired plants is great for the environment and thereby beneficial to both countries.
Significant progress was also made in the field of defense exports and imports. The US is the world’s largest exporter of defense equipment, and India is the world’s largest importer of defense equipment, according to the International Business Times. Even so, historically, defense trade between the two countries has been depressingly anemic.
However, this past week agreements have been signed between the United States and India that allow for the coproduction of weapons, as well as the transfer of technology to India that allow weapons designed in the US to be manufactured in India. Besides being another massive boost to trade, the export of manufacturing capability of defense equipment to India is particularly significant as it implies a trust that extends beyond the civilian realm and into the highly sensitive realm of defense.
Obama’s visit to India represents the final realization of a relationship that seems only natural. Both countries have been stable democracies since their inception. Both countries are home to people from a multitude of ethnicities and religions. As such, both countries have a deep respect for secular thought and are home to a wide swathe of often oppositional views. Finally, people in both countries enjoy freedom of speech, and can openly and publicly speak out for or against those in power without fear of retribution. Culturally and ideologically, there could hardly be two closer large countries than India and the United States, and these new, stronger Indo-U.S. ties will prove highly beneficial to both nations..

I’ve been wary of Narendera Modi ever since he came into office as the prime minister of India, and Obama’s recent visit to India and the blossoming relationship between the two countries just confirmed my uneasiness.
Modi is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party in India. Before running for prime minister, he was the chief minister of a state called Gujarat, which is equivalent to a governor of a state here. While in charge of Gujarat, he made great progress with infrastructure within the state, getting electricity and water to more people than ever before. But when riots broke out between religious Hindu nationalists and Muslims following the destruction of a Muslim tinderbox, Gujarat soon gained international recognition for another reason. After the burning of a train that was filled with Hindu pilgrims, the riots soon turned into an almost all-out massacre of thousands of Muslims.
Modi did not do anything to stop the violence while in power. He ordered officials to take no action against rioters, and was complicit in the dismissal of many police and court cases against Hindu rioters, according to The New York Times. On top of all of this, there are also allegations that Modi was actually actively perpetuating the violence against Muslims. The United States actually imposed travel restrictions on Modi during this time for his role in the riots. Even so, he was eventually re-elected as chief minister on a platform of uniting Hindus, largely around a fear of Muslims.
With the United States’ own shaky history with Islam and the Middle East, this closer relationship between the United States and India is incredibly worrisome. It might be great for both countries individually, but not for the international Muslim community as a whole or other countries, especially Pakistan and China.
India and Pakistan have had a long and violent history, starting and ending with the conflict over the border in the Kashmir region. U.S.–Pakistan relations have been shaky ever since 9/11, and have increasingly worsened after the death of Osama Bin Laden. On one hand, we found him in their country, which brings into question their commitment to eradicating terrorism in the region, but on the other hand we stepped all over Pakistan’s sovereignty as a nation by sending in a SEAL team and killing someone on their soil without even consulting them.
Pakistan’s foreign policy chief Sartaj Aziz warned of “India’s dangerous desire to create a space for war,” while Sherry Rahman, a former Pakistani information minister added, “Relations between India and Pakistan are in tatters,” according to The Wall Street Journal. Ever since Modi came to power, this has definitely been the norm. Peace talks have been called off and Pakistan’s attempts to revive dialogue have been rebuffed, all while Modi continues to accuse Islamabad of not taking enough action against terrorists. Meanwhile, there is growing aggravation that Obama has now visited India twice during his presidency but has not visited Pakistan even once. China, however, has been reaching out to Pakistan more and more.
While Modi and Obama were hugging in New Delhi, Pakistan’s army chief was on an official visit to Beijing. China is also regarding the U.S.–India relationship with vague suspicion, according to The New York Times. During Modi’s talks with Obama, the security quadrilateral he proposed included the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, which was worrying to China.
The South China Sea conflict, and China’s recent inflammatory moves in the region, were other topics of the talks. At Obama’s urging, Modi signed a statement criticizing China for how it handled the situation. There is also the threat that will result from the United States increasing sales of military technology to India. This development comes right after China lost its hold as India’s number one trade partner, a huge blow to China and worrisome for the nation on the security front.
Improving Indo–U.S. relations are great for both nations, and as an Indian-American, I’m happy to see the countries’ relations growing and forming in a new direction, but I’m still very wary of the public and overt way that this is happening, especially because both countries have had many issues regarding Islamaphobia in the very recent past, and both countries are now in the position to be extremely influential on the international stage. I just hope their influence is a good one..

2015-02-09,CMU,China,"ABC’s new comedy series Fresh Off the Boat, an adaptation of the book that chef Eddie Huang wrote about his own experiences, premiered last Thursday. The star of the show is 11-year-old, rap-obsessed Eddie who faces difficulties assimilating into a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood after his family moves from Washington, D.C.’s Chinatown to Orlando, Florida. The show allows viewers to reminisce on their younger days (the show takes place in 1995 — that’s 20 years ago!) and highlights the struggles that many immigrants face when coming into American society. Every immigrant faces the dilemma of retaining one’s culture, yet assimilating with the people around them, and this show really accents that dilemma through the tween experiences of the main character, Eddie. 
The parents in the show provide much of the comic relief, with the father portraying an extreme optimist in pursuit of the American dream and the mom’s caring yet assertive attitude that emulates the average overbearing Asian mother.
The show addresses Asian-American struggles in a lighthearted manner, to raise the awareness of the difficulties and perseverance with no intention to offend viewers. What impresses me the most is that this show manages to share these experiences with the general public and add some racial humor into the mix. One of the highlights of the pilot episode was when Eddie gets into a fight with an African-American boy who has a 40-year-old best friend. The boy calls Eddie a racial slur in the middle of the cafeteria and Eddie decides to start a fight. The next scene shows Eddie sitting outside of the principal’s office with both of his parents discussing the situation with his principal. Eddie braces himself to hear his parents agree with the administration’s decision on his behavior, but they surprise him by standing up for their son. Yes, Eddie started the fight but didn’t the African-American boy first call him a slur? Why was Eddie the only kid sitting outside the principal’s office and not the both of them? In this episode, we learned that family always has your back and that you should always stand up for yourself. Fresh Off the Boat will be on ABC every Tuesday night at 8 p.m.; tune in to witness the fun!.

2015-02-09,CMU,China,"What will Carnegie Mellon be like 20 or 30 years from now? A matter of increasing interest and significance in light of today’s rapidly evolving world, this question was raised by one of the university community’s newest members as food for thought during a recent strategic planning town hall meeting.
Dr. K. Jimmy Hsia, the new vice provost for international programs and strategy as of Jan. 1, is a man with a vision to increase the university’s global footprint. Though he’s only been on campus for a short period of time, Dr. Hsia, who is also a professor of biomedical and mechanical engineering in the College of Engineering, seems to be having no trouble integrating himself into the Carnegie Mellon community.
Hsia received his Bachelor of Science from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China and his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He is a fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and was the W. Grafton and Lillian B. Wilkins Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
During his time at UIUC, Dr. Hsia worked to develop worldwide opportunities in research and education for faculty and students in a number of countries in the Asian continent. He has served as chair of the UIUC-Zhejiang University Joint Institute Working Group. In addition to playing a role in nurturing global partnerships, he also aided students and faculty members in establishing dynamic relationships with other educational institutions and corporations across China.
Additionally, Dr. Hsia served as founding director of the Nano and Bio Mechanics Program at the National Science Foundation from 2005–07, associate dean of the Graduate College at UIUC from 2009–10, and associate vice chancellor for research for new initiatives at UIUC from 2011–13.
To Dr. Hsia, “having an international strategy is not a luxury, it is survival,” as he said at the recent town hall, adding that, in recent years, the university has done well in establishing its footprints internationally.
Dr. Hsia believes that the core of international strategy lies with the students, faculty and staff. In his words, “These are the people doing international things — faculty students and staff. Without them, there is no international strategy.”
Moving forward, Dr. Hsia intends to work toward maintaining the university’s high quality of education while simultaneously preparing students for future worldwide challenges. He ultimately aims for the university to become a global hub of knowledge, culture, and technology, all the while upholding a position amongst the world’s top educational institutions. Moreover, he aims to achieve results through a collective effort, with individuals across the Carnegie Mellon community coming together and working as one.
So, what will Carnegie Mellon be like 20 or 30 years from now? 
For Dr. Jimmy Hsia, a school with an even larger international footprint is in reach..

2015-02-16,CMU,China,"Earliest fossils of ancestral mammals discovered
Two newly discovered fossils of ancestral mammals help demonstrate the possibility of a wide range of ecological diversity in early mammals. The two fossils, Agilodocodon scansorius and Docofossor brachydactylus, were discovered in northeastern China and belong to creatures called docodonts, an evolutionary group that diverged from the mammalian branch and became extinct. 
Agilodocodon, which lived around 165 million years ago, had curved claws on its hands and feet to climb trees, and its limb proportions are similar to those of modern-day animals that live in trees. Paleontologists have found that its teeth are most suited for a diet of tree gum and sap. 
Docofossor, which lived around 160 million years ago, had shovel-like fingers for digging and teeth that suggested it foraged underground. Its proportions are strikingly similar to the modern African golden mole. 
The dating on the fossils suggests they coexisted with the dinosaurs.
Papers regarding the fossils were published independently in Science on Feb. 13 by international teams of scientists from the University of Chicago and Beijing Museum of Natural History.

Alan Turing’s code-breaking papers released
The notes of Alan Turing, a mathematician who played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II, were found in Bletchley Park, Britain’s code-breaking center. The papers were found stuffed inside holes in the ceiling of Hut 6, Turing’s workplace; Turing and his team appeared to be using them as draught excluders.
The notes were discovered in 2013 during a multimillion-dollar restoration project of Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and they were recently released to the public. 
Amongst the notes were “Banbury sheets,” long sheets of paper with holes punched in them to compare different ciphers. Turing used these Banbury sheets to speed up the decryption of Nazi messages.
“Discovering these pieces of code-breaking ephemera is incredibly exciting and provides yet more insight into how codebreakers worked,” Bletchley Park Trust chief executive, Iain Stander, said in a statement. 
The notes, along with other artifacts found at Bletchley Park, will be displayed in a new exhibition called “The Restoration of Historic Bletchley Park” in Hut 12.

Late-night screen time alters body’s natural clock
A new study from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts shows that individuals who read off of a screen such as an iPad before sleeping have a more difficult time going to sleep and wake up feeling groggier than individuals who don’t.
The study consisted of six male and six female volunteers in their mid 20s who, for a two-week period, alternated between reading off of iPads and printed books four hours before a bedtime of 10 p.m. each night. The researchers found that subjects took nearly ten minutes more to fall asleep, and spent less time in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, after reading on iPads than they did when they were reading printed books. They also took longer to become alert in the morning, which could result in negative effects in the real world.
Exposure to light at night disrupts the body’s internal clock by suppressing melatonin, a hormone used as a sleep aid, so the study’s results are consistent with what experts would expect. Some experts did note that using a bright light while reading a paper book could have the same effect.  The researchers reported their findings January 27th in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Eight million tons of plastic dumped in ocean yearly
A groundbreaking study published in Science this week quantifies how much garbage flows into the world’s oceans every year. Previously, scientists estimated how much garbage was in the ocean by taking sample counts of plastic on the surfaces of large garbage patches in each of the world’s oceans. A study last year estimated the amount of floating trash to be 245,000 tons at most.
This study, lead by Jenna Jambeck, an Environmental Engineer from the University of Georgia, combines population and economic data from 192 coastal countries bordering the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans in addition to the Black and Mediterranean Seas to show that, of the 245 million tons of garbage accumulated by these countries annually, 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastic flows into the oceans. 
The study also names the top twenty countries generating the most ocean-bound trash; China is first, and the United States is twentieth.
Since the gap between plastic floating on the ocean’s surface and plastic flowing into the ocean is so wide, scientists now have to figure out where else it is collecting and in what amounts in order to close the gap.

First stars in the universe born later than thought
New maps from the European Space Agency’s satellite, Planck, revealed “polarized” light from the early Universe.
Previously, scientists determined how old the Universe was by examining the Cosmic Microwave Backgroud (CMB) fossil light remaining from a time when the Universe was hot and dense after the Big Bang. Planck studied this light in great detail between the years 2009 and 2013.
“After the CMB was released, the Universe was still very different from the one we live in today, and it took a long time until the first stars were able to form,” explains Marco Bersanelli of Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy. “Planck’s observations of the CMB polarisation now tell us that these ‘Dark Ages’ ended some 550 million years after the Big Bang – more than 100 million years later than previously thought.” While 100 million years seems negligible compared to the Universe’s age of almost 14 billion years, it makes a significant difference when it comes to the formation of the first stars.
This new data has many effects besides an understanding of when the first stars were formed. It could lead to discoveries regarding dark matter, neutrinos and the stucture of the Galactic magnetic field.

A recent paper published in the Journal of Neuroscienceby lead author Dena Dubal discusses how manipulating the protein levels associated with memory can delay Alzheimer’s symptoms. Dubal, Assistant Professor of Neurology from the University of California, San Fransisco, and her team work with klotho, a transmembrane protein associated with longevity.
Previous research indicated that increasing klotho levels in the brains of healthy mice also increased cognitive function. Dubal’s team then increased klotho levels in the brains of mice who also expressed large amounts of amyloid-beta and tau, proteins associated with the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Her team found that, even with these toxic proteins, the mice with elevated klotho levels were able to retain cognitive function.
The team says that they would need to further investigate the mechanism behind this cognitive preservation before it is possible to treat humans in the future.
The next stages of this research involves identifying and testing drugs that affect klotho levels or are able to simulate klothos effects.

2015-02-16,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch’n’Soda recently put up their take on Stephen Adly Guirgis’s production The Motherfucker With The Hat. Loud and brash in parts, extraordinarily subtle in others, and chock full of gratuitous swearing throughout, the play works as a heady cocktail of guffaw-inducing one liners on one side and gut-wrenchingly painful moments on the other. As such, Motherfucker’s greatest strength lay in its ability to walk the fine line between hysterical humor and soul-scorching reflection.
Jackie, played by senior communication design major Sam Ahmed, is fresh out of jail and trying to stay clean. Having finally gotten a job, he wants to stay away from drugs and booze and do his part as a well-adjusted member of society. His girlfriend Veronica, on the other hand, played by junior civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy double major Erin Persson, loves her booze, cigarettes, and cocaine. In the hilarious opening scene, Veronica smokes a cigarette and snorts a line while telling her mother to look after herself and dump her current boyfriend. Jackie, ever the doting boyfriend, walks in, full of excitement because he found a job. The premise of the play is set when Jackie discovers a man’s hat in the living room that doesn’t belong to him. From that point on, everything goes south for him and Veronica.
Looking for advice, Jackie turns to his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor Ralph, played by senior professional writing and global studies double major Razghiem Golden. Ralph, himself an ex-addict, now a health beverage obsessive, tells Jackie to dump Veronica because of her philandering and constant drug habits. In the meantime, Ralph isn’t doing too well with his own wife Victoria either, played by senior psychology major Nkem Chikwendu. From this point on, Motherfucker follows the explosions and repercussions that spill over from this simmering brew of raging emotions.
The casting is spot on. Sam Ahmed, as Jackie, is innocently oblivious to the machinations of those around him. He wears Jackie’s struggles on his sleeve, from his problems with Veronica to his problems with substances. Easy to manipulate and constantly at war with himself, he elicits sympathy from the audience in spite of his questionable judgement.
Erin Persson as Veronica is equally likable. Effectively playing the part of a woman dealing with the consequences of mistakes she made when her boyfriend was away in prison for two years, she lurches from crisis to crisis. Constantly tortured, she lashes out at everyone who stands in her way. At the end of the day, one feels bad for her being trapped in a horrible situation she clearly can’t escape.
Razghiem Golden as Ralph is a smooth talker that seems to be a model of comically good behavior. It takes a while for one to realize that there is more to him than meets the eye. In a hilariously horrifying scene, Jackie confronts Ralph after a betrayal, only to have Ralph turn the tables on him for not having gotten his life together.
We also have Jackie’s cousin Julio, played by senior vocal performance major Taylor Rawley. Julio is played as a sensitive, effeminate individual who repeatedly helps Jackie even though he overtly despises him. Whether he is discussing hair care and waxing or emulating Jean Claude Van Damme, Julio makes for a good comic foil to the comparatively somber Ralph.
The standout character, however, is Chikwendu as Ralph’s wife Victoria. Subtle and understated, she slowly evolves from the stereotypical disgruntled wife into the most layered character of the lot. In what is arguably the best scene in Motherfucker, after smoking some weed with Jackie, Victoria tries to convince him to sleep with her out of pity. When he refuses, she tells him information that goes on to dominate the proceedings from that point onwards.
In spite of the depressing subject matter, watching Motherfucker was a riot. The actors all have impeccable comic timing. Brutal scenes are made all the more horrifying by how funny they are. The play deals with several themes, including unrequited lust and its consequences. Several characters have very different motivations for coupling with several others; this sets an interesting canvas for the confrontations that inevitably occur.
More than anything else though, Motherfucker shines for being stuffed with irrational, overwrought and pulpy emotion. Characters act on impulse. They rarely, if ever, make rationally sound decisions. But whether lust or love or addiction or pain or betrayal, the characters feel so strongly as to captivate the audience into empathetic submission..

2015-03-01,CMU,China,"According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News polls, President Obama currently has an approval rating of around 50 percent. This is extremely close to the 49.4 percent approval rating of George W. Bush, following a consistent pattern with the approval rating of previous leaders. In comparison, CNN reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has a high approval rating of 86 percent. This wide gap raises many questions, particularly: How is the approval rating of a country's leaders determined by its nation?
Media networks paint a melancholy image of a low approval rating, but when examined closely, it may not be all that bad. In addition to Putin’s high rating, Political Research Quarterly reported that the average person in Beijing supported the government at around eight points on a 10-point scale. Are the governments of these nations that much better than the American government? By many measurements, the answer is completely opposite.  
It would be a lie to state that our government lacks problems. However, it can be safely stated that Americans have more freedom of speech and expression than citizens from nearly any other nation in the world. This freedom has given Americans the ability to speak their mind when they approve or disapprove of those running the nation. In countries like Russia and China, many citizens are afraid to speak their minds. Instead of true satisfaction, fear may steer their vote of approval.
However, an even more likely conclusion to the differing approval rating between America, Russia and China is the deep integration of debate and political opposition in American society. America’s private news networks often criticize those currently in power, whereas the ones in Russia and China have more centralized media on which insulting the leader would be unheard of.
In all honestly, a lower approval rating for Obama would not be a bad thing. No matter who is in power, the approval of American leadership most often lingers around 50 percent. This is because the nation has become divided by partisan lines and many people have quit thinking for themselves, instead allowing powerful liberal and conservative television networks to think for them. Other political thoughts have been thrown to the sidelines, so people often feel no other choice but to join one side or the other.
An approval rating tells as much about a nation as its leader. If a country has too low of an approval rating, such as Greece’s 14 percent approval rating, it becomes instantly clear that the nation has fallen to economic turmoil or some other disasters. In contrast, too high an approval rating signals obstructions in the way citizens think. It is impossible for a government to truly please everyone in the nation, and the only way to get a nearly perfect approval rating is through force or suppressing free speech.  
The approval rating of the United States or any other nation is not an accurate picture of how a leader is doing. More accurately, it is a measurement of how a nation is doing. An approval rating cannot simply be “good” or “bad.” A truly free nation must aim for itself to fall within a realistic range at which people are still free to think for themselves..

2015-03-23,CMU,China,"Last week Pam, a category five cyclone, hit the Pacific islands of Vanuatu. The devastating storm has been reported to have killed at least 24 people and has left over 70 percent of the population homeless. The Vanuatu president and Australia’s Climate Council are convinced this was not simply a freak storm. Due to climate change, the sea levels around Vanuatu have increased by 20 centimeters and the temperatures have risen slightly. Warmer temperatures cause bigger cyclones, and higher sea levels mean more water can be tossed around by the storm. Many attribute this storm to the increased carbon emissions that caused global climate change.
Vanuatu is a tiny, undeveloped country. They contribute little to carbon emissions and other pollution, especially compared to countries like the United States and China. Despite this, the islands of Vanuatu and countries like them suffer more from climate change than large, first world power houses do. Should more developed countries, who contribute the most to environmental changes, take responsibility for the damage they cause to our planet?
The first step is to decide who exactly should be held responsible for climate change. The immediate reaction is to charge entire countries, yet this might not be totally fair. There are many groups and companies within these large countries that make an effort to reduce their detrimental effects on the environment. On the other hand, certain industrial and government projects produce a lot of pollution. Toyota, for example, admits that its hybrid cars require a lot of energy and produce a lot of carbon emissions during production and that the lithium ion batteries produce an excessive amount of sulfur dioxide emissions. Individuals can also be responsible for carbon emissions. For example, air travel uses hundreds of gallons of fossil fuel per person per flight. Individuals can certainly be penalized for excess pollution or else be required to cut back on their carbon footprint. This suggests that blaming an entire country might not be the most effective way to distribute the blame.
Even if we can restrict the blame to a specific group of people today, should they be held responsible for the past? Two years ago China surpassed the United States for the first time in the amount of carbon emissions they produce. However, the United States has produced more total carbon emissions in the long run. It is easy to say that the United States contributed more to climate change, but it is difficult to make the people today pay for what has been done in the past.
Some Pugwash members stated that the U.S. does hold responsibility for its actions in the past. The U.S., for example, paid reparations to Native Americans, a group of people severely persecuted in the past. Others believed that placing the responsibility of the past on those today would be counterproductive to solving the problem. Just because other countries haven’t had as much time to develop as the U.S. does not mean that they should be excused.
One Pugwash member proposed the creation of an international committee of governments and companies to regulate the effect humans have on the environment. Regulation could include taxation on any production or shipments that have harmful effects to the environment, regulating the amount of carbon emissions companies can produce and restricting the thermostat use of households and buildings on a global scale. The problem with this solution is deciding who will be part of this community and how they can enforce the legislation. It is extremely difficult to create an effective international society that includes members representative of the world population, and ensure that all people participate and abide by the rules it sets.
Finally, Pugwash discussed whether every individual felt a moral obligation to aid in climate change. It is difficult for an individual to hold responsibility for climate change, because any positive or negative action they make will not create a tangible impact on the environment. However, if hundreds or thousands of people make the same decision, the effects will begin to become noticeable. Pugwash believes that individuals could choose to help the environment if they are educated and feel a moral obligation. Unfortunately, only one or neither of these conditions is met for most people. It appears the only solution is to find a way to incentivize people to cut back on their pollution.
If we continue behaving as we do now, life on Earth will rapidly become unsustainable. Even if we feel no moral obligation to it, changing how humans live is necessary for our own survival. Regardless of whether or not we are able to decide who is responsible, everyone should be aware of how their actions affect the world..

2015-04-06,CMU,China,"After a seemingly interminable period of last-minute negotiating, the five permanent members of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council with Germany (P5+1) and Iran finally came to an agreement early on Thursday, April 2. 
After months of baseless speculation that Obama was giving the Iranians a blank check to do as they please with the deal, the public details of the framework make it clear that Iran and the P5+1 have achieved a very fair compromise. Iran will roll back significant portions of its nuclear program in exchange for lifting of crippling sanctions that have crushed its economy for nearly 50 years. 
Members of the P5+1 are touting this as a diplomatic solution to Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iranian leadership feels the combination of lifted sanctions and the survival of all of their nuclear facilities was sufficient, and the framework for a deal was created.
The hits to Iran’s nuclear program are massive. The deal includes the uninstallation of nearly 13 thousand of Iran’s 19 thousand centrifuges; only 5 thousand of the remaining centrifuges would be permitted to enrich uranium. The enriched uranium will be limited to 3.67 percent, which is enough for nuclear power but not nearly enough for nuclear bombs. Iran may not build any new enrichment facilities. Iran’s current stockpile of 10 thousand kilograms of enriched uranium will be reduced to 3 hundred kilograms. 
Iran’s “breakout time” to build nuclear weapons will be extended from two to three months to one year. Iran’s research and development will make it at least 10 years before they can begin building a weapon, and the breakout time of one year will remain the upper limit of their nuclear research for the duration of the deal. Fordow, Iran’s underground nuclear facility, will be prevented from enriching uranium for at least 15 years. 
The U.N. will have the ability to intrusively and aggressively inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities via the International Atomic Energy Agency. This will almost certainly prevent Iran from actually creating a nuclear weapon anytime over the course of the deal. The mere existence of the deal mitigates Iran’s possibly legitimate claim to need nuclear weapons, even if Israel has threatened nuclear action against Iran in the past. 
While Israel is openly skeptical of the deal and says it wants to inspect the nuclear facilities themselves, after this accord it seems silly for them to go through on their threats, considering that the international community’s response would now be even more devastating.
The return Iran gets, however, is significantly more impactful. Since 1979, Iranians have suffered from terrible economic conditions, wreaking havoc on everything from food security to health care access to air travel. Iranians have been denied admission into foreign universities both by force (i.e. the University of Massachusetts’ ban on Iranian students in its nuclear engineering program) and by monetary restrictions (sending money out of the country is a nightmare).
Iran has millions of barrels of oil sitting idle rather than getting sold (although that might be a good thing, considering the impact of fossil fuels). Even the anticipation of lifted sanctions is creating a boom in Iran’s stock market. The effects of Iranian sanctions went far beyond making it more difficult for Iran to increase its military capabilities. This deal signifies a light at the end of the tunnel for many Iranian citizens who never supported their government's posturing and rhetoric to begin with, yet still lived with the burden of economic sanctions that made their lives incredibly difficult.
The resistance to the deal from the American Right will claim that Iran will use the economic relief to further destabilize the region, partnering with militant groups in Hezbollah and the Houthis among other threats to democratically elected governments. While there are certainly problems with Iran’s regional affiliations, the nuclear deal will probably not worsen these situations. Iran is already providing support for these groups; the sanctions were not quite stopping them. 
Furthermore, this deal creates a level of trust between the United States and Iran that has not existed since Operation TPAJAX installed the shah and the Hostage Crisis. This newfound diplomatic pull could be instrumental in pulling Iran to a more moderate position. Between this and joint airstrikes against ISIS, it feels like Iran might be open to diplomatic relations for the first time in decades. Diplomatic relations will calm radicalism by giving Iran someone to answer to.
We will not know the extent of the provisions until the official text is rolled out in late June. There will also be hurdles in both the American and Iranian legislative bodies. However, this deal is exciting. Relations with Iran are by no means perfect, but this deal allows their people to live safer and better lives without introducing yet another avenue to nuclear conflict. U.S.-Iran relations have been impossibly strained for decades, but this creates a precedent for, if both sides fulfill their obligations, a middle ground and mutual trust. It’s by no means Nixon in China, but it’s a powerful start..

2015-04-13,CMU,China,"The future looks dim for smokers on campus. On Thursday, the Undergraduate Student Senate approved a proposal banning tobacco wholly from campus. Yet, proponents of banning tobacco products aren’t necessarily smoking the competition.
The proposal passed through Senate with 15 in favor, 13 against, and one abstaining senator. Now, the policy has to make its way through Graduate Student Assembly, Faculty Senate, and Staff Council. 
Afterwards, University President Subra Suresh must sign off on the policy taking effect. If all the pieces fall into place, and the policy does take effect, tobacco use will be banned on campus entirely. 
According to the draft of the proposed policy, “Smoking and use of other tobacco products is prohibited by students, staff, faculty, and visitors in all university buildings, facilities or property owned, leased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus grounds and outside areas.”
The policy continues to define a “tobacco product” as “any type of product containing, made, or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption and ingested by any means.”
The proposed policy does make concessions for e-cigarettes, the health effects of which are still debated. 
As a result of this, the policy prohibits campus community members from using e-cigarettes or vaporizers indoors, but allows their use outdoors.
Beginning with a rationality statement, the policy itself relies heavily on the example set by over 1,000 other universities that have already banned tobacco from campus. 
“We believe that making a campus tobacco-free is considered the gold standard of health,” Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, who sits on the smoking policy review committee that wrote the policy, said of the policy.
Mainly focusing on the health of Carnegie Mellon community members, the policy seeks to aid not only bystanders, but current users and new users. 
“We do care a lot about individuals who consume tobacco and wish to receive aid in cessation of those habits” Casalegno added last week in an interview with The Tartan.
Preventing people from starting and current smokers from continuing is a goal of the smoking policy review committee. 
The policy cites the Surgeon General, stating that smoking still exists as the “leading preventable cause of death in the United States” in its rationale for the policy. 
Going forward, other organizations hold these arguments in mind when they put it to a vote. The GSA and Faculty Senate will consider the views of smokers as well in their upcoming votes on the policy.
The population of smokers on campus is diverse, much like the population of Carnegie Mellon itself. 
Over 20 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s 13,000 students are from different countries, a significant portion of those students hailing from China or Korea. 
In the international sphere, China and Korea as countries consume more cigarettes than the United States. Per capita per year consumption of cigarettes is 700 cigarettes higher and about 1000 cigarettes higher in China and Korea respectively, according to the Washington Post.
With such a significant number of students from abroad, and from countries that consume that much more on average, the Smoking Policy Review Committee has a significant cultural hurdle to combat with the new policy. 
Yet data from other universities which have banned tobacco shows a significant decrease in the number of users after a smoke- and tobacco-free policy is implemented on campuses.
Data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows a decrease in overall users in the United States of about 20 percent since 1965. 
With CDC domestic figures, Pennsylvania still ranks eighth in smoking prevalence. On a dogmatic level, schools see this number decreasing with preventative measures just like the Committee’s proposed policy.
The future of the policy is balancing upon whether or not the respective governing bodies buy into this vision..

2015-08-24,CMU,China,"New technology improves detection of blood clots
Currently, there is no one method used to locate a blood clot in the body. Instead, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography are used to view the legs, heart, and lungs, respectively. A team of researchers at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, including faculty member Peter Caravan, has developed a new method that could identify blood clots in the body with a single full-body scan.
Caravan’s team created a blood clot probe by attaching a radionuclide, which can be detected anywhere in the body by positron emission tomography (PET), to a peptide that binds specifically to fibrin, which is found in blood clots. The team tested several probes with various radionuclides in rats, and is now focusing on the fibrin binding probe #8 (FBP8) that uses copper-64 as the radionuclide and has been determined to be most efficient. The team hopes to begin human testing in the fall.

Curbed carbon emissions could save farmers billions of dollars
Economist Brent Boehlert, a research affiliate of MIT, along with a team of researchers, has estimated that curbed carbon emissions could save farmers billions of dollars by 2100 by reducing the frequency and severity of droughts.
Boehlert and colleagues analyzed the effect of temperature and rainfall changes on droughts, and estimated that farmers will save approximately 980 million dollars annually by 2050 if large-scale carbon emission cuts are made that keep atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations below 500 parts per million (ppm), as opposed to 1750 ppm, which is the expected atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration if no measures are taken. Less drastic cuts that keep carbon dioxide concentrations below 600 ppm would save 390 million dollars annually.

Flexible electronics offer wide variety of applications
Researchers at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are now able to replace rigid circuit boards with flexible electronics by placing a thin silicon integrated circuit, only a few hundred nanometers thick, on a bendable plastic-like substrate.
This bendable format allows circuitry to be placed in tight spaces or curved surfaces, such as airplane wings or a person’s skin. The research team at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are looking into a variety of applications for this new technology, including aircraft applications measuring stresses and strains. The same technology is also being investigated as a way to monitor pilots’ health. A wearable biosensor patch that monitors the body’s heartbeat, hydration, and temperature could indicate fatigue or cognitive problems. In both cases, information could be relayed to a ground crew through the use of a small embedded antenna. The system could also monitor conditions of bridges and other infrastructure.

Chinese writing on cave helps predict drought
Sebastian Breitenbach, a climate scientist at the University of Cambridge, along with a group of researchers, has found writing on the wall of Dayu Cave in the Qinling Mountains of central China that records information about droughts in the region between 1520 and 1920. The research team also analyzed stalagmites in Dayu Cave.
By analyzing stable isotopes of oxygen, carbon, uranium, and other elements, the researchers determined that the years which the cave writing cited as years with little rainfall, correlated with higher oxygen and carbon isotope ratios. Using this discovery, the team created a precipitation model for the region. The model aligned with a drought in the 1990s, and predicted a drought in the late 2030s.

Drones are poor choice for monitoring wildlife
Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are becoming a popular method for studying wildlife, yet it has been suggested that they might cause stress or harm to the animals being studied. Mark Ditmer of the University of Minnesota, St. Paul, along with other researchers, studied the effect of a small UAV on four black bears, which were fitted with GPS collars and heart monitors.
The researchers found that the bears’ heart rates rose drastically when the UAV was flown overhead. They also discovered that the animals’ response to the UAV was stronger when the sound of the UAV approaching was masked by the wind. All four heart rates had returned to normal approximately 30 minutes after the UAV flew overhead. The researchers concluded that the animals were slightly, but not extremely, stressed by the UAV. They did note, however, that the bears being studied live in an area heavily impacted by humans, and that wild animals might have a much stronger reaction.

New galaxy collision provides insight on collision rings
A team of astronomers at the University of Hong Kong and the University of Manchester have discovered a new galaxy collision, which occurs when two galaxies of similar mass collide and the resulting shockwaves form new stars. The galaxy collision, named Kathryn’s Wheel, is 30 million light years away, which is about seven times closer to the Milky Way than any other galaxy collision found to date. The collision was observed with the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia during a wide field survey of the Southern Milky Way. The low mass of the galaxy collision suggests that collision rings can form around smaller galaxies than originally thought. Because smaller galaxies are more common, this implies that collision rings could be up to ten times more common than previously thought. The researchers intend to study the collision further with larger telescopes.

2015-08-31,CMU,China,"The United States Department of Defense renewed its contract with the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) this summer for $1.73 billion. This is over twice the value of the previous contract agreement the SEI made with the government over five years ago.
As per the school’s part of the agreement, the SEI will provide crucial services to the United States government. The institute will research ways to increase the reliability and security of government software systems. Paul Nielsen, SEI CEO, said in a university press release that “Our new contract guarantees that the SEI can continue to develop breakthrough technologies in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, the Department of Defense, and our industry partners.” 
This contract renewal may come as a relief, as the past few years, Carnegie Mellon has experienced problems with funding. “Like many colleges and universities, we faced the government shutdown, decreasing federal funding due to the sequestration and rising costs associated with growth and expansion,” Chief Financial Officer Amir Rahnamay-Azar said in his 2014 fiscal report for the university. Azar continued by noting that even bringing in more talented individuals has become a challenge, as the current higher education hiring climate is extremely competitive.
Last year’s fiscal shortages motivated University President Dr. Subra Suresh to raise money for the university, including by way of government contracts. In addition to these contracts, among which is a small one with the Federal Highway Administration, Suresh has also announced several large donations by private companies and alumni in the past year. Most notably, David A. Tepper is working with the university to create a new campus quadrangle for the business school in what is now the Morewood Gardens parking lot. 
This research initiative with the U.S. government more than doubles the total fiscal support Carnegie Mellon received via sponsored projects. With an investment this large, the U.S. government is publicly endorsing Carnegie Mellon’s importance as an innovator and top research institution. The amount of the contract is high enough that the SEI is now an approved Federally Funded Research and Development Center. The SEI shares this designation with 40 other research and development institutions in the United States.
According to Rahnamay-Azar, the SEI “saw significant revenue growth ($62.3 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to $123.4 million for fiscal year 2014) largely from the Department of Homeland Security.” 
The Department of Defense dramatic increase in funding demonstrates the importance of software technologies to the U.S. government, even more relevant after recent hacks from China, and a continuing chain of attacks from foreign countries. .

According to the WEF’s mission statement, both conferences attract decision-makers, experts and innovators to “define challenges, solutions and actions, always in the spirit of global citizenship.” Carnegie Mellon University is one out of 25 universities in the world to attend this event, and one out of only 12 universities in the United States. An even more impressive feat is that Carnegie Mellon’s fifteen person delegation — comprising faculty members, students, and staff — is the largest delegation among all universities that attended the conference.
Delegates from Carnegie Mellon included leading researchers in computer science, robotics, human computer interaction, machine learning, and information systems, to name a few. “Carnegie Mellon is always on the cutting edge of technology innovation, particularly technologies that collaborate with people to address the most pressing challenges of our time, so the WEF meetings are natural venues in which to share our ideas and demonstrate our technologies,” said Justine Cassell, Carnegie Mellon’s associate vice provost of Technology Strategy and Impact, in a university press release.
Topics discussed during the conference ranged from issues such as “What if machines outsmart us?” and “decoding cancer” to “What if scientists are the new chefs?” and “What if your mind could be read?” The Carnegie Mellon delegation participated in a variety of these discussions touching on various topics including computer science, machine learning, and robotics.
On the first day of the conference, Carnegie Mellon delegates presented an IdeasLab on “Machine Learning for Health.” In the session they discussed how machine learning can help predict neurodegenerative diseases, prevent epidemics, and aid individuals in the health industry such as doctors and health insurers. Various Carnegie Mellon delegates participated in this discussion, including Andrew Moore, dean of the School of Computer Science; Jason Hong, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute; Tom Mitchell, head of the Machine Learning Department; Daniel Neill, an associate professor of information systems; and Aarti Singh, an assistant professor of machine learning.
Carnegie Mellon also demonstrated advancements in robotics in a variety of presentations, such as in the exhibition “Meet the Robots,” organized by Cassell. In this exhibition, William Whittaker, a Carnegie Mellon professor of robotics, allowed participants of WEF to remotely drive Carnegie Mellon’s Andy Lunar Rover, which resides halfway across the world in West Mifflin, Pa. Ralph Hollis, another professor of robotics, showcased Ballbot, a robot that is similar in size and shape to a human, that moves while balancing atop a bowling-ball-sized sphere. 
Cassell also presented “virtual peers,” which are animated video characters that can hold a conversation with students, and have been used to aid autistic children and research the use of vernacular in schools. 
Cassell, Whittaker, and Hollis also all participated in a discussion panel on “Robots without Borders,” which focused on the topic of optimizing the incorporation of robotics into society to achieve societal improvements. Carnegie Mellon’s CREATE Lab also presented its Earth Time-Lapse technology, which aims at visualizing massive databases.
Many Carnegie Mellon faculty members were also recognized for their work at this event. Louis-Phillippe Morency, associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute was recognized as one of this year’s Young Scientists, a title given to leading contributors to science, engineering, or technology under the age of 40. Carnegie Mellon spinoff Neon, which was co-founded by the head of the Department of Psychology Michael Tarr and CEO Sophie Lebrecht, was recognized as one of the world’s 49 most promising technology pioneers.
Conferences such as the WEF’s Annual Meeting of the New Champions allow for leading researchers and innovators from around the world to share ideas and, hopefully, look toward an improved future. Public conference sessions and discussions of this year’s annual meeting are posted on WEF’s official website, and are available for streaming..

2015-09-21,CMU,China,"Being a CEO in the modern business climate is a daunting challenge. The global economy is constantly transforming, forcing businesses to change and adapt in an unstable market. 
In the current period of economic instability and decreased growth, many stress that change is the ultimate way to save the organization — otherwise companies face dying out.
This is exactly what David Farr, chairman and chair executive officer of Emerson Electric Company, believes. Farr visited the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon this past week to discuss business strategy reform, his successes, and his work as the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Emerson’s original business model to sustain growth functioned very well from the year 2000 to the year 2012, but in 2012, the company experienced a significant decrease in sales growth. 
As a result, Farr changed the structure of the company and adjusted his business model to better suit a world of shrinking global fixed income.
Farr focused the new strategy on delivering better growth, broader customer solutions, more robust profitability, and higher returns. “Without growth, no company can make an earning in the long run,” Farr said.
The foundation of Emerson’s new business strategy is made up of the management process, the talent within the company, the technology, and the investments. 
The management process must be reworked every year to ensure the company’s growth. The talent in the company must be reallocated to its most optimal position; Emerson needs “the right people, in the right places, with the right resources,” Farr said.
In addition, global technology must be carefully monitored and updated to suit customers’ needs and to maintain the company’s leadership in the market. Some new technologies may be disruptive to older companies, so Emerson must understand new technological developments and be willing to adapt to the changing world. “Emerson is utilizing the key disruptive technologies of the 21st century to unlock new opportunities for growth,” Farr said.
Lastly, investments in Emerson help the company establish presence and strengthen its position in new markets. Historically, this was not a problem, as Emerson surpassed the S&P 500 in terms of economic growth, but the company has been shrinking significantly since 2014. Farr was therefore forced to change his business strategy and worked with his board to adjust the company. 
Adjusting the structure was complicated, because Farr could not base Emerson’s business model on global economic growth. 
Currently, global fixed income and worldwide economic growth is decreasing. Farr therefore strategically shrunk his company to better suit the market. He cut the company down from a $24.5 billion franchise to one of $16.3 billion, and Emerson consequently experienced a 2.4 percent increase in sales growth. Today, as a result of his strategic actions, Emerson is showing excellent growth. Farr went on to explain other strategic changes he implemented in his business model to ensure growth, and how the management held the company’s high position in the market. Mid-tier markets in Russia and India offer profitable opportunities for Emerson, Farr said. Emerson was once a very strong company in China, but other competing local companies started to form and take over some of the market. 
Therefore, Farr was forced to change Emerson’s market strategies or disappear completely from China’s market. He employed new strategies that would tie down the company’s upper tier and grow in the mid tier, thus keeping their position in the high tier and enabling Emerson to compete with other mid tiers.
Farr believes that to be a CEO, you must demonstrate that you can indeed be a leader and induce positive changes for a company. Before he became Emerson’s CEO, Farr urged the company to expand to Asia given the global economic changes that were occurring at this time. Now, Emerson still holds a strong position in the Asian market.
“To be a CEO, you have to make an impact, you need to demonstrate that you can make something big happen, not just sit behind a desk,” Farr said. Farr himself exhibits strong leadership and willingness to better his company for the future, concluding by saying, “I was given the keys to make this a better company for the next CEO.”.

2015-09-21,CMU,China,"Last Tuesday, North Korea claimed to once again begin expanding its nuclear arsenal. North Korea has had nuclear weapons for some time, and its possession of these weapons is often presented as a negative test case for nuclear deals with “rogue states,” such as Iran.
A quick look into the history, however, reveals that the opposite is true. The Agreed Framework, the nuclear deal former president Bill Clinton made with North Korea, actually prevented the birth of a nuclear North Korea until former president George W. Bush let the deal collapse toward the beginning of his presidency.
The Agreed Framework-based counterargument to the Iran Deal is compelling but improbable; the Iran Deal is unlike the failed Agreed Framework in that there are key differences between the deals and political situations in North Korea and Iran.
First, the collapse of the North Korean deal had little to do with the deal itself and everything to do with American inaction. In North Korea, the United States had an active role in the deal. However, because many were skeptical of North Korea’s faithfulness to the terms, the U.S. slacked on energy shipments.
Meanwhile, the Iran Deal only gives the United States a say in when to inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities. Since this deal is easier for the U.S., it will not collapse based entirely on America’s skepticism.
Secondly, North Korea has a very strong central government that heavily controls flow of information. This information comes from American intelligence, so take it with a grain of salt, but it does seem that North Koreans generally have less will for diplomacy and often view their government as infallible.
In Iran, meanwhile, there exists a real desire to connect with the West. There is also evidence that, despite American conceptions, the Iranian government actually is quite responsive to the people. The image of Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif reaching out a sunroof to high-five throngs of thrilled citizens is stunning. The political engagement of citizens will empower moderates in the Iranian government, which will turn the country from a militaristic rogue state into a nation eager to improve conditions within its own borders.
Finally, the Agreed Framework did what it set out to do; it prevented North Korea from attaining nuclear weapons. Though North Korea publicly flirted with the idea of bombastically violating the deal, its first nuclear tests did not occur until after the deal crumbled.
Much more so than Iran, North Korea has long been a state inclined toward nuclear ambitions and cheating on deals. But America’s offer to help with North Korea’s severe energy problem was enough of a carrot to hold the country to that deal’s terms. In the same way, the Iran deal will lift the sanctions that have restricted Iran’s economy and infrastructure for 40 years, motivating the Iranian government to keep their end of the deal. 
While it is disconcerting that North Korea may restart nuclear tests, it is important to remember that American diplomacy once had that under control. China has strongly condemned the possibility of North Korean nuclear testing and will likely exert enough pressure to keep anything meaningful from coming of North Korea’s announcement, but the message remains the same. Diplomacy is a powerful tool. The Agreed Framework served its purpose, and it is time to give the Iran Deal a shot to do the same..

2015-09-28,CMU,China,"It has been almost a week since Nepal passed its first federal constitution, and tensions continue to escalate. As of Friday morning, 45 people — half of them police officers — have died in anti-constitution protests. Nepal’s southern neighbor India looms large over the conflict. While the crisis itself is worth of attention, it also points to bigger questions about the role of regional leaders. 
The new constitution, which was enacted on Sept. 20, has been in the works for seven years. Nepal has been functioning under an interim constitution since its monarchy was abolished in 2007. In less than a decade, Nepal has gone from being a theocratic Hindu Kingdom to a secular federal republic. These rapid changes have inflamed ethnic tensions.
Nepal is made up of several ethnic groups, and these minority groups experienced years of marginalization under the former monarchy. The two largest of these groups, the Madhesis and the Tharus, comprise 40 percent of Nepal’s population, and they live mostly in the southern plains region along the Indian border. In the last week, the south has erupted with protests against what many Madhesis view as their underrepresentation under the new constitution. 
Most recently, Madhesis protestors have barricaded the two main borders between India and Nepal, shutting down vital imports and applying pressure to the government in Kathmandu. The new constitution divides the country into seven provinces and distributes representatives based on both geography and population. 
Each of the 75 districts in the nation will receive a seat on the Legislative-Parliament, while the rest of the regionally elected seats will be distributed based on population. This is helpful for the rural, mountainous regions of Nepal, where population is sparse, but it also leads to an under-representation of the south, which is much more densely populated. 
India, as the regional leader of Southeast Asia, has had much to say about the week’s unrest in Nepal. After the constitution was ratified by the Constitutional Assembly, Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar rushed to Nepal to request a delay in its implementation. When that failed, the Indian government in New Delhi recommended seven amendments to the Nepalese constitution. These amendments sided heavily with the southern protesters and pushed for more population-based representation. 
India certainly has a vested interest in keeping Nepal stable. The two countries share an open border, and instability in Nepal would increase smuggling and terrorist traffic across it. Also, the Indian government fears that violence in Nepal’s south will spill over into the already unstable Indian state of Bihar. 
While these concerns are legitimate, India is overstepping its bounds. A constitution is meant to reflect the voice of a nation’s people, not that of its allies or neighbors. While support and advice during the writing process can be constructive, proposing amendments and trying to delay a constitution that was ratified by a democratically elected Constitutional Assembly is patronizing. Nepal is a sovereign nation, and its government deserves to be respected. 
The violence in Nepal is certainly troubling, and the 45 deaths are a tragic loss. However, when viewing this crisis, it is important to remember that state-building is rarely a peaceful or linear process. 
Although everyone wishes there was a peaceful path to representational democracy, we have yet to find one. By aggressively enforcing its will, India is stifling Nepal’s progress towards democracy and turning it into a puppet state. 
Rajeshwar Acharya, Nepal’s former ambassador to China, summed it up best when he said: ""Domestic issues of any country are corrected by the political actors and authorities of the same country and there is no need for any other country to issue instructions. It doesn't mean that Nepal can't work independently just because it is a small nation. All of our friendly nations are requested not to interfere into our domestic affairs,"" according to Republica. 
The entire political system of democracy rests on faith. A nation’s people need to have faith that their vote matters. When more powerful nations step in, they undermine that trust — no matter how good their intentions..

2015-11-16,CMU,China,"Continuing our discussion from last week about technical automation, Pugwash heard from Laurence Ales, an assistant professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, regarding the effects of automation on job loss.
Ales began his talk by laying out two stories that are often told by the media regarding automation. The first is that modern automation will take all our jobs as humans become obsolete in comparison to robots. The second is that although the market has responded to automation in the past, this time is different.
After putting the two media narratives on the table for us to think about, Ales gave a brief history of past technological changes and their impacts on the market. Technological change has been happening throughout human history, moving the labor force from artisans, to factory laborers, to service workers. At each transition, some jobs were lost, but other positions opened up to replace them.
Looking at the first concern that arises, regarding the idea of humans becoming obsolete or running out of jobs, Ales cautioned us to not only look at jobs lost, but also jobs gained.
If autonomous vehicles or drones take over the transportation and delivery sectors, then of course people who are currently delivering pizzas will be out of jobs. However, that’s just the first step. If robots provide such an advantage, pizza might get cheaper, encouraging more people to buy it. This necessitates more pizza cooks, more receptionists to take orders, and more managers to organize it all. Similarly, it means more drones doing delivery, which could mean a drone repair shop opening up down the street.
Although automation reduces some jobs, Ales wanted to make it clear that it will open up new opportunities in other areas. Humans will always have a competitive advantage in something, relative to machines or robots, and those areas are where jobs will open up.
The second concern, however, is that modern automation is somehow different from automation in the past. Maybe it’s the pace of the automation, or which jobs are being replaced, or even who’s making how much money.
It’s true, Ales said, that the jobs being replaced now, or the jobs that will be replaced in the near future, are different than prior jobs. The last major industrial shift saw a decline in factory laborers due to a transition towards service jobs, and now it’s those service jobs, among other industries like transportation, that are being targeted.
Despite the prevalence of technology, however, there are still plenty of areas in which humans have an advantage over machines. Maybe they can deliver pizzas and drive cars, but they still don’t make very good janitors or economics professors. And the robots in use aren’t being repaired by other robots, or at least not yet.
In looking at inequality, Ales thinks there might be something to worry about. The wealth gap has been increasing since the 1970s. This is possibly due in part to the fact that the jobs being replaced are mid-level jobs involving semi-skilled work, and the new jobs being created are on either end of the spectrum.
Ales next addressed the question of policy. If automation takes away some jobs, while at the same time opening up new ones, and the wealth gap is increasing, what are some policy solutions that could address these issues?
First, to help workers who are in danger of being replaced, we should make it easier to transfer from one sector to another. Find which industries are losing jobs, and provide incentive for workers to switch to similar industries that aren’t being replaced. At the same time, make sure to support people who want to go into careers that are seeing growth. Easing transitions from one career to another would make workers more agile and able to respond to automation.
Secondly, Ales argued that to address the income disparity, taxes should be raised on the wealthy instead of raising the minimum wage. Providing a higher minimum income would only encourage workers to stay in dying industries, according to Ales. Instead of doing that, the government should tax the wealthy and use that money to provide re-training for workers to find an industry that is growing instead of shrinking.
The talk by Ales was followed by a question and answer session. One question that came up was while Ales’ talk applied mostly to the United States and other developed countries, what about nations like Mexico or China? Also, what would happen when robots eventually have all competitive advantage over humans? Perhaps most importantly, will economists’ policy advice be heeded by those in charge?
While Ales had some answers, other questions are still up for grabs. “Get back to me in a year,” he laughed when asked about his current research. However, Ales was clear that as far as we know, the current wave of automation doesn’t mean the end of the world as we know it, as many claim..

2015-11-16,CMU,China,"Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns came to Carnegie Mellon to talk about “The Future of America’s National Security” last Tuesday.
Having played a leadership role in U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East and Asia and becoming one of the nation’s top career diplomats as undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2005–2008, R. Nicholas Burns offered a big-picture perspective of the country’s position on the world stage. Burns, former Ambassador to Greece and NATO, “reflects the intellectual culture we seek to create in the Institute for Politics and Strategy. In his many years in the state department’s Foreign Service and now as a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Ambassador Burns had become one of our nation’s top experts both in politics and strategy,” said Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences.
The Ambassador’s lifelong trajectory supports the notion that one may start as an intern, following their passions in school, and through dedication and hard work, eventually be called upon to negotiate some of the most challenging issues in the world today. “Carnegie Mellon has such an incredible reputation as one of our leading schools for engineering and computer science, being on the cutting edge of our 21st century economy, but it does have to be balanced by an understanding of global policy and global affairs,” Burns said.
A great part of Burns’ message focused on international cooperation and the United States’ role as a global leader, in any metric devised. He drew attention to the United States having the greatest economy in the world, an incredibly innovative student population, and an insurmountable amount of political influence. All of this combined highlights the country’s responsibility to maintain the safety and security of its own borders, but also the rest of the world — “in a global age, if we’re not engaged as the leader of a coalition, if we’re nor helping other people, then we injure our own security as well as theirs” Burns said.
The elimination of boundaries brought on by globalization has not only stimulated the global economy, but has also transformed the way nations look at predicaments. Climate change is one of those. The future of clean energy jobs and high tech jobs will be born in universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Carnegie Mellon, Burns said, and it is that kind of forward thinking that makes the United States an indispensable and exceptional power when it comes to leading change. Transnational alliances are key to solving this problem. Reaching out to countries such as China or India, some of the world’s largest carbon emitters, and redacting a climate agreement are believed to be some of the most important things President Obama will do during his mandate. By mid-December, the first global contract on climate change will most likely emerge, where every country in the world agrees to a mandated level of diminished carbon emissions, on a schedule that will take us forward during the next 30 or 40 years.
Other important issues that cross oceans and physical barriers are the trafficking of women and children as well as organized crime rings and drug cartels. There are so many elements involved in finding solutions to these issues, all of which require an enormous amount of cooperation.
“Part of it is getting to the source of the issue beyond America, but the most important part is getting to the root of the problem in our own country, in the hearts and minds and insecurities of our own kids, who are dependent on drugs,” R. Nicholas Burns said in an effort to highlight the role education plays in the mitigation of several global problems. Nonetheless, the magnitude of these issues requires the support of not only several nations, but also several resources such as the military, every level of government, and also businesses in America.
“Think about what is at stake in the transnational domain,” Burns said. “We have to be out there, engaging other countries as a leader and fight these problems before they can assault us.”
The lecture marked the introduction of Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences’ new academic unit which will focus on the study of political science, international relations and national security. Under the direction of Kiron K. Skinner, who brings an enormous amount of scholarship, energy, and dedication to the enterprise, the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) will serve as a center for research, undergraduate and graduate education, and university-wide initiatives..

2015-11-23,CMU,China,"China and CMU to provide scholarships
Last Friday, Nov. 20, Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh met with members of the China Scholarship Council to approve new fellowships which seek to provide support for Carnegie Mellon graduate students of Chinese origin. 
These fellowships, added to funding and federal grants from the university, creates a sum total of $32 million in financial support that will span across the next five years. These fellowships will allow more Chinese students to study at the university without the burden of the large price tag attached to this institution.
As part of this program, the China Scholarship Council will provide full tuition and a two-year stipend to as many as 20 Carnegie Mellon doctoral students and four master’s degree students. The university will provide its usual financial support after this time has ended.
These fellowships will provide support for doctoral students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields as well as students in the social sciences, humanities, design, and architecture. Additionally, these fellowships will support students pursuing a master’s degree in the arts, drama, and music.
This agreement, overseen by China Scholarship Council Secretary-General Jinghui Liu, adds to the longstanding history of collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and China.
Alumna organizes LATINY conference
2012 Carnegie Institute of Technology alumnus Luza Jaramillo has organized the first ever LATINY technology conference.
Jaramillo is of Colombian decent. With recent numbers from Google Inc. showing the company’s Hispanic workforce in the single digit percentages, Jaramillo thought it prudent to host a technology conference focused on Hispanic diversity in the tech industry. 
As a student, Jaramillo attended the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2010, sponsored by Carnegie Mellon’s Information Networking Institute (INI). 
INI Director Dena Haritos Tsamitis has long supported conferences and initiatives that promote diversity in the technological workplace. “Sponsoring students to attend Grace Hopper and similar minority-serving conferences is just one facet of the INI’s commitment to diversifying the field,” said Tsamitis. “However, it is not simply about attracting more women to the field. Our focus is on removing barriers and enacting a culture shift that embraces all individuals, no matter their gender, ethnicity or background.”
Jaramillo became involved in the Latinas in Computing organization through these many events sponsored by INI. 
Now, in 2015, Jaramillo has worked to organize LATINY, a conference poised to be held in South American cities which provides a platform similar to the Grace Hopper Celebration conferences.
LATINY debuted on November 9 in Santiago, Chile. The conference hopes to broaden interest in the technological industry among diverse students..

2016-01-25,CMU,China,"On Monday, Dec. 21, the Pittsburgh City Council voted 7-2 to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. Before the law was passed, marijuana possession was punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine. Now, when police catch someone in possession of under 30 grams of marijuana, they will confiscate the drug and assess up to a $100 fine. No jail time.
The Pittsburgh City Council made the right decision, and they deserve recognition and praise for it. At the same time, we should demand even more from our city council and our elected officials at all levels of government: full legalization.
Legalizing marijuana nationwide would save taxpayers billions of dollars on the futile War on Drugs. Every year, federal, state, and local governments spend as much as $50 billion policing drug use, especially marijuana, especially marijuana. Imagine if we could instead use that money to build new schools, fix America’s crumbling infrastructure, or even reinvest it into drug prevention and addiction treatment programs. That’s to say nothing of the additional tax revenue that a legal marijuana market would generate. According to a study by the Cato Institute, legalizing marijuana would generate $8.7 billion in tax revenue. Legalization would also empower police to address real matters of public safety. Decriminalization and legalization enable police to focus less on low-level offenders and focus more on dealers, gangs, and cartels, forces that really do harm the public and deserve undivided attention.
Pittsburgh’s move to decriminalize marijuana will keep people out of already crowded jails. The United States incarcerates more of its own citizens than any other country, even China, an authoritarian state with over three times as many citizens. As many as 50% of America’s prisoners are nonviolent offenders, usually for drug possession. Legalizing marijuana nationwide would keep millions of people from going to prison every year, and can save lives, communities, and money.
Perhaps the most important reason to support legalization, though, is the clear racism in the way marijuana use is policed. Let’s face it, a lot of white, middle-class kids at Carnegie Mellon smoke marijuana, but I doubt that many Carnegie Mellon students worried much about getting a $500 fine for possession. According to a  2013 study by the ACLU, even though white people and black people use marijuana at the same rate, black people are four times more likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana than other groups. For white people, using marijuana comes with a slap on the wrist. For black people, it can derail your entire life. While decriminalization is a step forward towards equal treatment, the fine can still be applied to perpetuate systemic racism. Decriminalization and legalization help ensure that the law is applied fairly to everyone.
Pittsburgh took a huge step forward when City Council voted to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. The move will save taxpayers money, make the streets safer, depopulate jails, and promote racial justice. However, while we applaud City Council, we must acknowledge that any journey is more than the first step forward. Now that we have forward momentum, we must work even harder to make marijuana legal..

2016-02-01,CMU,China,"Human trafficking is a global problem, with 20–30 million slaves being sold around the world today. It is extremely prevalent in the United States alone, with 75 percent of U.S. trafficking victims being, in fact, U.S. citizens. The United States has been labeled as a “destination country” for international trafficking due to the fact that we are considered to be a wealthy country and have expendable money for the exploitation of human products. Countries with instabilities and weak infrastructure tend to be the “supply countries,” where large pools of vulnerable citizens in search of security and hope can be found.
This was just a portion of what director of programs for The Project to End Human Trafficking, Lynsie Clott, discussed in Tuesday’s presentation titled “Human Trafficking 101 and Local Cases.” Clott delivered a highly informative yet unsettling talk on understanding this concept of modern slavery. She provided the audience with a thorough definition of human trafficking — whilst also clarifying the difference between human trafficking and human smuggling — and the various ways trafficking conceals itself in society in the forms of sexual slavery, commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, or forced servitude.
Clott provided hard-hitting examples that illustrated the differences between the numerous forms trafficking could take.
The first example was of a trafficking victim from China who had been given a forged passport and was tricked into coming to the United States with the hopes of “working in a nice hotel and making good money.” Upon arrival at JFK, her traffickers discretely transported her from the airport to a hotel room where she was forced into becoming a prostitute.
More extreme examples include such an incident involving a girl whose earliest memories were of her parents using her as the “star” of their child pornography film to advertise her for commercial sex. Clott connected this example to the fact that children are frequently targeted and kidnapped by traffickers, forced to beg for money on the streets, and cruelly maimed and deformed by their kidnappers to entice passersby into sympathetically yielding more money.
In the U.S., regional and inter-state movement of humans as products (often referred to as “running the circuit”) is much more prevalent than international trafficking. The United States’ consumerist culture and the need to meet the incessantly increasing demand for goods are what fuel labor trafficking. January is Human Trafficking Awareness month, and it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of spreading awareness and educating ourselves. The general population’s ignorance of issues regarding human rights violations and their prevalence in our country is what cultivates, if not exacerbates, this matter. There are countless resources available to educate us on the matter of human trafficking. The Not For Sale Campaign and the United States Department of Labor can both be referred to as credible sources of information on the issue. Slavery Footprint is also a very useful tool that serves as a type of survey that allows users to “input select data about their consumer spending habits, which then outputs a graphical ‘footprint’ of the user’s participation in modern-day slavery (as quantified by their consumption of items created by forced labor and child labor).”
To get involved at the institutional level, students can contact Jess Klein, the Coordinator of Gender Programs & Sexual Violence Prevention, who organized the event..

2016-02-15,CMU,China,"The fallout of the Zika virus as Brazil hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics depends on a lot of factors, but based on historic results, there a few ways Olympic crises usually work themselves out. Of course, this all depends on what scale the Zika virus continues to spread, and how severe its impact turns out to be. 
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), common symptoms of the virus are a fever, rashes, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. While a combination of these symptoms sounds unpleasant, the ailments are hardly deadly.
The real issues stem from how easily Zika spreads undetected, and whether or not it causes birth defects. It seems more and more likely that women who get Zika while pregnant are likely to have children with birth defects, most notably a brain defect called microcephaly, which can cause lifelong problems for the infants, and frequently results in death.
Brazil, the most heavily impacted country, has reported over 4,000 cases of microcephaly with potential ties to Zika. While the link between Zika and microcephaly hasn’t been confirmed, the jump in cases in countries with the virus points to a connection. So what will Brazil do? In the past, there has been a general ‘the show must go on’ mentality with the Olympic games. With the exception of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 games, which were cancelled because of the World Wars, every games has been run as planned independent of external forces.
So if the show goes on, how will it go? Looking back to the cost overruns of the 2014 World Cup hosted by Brazil (FIFA admits a cost of upwards of 15 billion USD), there is already cause for concern. Even without the complications of a birth defect causing virus, cost overruns have been a consistent problem for first time hosts of the Olympics, with the Sochi games having an estimated cost upward of 50 billion USD.
While cost overruns and runaway price tags are certainly an issue, the games have always run as planned through financial issues. With steep costs at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and at the Montreal Olympics in 1976, events ran as planned and only after were the hosts left trying to recoup their losses.
Besides high costs, the default problem for an Olympic games is boycotting countries. Past historic boycotts have come from border disputes, apartheid protests, Cold War political statements, and even smaller regional disputes. While the last boycott was by North Korea in 1988, this option has often been taken advantage of, with seven boycotts held in the last 16 games.
This leaves the question of what it would take for the Zika virus to cause any form of boycott. To date, there are about 35,000 estimated cases of the virus in Brazil, many of which are not confirmed. In contrast, the CDC estimates that there were 60.8 million cases of the H1N1 flu virus in the United States during the 2009-2010 outbreak. For Brazil to have a proportionally large outbreak, there would need to be about 40 million cases of the Zika virus. However, if the correlation between the Zika virus and birth defects is confirmed, the picture would be different for the Zika virus. But which countries would boycott the games?
Since Zika is very difficult to contain in areas with mosquito populations and subpar medical systems, African and Southeast Asian countries where the disease could quickly spread have reason to consider caution. The island countries around the South China Sea are especially vulnerable, given past problems in these areas containing yellow fever, a disease spread by the same mosquito breed as Zika.
In addition to facing the prospect of intercontinental boycotts, Brazil may see countries close to home choose not participate. El Salvador, a small country south of Guatemala in central America, has asked its population to avoid having children until progress is made battling Zika. Could they go the next step, and ask people not to go to Brazil?
Even if a country isn’t worried about bringing Zika back from Brazil, they may prefer to keep the focus on combating the disease, instead of turning to the Olympic games. Take Columbia, which estimates 30,000 cases of its own. While an official boycott of the Olympic games may not be necessary, another Zika-hit country could easily choose not to participate in order to focus national efforts on the problem at hand.
With Zika becoming a bigger issue each day in Latin America, there are still a lot of options on the table for the 2016 Summer Olympics. But odds are good that most countries will still participate as planned..

2016-02-15,CMU,China,"This past Friday, Feb. 13, Carnegie Mellon’s annual Lunar Gala was held in Wiegand Gymnasium. This year was the show’s 20th anniversary, so the hype was pretty grand. With separate teams for producing, modeling, designing, dancing, tech, and others, this event really showcases the incredible passion of Carnegie Mellon students who have spent much of last semester and January preparing for it. But I know that’s not why you’re reading this article. So without further adieu, let’s review the good, the bad, and the downright strange looks that graced LG’s 20th anniversary stage.
The first line, Polymorphism, by senior architecture major Richard Chou and junior art major Katherine Zhao, was described by the viewer’s pamphlet as a collection of pieces that represent “a structural form of data.” This collection featured a good amount of leather, blacks, grays, and metallics alongside hard, metal accents such as a giant, jauntily angled wire cube surrounding one of the models’ heads, and two wing-like forearm wraps, which seemed to hold the model’s arms in place. In all, this was a very solid collection. The geometries were unexpected and intricate, and the overall effect was interesting to watch.
Next, we had Cymatics by first-year design major Anna Gusman and first-year art major Ariana Nathani. Described as “an exploration of the way sound interacts with its environment on a molecular level,” Cymatics displayed quite an intriguing set of patterned pieces. My personal favorite was the first look — an overlarge, short- sleeved top whose entire front was cut into a gorgeously intricate and fluid pattern that struck the right balance between sexy and tasteful. The only glaring negative I saw in this collection were the clear plastic visors some models wore over their faces; they looked a bit like cut-up Coke bottles to me.
Up next was The Barracks by junior industrial design major Linny Tan. Tan’s line was described as “a series
of military-style lingerie that investigates the clash of hyper masculine and feminine in a quest for androgyny.” This collection played a lot with hints of color, using a primarily black base fabric and adding accents of a not-quite-floral pattern. There were many interesting pieces here, particularly a mesh top with a folded lapel- like chest covering which looked very luxurious. Also, many of the bottom pieces were beautifully executed.
Exuviae, a line built around the idea of exoskeletons, featured beautifully crafted plastic accessories, which made the relatively simply blue pieces come alive. Most times with fitted undergarments, they can end up looking bunchy or awkward, but these fit each model’s curves perfectly. This collection was an overall success.
Moving on, we had Dauntless by junior chemistry major Eunice Oh, and senior electrical and computer engineering majors Katherine Wang and Yiru Yao. This collection “incorporate[d] elements which highlight the elegance of a woman and the fierce nature of a warrior.” Dauntless featured a primarily black base garment embellished with some large, structured, gold armor pieces. This collection seemed to be an immediate crowd favorite, with the first look — a fitted leather and fabric cocktail dress with gold, wing-like shoulder pads — earning several hoots and hollers. Overall, this collection had a toe in dynastic style, with bright reds, golds, and blacks, and a toe in Alice and Wonderland, with the rose accents and the regality of many of the pieces.
Next was Abraxas by junior mechanical engineering major Melissa Zucker, junior humanities and arts major Catherine Zheng, and senior architecture major Shanna Chan. Described as “an exploration of the classic female silhouette through abstract mathematical concepts,” Abraxas had a few striking pieces — namely the cut-up black leather dress with huge shoulders and a slight accentuation of the hips, which looked like something straight out of this world. Overall, this collection was a nice sight. 
Imperatrice, by sophomore business major Angela Liang, first-year design major Shannon Lin, and first-year humanities and arts major Hilary Lai, was inspired by Wu Zetian, “the only woman ever to rule China.” This collection played with cute, girly silhouettes, but each piece had a little bit of an edge to it. My favorite of the harder accents were the pyramid accents, placed on the models’ tops in the center of their chests. It was
just enough point to say “I’m coming for you,” but not enough for you to be super nervous about that fact.
Next was Filigree by junior neuroscience major Noa Fineout. Fineout’s collection was a journey for me. At first, I absolutely hated all six of the garments. But when Fineout herself came out to receive her flowers, she was wearing a piece as well, and it all kind of made sense. What I hated about the collection was that it seemed very unfinished and sloppy, but when Fineout came out, with her unsewn sleeves and busting seams, I figured that it was all part of the concept — a deconstruction of these multi-layered, Victorian undergarments. I believe that Fineout’s own garment was the highlight of her collection.
Up next, we had XOAIX, pronounced just like it looks, by senior drama major Becki Liu. This collection, described as a “daydream inspired by the romantic colors of the south of France,” had its good points and its not-so-good points. With the exception of the very first garment — a short dress with a lace neck accent — many of the pieces just didn’t do it for me. They hung a little strangely and didn’t flatter the models’ figures enough to look good, but didn’t break away enough to look very conceptual. This was a miss, in my opinion.
One of the most exciting and innovative lines was Pom by sophomore design majors Emily Mongilio and Lily Fulop. This collection was all “crochet lingerie.” I’ll let that sink in. Blending the “soft, and fun” aspects of yarn work with the “risque and provocative,” Pom was one of the standout collections and took the idea of hooking to a whole new level. This was one of the few collections where the models actually had some fun. Adorned in a rain of pom-pom puffs, two of the models spun around their poms, and this brought a slightly sexy aspect to this already out-there line. Plus, the fits on these bottoms were impressive; as a crocheter myself, I was super impressed with how well the booties were cradled. It was one of the night’s highlight lines.
Next was Decay by first-year drama major Michelle Li. In her description, Li characterizes her collection through the phases of decay the moon experiences. Her collection was earthy and exciting — the first piece was accompanied by antlers. It was a very cool collection, incorporating a lot of late-fall colors and a bomb soundtrack. There were many notable pieces, but the one that I remember best was a huge, fluffy, folded leaf- looking garment which looked at once soft and brittle. Li’s was a very interesting concept, which was executed flawlessly.
Crest, by senior industrial design major Sophie Parrinello, was described as “free-spirited and easy going.” I think that’s a pretty apt description. The fabrics incorporated “traditional Japanese shibori indigo dy[e]ing” techniques, which resulted in a very interesting set of fabrics, which was used all throughout the line. This was the most cohesive line in terms of fabric choices — the indigo fabric and yellow undertones made up each garment — and I’m not sure if that was detrimental or beneficial to this collection as a whole.
Up next was Corpus by junior design major Rachel Chang and junior science and arts major Christine Shen, described as an exploration of “the conflict between vulnerability and protection in human relationships.” Personally, this was one of my least favorite lines. It tried to incorporate some fringy accents and some plastics and whites and beiges, but the overall effect gave me baby’s-first-Halloween-cowboy-costume. It wasn’t quite a success, but I did appreciate some of what they tried to do — the diagonal slit up one of the skirts, for one.
Next was Fukkatsu by sophomore art major Cindy Hsu and sophomore communication design major Sharon Yu. Fukkatsu “means revival in Japanese,” and this collection was pretty lively. With some stunning patterns, the pieces seemed to flow and swim together alongside the Koi fish pictured on nearly each garment. This collection played with geometries and strictness — ranging from sharp shoulder pad wings to slouchy hoods — and I quite enjoyed it.
Exuviae, by senior architecture majors Noopur Suckhlecha, Jenny Wong, and Marnfah Kanjanavanit
was an experience. This was hands-down tied for my favorite collection, and let me tell you why: exoskeletons. “Exuviae are the empty exoskeleton remains...after a skin-shedding process.” This collection featured beautifully crafted plastic accessories which made the relatively simply blue pieces come alive. From a beautiful and realistic spinal cord to some clipped wings, this collection stood out as not only one of the best concepts, but also a great experience. The spinal cord, modeled by model coordinator and fine arts senior, Alex Walker, was the only real reveal of the show; he strutted down the runway and turned around, and I swear, the front row just gasped.
Up next was Erode by sophomore mechanical engineering major Jonathan Lopez, junior design major Zai Aliyu, and sophomore art major Kate Werth. This collection “explores continually changing environments ... through the use of black, white, and an organically manipulated grid structure.” For me, this is a collection that could have benefited from a different order. I think that there was some potential here for a clearer narrative to be told, but I didn’t quite see it in action. Most of the pieces had some bits cut out, in varying depths and revealing various shades of black/gray, and a more coherent sequence might have made this collection stand out more.
Last, but certainly not least, was Sanctum by senior decision science major Sasha Kerbel and senior humanities and arts major Madalyn Gryger. This collection “explores the experience of living with mental illness.” It. was. amazing. Absolutely grand. The soundtrack was completely mood-setting and terrifying, and the second this collection hit the runway, all eyes were glued. This collection featured some intricate beadwork, and nearly all of the models were wearing masks, some more aggressive than others. The first model wore a ripped leather bodysuit and a leather head covering with a ripped cut-out a la Hannibal Lecter. Another model wore a pretty masquerade mask, which I thought was very fitting for the concept, and still another wore a wire mesh face covering, which looked horribly painful. This collection was tied with Exuviae, in my opinion, for overall best collection.
And there you have it! The 20th anniversary of Lunar Gala was quite an experience, and it serves as a stylish reminder of the power of our student community here at Carnegie Mellon..

2016-02-15,CMU,China,"Last week, various events at Carnegie Mellon University and around the Pittsburgh area were held to honor the Chinese Lunar New Year, which fell on Monday, Feb. 8 this year. Major celebrations at Carnegie Mellon included a Chinese New Year Extravaganza, which was featured on Friday, Feb. 5, for Carnegie Mellon’s weekly Late Night series, and Lunar Gala, an annual student-led fashion show that consistently boasts one of the largest attendance rates for a university event, which took place Saturday, Feb. 13. Additionally, in Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill and the Chinese community of the city of Pittsburgh teamed up to host a two week celebration, which featured a Lunar New Year Kick-Off Festival on Feb. 6, as well as an upcoming Year of the Monkey Lunar New Year Parade on Feb. 21, both of which are open to the public.
On Friday, Feb. 5, over 400 people gathered on the first floor of the University Center to attend the festivities at the Chinese New Year Extravaganza. The event was co-hosted by the Chinese Students Association and Late Night at CMU, but included participation from numerous other campus organizations. Various Asian organizations — including AKDPhi, JSA, TSA, HKSA, and SIAM — sold food from their respective cuisines, in addition to providing free dim sum, a type of Asian cuisine. Dance performances were provided by the Carnegie Mellon group Sahara, a Bollywood fusion dance group, and Carnegie Mellon’s K-Pop Dance Club, as well as the University of Pittsburgh’s FRESA. Additionally, there were musical instrument performances and a magic show. The extravaganza also featured various cultural games and activities, which included writing calligraphy, playing Ping Pong, and a pre-extravaganza dumpling-making event.
Cultural elements were weaved throughout the festivities by the presence of lanterns, the use of the Chinese character “Fu,” meaning happiness, and other traditional Chinese decorations, many of which were brought back from China by students over winter break. In terms of Lunar New Year celebrations, the annual extravaganza is the major cultural event open to the Carnegie Mellon community. Although the Lunar Gala fashion show, covered in this week’s Pillbox section, is a prominent campus event that also honors the Chinese New Year, the actual show is not Chinese New Year themed in any way and is instead a fashion show that relies on the creativity of students interested in fashion, design and dance.
“I definitely believe that Chinese New Year Extravaganza is the most important event during the year in terms of really bringing together the Asian and the non-Asian cultures,” said Ximin “Teddy” Ding, a sophomore math major and member of CSA. “Students from all races, countries and backgrounds were writing calligraphy, practicing chopstick and Ping Pong skills, and having a fun time together,” Ding said. “Scenes like this are definitely a big part of our motivation to keep doing the New Year Extravaganza every year.”
Apart from the festivities held at Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh residents traveled to Squirrel Hill where they enjoyed an afternoon of live dance and music performances at the Lunar New Year Kick-Off Festival, which featured the Pittsburgh Steel Dragon acrobatic lion dance team, the Pittsburgh Taiko Drummers, the Organization of Chinese Americans Cultural Youth Dance Ensemble and Tzu Chi Academy, Pittsburgh Chinese School, Silk Elephant Thai dancers, Oom Yung Doe Martial Arts, U.S.A. Pro Karate, and the Yanlai Dance Academy, as well as performances on the guzheng and hulusi, two types of Chinese instruments. The festival also featured arts and crafts such as origami, Chinese astrology coloring, dumpling making, paper lanterns, calligraphy, and painting.
The upcoming Year of the Monkey Lunar New Year Parade will take place on Murray Avenue from 11 a.m. to noon on Feb. 21, and will feature costumes, music, a marching band, and traditional Chinese and Thai dragons. From Feb. 6 to Feb. 21, participating Squirrel Hill restaurants and cafés will also offer a 10 percent discount via the “Passport to Asian Eats” program, as part of the celebration..

2016-02-22,CMU,China,"Generally, both Democrats and Republicans tend to be in favor of free trade to an extent, but multiple people are vying for the opportunity to be the most staunchly protectionist president since Herbert Hoover. Free trade has become an increasingly divisive issue since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) removed trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Trade has become a flash point once again over the past year. Two of our federal trade agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — a trade pact which removes many trade barriers between Pacific Rim nations — and the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank — a federal agency designed to give out loans to American exporters — have become the subject of high-profile congressional battles. This is one of the clearest wedge issues between candidates within each party.
Hillary Clinton, Former Secretary of State
While Secretary of State, Clinton was a champion of the TPP, but has since reversed her position. She also seems to oppose a trade deal between the Obama administration and Europe. Clinton’s stated reason is that the currency manipulation protections that were in the TPP when she was privy to discussions were absent from the newest version of the pact. Clinton was away from the negotiations for some time, and it is quite possible that the problems she had with the deal were not in the version she saw, but it is also possible she changed her position in order to gain union support. Clinton has a very mixed history on free trade. She defended NAFTA and as a senator she generally voted for free trade agreements with the notable exception of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which removed trade barriers with countries in Central America and granted test data exclusivity to drug companies to prevent the creation of generic medications. When running for president in 2008, Clinton strongly opposed free trade, calling NAFTA a mistake. The complications of individual free trade deals are probably in play and Clinton likely has a stance individualized to each one. The evidence says she opposes large free trade deals on a conceptual level, but with the right protections she thinks they can be okay, though Clinton still supports smaller deals.
Clinton is less difficult to gauge on export financing. She condemned Republican Congress members for failing to act on the agency’s expiring charter, saying that the jobs supported by the Ex-Im Bank were at risk.
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)
Sanders has long been a vocal opponent of not just free trade, but trade in general. He denounced the Clinton era Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China as shipping jobs over to a country with lax labor laws and hurting the US economy. He had similar concerns with NAFTA and many other free trade deals. Sanders thinks all free trade deals are designed to benefit corporate America at the expense of American workers and give corporations leverage to simply find a new country to operate in if the labor costs get too high. He thinks that globalization nullifies American labor laws.
Sanders also was the  only non-Republican to oppose the renewal of the charter of the Ex-Im Bank, calling it an “outrageous example of corporate welfare.” He believes the bank’s claim that it helps small business is untrue.
Retired Neurosurgeon Ben Carson
In his book in 2012, Ben Carson said heavy tariffs on assembled goods would help America’s trade imbalance. However, Carson has said that he supports free trade, although he thinks it should go through Congress  given the complexities.
Carson also believes that the Ex-Im Bank is a counterproductive government intervention into the free market.
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)
Cruz supports free trade, but believes that Congress should be able to vet free trade agreements. He refused to pass the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which fast tracked the president’s ability to pass the TPP unless Republican party leadership committed to letting the Ex-Im Bank’s charter expire. The TPA was likely a rebuke of Obama and not free trade.
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Kasich generally supports free trade, but believes there ought be certain limits. His primary issue is that occasionally free trade agreements will allow countries to violate international law and the court challenges take two years while American workers are out of a job. He also plans to focus on currency manipulation, intellectual property, and cyber-attacks when making deals.
Kasich claimed to support the TPP in a Republican debate. However, he has been one of the more vocal opponents of the Ex-Im Bank, saying it is unnecessary corporate welfare that simply exists to fund risky, ventures the market has deemed likely to fail.
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL)
Rubio has openly supported free trade in the past on the basis that U.S. companies get access to larger markets by selling to foreign populations. He also has a consistent record of voting for free trade deals with other countries such as Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Rubio has also supported the TPP on the grounds that it will help the United States strategically in Asia as well as economically, despite the political peril of siding with President Obama as a Republican.
Reality Show Host Donald Trump
Trump has been a vicious critic of free trade. In many Republican debates, Trump has said free trade deals have eroded American jobs. In his 2011 book, Time to Get Tough, Trump said 15 percent tariffs should be imposed on all imported goods and called the South Korean Free Trade Agreement “embarrassing.” He wants to impose heavy tariffs on goods from Mexico and China in particular, saying he was not opposed to a tariff as high as 45 percent. More specifically, he has proposed a 35 percent tariff on cars from Mexico andusing international law to beat back China’s tariffs on American goods and export subsidies. Trump said the tariffs on Mexico would reduce the trade deficit with Mexico and force them into building his wall along the Mexican border in Thursday’s Republican Town Hall on CNN.
Trump has said the United States needs “fair trade” and is a staunchly protectionist candidate. He often says China, Japan, Mexico, and Vietnam are beating America at trade.
Trump probably feels negatively about the Ex-Im Bank given that he believes Chinese export financing is illegal..

2016-02-22,CMU,China,"This week’s topic in Pugwash is instant gratification. In today’s world, we’re constantly connected through our computers, our phones, and even our watches. 
We can talk to people we know or strangers across the world, or dig into the past and a large portion of humanity’s knowledge, all at a moment’s notice. Is this unfettered access allowing us to reach greater heights than ever? Or is it degrading our attention spans and our ability to focus on issues that actually matter?
Our meeting started out with a short video from Louis C.K., a famous comedian. In it, he complains that even though there’s so many awesome things that come from today’s technology, no one really appreciates it. People spend all their time poking at phones and complaining that their connection is slow.
However, as one member pointed out, Louis C.K. is a comedian, not a philosopher. While he makes funny jokes, he isn’t always the most factual or insightful person. Technology has definitely improved quality of life in so many ways for almost everyone in developed countries, even if people do get frustrated over slow internet connections.
Another point brought up throughout the conversation was that people distracted themselves even before there were smartphones or websites like Reddit or 9gag. Instead of reading comics in the newspaper, we now browse cat pictures on Facebook. 
Instead of twiddling our thumbs or spinning a pencil, we now spin our phones or check them for new messages. Boredom is becoming obsolete.
While you might appreciate the idea of getting rid of boredom while waiting for the bus, some research shows that being bored and allowing the mind to wander is an important aspect of creativity. In addition, if relieving boredom with smartphones turns into having a need to constantly use a smartphone, there would seem to be a problem.
It could be that constantly flipping from one stimulus to another is dulling our ability to really drill down and focus on a task at hand. We do have events like hackathons, which show that being able to single-mindedly focus for long periods of time isn’t entirely a lost art, but can hackathon participants really be said to represent society? 
Maybe for some people, concentrating isn’t a problem, but that might not be true for society as a whole. One Pugwash member even compared instant gratification to opium use in China, as something that could be dulling the edge of our entire society without us noticing.
While we didn’t have answers on this particular question, Pugwash agreed that it would be interesting to see data on how well the entire population can concentrate today versus twenty, fifty, or a hundred years ago.
On the other hand, having instant access to information can make it easier to get invested in a project, as small problems can be more easily overcome, allowing you to keep working on something without getting stuck.
As far as human interactions go, there was a split between those who thought online interactions and instant messaging were just as healthy as in-person interactions, and those who were worried that something was being lost. Even if something is being lost by having conversations over the internet, was it really worth everything that’s being gained? Instead of having in-person conversations end when a fact can’t be remembered or agreed upon, people can look things up and continue. And long-distance communications are entirely positive, as they’re replacing not having any communications at all.
Finally, Pugwash wondered if perhaps the problem with instant gratification is just youths being youths. Younger people have always been seen as flighty or lacking concentration by older generations, and time has different values at different points in one’s life. Every small portion of time means more to people when they’re young. 
One year as a 20 year old is 5 percent of your life, whereas one year as a 50 year old is 2 percent. Life is more chaotic as well, as we’re uprooted from elementary school to middle school to high school to college. Perhaps when people settle down and have a longer perspective, the instant gratification will have less of an immediate draw.
Instant gratification is a large topic that affects us all, and Pugwash doesn’t have all the answers. Whenever you choose to browse Reddit, Facebook, or the like instead of working on that project due next week, you’re choosing the instant gratification of cat pics over a long-term goal. Maybe this is putting society on a downhill slope, or maybe it’s just a side-effect of modern life as a millennial.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on instant gratification..

2016-03-28,CMU,China,"According to John Carson, the Head of the School of Art, “the unpredictability of the MFA program at CMU is one of its strengths and joys.” This was certainly true of “Self-Driving Car,” the CMU 2016 MFA Thesis Exhibition. As the culmination of three years of study and experimentation, “Self-Driving Car” simultaneously shows us a snapshot of the artists’ long, arduous process while giving us a glimpse of their future trajectory. The diversity of themes tackled by these seven MFA seniors was superseded only by the diversity in the materials used to convey their ideas. From immigrant displacement to the history of technology, from french fries to bondage props, “Self-Driving Car” explores the entire gamut of the human experience.
The most visually engaging piece in the show was an installation by Tucker Marder, a graduate art major. Occupying the largest space in the gallery, Shark Shapes, a mixed media installation using foam shark toys, Bloodstream Top Predator Chum, nylon dock line, and fish food was a treat for the eyes (but not so much for the nose) with its striking colors and quirky shapes. The piece consisted of many brightly colored and exuberantly shaped shark toys balanced on various platforms or pedestals, or in one case hung from the ceiling using a vivid red rope. There was one important detail. Each of the foam toys had been chewed by a shark, as evidenced by the teeth marks. On the wall were hung photos of the sharks mauling the toys, the frames covered in fish food.
Shark Shapes continues Tucker Marder’s exploration of ""a more symbiotic relationship between humans and the planet,"" through an ""environmental ethic that promotes optimism and engagement rather than depression and paralysis,"" in the words of the artist. The juxtaposition of these whimsical colors and shapes with an animal commonly used in pop culture as a symbol of mass terror brings out the inherent humor in our natural environment. Also, balancing the chewed up foam toys on buckets of shark bait, or in one case a giant globe of chum (hence the smell), brought home the delicate balance between human control over our environment and nature’s inherent responses. But ultimately, the appeal of this piece was the visual magnetism it exuded. The balance and precision with which the colors and shapes were positioned and lighted gave it a sweeping grace, a presence large enough to fill the entire space despite the relatively small size of its individual components.
Almost as striking was graduate art major Zhiwan Cheung’s sculptural and video installation The Impossibility of Home. As the name suggests, this piece, in the words of the artist, probes the idea of an ""odyssey towards a home that does not exist, a rite of passage with no destination."" To represent this search with no end he chose banana trees and Chinatown orange. The former is a species whose history of dispersion and domestication is so complex that its origins are shrouded in a veil of mystery, while the latter is the name of a specific hue of orange that has no recorded root in history. Chinatown orange doesn’t in fact have any root in the cultural landscape of chinatowns. Both of these combine to convey the artist’s search for a lost origin, an absent explanation.
The Impossibility of Home was a mini plantation of bright orange colored banana trees, Chinatown orange to be exact. No, there was nothing subtle in the execution of the concept. However, the orange trees and the dramatic lighting combined to form and immersive environment that was very enjoyable to experience. Also, the ridiculous, over the top aesthetic of the piece highlighted the ridiculousness of our mental associations of unrelated constructs as well as our inherent drive for answers and explanations that don’t exist. The piece sounds great, right? It was, until the videos started playing. The videos showed us clips of banana plantations and forests. Some had the fake orange banana trees in them juxtaposed with the natural surroundings. Some clips even had the artist wandering around a plantation in an orange onesie. The entire time, there was a narrator’s voice giving us the history of the banana as well as Chinatown orange in a tone obviously meant to evoke nostalgia, despite only succeeding in evoking memories of Discovery channel documentaries. This overt explanation of the “message” of the art removed all the nuance from the piece, making it seem like a parody of itself.
Right beside Zhiwan’s piece, the viewer is confronted by a barrage of color. In his Love Letters to Wendy, graduate art major Dan Allende explores the absolute depths of our food chain: junk food. Using the male belly, the essential characteristic of the ‘dad bod,’ as his muse, he made plaster casts of his own belly, transforming them into vibrant masks. He then made six giant collages of all sorts of colorful household debris, play-doh, pipe cleaners, flower petals, and orange peel. In the center, fenced off by ropes of Cheetos strung together, were placed three contraptions of various heights, each dangling a french fry suspended by string, each spinning at a different rate. The massive collages, the multitudinous masks, and the spinning french fries all combined to form a time travel device, shooting us back into those distant reaches of our childhood when indulgence wasn’t a sin punishable by contempt and our body wasn’t an item in a silent auction.
Probably the most traditional exhibit in the show are graduate art major Ada-Scarlett Hopper’s pieces Movement | Flow :: Bound | Free and Pas de Deux, dependency. Primarily a sculptor, Ada uses the medium of photography to convey the idea of the body as sculpture. In Pas de Deux, dependency, using her experience as both a ballet dancer and a dominatrix, Ada explores the idea of systems of control that can exist between two people, and the flow of control from one to the other. Designed in a symmetrical manner, this piece is a stunning series of sixteen self portraits, eight with her ballet partner, eight with her BDSM partner. The photos all convey the sense of action and motion that is normally associated with these activities. By freezing them, we free ourselves from the notion of gesture, a concept inherent to the time dimension, and are able to consider the bodies as merely three dimensional sculptural objects.
The self portraits are arranged in a line and halfway down the line we switch, almost imperceptibly, from one set of self portraits to the other. On all the photos, she has overlaid white tape to capture lines in the physical forms of their bodies, in particular lines that directly influence her freedom of movement. By doing so, Ada has materialized the invisible matrix of control that surrounds and influences her, a matrix that she is, however, also able to influence.
“I like rules,” Ada said on Thursday night at the open critique of her work, held in the gallery. That is something clearly visible in her work: sixteen self portraits on a black background, mounted on white, framed in black with white tape, all the same size, hung in a row, lit by a row of purple spotlights. We see an obsession with structure, boundaries, formal systems, control. “If we view BDSM from a wide angle lens, it’s just bodies in space,” Ada said. And this was very much the focus of the exhibit, the similarities between the seemingly disparate disciplines of ballet and BDSM, the same exchange in control, the same trust and the same juxtaposition between pleasure and pain, maybe even pleasure through pain. After all, “pointe shoes are foot bondage.”
Her self portrait triptych Movement | Flow :: Bound | Free, explores similar ideas of motion and control, this time using the “spotting technique” that helps a ballet dancer pirouette, without getting dizzy. This technique requires the dancer to keep their head and neck stabilized in space, gazing at a particular spot in the audience before spinning, and turning their head at the last second. For the piece, Ada tied a bondage collar around her neck, attaching the collar to opposing walls of the ballet studio. She then proceeded to pirouette as far as she could with her neck physically held in place, taking photos of herself in the process. In her own words, this was the “invisible bondage of dancers made visible.” Her work may be traditional in form, but it is inventive in content. Daring, yet not attention seeking. It is an unlikely but insightful fusion of a sculptor’s aesthetic with a photographer’s process.
These were just four of the seven installations at the Miller Gallery. The exhibit will continue to be on display until April 10. A particularly good night to visit the gallery will be Thursday, March 31 when, starting at 6:30 p.m., the works of Dan Allende, Tucker Marder, and Jesse Kauppila will undergo a critique open to the public. Eric Shiner, Executive Director of the Andy Warhol Museum, will be the guest critic. Other dates to mark in your calendars are March 31 and April 7 at noon when Dan Allende will be conducting a workshop on mask making and belly dancing..

2016-03-28,CMU,China,"In the endless cycle that is presidential election news, we hear a lot about businessman Donald Trump and his promises for better deals. Deals with Mexico, China, you name it, Trump will make a deal with it. A great deal. You’ll see.
In the arena of current presidential news however, the congressional leaders of the GOP are faced with another deal that has a lasting effect on our nation, more than a four-year term. Obama has appointed a nominee to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court: Merrick Brian Garland. 
Obama announced his appointment last week in a clear statement to Congress: “I’ve done my job, now you do yours.” 
As per his constitutional duty, the president has appointed a justice to fill the vacancy, and the Senate will hold hearings and vote to confirm the nominee, right? Wrong. Cue the obfuscation!
In their attempt to continually be the most unproductive Congress ever, GOP Senate leaders previously stated that they would consider no nominees until after the election. “Give the American people a voice!” they cried. “Let the next President choose the justice!” They invoke such “rules” as the Thurmond rule  and Biden rule, which are both myths conjured by opponents of previous nominees. 
Many, like Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL) and Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX), say that precedent mandates not nominating and confirming justices in an election year. If you say it loud enough, it sounds true! Except for the fact that these claims are completely false. Pants on fire. 
But let’s really dig into all the hypocrisies of their argument, shall we?
First, let us address all this populist rhetoric. I get that GOP establishment incumbents are trying to sound like they want the people to choose. Let the people decide like our founding fathers intended. It’s a reasonable political ploy, especially when trying to save their seats with a fascist bag of Cheetos as the potential nominee. 
Except for that the people did choose; we chose Obama, twice. Now if some of the GOP wants to claim that the 2014 Midterm elections is a sample for the people, then they should tell that to the 66 percent of our country that did not vote in them. 
It’s simple: the voters wanted a Democrat (as they have in the last five of six general elections) in the Whit House, so he will be appointing the judges until he’s out. No more discussion.
Now, don’t get me wrong, Democrats are also at fault for holding up Supreme Court justices. In 2005, during Samuel Alito’s hearings to be on the Court, then Senator Obama (D–IL) and Senator Clinton (D–NY) voted with 22 other prominent Democrats to filibuster the entire nomination process. Only four Democrats even voted for Alito to confirm him. It has become increasingly difficult to keep the Supreme Court above politics, as it was intended. 
Still, in Alito’s case, the Democrats saw him as a more extreme conservative ideologically, and would perhaps have been more willing to support a consensus nominee, a moderate that most of the Senate could get behind. 
Keep in mind many Republican leaders have called Merrick Garland a “consensus nominee” (Orrin Hatch (R-UT), senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee) in his previous hearings to be confirmed to the D.C. District Court of Appeals, where he has served since 1997. But we’ll come back to Garland later.
Let’s move right along on to the so-called rules. For a party hell-bent on preserving the “original intent” of the constitution, it sure is flexible on the definition of “rule.” The “Thurmond rule”  contends that the Senate will not confirm nominees to the judiciary after a certain point in an election year. 
Named after former Senator Strom Thurmond (R–SC), the rule originated in the 1968 fights over Lyndon Johnson’s Supreme Court nominations, which Thurmond on. 
Since then, this partisan suggestion has only been used when politically advantageous to the party trying to block the nominee. And yes, both parties have used it since 1968. But other than when the nominees were blocked in 1968, no one treats it as a rule. It is the Thurmond Myth.
The “Biden Rule” is named after then Senator and current Vice President Joe Biden (D–DE). This rule, as it is often called, actually is more of a suggestion taken from a speech that Biden gave as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1992. He called for no nominees to be considered until after the election, during the lame-duck period before the next President takes office. (Quick side note, Republicans. Stop calling Obama a lame-duck President. That’s not until after the election.) 
But still, Biden’s actual comments are usually glossed over with no context. He gave this speech with no nominee to consider and no vacancy to fill. He had been concerned with the growing partisan divide over judicial hearings, as Clarence Thomas’ divisive hearings had been in October of the previous year. 
Even so, the Senate never voted on his suggestion, and now the GOP is using it as a lame excuse to block the nominee while giving Biden some respect for maybe the first time ever. Had enough yet? Good, me neither.
This brings me to the last Republican bastion of argument: precedent. Justice Scalia spent his career as a direct interpreter of the Constitution. He contributed a strong conservative voice to the Court for many years. Still, Republican leaders tarnish his legacy by forging fake precedents to reject anything Obama suggests. 
As previously mentioned, Cruz and Rubio have proudly stated the “long tradition” of not nominating and confirming justices in an election year. 
Those few words are the tricky part, though. See, the thing about precedent is, you need a real set of several instances from the past to back up that “long tradition.” There has really only been two instances in the past 80 years when this situation has even happened at all. In 1940, when F.D.R. appointed Justice Frank Murphy and was confirmed, and in 1968. 
That last one sound familiar? It should, because it is when Thurmond refused to confirm any Johnson nominee. This is the only instance that holds to that model because of the phrasing of their comments. Cruz specified nominated and confirmed, which disqualifies those nominated before the election year but confirmed during one, of which current Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is one, who was nominated in 1987, and confirmed in 1988. There is no tradition of preventing nominees, only a hunger for preventing Obama any victory toward preserving his legacy.
Now, back to Garland. GOP leaders, the only people that will buy your arguments are the ones already voting for you, so why do you stall? Garland is for all intents and purposes left leaning, far more to the left of the center than Justice Kennedy is.
Still, Obama has given you the most moderate candidate 
 his party would allow. Many are still upset he did not appoint someone more liberal. Garland leans conservative on criminal cases and has a mixed record on government transparency. On an even more basic level, he is is an older, white male. 
He is incredibly qualified to be on the Supreme Court. He clerked for Justice William Brennan in the 1970s, served as a federal prosecutor for the Oklahoma City bombings in 1992, and has served on the D.C. Court of Appeals since 1997, and as its Chief Justice since 2013.
What are your options? Let’s say you manage to delay until the next President takes office. Hillary gets elected, and nominates someone more liberal, with a newly gained Democratic Senate? Or, god-forbid, Trump gets elected, and he could nominate anyone. Maybe he’ll go Caligula on you and nominate his pet horse. Is that really what you’d prefer?
My point is, if the GOP really wants to improve its general election chances, it needs to take this bargain deal now while it can; there won’t be one better. They should show the people they talk incessantly about that they can make a compromise. 
Stop the obstruction. Confirm Garland..

2016-04-11,CMU,China,"New material turns water to steam without boiling
Researchers have created an extremely black material that can turn water to steam without boiling. The material, a deep black color that reflects little visible light, is made up of “nanopores,” gold nanoparticles affixed to a scaffold pocked with tiny channels. On April 8, the researchers reported in Science Advances that the material is 99 percent efficient at absorbing light in the visible spectrum and parts of the infrared spectrum.
The material floats on the surface of water due to its high porosity, allowing it to naturally soak up sunlight. The electrons on the surface of a gold nanoparticle in the nanopore are excited when hit with a certain wavelength of light, and they oscillate back and forth. These oscillations, known as plasmons, create localized heating, which vaporizes the water nearby.

Fresh fruit intake reduces risk of adult heart attacks
According to new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, people who eat fresh fruit daily are at a lower risk of heart attack and stroke than people who do not. 
Researchers from the University of Oxford and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences conducted a survey of half a million adults in urban and rural areas of China who had no prior cardiovascular diseases or anti-hypertensive treatments.
The researchers monitored fruit intake (mainly apples or oranges) and health for seven years. The study found that fruit intake was strongly associated with other factors, such as education, lower blood glucose, lower blood pressure, and not smoking. The study also found that fruit intake alone was associated with about one-third less cardiovascular mortality in both men and women from different areas of China.

Curiosity shown to be masochistic biological drive
New research published in Psychological Science shows that people will choose potentially painful outcomes with no obvious benefits just to satisfy their curiosity. 
“Just as curiosity drove Pandora to open the box despite being warned of its pernicious contents, curiosity can lure humans  — like you and me — to seek information with predictably ominous consequences,” said study author Bowen Ruan of the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Researchers designed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that people are willing to resolve uncertainty even if it brings them pain. In one study, 54 college students were given various types of pens that deliver electric shocks when clicked. Participants who were unsure of whether the pen would give an electric shock were more likely to click the pen to find out than participants who knew prior.

Record-setting supermassive black hole discovered
The discovery of a near-record supermassive black hole in a local galaxy has prompted researchers to think that supermassive black holes may be more common than originally thought, according to University of California, Berkeley astronomers. 
The supermassive black hole is around the size of 17 billion suns, and located in a galaxy known as NCG 1600. Images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that the center of NGC 1600 is unusually faint, indicating a lack of stars close to the black hole, meaning that the galaxy is, therefore, massive. The researchers reported the discovery of the black hole, located about 200 million light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Eridanus, in the April 6 issue of the journal Nature.

Chinese farmers help bees, hand-pollinate flowers
As a result of the worldwide decline in bee population, farm workers in Hanyuan county, in China’s Sichuan province, are pollinating flowers by hand.  The county, known as the “world’s pear capital,” has seen drastic reduction in fruit crop as a result of pesticides reducing bee populations.
Farm workers transfer pollen from male to female flowers to artificially fertilize them. Photographer Kevin Frayer captured images of the workers pollinating the plants, saying, “On the one hand it’s a story about the human toll on the environment, while on the other it shows our ability to be more efficient in spite of it all. It is entirely possible than in our lifetime this practice could become the norm all over the world.” Bees are crucial not only to our ecosystems, but also to a heavy majority of our produce.

SpaceX lands reusable rocket on ocean platform
After four failed attempts, SpaceX has successfully landed a reusable rocket on an ocean platform off the coast of Florida.
The rocket, called Falcon 9, was returning to Earth after delivering an inflatable habitat built by Nevada company Bigelow Aerospace that will attach to the International Space Station for a two-year test. After the cargo was delivered, the main-stage booster of the rocket separated and landed on a floating platform called a drone ship.
“The rocket landed instead of putting a hole in the ship — or tipping over — so we’re really excited about that,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk told reporters in Florida. This is the first cargo run NASA has made with SpaceX since their rocket exploded after launch in June 2015.

2016-04-11,CMU,China,"This past weekend Carnegie Mellon hosted the fifth annual CMU Summit on US-China Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Since 2012 the Summit has“attracted over 3,000 participants and 100 industry leaders” to campus to discuss the latest advances and challenges for people working in technical fields. The Summit is a massive event that works to bring students and industry leaders from all across the U.S. and China together for a schedule packed with speeches, discussions, and networking events.
This year’s Summit was broken down into five major topics, each featuring a keynote speech in the morning followed by a panel discussion and question-and-answer session. The five pillars of the event were finance, high technology, energy and sustainability, innovation and entrepreneurship, and start-ups. Energy and sustainability, finance, and innovation and entrepreneurship are regular topics for the conference, having been discussed in previous years. Meanwhile, the focus on high technology, specifically the power of artificial intelligence (AI), and start-ups were new, reflecting new trends in the ever-changing field of technology.
The weekend was opened and closed by five distinguished keynote speakers. Carnegie Mellon professors Terrence J. Collins and Tuomas Sandholm joined entrepreneurs Feng Li, Ning Yang, and Bo Tao in shaping the discussions dozens of panelists and hundreds of attendees would have over the weekend.
The first topic, finance, sparked lively discussion about the future of financial technology, or “fintech.” Deregulation was the word of the hour, with panelists weighing in to a packed auditorium on how fintech can facilitate free global trade with minimal regulation. The question-and-answer session followed a similar theme. Panelists fielded questions about the effect of the 2008 Great Recession on the fintech industry and how future regulation might change the landscape. The panelists pointed out that fintech had grown ever more important since 2008 as traditional banks were restricted by regulations but new, technology – based enterprises remained relatively deregulated and free. Tone Vays, panelist and head of research at BraveNewCoin, said that recent threats to regulate the industry, particularly from presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, “may be the best thing that’s ever happened to the industry” because fintech is by nature impossible to regulate, and the more people try to accomplish this the clearer that will become to consumers. When asked to look into the future of fintech, panelist and Carnegie Mellon professor Timothy X. Brown summed it up best, saying the future will be a process of “evolution, not revolution.”
High technology was up next, with the program promising “insights on the cutting-edge issues in Artificial Intelligence.” The panel wrestled with the fundamental questions of the AI industry such as what AI is, what problems it should try to solve, and how it will change our lives. Some panelists advocated for AI that melds with the arts, envisioning technology that facilitates creation and eliminates mental drudgery so people have more time to spend on creativity and entertainment. Others saw AI technology in a more scientific context as a tool to personalize healthcare, remove inefficiencies, and produce and analyze theories the human mind cannot grasp.
The final panel on Saturday focused on energy and sustainability. This panel was the most technical, specific, and down to earth of the three, addressing the opportunities and challenges the industry faces from government policy, changes in prices of oil and natural gas, and consumer interests. One panelist summed up the mood of the discussion, saying, “we’re moving the needle, but not fast enough.” The governments in both the U.S. and particularly China are pushing for clean energy by providing incentives to the private sector to invest, but these steps are tempered by economic concerns. Consumers are beginning to invest in sustainable products, but many remain apathetic about the issue. Finally, technological developments like smart meters, meters that provide information on how much energy a particular household or area is using, have helped create an energy supply system more conducive to clean power, but there is still a lot more progress needed on issues like energy storage.
The Sunday panels provided platforms for industry leaders to discuss and give advise on how to navigate technological fields. The start-up panel brought entrepreneurs from a variety of start-ups together to give advice on getting ideas off the ground and turning a concept into a company. According to the program, the innovation and entrepreneurship panel is “dedicated to creating a platform for prestigious investors and entrepreneurs from both China and the U.S. to network, share experiences, and exchange ideas” and to “promote a bilateral dialogue and cooperation between the two countries.” This year the panel spotlighted the robotics industry.
The Summit also invited attendees to take an active role. There were networking sessions after every panel discussion, and the New Venture Competition asked teams of student entrepreneurs to create start-up solutions to real world problems. The competition was judged based on real world feasibility and likelihood of economic success and offered a $15,000 cash prize to the winning team.
The entire event offered invaluable opportunities to technology-focused students in terms of information, experience, and connections..

2016-04-11,CMU,China,"Last Sunday, April 3, a trail derailment in Philadelphia killed two construction workers and injured thirty-five people. Just a month ago, a train derailment in Kansas injured thirty-two. In 2015, another Philadelphia derailment killed eight and injured over two hundred, the deadliest train accident in the region in nearly thirty years.
Let’s face it: America has a transportation infrastructure problem, and it’s getting costly and dangerous. 
Once known for our innovative, state-of-the-art highways and railways, our country now lags behind much of the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to public investments in transportation. We’re losing money, and lives, because we lack the collective will to tackle our infrastructure head-on with meaningful and decisive action.
While many advanced nations are pushing to update their infrastructure, the United States is falling behind. In less than a decade, the United States fell from 7th in the World Economic Forum’s rankings of international road quality to 18th.
When considering infrastructure holistically, the World Economic Forum ranks the United States even worse: 25th. China ranked lower, yet it is moving up, while the United States continues to fall down. China spends 9 percent of its GDP on improving infrastructure compared to the 2.4 percent of GDP that the United States spends for that purpose.
This lack of public investment is reflected by sobering statistics. 65 percent of American roads are in poor condition, and 25 percent of America’s bridges urgently require repair or handle more traffic than they were designed to handle. Here in the City of Bridges, 20 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient, including the all-powerful Liberty Bridge.
The United States ranks 18th in the world for the quality of our railroads and just 30th in the world for the quality of our air transport. Meanwhile, nearly half of Americans lack stable access to any transit at all.
Having such poor infrastructure has fiscal and physical consequences. Americans spend 5.5 billion hours in traffic every year, resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars in lost productivity and increased fuel costs. In 2020, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that poor infrastructure will cost $1 trillion in business sales, endangering 3.5 million jobs and costing the GDP $3.1 trillion between 2012 and 2020. Historically, huge public investments in infrastructure, such as the transcontinental railroad and the Interstate Highway System, have corresponded with periods of unbridled economic growth and productivity. In our current case the converse is true: failing to invest in infrastructure has suffocated our economy.
More importantly, the New York Times estimates that more than 14,000 transportation deaths are caused by poor infrastructure every year. 
Train derailments are a perfect example. Many derailment deaths, including the deaths in both of the above Philadelphia derailments, could have been prevented had those railroads been retrofitted with a technology called Positive Train Control. 
It is a moral failing to allow so many transportation-related deaths that could be prevented by greater investments in infrastructure.
It’s time to get over our infrastructure problem by committing to a massive infrastructure spending program over the next decade. It’s time to bid farewell to train derailments and traffic jams, and time to greet a new American century marked by the innovation, economic growth, and security that enhanced infrastructure can help provide..

2016-04-25,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama is a playground of old styles and fresh experiments, and The Plague in Venice was a bit of both. Directed by guest Sasha Iliev, and based on a story by Flaminio Scalia, The Plague in Venice premiered on the Chosky stage this month as a spectacular reimagining of a 400-year-old form of Italian theatre. The Plague in Venice, a comedy about a plague that killed a quarter of Venice’s population in the late 16th century, has everything characteristic of Commedia dell’arte: exaggerated archetypal characters, improvisation, and satire on politics and human nature. But this background information, while useful in retrospect, was hardly necessary for me to enjoy this bizarre but wonderful show.   
The set and costume designers behind the scenes deserve the loudest shout-out. Everything in this fictionalized Venice was visually stunning, from dreamy wrought iron bridges over canals, to an enormous, black lace-bordered moon that really did hit my eye like a big pizza pie. Fixed throughout the show with few moving parts, the set was not complicated, but elegant. 
The costumes were far more extravagant, often wearing the actors more than vice versa. They perfectly emphasized character types like The Alchemist with his galoshes and large clusters of boils, the greedy Pantalone with his gold-trimmed hammer pants, and The Lover with a tulip-bud skirt reminiscent of a particular part of the female anatomy. The play’s two most threateningly named characters — Plague and Death — got two of the coolest outfits. Plague was queenly in her hot lava-like flowing body suit, while Death (played by Junior Drama Major Clay Singer) was more towering puppet than costume, floating menacingly across the stage and grasping up victims with its skeletal metal hands. Even Plague’s squad of rats were alluring, with fur like gossamer rags and red glowing eyes. I could’ve sat through two hours of The Plague in Venice with my hearing turned off, and the sight of it alone would have conquered my attention. 
Admittedly, the play packed more of a visual than a comedic punch. Its crude slapstick and stock cast of over-the-top characters, classic to a style of theatre several centuries old, is not too compatible with your average millennial’s ironic, postmodern brand of humor. The lines that won the most laughs were oddly placed yet refreshing references to the contemporary, such as the song lyrics each character would quote when Death asked for their “last words” — everything from “Bohemian Rhapsody” to “Highway to Hell.” I was also tickled by the running joke that one of Plague’s rats — Mickey — is a troublemaker with a big mouth and a high-pitched jolly laugh. But even if this comedy didn’t exactly put the audience in hysterics, I often found myself grinning at the sheer absurdity of the spectacle.  
The spectacle would not have been nearly as effective without the talents of its cast. Senior Drama Major Caroline Pluta dominated the stage as Plague, whose poise and malicious delight never let the show’s premise — and its title — become lost in the chaos. Franceschina (played by Senior Drama Major Kelsey Tarantino) was an interesting, stereotypically masculine twist on a very trope-y role. Instead of sighing and weeping in the name of love, this Lover weaponizes her own stench and dodges marriage to seek the amorous activity she really wants. The show’s most entertaining character was The Alchemist (played by Senior Drama Major Colin Whitney), perhaps because he strayed most often into contemporary territory, fumbling with “spill-proof” flasks and reading off a laundry list of side-effects for a plague antidote that include erectile hyper-function.  As an ensemble, the cast effectively highlighted human silliness in continuing to seek out sex and material wealth even during a time when everyone around you is literally dropping like flies. 
It’s impossible to know how much of the show I saw on Friday night was improvised, as one of the tenets of commedia dell’arte is unpredictability. Paired with outstanding — and obviously professional — visual design, the show’s comparatively less polished performances gave off an impression of charm and balance. The Plague in Venice wasn’t intimidating, despite its brilliant artistry, because the performers did not take themselves or the satire too seriously. When the bows came and the cast broke into a final cheerful song, I found myself wishing I knew the words to sing along, so we could better revel in the ridiculousness together..

2016-08-19,CMU,China,"With the end of summer comes the end of one of summer’s greatest traditions — man-made explosions in the sky. 
Whether it’s for baseball games, the Fourth of July, amusement parks, or personal pleasure, fireworks are a prevalent part of summer. But how exactly do pyrotechnists create all those colors and shapes in the middle of the night sky?
The discovery of fireworks can be traced back to the discovery of gunpowder, which occurred around 2,000 years ago in China. It is hypothesized that a cook accidentally mixed together and heated potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur to produce a black, flakey powder. When this powder was inserted into a bamboo shoot and tossed in a fire, the pressure inside the shoot from the gases of combustion caused the shoot to blast apart. 
Aside from replacing the bamboo shoot with a paper tube and adding a fuse, our modern definition of a firecracker hasn’t really changed. Sometimes, aluminum is added to the powder to create a brighter explosion.
Over time, another fun, handheld pyrotechnic soon emerged — the sparkler. Sparklers consist of a thin metal wire dipped in sparkler composition and left to dry. Sparkler composition typically contains a metallic fuel, an oxidizer, iron or steel powder, and a combustion binder to hold it all together. Adding certain pyrotechnic colorants also produces different colored sparks — strontium for red, calcium for orange, sodium for yellow, barium for green, and copper for blue.
The sparkler is lit from one end and burns for several minutes, depending on the length. Since all the chemicals are proportioned in a sparkler, the sparkler burns much more slowly than a firecracker.
However, we can all agree that the ultimate pyrotechnic is the firework. Aerial fireworks are found in the form of a shell consisting of a cylindrical paper container, various shapes of a sparkler-like composition known collectively as stars, a bursting charge at the center of the shell, and a fuse.
A mortar — usually a short, steel pipe — launches the shell into the air using the resulting explosion of a lifting charge inside the pipe. The lifting charge also lights the shell’s fuse, and depending on the length of the fuse, the bursting charge is ignited at a specific altitude and the shell explodes. 
As the shell explodes, the outsides of the stars in the shell are also ignited, causing a bright shower of sparks. Since the stars are thrown in multiple directions via the shell’s explosion, the shower of sparks forms a huge sphere of sparkling light — the most basic firework shape.
Shells can also ignite in multiple phases, known as multibreak shells. These can be shells within shells, or shells with multiple sections that are broken apart using break charges. These shells can contain stars with differing colors or compositions to create different lighting and sparkle effects.
But if all fireworks were spherical, the displays wouldn’t have as much pizzazz as they currently do. The shape of the firework largely depends on the shape of the shell and the arrangement of the stars. 
To create any two-dimensional figure, the stars must be placed in pellets and arranged in an outline of the figure in the shell. The pellets are surrounded by break charges to separate them simultaneously from the shell and contain explosive charges to propel the stars outward in a blown-up form of the figure.
Pyrotechnists have standardized many of the popular shaped fireworks. To name a few, palm fireworks contain charges in the shape of a solid cylinder that travel outward before exploding, then curl downwards after exploding to form the limbs of a palm tree. Willow fireworks (my personal favorite) contain stars with a higher composition of charcoal to make the sparkles burn longer so when the stars fall they form the shape of a willow tree.
Pyrotechnists are pushing the limit of what shapes and colors can be achieved with fireworks with every show, leading to an increasingly enjoyable viewing experience..

2016-08-19,CMU,China,"Manufacturing has always been a mainstay in American politics. The reasons politicians love manufacturing are obvious. Manufacturing jobs used to be broadly unionized and tended to pay well with some benefits all without requiring a college degree like many similarly paying jobs do. This made the factories highly favorable due to the boost they provided to the economic well-being of families who might otherwise struggle. Furthermore, manufacturing the products themselves is far more expensive than shipping them, so politicians could reliably push for manufacturers to get all sorts of goodies for bringing manufacturing to their districts, which in turn made the politicians' constituents happy.
Manufacturing’s role in the economy, however, is a different story. From the 1960s until recently, manufacturing has been steadily becoming a smaller and smaller part of the American economy. After the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the 2000-01 recession, American manufacturing took a particularly big blow. Manufacturing jobs have been in decline even despite the recent uptick in the number of factories around the nation. To make things worse, American workers became less central to the value of manufacturing due to outsourcing and automation. As a result, manufacturing unions have weakened and manufacturing jobs now make less money than service sector jobs. The average manufacturing worker makes $20.47 per hour compared to the average service sector worker’s $21.37 per hour. The decline in the number and value of manufacturing jobs has taken the legitimacy out of some politicians’ favorite talking points.
Politicians won't let the reality of the situation stop them, however; and manufacturing talk isn’t going away on the campaign trail. Both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton have dedicated plenty of energy to this topic at campaign events. The new reasons for going back to the manufacturing well for political fodder are distressing. The decline of American manufacturing has hit older workers without college degrees particularly hard, and their economic anxiety is easy for politicians to take advantage of. Talking about bringing back manufacturing garners political support from this vulnerable population without offering real solutions. In addition, the rhetoric of manufacturing jobs being “moved” overseas, or countries having “stolen” jobs from Americans makes for very easy scapegoats and easier applause lines for politicians.
With all of the focus on manufacturing, the idea that manufacturing is the core of the American identity and the American economy is not going away. That said, both prongs of this idea are probably not true. 
Jobs that pay someone enough to live and that don’t require a college degree are a big part of the American Dream, but those jobs don’t necessarily have to be manufacturing. The prominence of unions in manufacturing is what caused factory jobs to be a path to the middle class without requiring a degree. As unions are weakening, manufacturing no longer even fits that bill.
The economy might even be better off if we stopped focusing so much on manufacturing. Take Hon Hai, most commonly known as Foxconn, one of the largest manufacturing companies. Hon Hai’s revenue is about 70 percent of Apple’s and about 190% of Microsoft’s. However, their profits are less than 10 percent of Apple’s and less than 30 percent of Microsoft’s. Simply put, manufacturing companies’s profit margins are quite slim even when they produce high value products such as electronics. As a result, manufacturing jobs are not paying well enough to help stimulate the economy by helping people have money to spend, and manufacturing companies also have profit margins too slim to help infuse money into the economy. This then drives the problem with pay because workers are another expense that has to be slashed when money gets tight. This is bad for the economy as a whole.
With manufacturing seemingly offering nothing to anyone, it’s time politicians turned their focus to our continuously growing service sector. Since no political blood is spilled over the service sector, it’s generally vilified as a continuous churn of low-paying jobs, but it doesn’t have to be. There are a number of ideas floating around to improve the quality of service sector jobs such as unionization. New technologies and better management increase the productivity of individual workers which often gets that position a raise. These are areas the government could potentially be able to help. These are the policies that need to start making the cut when it comes to jobs plans. Current political rhetoric would be well placed in the 1940s, but we don’t live there anymore. Manufacturing can’t absorb so much of our economic energy that we ignore the economy we have now.
When people run for office, the things they say matter. Candidates need to stop making promises to reverse major trends in the global economy — this is not something that the government can do. This focus also leads politicians to make bad decisions which just end up weakening our economy and the quality of life of the people participating in it. Politicians have to work with our current economic reality. The service sector jobs that are impossible to outsource or automate have stayed, and we have to shift our focus to making those jobs compensate workers better. Living in the past makes for some nice political rhetoric but it is no way to shepherd an economy..

2016-09-12,CMU,China,"Carnegie Mellon University and China’s Tsinghua University renew dual-degree masters program in computer science
It was recently announced that Carnegie Mellon University renewed its deal with Tsinghua University in China to offer students at both universities the chance to learn computer science from faculty at the top-ranked computer science programs in both the United States and China. This program will allow students to receive degrees from both universities.
Both Carnegie Mellon and Tsinghua University are striving to have this newer dual-degree program be accessible to more students in China and in other countries. The renewed program will also eliminate the previous version’s thesis requirement.
Present at the signing of the agreement was Jianping Wu, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of Tsinghua’s Computer Science Department. Also present were Wenwu Zhu, professor and deputy head of Tsinghua’s Computer Science Department, and Jun Zhu, associate professor of computer science at Tsinghua and an adjunct faculty member of Carnegie Mellon’s Machine Learning Department.
“This will be a great opportunity for students who want to maintain strong ties with China, but also seek the advantages that come with credentials from two outstanding computer science programs,” Frank Pfenning, head of Carnegie Mellon’s Computer Science Department, said in a university  press release.
Students will spend the first year of instruction at Tsinghua University. Afterwards, scholarships will be established to support these students, who will then finish their second year of study at Carnegie Mellon. About five students are expected to take part in this program during the first year.
Recruitment for the program begins in the fall.
The Center for Iranian Music at Carnegie Mellon University to host concert on Sept. 14 to promote Persian music

2016-09-19,CMU,China,"So I missed the first week of classes to go on a family trip to China. When I tell people this, the most common response I get is “why?” Why did I, the history nerd, want to visit one of the oldest and most culturally rich countries on the planet? Why did I, the college senior in respectable academic standing, opt for a once-in-a-lifetime experience (or if I’m lucky, twice) over yet another syllabus week? Or is the question why did [ITAL]I[ITAL] go? Me: the white girl, all-American and embarrassingly unilingual, with a “chinaboo” kid sister and parents who won a big case this year. Everyone calls travel “eye-opening” and “life-changing,” and I don’t expect to escape all the clichés. But travel is also an exercise in privilege. 
While abroad, I try my best to blend. I imagine the worst “American Tourist” stereotype and will myself to embody the opposite. Be polite and respectful. No dumb questions. Pay attention to the tour guide. Never assume that you know better. Heed all “no pictures” signs, especially in places of religious significance. No complaints about people not speaking your language; the average schoolchild here knows more English than you know of Mandarin, you poop. No demands that anything — the food, the weather, even the plane rides — conform to your expectations. Always be flexible. And most of all, never forget: this is not your exotic vacation locale, this is not your cultural zoo. This is you visiting an unfamiliar world filled with people more similar to you than not, learning and exploring and most importantly leaving it again untouched. 
Despite my rules, I did not blend in even a little. The curly red hair and pale-as-paper skin earned me open stares almost everywhere my family went. On a visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing, I was grabbed — quite literally grabbed — for a selfie by at least six locals. I felt like something of a minor celebrity; it was flattering and bizarre and anxiety inducing all at once. For the first time, my whiteness had granted me “minority” status. But unlike other minorities, my whiteness didn’t put me at risk for harassment or discrimination or oppression; the only bullet I had to dodge was a camera flash.
Tours of Buddhist temples and monasteries left me similarly uncomfortable. I was torn between awe at these places’ beauty and millennia of symbolic meaning, and fear that my very presence was an intrusion on these people’s deeply held religious beliefs. I nearly panicked in front of a 2,000-year-old golden Buddha in a Lhasa temple. Burning yak butter and heady incense permeated my nostrils and made my head swim. Dozens of local people jostled me from every side, single-minded in their determination to pray at one of the holiest sites in the world. I was a foreign obstacle to their blinding faith, and I wanted out. I needed to breathe. 
Also, for all that Beijing, Shanghai, and Xian are industrialized, modern cities, I never forgot that I was visiting a distinctly non-democratic country. Chairman Mao gazed serenely out at Tiananmen Square, manned every twenty or so yards by an armed officer. “Big Brother’s” webcam sat innocently on the dashboard of our Lhasa van, ready to report any incendiary things our guide might say. Funnily enough, I was able to open the “OkCupid” app — but the nearest users it picked up were in Bangladesh. And of course, every tour guide smilingly referred to my father as a “businessman,” unaware that his daughter — raging liberal and aspiring revolutionary — was sitting quietly in the backseat.
There were simpler, less fraught moments of angst. I spent an hour tracking down my missing suitcase in Xian. I sat down for five minutes in Beijing and got eaten alive by mosquitoes. I had more than one less-than-flawless encounter with a squat toilet. And don’t even get me started on Tibet. Lhasa was three days of pounding headaches, total lack of appetite, and the vague feeling that I was floating. Altitude sickness is so real. Incidentally, Lhasa was also the midway point of the trip, right around when all my friends were posting “just got back! let’s get dinner!” messages in the group chat I couldn’t reply to. Holed up in our hotel’s “oxygen lounge” and trapped behind the “Great Firewall” of China, I read through these messages and wished I was back in the ‘Burgh with them. The grass is always greener, I suppose.  
There were also simple moments of joy. To anyone looking for a pick-me-up, I wholeheartedly recommend the panda breeding center in Chengdu, or these awesome fried soup dumplings in Shanghai, or the aerial view of mountainous Lhasa after a lung-beating climb. I am bowled over by gratitude that I was privileged enough to do all this. So, I’d like to raise one of those obscenely large bottles of beer my parents received in every restaurant. Three cheers to adventure, to learning experiences, and to embracing the uncomfortable.   .

2016-09-26,CMU,China,"Often referred to as the future of computing, quantum computing is based on exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics to transfer information using ‘qubits’. At the International Conference on Quantum Cryptography (QCrypt), held on Sept. 12, at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., several research teams presented their findings in the field of quantum computing.
‘Qubits,’ or quantum bits, are the smallest unit of information in a quantum computer. They store data that is traditionally binary in the form of two distinguishable quantum states. The general principle behind storing information is that these quantum bits have properties like superposition and entanglement. Superposition is the ability of these qubits to have more than a single state at the same time, which means that, in the case of an electron, it is possible for it to be in the ‘up’ and ‘down’ state at once. Entanglement is the inexplicable phenomenon of quantum particles to be in ‘sync’ with each other, even at great distances. 
However, the existence of a fully functional quantum computer is still years away. This is because of the fact that it is a significant challenge to make qubits behave in a certain way when even the slightest disturbance causes qubits to fall out of their state. Another concern is that even though they have entanglement states at larger distances, those distances are finite and information needs to be repeated after some threshold value when using physical transfer methods. In free space, less information is lost, scattered, or absorbed.
A group of researchers from the University of Calgary in Canada reported that they had transferred quantum states successfully over a distance of 6.2 km using three spaced out stations — A, B, and C — to send states from A to C using the Calgary fiber network. One of the interesting things that the report notes is that, even though they send disembodied quantum states from A to B, B doesn’t receive any physical particle, but still sends out photons in entanglement states. Another team reports the construction of a 30 km optical fiber-based quantum network distributed over a 12.5 km area in the city of Hefei, China. According to the report, the network is as completely robust in the real world scenario and employed stabilization strategies. Both of these findings were published in Nature Photonics on Sept. 19. 
A research team from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands developed a system of quantum memory using quantum entanglement of electrons in diamond chips. Moving the entanglement of electrons to atomic nuclei protects the states, which is a rule that could potentially be used to expand the range of quantum networks, according to a scientist on the team. 
As research teams continue to work on quantum computing, they find better ways to control quantum bits and make stronger, larger, more functional quantum networks.  Quantum computing could revolutionize computing simply because it is so much faster than traditional methods. One way to think about this is that factoring large numbers, which is one of the slowest calculations that traditional computers do, could be done in a significantly shorter, more feasible time. 
Furthermore, entanglement allows researchers to know when the data is being modified or accessed, because tweaking one qubit allows another that is far away to also change, which security systems can catch and relate to unauthorized access. Thus, another benefit of quantum computing is that it allows for better security of data transfer..

2016-10-03,CMU,China,"Most students on campus could guess that the Hunt Library was funded through a donation of someone who’s last name was Hunt. Lesser known among the student body is the history behind the Hunt family and most importantly, Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt. Throughout her lifetime residing on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside, Rachel acquired an array of artifacts reflecting her fascination with the botanical world. By the 1950’s, the collection was well known in the academic world, and Rachel came to publish the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt.
In an attempt to preserve this legacy close to its home, the Hunt family generously donated Rachel’s collection to Carnegie Tech, accompanied by a building to house both the collection and a library. For those who are unaware of the mysterious fifth floor of Hunt library, currently known as the Hunt Botanical Institute, this is where Rachel Hunt’s botanical collection can be found.
Since 1964, the institute has been working to preserve and foster further growth of the botanical arts by displaying an international exhibit. The exhibit brings together the botanical community from across the world, including the Botanical Society, which hosts a conference at the institute during the international exhibition. Currently, the 15th International Exhibition is on display.
When the exhibition first began, the world of botanical art existed with many more restraints than it does now. In 1964, the institute only accepted art that had been published. Considering the fact that many fine artists do not seek out having their art published in scientific journals or texts, this excluded a lot of talent from the series. As perspectives have become more accepting of the notion that botanical art is equally as artistic as other forms of fine art, the institute has grown to accept submissions from a wide array of artists.
The selection process is conducted by Curator of Art and Senior Research Scholar, Lugene Bruno and Assistant Curator of Art, Carrie Roy. It’s an extensive process that takes place over a two-year period, and its outcome reflects one of the most diverse and talented collection of botanical art ever. According to the Hunt Institute’s website, “Collectively, the catalogues are the most comprehensive record available of 20th–21st-century botanical artists and illustrators — the number of individuals represented now totals 1,129.”
The selection process begins with open submission of works from anyone. Some of the artists have never been heard of by the curators, while others have been, and others come recommended. Some of the art also comes from artists that Bruno and Roy have watched evolve throughout their careers, who are then asked to submit their art to be featured in the international exhibit. Roy mentioned that because an artist can only be featured in the international exhibit once, it’s important to pick the artists that they think are most ready, to avoid having someone display their work before the peak of their career.
Each artist digitally submits what they believe to be their top three pieces. Bruno and Roy select artists that will be featured in the exhibit and narrow it down from the three pieces they’ve submitted to the one that they would be most interested in seeing for the exhibit. Once it’s been decided which pieces are best for the exhibit, the artists send in the physical piece for a final approval. In preparing for the exhibit, all of the photography of the art and graphic design for the series is done in house, which takes a lot of attention to detail to achieve a quality outcome.
This year’s exhibition includes art from 15 different countries, including the U.S., England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, China, Japan, and South Korea. As in previous years, the submissions are heavily from the U.S. and Western Europe, but there has been a growing presence of submissions from countries in Asia as well.
The most common medium for the art is watercolor, though many artists also use colored pencils, ink, powder pastels, or powder graphite. This year, there is a lot more work featuring colored pencils.
What inspires Bruno most about the international exhibit is searching for artists that are pushing the boundaries of what is botanical art, while still showing appreciation and understanding for what the purpose of botanical art is. For example, though it is traditional for the background of the art to be white, Bruno pointed out that several pieces in this year’s international exhibit use a combination of artistic mediums, but didn’t follow the rules surrounding background. One piece resembled a photograph, with shadowing on the white background. Another implemented a desert landscape as a background, something not commonly seen in botanical art.
When asked what her favorite piece in the exhibit this year was, Roy explained that given the complexity of emotions expressed in each piece, depending on the day, one piece will stand out more than another, but she could never pick an absolute favorite. This really speaks to the beauty of botanical art, as it’s humanity’s attempt to capture the pure beauty of the organic world, something that we can relate to more deeply than the material world around us..

2016-10-10,CMU,China,"If there’s anything that these horribly splintered political parties of ours can agree on, it’s the value of human life. Black Lives Matter and Pro-Life protesters raise their signs because of one core, irrevocable conviction that spans any group: human life is precious, and we as a people and as a government have a duty to protect it.
Except, apparently, the lives of criminals. This is a glaring hypocrisy in American idealism: despite our professedly sacred values of the importance of human life, the death penalty continues to be supported and funded by the federal government. Texas alone has executed 538 people since 1976. Executions have decreased in recent years, but the inconsistency in our federal government’s values persists: capital punishment should be abolished, wholly and completely. Waiting for the states to get rid of this cruel practice one by one doesn’t reflect any decisive rejection by our country. As The New York Times  reported last week, “For the first time in almost half a century, support for the death penalty has dipped below 50 percent in the U.S.” Americans are realizing the hypocrisy.
It is still appalling, however, that 49 percent of Americans support capital punishment. Some may support it simply because they believe it to be too expensive to keep our worst criminals in prison for life, yet this process of legalized murder is so inefficient and lengthy that the cost of killing someone isn’t very different from the cost of keeping them in prison.
Others may support it as a deterrent to criminals from committing these atrocious crimes, for fear of receiving a death sentence. However, there remains no substantial proof of this — in fact, a group of criminologists at the University of Texas at Dallas conducted an extensive study in 2009 that concluded that there was “no empirical support for the argument that the existence or application of the death penalty deters prospective offenders from committing homicide.” Regardless of the data, it is doubtful that a criminal would hesitate to commit an offense in Pennsylvania, where the death penalty is legal, rather than in New York, where it is not.
Yet, although there is no visible reason for its continuation, the United States continues this archaic practice, in cheerful company with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. We, with our glittering international reputation, are also invariably used as the justification for the use of the death penalty in countries with poorer justice systems.
We, as Americans, pride ourselves on our high moral standard, the central values of the Constitution that differentiate us from other, less democratic, countries. One of the most essential convictions of the Constitution, however, is that against “cruel and unusual punishment.” This famously vague command has been debated in many contexts, but in this case it is definitive.
Once sentenced, the offender waits for roughly 15 years, through innumerable appeals that circulate and bounce back and forth in the legal system, before the actual execution. They are also usually sentenced to solitary confinement during this time, as opposed to other inmates in the prison. Regardless of the actual punishment, this wait for death, alone, for over a decade, is unarguably cruel and unusual.
The execution at the end is even more so, for despite the efforts to create a ‘humane’ death, there have been many horrible accidents. An unforgettably awful case is that of Clayton Lockett, in which the botched administration of drugs caused him to endure over 40 minutes of agony after sedation.
There are a lot of stories and statistics that can be cited about this issue, but the baseline is this: we, as a civilized nation, do not have the authority to end a human life. It is an accepted belief that life is precious and sacred, and despite the many atrocities that may have been committed, we do not have the moral authority to end it. 
It is hypocritical to condemn other countries, and our own citizens, for their executions, while participating in it ourselves.
While the government claims not have the authority to force state governments to end capital punishment, it can still declare a moratorium on the death penalty for federal crimes. As a country that unfailingly defends the value of life and dignity, this would be a powerful message to the rest of the world..

2016-10-17,CMU,China,"On Thursday, before President Obama had arrived, the Frontiers conference began with several sessions explaining how artificial intelligence (AI) and data science affect various levels of policy. The local and national sessions, called tracks, took place on the second floor of the Cohon Center. The panels were a who’s who of academic and corporate giants in the field of AI such as Engineering Director at Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center Raffi Krikorian and Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Research Jeanette Wing. The local policy track also featured municipal government officials who embody the spirit of making data “work for us” as the president often says.
The National Frontiers track opened with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf telling the story of innovation in Pennsylvania, beginning with William Penn’s idea of freedom of conscience, winding through the founding ideas of American government born in Pennsylvania, touching on the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and finally landing on the transportation revolution which still roils on today as self driving cars become frequent sights on the streets of Pittsburgh. “Welcome to Pittsburgh; welcome to Pennsylvania; welcome to the future,” said Wolf before he ceded the stage to a series of “lightning speakers” who gave ten minute talks on their areas of interest or expertise.
The first speaker was Tanya Berger-Wolf of the University of Illinois at Chicago. She spoke about how data science is making it possible to track animals without invasive tracking devices that could be dangerous to the animals. The program she referred to was able to use machine learning techniques to identify species and even individual animals. This resulted in programs like Flukebook for tracking whale flukes and the IoT, Internet of Turtles.
The second speaker was Carnegie Mellon robotics professor Stephen Smith. Smith presented a plan to alleviate urban congestion by having traffic lights autonomously optimize their own patterns and then send that information downstream so future lights know what to expect. This program found great success in Penn Circle, reducing travel time by 26 percent, idling time by 41 percent, and emissions by 21 percent. After a successful expansion to Bakery Square, Smith’s team plans to continue expanding the program throughout Pittsburgh.
The final lightning speaker, Suchi Suria of Johns Hopkins, explained how electronic health records could be used to diagnose conditions such as sepsis that require a quick response. The algorithm she and her team developed was able to use these records to discover sepsis up to 24 hours before doctors are able to make the same diagnosis. This approach was not unique to sepsis, and has also been successful in responding to other conditions and could help diagnostics significantly.
Krikorian and Wing, alongside founding director of the New York University Center for Data Science and Director of AI Research at Facebook Yann LeCun, Vice President of Cognitive Computing at IBM Guru Banavar, and research scientist at Google Francoise Beaufays, participated in a panel on best practices in AI. The panel began with how AI developed from something of a niche field of study into the dominating presence it has today. All of the members of the panel agreed that the convergence of the available tools — humans now having powerful computers in our pockets — and deep learning in the last five years have expanded the capabilities of AI to the point where they are unavoidable. Deep learning is a process by which an algorithm attempts to model abstractions from data, allowing for more general decisions. Wing explained that AI began as a dream of recreating human intelligence, but that quickly proved challenging. Eventually, people identified individual tasks that a human can do and attempted to algorithmically recreate them which has lead to the specialized AI we have today.
The panel also got into some of the specific limitations that computers face. One specific example that LeCun gave was the difference between the sentences “the trophy did not fit in the suitcase because it was too large” and “the trophy did not fit in the suitcase because it was too small.” Humans observe the world and are easily able to discern that either the suitcase was too small to contain the trophy or the trophy was too large to fit in the suitcase, but that observation of reality is missing from computers. Wing added that conversational English is different from written English and sometimes people will switch languages when they are speaking. LeCun believes that these challenges have to be overcome before AI can start to function as accurately as humans.
Finally, Wing mentioned the importance of secure AI that is safe from some of the more harmful tendencies of people. This was in response to a question about Microsoft’s Tay, which has been described as a “Hitler-loving sex robot.” Tay was originally supposed to be an automated conversational bot that picked up on people’s tendencies, but was quickly corrupted into saying some things that were less than friendly. This came on the heels of a wildly successful version of Tay named XiaoIce which was released in China. It showed the need to actively make sure AI doesn’t become harmful.
In the Local Frontiers track, Chief Data Scientist at the University of Chicago Center for Data Science and Public Policy Rayid Ghani, Knoxville Chief of Police David Rausch, and Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Monica Bharel discussed how data can be used to disrupt cycles of incarceration. Rausch’s police department has gone two years without a police involved shooting, and when asked about how that happened, he responded that there was a little luck but a lot of effort. He mentioned that community engagement helped officers and their communities interact more positively. He also talked about how the education of officers, including a large increase in the number of officers with four year degrees, and more stable working conditions and hours for police officers helped to make police less likely to need violence. He also talked about how officers are trained to reset situations where they are at a disadvantage so they never have to resort to violence. Ghani added that these were all backed up by data saying these were meaningful predictors of violence. Police who have four year degrees are less likely to commit an act of police violence while police who consistently respond to distressing situations such as domestic violence or suicides are more likely to commit an act of violence in the coming weeks.
Bharel also added the importance of tackling substance abuse to disrupting cycles of incarceration and talked about how Massachusetts implemented the State Without Stigma program to help create vocabulary to talk about drug use and addiction in a way that doesn’t alienate people. She also spoke about how the data supports that the start of the opioid crisis is not heroin and illegal drugs, but that this comes as a result of opioid prescriptions for things like back pain. The data explains the flow of the problem and helps the department respond.
The tracks were heavy on specific policy discussions and how data science affects how both private and public entities should respond to the vast amount of information that now surrounds us. They were followed by the plenary session featuring President Obama that focused on brain science and medical information..

2016-11-21,CMU,China,"Recent events have led to many questions about the future of our country, one major question being: What exactly does the Donald Trump presidency mean for the future of science and technology in the United States? Trump’s personal quips on the subject seem at best immature, simple, and uninformed, and at worst anti-fact. Yet, the forces and motives that have led to his unprecedented presidency are complex and nuanced, and paint an uncertain picture of the future for science in the United States.
On one hand, there are many signs that we are entering a dark age of scientific Armageddon. Trump has put a prominent climate change skeptic in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition team, and has publicly questioned climate change himself. He has supported claims that vaccines cause autism, and in general has expressed contempt for the scientific community. There is ample evidence that a Trump presidency could lead to a decrease in both funding and respect for science in America, and possibly in the world. This may be the tipping point for global catastrophes such as climate change, and this election will forever be remembered as the beginning of the end.
On the other hand, such fears may be somewhat alarmist. In fact, in many ways Trump could act as a catalyst to a certain type of scientific and technological progress in the United States. Trump rose to power because of a nationalism that — while in many ways is fearfully similar to the jingoism that beget Nazi Germany — is also not unlike the American fervor that propelled the United States scientifically and technologically after the second world war. For example, the 1960s space race that led to an acceleration of technological innovation was very much fueled by a nationalist and globally competitive atmosphere. This type of research — large, flashy, and militaristic — may be perfectly in-sync with Trump’s (and more importantly, Trump’s supporters’) agenda.
If marketed correctly, investment into clean energy could capture America’s imagination the way the space race so classically did. Currently, China is leading the world in clean energy research by a significant margin. If Trump and his supporters do truly wish to dominate China in all manners, we must increase expenditure in clean energy technologies. If the motive is spun not as an attack on fossil fuel industries, but rather a rejuvenation of American might, clean energy research could potentially receive a boost.
Yet, this could all be overly optimistic thinking about an administration that has great disdain for scientific inquiry, particularly climate change. While we may see growth in showy and defense-focused research, funding for fundamental climate research could wane, not unlikely funding cuts for stem cell research in the George W. Bush era. In fact, countries such as France have threatened to place tariffs on U.S. goods if the U.S. refuses to address climate change. This, coupled with Trump’s predilection for isolationism, could destroy the global competitiveness of American products (not to the mention the environment as well). As many articles on the subject have espoused, we honestly do not know exactly what Trump means for the future of science and technology. In this scenario, the only thing that is truly certain is uncertainty.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on how a Trump administration will affect future science and technology policy..

2016-11-21,CMU,China,"Stephen Hawking gives humanity 1000 years to find planet
Speaking at the Oxford University Union, Stephen Hawking admitted that humanity’s survival is dismal in the distant future, noting that “although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next 1,000 or 10,000 years.”
Many factors can render the planet uninhabitable if given 1,000 years. Global warming does not seem to be slowing, but increasing exponentially. Frequent epidemics, such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, are also on the rise. “By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars,” Hawking remarked. “So a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race.” Premonitions similar to Hawking’s are partially what drive today’s rush for the colonization of Mars.

Dinosaurs may have existed 20 million years earlier
Paleontologists at Macquarie University employed a novel dating method involving probability to increase the accuracy of the fossil record. A new family tree of over 1,000 species, the largest ever, was assembled to aid in the design of a probabilistic framework of first occurrences of specific species. 
Paleontologists found that the likelihood of discovering the very first fossils is very minute, and so introduced probabilistic methods to increase accuracy of their estimates. 
They found that the very first dinosaurs were present at the end of the Permian-Triassic period, 250 million years ago, meaning early dinosaurs somehow survived the largest mass extinction event in Earth’s history.
The entire study was published in Biology Letters.

China uses CRISPR, gene-editing to fight cancer cells
Scientists at Sichuan University injected a patient suffering from metazoic lung cancer with white blood cells that were edited using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR). This is the first known instance of  the application of the CRISPR technology on  human beings. 
CRISPR are segments of prokaryotic DNA that enable faster, cheaper, and more accurate gene editing. The new white blood cells, T-Lymhotcytes, targeted and attacked rogue cancer cells.
Sichuan University received ethical clearance for its trial within six months. Seeking the same approval would have taken much longer here in the United States. Scientists are hopeful that competition between China, and the U.S. will drive the latter to accelerate gene-editing research.

Pluto may have oceans underneath its icy surface
Scientists have newfound evidence of a sub-surface ocean on the icy dwarf-planet Pluto. Analysis of data sent back by NASA’s New Horizon space probe,which made the closest flyby of Pluto last year, shows compelling signs of water bodies below the ice surface. This adds Pluto to the list of worlds in the solar system believed to harbor hidden water oceans, which are highly probable incubators of extra-terrestrial life. Pluto’s oceans are not the most likely candidates for alien sightings, however, due to their harsh, cold conditions.
Pluto’s supposed ocean is estimated to be 150 to 200 kilometers below the surface and 62 kilometers deep. Internal exothermic processes in Pluto’s core are what could keep water liquid despite the planet’s great distance from the sun.

Zika virus no longer an international health emergency
The Zika virus, the disease that ravaged Brazil and Florida, is no longer an international emergency according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This does not mean the virus is eradicated or ceased to be a threat, however. “We are not downgrading the importance of Zika,” said Pete Salama, executive director of WHO. “By placing it as a longer-term program of work, we are saying Zika is here to stay and WHO’s response is here to stay.” 
The Zika virus was declared a Public Health Emergency in February 2016, after it was linked to birth defects such as microcephaly and neurological complications. The disease will likely continue to spread in areas with the mosquito vector since its spread depends on the  Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that act as carriers to that virus.

Alaska Airlines flies first biofuel-powered engine
Commercial airline Alaska Airlines flew its first flight with 20 percent biofuel. The fuel was made from forest tree limbs and branches, developed at Washington State University with aid from Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance. Moreover, it is chemically indistinguishable from usual kerosene-based jet fuel. 
Joe Sprague of Alaska Airlines commented, “This latest milestone in Alaska’s efforts to promote sustainable biofuels is especially exciting since it is uniquely sourced from the forest residuals in the Pacific Northwest.” 
This feat comes at a time when contrails and jet engine emissions are under scrutiny from the environmental community.

2016-11-21,CMU,China,"The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) and Carnegie Mellon University held the first part of the two-part joint Carnegie Colloquium on Digital Governance and Security in Washington D.C. on Oct. 31. The first part of the colloquium was titled “The Rise of Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Military Operations and Privacy,” and the second part, titled “The Future of the Internet: Governance and Conflict,” will be held this year in Pittsburgh on Dec. 2. 
CEIP is a series of foreign policy-based research centers located in Russia, China, Europe, the Middle East, India, and the United States, with headquarters in Washington D.C., that collects itself under the phrase, “The Global Think Tank.” It was established in 1960 by Andrew Carnegie and, according to a report by the University of Pennsylvania, is the third most influential think tank in the world. 
The colloquium, held for the benefit of both Carnegie Mellon and the CEIP, aimed to allow for communication between the academics at Carnegie Mellon and the foreign policy and ethics experts from all the CEIP stations across the world to discuss the implication of artificial intelligence on foreign policy and the challenges posed by it. The second part of the colloquium will focus on cyber-security norms and internet governance. 
“Designing safe software systems and attempting to create the learning abilities of the human brain are natural progressions towards the two of the modern world’s most pressing concerns — cyber security and privacy,” said President Subra Suresh, in the welcome address. He explained that discussion, such as the one facilitated by the colloquium, would help shape thought about the effects of technology on global society and diplomacy.
The colloquium consisted of three panel discussions with experts from both sides. The first panel was “The Future of Consumer Privacy: Machine Learning and New International Data Protection,” and was introduced by Andrew Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. 
In his speech, Moore elaborated on the difficulty of the conflicts between privacy and personalization, especially when using machine learning, saying, “privacy and personalization, which seem like clear goods, lead us to very difficult societal and technical challenges.” He then explained four fictional, but relatable scenarios that shed better light on the dilemma posed by this intersection of technology and policy including law-enforcement and medical use of data. 
He referred to the data of Matt Fredrikson – an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science that reveals the trade-off between privacy levels and lives saved or years of lives saved, to caution against “being on either extreme end of that trade-off” and say that “we should find our place in the middle of that trade-off.” 
This panel’s speakers included Edward Felten, a computer scientist and deputy U.S. chief technology officer at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Yuet Ming Tham, a partner at Sidley Austin’s Hong Kong office who focuses on privacy, cross-border compliance, and investigations; and Paul Timmers, director of the Sustainable & Secure Society Directorate in the European Commission Communications Networks, Content and Technologies Directorate General (DG CONNECT).
Following the panel were robot presentations by Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute professors. These included the snakebots by Howie Choset, a professor of robotics; the ballbot by Ralph Hollis, a professor of robotics; and the Robotanist by George Kantor, a senior systems scientist.
Finally, the last panel, titled “International Perspectives: Autonomy and Counter-autonomy in Military Operations,” was introduced by David Brumley, director of CyLab Security and Privacy Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The speakers included Lt. Gen. Dr. R.S. Panwar, the former colonel commandant of the Indian Army Corps of Signals; Daniel Reisner, a partner at Herzog, Fox & Neeman; and Mary Wareham, advocacy director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch and global coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.
Jim Garrett, the Dean of CMU’s College of Engineering explains in the university press release about the colloquium, “The wide span of impact from artificial intelligence and cybersecurity demands these kinds of international discussions, ... These forums provide an exchange of ideas, an appreciation for a wide variety of views and a debate on tough topics.” 
Thus, the Colloquium is a great way to open discussions about artificial intelligence and its implications, and the second part is sure to bring more interesting   and valuable discussion as well..

2016-11-21,CMU,China,"Dear Marvel,
Congrats. Unsurprisingly, your new film, Doctor Strange, is great. I *love* this movie. I love its trippy art style, its classic Marvel humor, and its heart. You also somehow managed not to create a terribly-written villain (as you usually do), and your movie has already made over $500 MILLION. Obviously, that’s a lot of money.
Oh and I loved your actors, too. Well, most of them.
I thought your choice last year to cast Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, a character known in the respected Marvel Comics to be an old male Tibetan monk, was interesting at first, and it’s no surprise that Mrs. Swinton is a phenomenal actress. In fact, she was phenomenal in this very movie. But many people were angry, confused, and shocked. Tilda Swinton is as far from an old male Tibetan monk as you are from DC.
Seven months ago you released a statement trying to defend yourself. 
Here’s how I break it down to my friends: one, you threw money at yourselves. No surprise. Every business does that. Tilda Swinton scared me to death as the White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia and is enormously talented.
Second, by essentially sweeping your problem of accidentally creating a racist stereotypical Ancient One and offending China under the rug, you’ve created a larger problem by playing into Hollywood white washing and making her Celtic rather than Tibetan. You have denied another role, another job opportunity, to Asian actors. This is not the first time this has happened, and I am tired of feeling pushed to the side to seemingly appease your audience.
Third, and most importantly, you lied to me.
I see no “strong record of diversity” and “regular departure from stereotypes” when I see your ratio of three white Chris's for every one black Nick Fury. For every female superhero there are two genius playboy billionaire philanthropists. When I look at cast photos from your previous movies, I often see two colors. I, an Asian-American teenage woman, can’t see myself and I am part of one of your key demographics.
This was where my anger, confusion, and shock stemmed from, but I also felt hurt. Disappointed. Excluded. Grant Gustin, who plays The Flash on CW, said recently, “Story telling in general will remain an escape from every day life,” and I did not expect you, my lifeboat, to cast me off, especially now. I expected more and better, and now after watching the movie I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Doctor Strange had quickly become one of my favorite Marvel movies but I could not ignore the struggles, problems, and lies involved within its production. Additionally, all my fellow Marvel-loving friends have written this off, but myself and my Asian-American friends are still torn up about this.  And this divide that’s been caused probably hurts me more.
Earlier this month, I felt torn, too. I felt hurt about America as a nation, and how we are devolving into a cycle of violence and hate with a completely new, stronger, and rawer sense of viciousness with a seemingly bleak view on how we can find a solution. Right now, I’m ashamed of our country, and I feel that way towards you, too.
And right now, all I can think of is to ask, what happens now? What does this movie mean for our representation? How will representation form under Trump’s presidency? Moreover, how does this presidency reflect us as a nation?
Your whitewashing has already dealt a major blow to diversity and visibility, according to Variety, because of its inevitable success. And with Trump, that blow might be a lot larger. But I refuse to be intimidated by our circumstances. If anything, these situations have motivated me to make a change.
I’ve already told people to go see this movie. In fact, I’ve already seen it twice. And I might watch it a third time as well. But when I tell people to watch this movie, I’m going to tell them about what has happened behind the scenes. I want people to watch this movie with a greater knowledge of Asian issues, and create a chain reaction of awareness.  
I will acknowledge it: you possibly couldn’t have won anyone over with this character. If you created a racist Asian stereotype, that might have offended people even more. But instead you created a complex, substantive character that an Asian woman could have desperately benefited from.  I just don’t want you to lie to me, or your millions of fans, again.  I hope what has happened can help foster a discussion not just on your end, but everywhere else too.
We as a country should move forward, too, to learn from our mistakes and unite in love. We need to achieve a greater understanding of each other in order to overcome the lies and hatred that the country seems to be swirling down into. And in a time where you are the hero of millions of people all around the globe, I hope you do the same..

2016-11-21,CMU,China,"As the semester reaches its final lap, with all the exams and essays piling on top of each other up to our eyeballs, it seems impossible to even think about taking time to relax, chat with friends, and enjoy a good meal. But sometimes, taking time for ourselves, away from campus, tests, and deadlines, is the best way to relieve all the stress that has been building up on us since the start of the semester. For me, great food with great friends is the perfect remedy.
This is my first semester at Carnegie Mellon, and I’ve tried to explore Pittsburgh as much as I can. After visiting Oakland and Shadyside, Squirrel Hill was next on my list. This week I decided to go to Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill with a friend. As soon as we entered the restaurant I instantly knew I would have a good experience there. We were seated immediately, since we arrived early in the evening, before 6 p.m., but the place was already bustling with people relaxing after a long week. The interior of the restaurant is nice and laid back, the ideal spot for college students and families. Customers can watch the chefs make the noodles from scratch through a glass screen looking into the kitchen at the front of the restaurant. I was surprised to see the chefs making the noodles by hand in the Chinese style because it’s something I haven’t seen in many Chinese restaurants outside of China or a Chinatown.
The menu itself is extensive, ranging from a variety of noodle choices, to dim sum, to several rice dishes. It took me a while to choose what I wanted, but I finally settled on a classic Chinese dish — braised beef and tendon noodle soup — while my friend selected the hot spicy wonton noodles and an order of pork soup dumplings for us to split. Instead of a waiter asking for our order, the restaurant provides paper menus and pencils at the tables so customers can check off everything they’d like to order. When the waiter came to pick up our menus, he simply asked which type of noodles we preferred (thin or wide). This was a new style of ordering that I hadn’t experienced before, but it felt right with the casual but chic style of the restaurant.
The food came very quickly, with barely a wait at all. The moment the beef noodle soup was placed in front of me, I could smell the familiar aromas of beef and spices. It was phenomenal, with exquisitely tender beef and tendon, steamed broccoli, and handmade noodles. The dish immediately took me back to Shanghai, where I ate my first authentic Chinese beef noodle soup. It was quite spicy, just the way I like it. If you aren’t partial to spicy food, be sure to tell your waiter for a mildly spiced dish. My friend and I shared dishes, and her wonton noodles were just as delicious, with the hot chili oil flavoring the noodles in the best way. The pork soup dumplings were also a great addition to the meal, with soy sauce and thinly sliced ginger complementing the dish. This was my first time eating soup dumplings, and they left a great impression. The pork was mildly seasoned, allowing for the soy sauce and ginger to enhance the dumplings. By the end of the meal, I was completely stuffed and satisfied.
Of all the places I’ve visited in Pittsburgh so far, Everyday Noodles is definitely at the top. The service was efficient, but not overbearing, the restaurant atmosphere very welcoming, and the food itself spectacular. It had some of the most authentic Chinese dishes I’ve had in a restaurant in America. This was the perfect way for me to relax after a week of endless assignments and to catch up with my friend. The place was busy, but not overcrowded, which allowed us to feel comfortable. I'm excited to go back with more friends and try different dishes. I would highly recommend Everyday Noodles to anyone — the menu has something for everyone, including vegetarian choices, desserts, and bubble tea. Plus, it’s very close to campus — just a short ten-minute bus ride away. I will definitely bring my family to eat there the next time they are in Pittsburgh..

2016-12-05,CMU,China,"It’s 1979. The Iranian Hostage Crisis has just ended. There’s been a coup in Nicaragua, and a war between China and Vietnam. The world is complex, constantly shifting between peace and tension in every region.
This was the state of the world when the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women came in front of the U.N. Usually referred to as CEDAW, it came to fruition after thirty years of debate on women’s issues in the United Nations. 
The U.N. took several routes to examine the different perspectives and scenarios among their member countries. Commissions were created and different Conventions were passed, eventually culminating in CEDAW. 
CEDAW was intended to serve as the central international agreement on the rights of women and the protections that they need. It also lays out actions that should be done in order to ensure those protections. In a time when women’s rights were threatened across the globe, CEDAW was meant to help push positive change worldwide. It was signed and ratified by most countries, which should have been enough. It was enough for it to come into effect under the U.N.
However, what the U.N. says needs to happen doesn’t always quite filter into the world in the same way. CEDAW was missing something important, something that would have given it a weight it did not have.
The United States never ratified CEDAW. Without that tacit approval of a superpower country, it lacked a certain legitimacy. Ratification would require the entire Senate vote on the bill, with two thirds approving. However, CEDAW has never even appeared before the Senate. 
For context, most countries have approved of CEDAW — of member-states, the only others who haven’t yet ratified are Iran, Sudan, Palau, Tonga, and Somalia. In the area of women’s rights, that’s not the best company to be in. In fact, there are so many countries with major human right’s violations who at least paid the lip-service of ratifying. The U.S. hasn’t even given it the chance of a vote.
That’s the main issue here — the fact that it hasn’t been in front of the Senate. The issue is that it’s very hard to vote against a women’s rights bill. Sure, there’s a question of United Nations interference in national law, but there’s 30 years of history to show that signing CEDAW won’t weaken the United States in any way. 
Other than U.N. overreach, there isn’t much cause to block without getting into hugely controversial issues. That’s why it has never been up to vote — ducking a vote is significantly easier than casting a Nay vote in front of the country.
If you’re wondering what’s so controversial about CEDAW, the answer isn’t surprising. It’s what’s always controversial in terms of women’s issues in the United States. One of the actions CEDAW urges members to follow is providing access to education on family planning as well as health services that may be pertinent. Reproductive matters can be hugely controversial in the United States, but words like abortion are never used in CEDAW. It only mentions that information and health services should be available — there are no requirements as to what type.
Many of the other objections to CEDAW in the U.S. come in a similar vein. CEDAW is not a terribly specific document. Many of its terms can be interpreted in different ways, and allow each nation to determine the best course of action to achieve them. There isn’t any punishment for not completing them either. Any worries about the terms of CEDAW should be dissuaded by the wide range of countries that have ratified the convention. Even extremely conservative nations have ratified the convention, which would not have occurred if they were worried about the terms outlined clashing with their principles. And countries similar to the U.S., allies like Canada and Germany, have given it their approval as well.
CEDAW has accomplished some things since its passage. Laws against human trafficking and domestic violence have been passed around the world. More rights have been given to women in various countries. CEDAW has made a difference in the lives of many women.
And yet, that’s not enough. There’s more to do, and there are areas of the world where women don’t have the equality that CEDAW presses for. 
In the grand scheme of things, the United States has to consider so many factors in how it conducts its foreign affairs. The U.S. can’t simply decide that the choices of a nation are unacceptable and single-handedly change them. But what the U.S. can do is ratify a document it should have ratified ages ago.
It’s been over three decades since CEDAW was presented to the United Nations. The U.S. is lagging behind other countries in demonstrating its concern for women’s issues. Giving CEDAW its chance in front of the Senate would show people around the world and here in the U.S. that the U.S. government does not dismiss these issues. 
It would add legitimacy to the document that the biggest superpower in the world supported it. It’s time to give CEDAW the chance in the Senate that it should have had a long time ago..

2017-01-30,CMU,China,"New species of extinct giant otter found in China
Scientists have described a prehistoric otter species that was “two to three times larger than any modern otter,” according to paleontologist Denise Su.
Siamogale melilutra lived six million years ago in what is now the Yunnan province of China and, according to the scientists who originally discovered it, would have weighed over one hundred pounds.
The researchers studied a fossilized cranium found in a mine in 2010 and came to the conclusion that it belonged a previously undiscovered otter species, based on a digital reconstruction and analysis of its skull structure. They also believe that some previously unclassified fossils found in 2009 are S. melilutra specimens as well.
The findings were published this week in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

NASA launches new project to study cause of auroras
A NASA campaign launching this month aims to learn more about Earth’s magnetic field through auroras, the stunning polar light effects at occur at the Earth’s poles.
The first mission, named PolarNOx, will study the after effects of the aurora while avoiding interaction with the aurora itself. It will focus on collecting data on atmospheric nitrous oxide, a gas produced by auroras. The PolarNOx rocket launch window closes Jan. 31.
The second and third missions will use two rockets each. Neutral jets — jets that do not interact with the ionosphere — in Auroral Arcs will determine the relationship between auroras and ionospheric electrical fields. The ISINGLASS sounding rocket will fire its identical rockets into two different auroras and investigate how they are affected by the solar wind. The entire project will be completed this March.

Research explains prehistoric Martian climate change
Though Mars is a notoriously dry planet, its surface contains evidence that it was once covered with liquid water — an established fact in the scientific community. However, it is unknown what prehistoric climate conditions caused Mars to become warm enough for liquid water to exist; the planet’s atmosphere lacks enough greenhouse gases to produce a greenhouse effect.
Environmental scientists published a proposal this week that may be the first to successfully explain this climate change, using a principle called collision-induced absorption. They claim that while there may not have been enough individual gas molecules present to create a greenhouse effect on their own, the interaction between these molecules creates a significant amount of heat retention — enough to warm the planet.

Distracted drivers much have lower response times
A study published this week in the journal Human Factors found that drivers in automated cars have a wide range of response times.
The study engaged 26 adults in a simulation with normal driving conditions in an autonomous vehicle. Drivers were asked to perform a distracting secondary task and, at random intervals, they were requested to switch either from manual to automatic or vice versa. The response times ranged from 1.9 seconds to 25.7 seconds; distracted drivers had slower response times, on average.
The authors of the study believe their findings have implications for both road safety and the auto-engineering industry, as vehicle designers try to improve the safety features of their imminently commercial self-driving cars.

Female scientists usually excluded from peer review
An analysis of the age and gender data of over 100,000 scientists revealed that women are less likely to be asked to review publications, as compared to their male peers.
The data, collected from American Geophysical Union journal articles, showed that even though female authors are more likely to be accepted for publication, only 20 percent of reviewers are female — less than the expected proportion, based on the number of women in the AGU.
The authors of the review note that the bias is present across all age groups, thus “the lower participation by women as reviewers is not just because editors were seeking more-senior reviewers, who are predominantly male.”
Female scientists also face bias in award and grant decisions, conference invitations, and hiring and promotions.

Extended periods in space may affect genes and cells
The preliminary data from NASA’s ground-breaking “twin study” suggest that long periods spent in space may alter the human body.
In the study, astronaut Scott Kelly spent 342 days in orbit on the International Space Station while his identical twin Mark remained on Earth. Various biological measurements of both brothers were taken before, during and after Kelly’s year in space.
Kelly experienced atypically large fluctuations in gene-expression signatures, possibly due to the stress of living in orbit. His genes also showed signs of decreased methylation. These effects and their consequences are still being studied. However, because the study involves sequencing the entire genome of both twins, the complete results may never be published due to privacy concerns.

2017-01-30,CMU,China,"DNA is an incredible thing, carrying precious information in a small space to make you who you are — genetically, at least.  
This double-helix polymer carries all the information required for growth, development, functioning, and reproduction for all living things. DNA is made up of four nucleotide bases that pair up with each other – adenine (A) and thymine (T), and guanine (G) and cytosine (C).  In a hierarchical structure, the base pairs form DNA, and the complete set of DNA forms the genome. 
In humans, the genome manifests itself in the form of 23 chromosomes, consisting of 3 billion base pairs. When your cells need to create proteins, the genetic information flows from DNA to RNA through transcription and then from RNA to protein through translation.
With such an important molecule, you may think that the information is set in stone and untouchable, but in the 1990s, scientists began looking into methods to purposefully affect the genome. When DNA is manipulated by inserting, deleting, or replacing segments in the genome, it is called genome editing.
In order to edit a genome, researchers have engineered nucleases, which are enzymes that can cut between the nucleotide base pairs to make smaller segments of DNA. There are currently four types of nucleases: zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effective-based nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases, and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. 
CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat, and consist of short sequences of RNA (called CRISPR RNA or crRNA) that can guide a system to a specific, matching DNA strand.
The CRISPR-Cas9 method consists of Cas9, which is the enzyme that cuts the DNA into smaller sequences, and guide RNA (gRNA), a combination of crRNA and tracrRNA that helps guide Cas9 to the part of the genome that needs editing so it can cut in the right place.
Like DNA, RNA is also made up of four nucleotide bases that pair off — adenine (A) and uracil (U), and guanine (G) and cytosine (C). In order to locate a specific place in the DNA sequence of the genome, the gRNA will have complementary bases to the target DNA, thus only binding to the target sequence. The Cas9 enzyme then follows the gRNA to the target DNA and cuts it in two.
Of the four methods, CRISPR-Cas9 is the simplest, most versatile, and precise method, and was heralded as Science's 2015 Breakthrough of the Year. It can be used to target multiple genes at the same time, which sets this method apart from the rest.
CRISPR-Cas9 (and genome editing, in general) has a lot of potential to help treat medical conditions that are caused by genetics. These can include various types of cancers, hepatitis B, and even cholesterol, to name a few. In April 2015, A team from China attempted to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos, which sparked wide-spread debate regarding the ethics of testing gene-editing technology on humans. Their study concluded that CRISPR was unfit for use in reproductive medicine. Last year, in October, CRISPR gene-editing was testing for the first time on a human subject, by scientists at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. It was an attempt to treat a patient with aggressive lung cancer, according to an article in the science journal, Nature. 
However, as with any emerging biological technology, there are ethical concerns that accompany this method. There are two types of cells in the body – somatic cells, which are non-reproductive cells, and germline cells, which are. DNA from germline cells is passed from generation to generation. While gene editing in somatic cells is currently relatively uncontroversial, gene editing in germline cells would be passed to future generations and is currently illegal in many countries. Regardless, scientists continue to make CRISPR-Cas9 even more accurate..

2017-02-06,CMU,China,"With a simple turn of a handle, you have access to clean water. And, as residents of Pittsburgh have discovered in the past week, the cleanliness of water dramatically affects one’s quality of life.
Access to clean water is vital for the survival of individuals and communities. In July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly acknowledged the human right to water and sanitation through Resolution 64/292. In Nov. 2002, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 15, in which Article I.1 states: “The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights.” 
By some accounts, efforts to obtain clean drinking water date back even prior to the discovery of fire. Ancient people relied on taste to tell if water was clean, which is actually not a viable method. In one of the earliest documentations dating back to the 15th century, archaeologists found Sanskrit writings in ancient Egyptian tombs depicting water treatment. In the Sus’ruta Samhita, from 2000 BCE, there are a number of different water treatment methods described, including boiling and heating water, filtering through gravel and sand, and dipping hot iron into it. 
In terms of water distribution, the earliest account of piping dates back to 3000 BCE, with Mesopotamia’s baked clay pipes, China’s bamboo pipes and Egypt’s copper sheets that were hammered into cylinders, all of which were used to transport water. In 400 BCE, Rome’s aqueduct system carried water throughout the entire city.
Pittsburgh as a city was established a little more recently than Rome, in 1816. Before the public water supply began in 1802 with the digging of four 47-foot wells, residents relied on river water. As the population grew, it became necessary to expand the water distribution, and the city built several pumping stations that pumped water directly from the rivers with no purification. By the end of the 19th century, however, the river water had become too contaminated and scientists had found evidence that drinking impure water could negatively affect health through waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever.
Thus, by 1905, construction began on plants that implemented slow sand filtration (SSF). SSF is a technique in which contaminated freshwater (river water, in Pittsburgh’s case) flows into a reservoir and through a layer of sand, where it is both physically filtered and biologically treated to remove pathogens and sediments. 
The key difference between SSF and rapid sand filtration (RSF), apart from the speed at which the water is filtered, is the fact that SSF is primarily biological while RSP is primarily physical. In SSF, a microbial community known as the “schmutzdecke” is established on the top layer of sand, causing the top layer to be biologically active. These predatory bacteria, which generally come from the source water, feed on microbes from the water that pass through the SSF, which is particularly effective in removing bacteria, viruses and heavy metals, but is not effective in removing chemicals. 
In 1911, the city began using chlorine as an additional disinfectant. Chlorination of water is the most commonly used method of killing microorganisms in freshwater. 
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, chlorine levels of up to four milligrams per liter are considered safe in drinking water. 
At this level, chlorine is effective against pathogenic bacteria, but not strong enough to kill all viruses, cysts and worms. However, combined with filtration, it is effective at disinfecting water supplies. 
By the second half of the 20th century, the SSF system had aged and an upgrade to the water purification system occurred in two stages. First, a clarifier pretreatment station was constructed in 1962 to chemically treat freshwater and remove iron, manganese, tastes, odors, and colors from the water before it reached filtration. Second, the SSF stations were replaced with RSF stations in 1969.
In 1984, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority (PWSA) was officially formed, taking charge of maintenance and construction of all water distribution systems in Pittsburgh. According to their website, PWSA’s vision is “to provide water and wastewater services that meet or exceed all regulations and customer expectations at the lowest possible cost.”
Last week, on Jan. 31, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority issued a precautionary flush and boil water advisory for residents of Pittsburgh. When testing near a Highland Park water filtration plant, some tests showed that the treated drinking water had levels of chlorine that were below regulation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environment (DEP); there was a risk that the treated drinking water still contained microorganisms. 
Later that day, the PWSA issued another statement saying they took the Highland Park plant out of service and added chlorine to the water to maintain DEP regulations.
On Feb. 2, the PWSA lifted the precautionary flush and boil water advisory, confirming that there was no longer a risk to the drinking water supply. Although the entire affair only took place over the course of a few days, it brings a sharp reminder that access to clean water is as much a privilege as it is a right..

2017-02-13,CMU,China,"On Tuesday, Feb. 7, Dr. Thomas S. Mullaney, Associate Professor of Chinese History at Stanford University, visited Carnegie Mellon University to discuss the history and development of Chinese computing, the topic of his upcoming book, The Chinese Typewriter. Mullaney specializes in the fields of East Asia, the History of Science, and Global History, and received his PhD from Columbia University. His works have been published in Journal of Asian Studies, The Atlantic, and the Los Angeles Times.
Invited to Pittsburgh by Carnegie Mellon’s Department of History, Mullaney presented his lecture, “The Ecologies of Chinese Computing.” He began by first explaining the fundamental difference between the characters of the Chinese language, and the letters of the Latin alphabet that dominate the Western world. There is no such thing as “typing” in Chinese. The language is written electronically by input, retrieving information from a database to print something on paper or on screen.
When Chinese linguists began to develop the Chinese typewriter in the early 20th century, Mullaney explained, they considered the basic idea of typing: what you type is what you get. In the 1940s, Lin Yutang, a Chinese linguist and inventor, introduced the concept of putting only the radicals that make up characters and several common characters on a keyboard because it is impossible to fit over 50,000 characters on a keyboard, compared to the 26 characters of the Latin alphabet. Instead, a typewriter would have a database of characters and parts of characters from which a writer would retrieve by pressing the keys.
Many different innovations have contributed to the progression of Chinese computing throughout the 20th century. One innovation Mullaney presented was predictive text, which placed characters next to each other that were commonly used together. For example, each of the characters in the name 'Mao Zedong' were spread apart on the keyboard, but through predictive text, were organized next to each other, which lends to quicker, more efficient typing. Another innovation was autocompletion, similar to today’s autocorrect. Because Chinese languages are not necessarily spelt, the concept of autocompletion is a retrieval mechanism. Not all of the parts of a character are needed to arrive at an unambiguous location in the character database to print the desired character.
Mullaney continued his argument by discussing the keyboard that the Chinese government developed in the closing years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). This keyboard had 256 keys, some with full-body characters, but mostly with bits and pieces of characters, bringing back Lin Yutang’s original ideas thirty years later. This keyboard was considered a medium-sized keyboard in comparison to the QWERTY keyboard used in the West. 
To bring his lecture to the present day, Mullaney conceded that in the 1990s, the Chinese input system slowly began to look just like the QWERTY keyboard. However, he labeled this era as “a nervous system of Input Wars,” when hundreds of different input systems in China were competing with one another all while standardization was becoming more common. Most of these systems were structure-based systems, not the Pinyin system — the input of romanized Chinese characters by pronunciation that we see so commonly today. One structure-based system still prominent today is the Wubi input system, which is much faster and transcends specific dialect pronunciation.
Mullaney also explained other input systems, such as shaped-based retrieval, which assigned characters to a particular shape of Latin characters, and the Double-pinyin method, which used Latin letters as variables for different elements of Chinese pronunciation. Though they are not in use, these systems are a testament of the creativity of Chinese linguists in a globalized world dominated by Latin languages, especially English.
Despite the prevalent use of the Pinyin system, Mullaney stressed that we should not assume that the 'phoneticization' of characters is complete or concrete. On the contrary, he said, the capacity of structure-based systems such as Wubi is great, beginning with their efficiency. 
At the end of his lecture, Mullaney challenged the audience to think about how Chinese computing has evolved, and how it will continue to evolve in the face of constant technological advancement. Mullaney’s upcoming book, The Chinese Typewriter, will be released in the summer of 2017..

2017-02-27,CMU,China,"Walking into the newest special exhibition at the Andy Warhol Museum, painted by artist Firelei Baez and titled Bloodlines, is like walking into a magical garden. Gorgeous, powerful women gaze out at the viewer from every wall, surrounded by intricate textures and floral designs. Contrary to what a lot of people think of when they hear the words ""contemporary art"", the show is accessible, pulling the viewer in with delicate flowers, fine hair textures, and curvaceous female forms running throughout the work in rich, dramatic colors. A wall stretching the length of the gallery was painted a soft blue and completely covered in floral medallions and elaborate patterns, and my first thought upon seeing it was, ‘I wish this was what my room looked like.’
But after the initial wave of wonder at the beauty of the space, the viewer begins to notice the complexity of the work. The woman brought to life in vivid reds with the stunningly beautiful headdress is actually wearing a tignon, a head covering required for free women of color in antebellum Louisiana to make them less attractive to white men. The women forced to wear tignons threw the attempted mark of inferiority back in the face of their oppressors and turned them into a fashion statement. The floral medallions on the installation contain the Black Panther symbol and the Black Power fist. Running throughout the whole exhibit is a complex interplay of symbols of race, repression, and resistance. Born to Haitian and Dominican parents, Baez’s work references the complexities of cultural diaspora from both a personal and global perspective but is ultimately an exquisite celebration of beauty in history and the individual.   
Baez is a Dominican woman based in New York. Bloodlines is her first solo show and is an impressive discussion of womanhood, globalism, and cultural traditions. At first, Baez’s paintings, with their emphasis on laborious detail and personal honesty, may seem like an odd choice for the Warhol. Warhol, with his quick and relatively easy screen prints and affectless persona, seems at odds with Baez. However, both artists work with cultural icons to highlight certain aspects of their society. Just as Andy Warhol’s work was a playful commentary on commercial icons, working with the construction of what defines an American identity, Baez works with the narrative of history of woman of color. The way we — immigrants, refugees, or people in countries who have experienced recent changes in political structure — understand history is blurry and incomplete. We understand it through an amalgamation of material cultural, aesthetics, and key stories.
Rather than in screenprints and photography, the media that brought fame to Warhol, Baez uses more traditional materials. Her exhibit consists of enormous paintings with the most delicate, precise brushwork. The use of acrylic, ink, and yupa paper in large scale gives the work a sense of nostalgia and a sense of love and care that allows you to feel the artist infusing herself into the narrative she is constructing and curating.
One of the most interesting things about the show is the way Baez uses repeated symbols and motifs to build meaning. The floral motifs on the walls appear in some of her paintings. Indigo and china patterns, colonial era crafts that came with famine and exploitation, bubble up in different parts of the room. And everywhere, there are references to textiles from different cultures.
Textiles' aesthetics are interesting for a number of reasons. Primarily, textiles evoke a sense of body and the history of women. They allude to complex stories of cultural exchange and oppression, which the audience and even the subject does not fully understand because of the scale and subjectivity of these narratives. For example, the painting of the tignon explores a complex relationship with the textile, painting the tignon in beautiful, rich patterns but also making it dominate the painting, simplifying the wearer to bright colors and removing all her facial features but her eyes, which stare emotively at the viewer, full of power. The Japanese brush painting and Indian block print patterns that reappear in multiple works reference not only the cultures they come from but also the commercializations of their aesthetics. The viewer is asked to consider the textiles involved in conventional, Western stores. Clothes and textiles are tools of oppression and empowerment — they are ways of controlling how others see you. They capture the social expectations of the time, but in every painting the woman is made the subject of an image to tell her own story. So, as much as Baez’s work focuses on historical narrative, it brings power to the women by placing control of the narrative in their presence.
Another repeated motif in the exhibit is, clearly, the female body and hair. They are used as symbolic tools to primarily to discuss gender and race. Her work references laws surrounding natural hair and the paper bag test — laws devised to define and control race in Caribbean society — challenging the viewer to categorize the multicultural, uncategorizable women and work before them, but it also alludes to legends and imagery from both Caribbean and western culture involving women as seductresses or monsters. Baez’s incredible ability to create beautiful textures of hair or fur in tiny brush work then creates a new narrative of these women. Breaking away from the Rubenesque figures, intended for aesthetics and titillation, her figures claim their presence in a style of art that recalls academic and anthropological drawing. Her figures hold their own, forcing the viewer to see them as individuals and not ephemeral sexual objects or a stand in for a larger culture.
Perhaps, though, the most impactful motif in the show is the grounding of the work in portraiture. The eyes, the body forms, the references to real world people and objects all make it so that the work is about people rather than general concepts. For centuries, artists have used eyes as a way of drawing the reader into a more psychological painting, and reading into their expression allows one to know the artist and their subject. The eyes in Baez’s work reflect power and pride. Self-portraiture is an element that Baez often comes back to in her work. This is such an important part of her work because vague references to historical narratives and aesthetic traditions on their own aren’t enough to connect with an audience, most of whom are likely not from the cultures being discussed. Because the self-portraiture allows her to lay claim to part of these stories, to say this is where she belongs and a part of who she is, we get a heightened level of intimacy with her work that makes it tenfold more impactful. It implies meaning beyond textiles, war, and colonialism — it gives us a peek into her own story and the love she gives to her subject matter.
The sensuality of form combined with the seriousness of subject matter in the show creates layers of stories that are difficult to untangle. The flowing forms from the acrylics and ink serve to further blur (literally and metaphorically) the intention of the symbolism in Baez’s work. It leaves us with a question: Where does her work fall in the world of activism and resistance? Artistic traditions tell us that there is power in representation — the Chicana art movement, for instance, worked with imagery of religion, womanhood, and industrialization to discuss social injustices, but what perhaps is most powerful in Baez’s work is that, in obfuscating meaning and central references through contradictions in symbolism and layers of narrative, it suggests there is power in moving beyond identity politics. That there is something universal about working to unravel who we are and where we come from, and in that moving beyond the hard lines of identity beyond easy communication we can share something more intimate and real..

2017-02-27,CMU,China,"Donald Trump rose to the presidency largely by preaching a populist message of economic nationalism to stand up to neoliberal corporate globalization. The president is to be commended for remaining consistent on that message when it comes to his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which gave provisions for corporations to change environmental, safety, and labor laws of sovereign nations without the consent of the governed through seeking arbitration in the corporate-representative dominated court known as the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). Still, whether Mr. Trump will actually make trade deals that advance the interests of workers remains to be seen, and the possibility exists that he might in fact make worse trade deals than the TPP. The opposite of anti-corporate economic nationalism is certainly being pursued, however, in the President’s tax plan, which portends an alarming ceding of American leadership and a threat to democracy and sovereignty around the world.
Despite the good of maintaining democratic institutions and sovereignty brought about by withdrawing from TPP and avoiding the ISDS, the downside is that it gives authoritarian China — under whose hegemony environmental, safety, and labor standards are also unlikely to be met — the upper-hand in setting economic conditions for the Asia-Pacific region. This abdication of American leadership in the region is all the more troubling considering that the Bank of China is a tenant in one of the president’s buildings, and the president may be paying back loans from China. However, the public cannot know if the loans are being paid, because the president has not released his taxes. Tough talk notwithstanding, Trump showed China a sign of warmth in his appointment of Governor Terry Branstad (R-IA), who has a relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping dating back to 1985, to be the U.S. ambassador to Beijing.
The president’s tax plan calls for corporate taxes to be lowered from 35 percent to 15 percent; the highest income tax bracket of individuals, who make $415,050 and over annually, to be lowered from 40 percent to 32 percent; and the lowest taxpaying bracket of individuals, who make $0 to $9275 annually, to be increased from 10 percent to 12 percent. Such tax cuts for the rich and corporations, besides causing unfair increased tax burdens on those less able to afford it, are widely considered to be laying the groundwork for an explosion in the national debt (the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates $10 trillion growth in debt over the next 10 years, playing into the hands of China who owns much of the debt. 
The Trump-GOP tax argument goes that in order to realistically provide Americans with jobs, the U.S. must repatriate billions of dollars of offshore corporate funds by incentivizing with a warmer business environment of deregulation and lower taxes. They claim the economy will grow so much by lowering restrictive taxes that government revenue will increase, despite taxing at a lower rate, because more people or items will be taxed than before since employment and consumption will increase substantially. However, the experience of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and H.W. Bush should show that revenue does not increase with supply-side economics because if taxes are effectively not being collected because they are so low during times of increased spending on the military and defense (as Mr. Trump proposes), then there will be no revenue for the government and debt will increase greatly as it indeed did under Reagan (from $1 trillion to $2.9 trillion, according to White House historical budget tables), which is why Bush famously, or rather infamously, had to raise taxes despite the campaign promise of his much-read lips.
Beyond a debt explosion, incentivizing corporations to repatriate funds to the U.S. does not actually guarantee substantial increase in good or equitable jobs. According to nonpartisan think tank, the Economic Policy Institute, “the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio, 20-to-1 in 1965, peaked at 376-to-1 in 2000 and was 303-to-1 in 2014, far higher than in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s.” Such pay disparity, combined with the President’s and the GOP’s opposition to raising the minimum wage, means that there is no guarantee that the jobs corporations provide are going to actually be well-paying. 
Corporations increasingly use automation to replace human workers, a practice championed by the President’s withdrawn Labor Secretary pick, Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. CEO Andy Puzder. A 2013 study by Oxford researchers Dr. Michael A. Osborne and Dr. Carl Benedikt Frey “estimated that 47 percent of jobs in the U.S. are ‘at risk’ of being automated in the next 20 years.” This means there is no guarantee that corporations repatriating funds will really result in substantial increases in human employees or that the jobs available will be not just accessible to those fortunate enough to receive university education. If the GOP is going to take credit for providing better, higher-paying jobs for Americans in engineering or robotics, then it must back that up by supporting universal access to education that will support those careers. The administration must at least execute a plan to significantly lower student debt. It is unlikely, however, that the GOP would advance an expensive idea like universal education to which they are currently ideologically opposed. 
Rather than beg corporations for alms in the form of employment by giving them carte blanche operation in our country, the U.S. should instead take the stance that our resources and labor force are valuable. It is the government acting on behalf of American workers that has leverage over corporations to demand that they pay their fair share of taxes, rather than let them off the hook with the excuse that they are job creators. With revenue from corporate taxes, the government, which is controlled by the will of the voters, rather than corporations controlled by the will of the Board of Directors, can then fund good jobs in public programs.  Furthermore, the U.S. should use its great influence to lead other countries to tax corporations their fair share so nations do not undergo a Hobbesian process of undercutting each other’s corporate tax rates, which is exactly the division that the corporate elites use to conquer.  .

2017-04-03,CMU,China,"As part of this year’s program of Energy Week at Carnegie Mellon, which consisted of activities related to the energy sector and energy issues facing society, Carnegie Mellon students and members of the community had the chance to attend various lectures given by distinguished professors and scientists working in energy-related fields. Marcia McNutt, who last year became the president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and who was previously the first female editor-in-chief of the journal Science and led the United States Geological Survey, gave one of the lectures.
The lecture began with Dr. Jared Cohon, the director of Scott Institute and former president of Carnegie Mellon, giving a welcome address and thanking the many sponsors of Energy Week. He introduced the role of Scott Institute in addressing today’s energy issues and recognized the attendees who had played a major role in the institute. Next, Provost Farnam Jahanian introduced McNutt with a statement on how science is a core part of America’s national identity while also recognizing Cohon for the work he has done for the university, even after stepping down as university president.
McNutt’s lecture primarily introduced different reports that the NAS has compiled over the years on energy-sector related subjects. First, she briefly described the history of the NAS, which was created by President Lincoln and chartered by Congress for the purpose of advising the legislative body. The NAS puts out around 200 reports a year on widely varying scientific disciplines, but McNutt emphasized that many of them match the themes of Energy Week: policy, research, education, and looking toward the future. Through her lecture, McNutt aimed to showcase how useful these reports can be.
The first report she introduced was a 2016 study, titled “Analytic Research Foundations for the Next Generation Electric Grid,” which described the characteristics that a modernized energy grid should have in order to meet society’s future needs — for example, the need for alternative energy sources for electric cars. The characteristics they found necessary include customer participation, integration of generation and storage options, new markets and operations, high quality of power, operation efficiency and asset optimization, and resiliency against attacks and disasters.
She also emphasized the importance of the grid being able to handle and analyze large amounts of data in real-time in optimizing the performance. As an example of modernizing the grid, McNutt mentioned that her home in California is a home that produces as much energy as it uses via solar panels.
Another significant report was one regarding the potential of using algae and cyanobacteria as sources of future biofuels. Using algae as a biofuel source has several advantages — energy security, no net greenhouse gas emissions, high biomass productivity, and the fact that it doesn’t compete with food, unlike other crops that are grown for biofuels, such as corn. However, the NAS report concluded that more research is still needed to make algal biofuels sustainable in the long run.
McNutt also mentioned a rare two-nation study that was commissioned by both the U.S. and China. Because the U.S. and China are the two top energy consumers of the world, the nations agreed to jointly research areas of renewable energy development which would be ripe for cooperation rather than competition. The collaborative areas identified were basic and pre-commercial research, the proper mapping of production sites, operations and management, recycling materials, and setting standards
Another study that tied together policy and energy identified the impacts of U.S. tax policy on greenhouse gas emissions. The report assesses different facets of U.S. energy-related tax policies — fuel taxes, renewable energy production credits, depletion allowances for oil and gas, home efficiency improvement credits, nuclear decommissioning tax preference, and aviation fuel taxes — on the levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The report concluded that while fuel taxes, production credits, and efficiency improvement credits helped lower greenhouse gases, the depletion allowances and nuclear decommissioning tax preference did not have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
McNutt highlighted one study that she thought was particularly important which discussed the hidden costs of energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar, and biofuels. The report concluded that the biggest quantifiable hidden costs were greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. It stated that developing tar sands would worsen both costs while using renewable energy sources would lower them.
McNutt mentioned an array of other studies, on topics from the impact of the Helium Privatization Act to the prospects of LED lighting. She concluded the lecture by thanking several people from Carnegie Mellon who contributed significantly to the reports she presented.
At a post-lecture interview, McNutt was asked about her views on the upcoming March on Science, which will be held in cities nationwide on Earth Day, April 22.
“It is their civic duty to show their support for science, [and] to show that science matters,” she said in response.
She voices her concern whenever she hears people denying well-established climate science, and takes to Twitter to point people in the right direction on the subject. However, she expressed a note of caution to people interested in participating in the march. “I think it’s important that they march for science — that they not march against anything else. I would be concerned if they marched against the budget, or they marched against the administration,” she argued.
Citing her familiarity with the budget process as the former director of the U.S. Geological Survey, she advised that people should not jump to conclusions about policies too early since it generally takes a long time for anything to become law. Her primary concern was that scientists would come across as a special interest group, further politicizing what should be a neutral, fact-based subject. But despite these concerns, she says that voicing support of science is something people “should be doing as citizens.”.

2017-04-10,CMU,China,"On Thursday, April 9, President Donald Trump ordered the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles, which struck Al Shayrat airfield in Syria and resulted in the deaths of 15 people and further uncertain global consequences.
According to Trump, the decision to launch the missiles was a direct response to the brutal chemical attack that killed dozens of people — many of them children — in the Idlib province in northwestern Syria on April 4. He said it was “vital [to] national security” that the United States “prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,” mentioning despair over the infants who were harmed and an overall desire to “end the slaughter and bloodshed” as an explanation for his actions — sympathies that many Americans share and want our country to act on.
But Trump, who was resolutely against taking actionagainst Syria until this decision, acted quickly and without the approval of Congress — for all we know, he acted without any concrete plans for his next move at all. Furthermore, he may have inspired the disapproval, or downright anger, of many other countries thanks to his impulsive choice. Russia has condemned the strike as a “disgraceful attack,” and Germany and France have refused to endorse the attack.
Tuesday’s chemical attack, which reportedly originated at the airfield, was carried out early in the morning when many were still sleeping. Eyewitnesses at the scene reported waking to the sound of an explosion, only to go outside and find people in the street choking and unable to move, with constricted pupils. Other symptoms included vomiting, fainting, and foaming at the mouth. Later in the day, rockets were fired at the hospitals and clinics treating the survivors of the first attack, burying doctors and patients in rubble.
The death toll of the attacks varies by account, but most likely falls somewhere between 50 and 100 — and the number injured throughout the day is thought to be much greater. Both the Syrian government and the Russian government  are denying their involvement in the attacks, but the United States maintains that Syria was behind the attack and Russia was “complicit.”
Trump’s decision to attack the airfield may be an important first step in the effort to put an end to the excessive violence against the Syrian people, but it’s too soon to say. At this point, we have no way of knowing that his actions won’t also have harmful consequences of their own. Based on his record and what we know about the attack, there is reason to doubt whether he even considered such an impact before moving forward with the attack.
Concerning to many is the fact that Congress was not involved in the decision to launch the missiles. Trump ordered the attack after only two days of deliberations with his own security advisors — and some meetings actually took place, not in the White House, but at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
Whether the strike was legal in the United States or not is the subject of debate in the media — murky precedents regarding national interests, the War Powers Resolution, and the actions of former presidents have been used to frame the decision as a misuse of presidential powers or a justified humanitarian intervention that will also protect American interests in the end. Either way, involving more people in the decision would have been a guarantee that the possible consequences of the strike had been more thoroughly considered and accounted for in plans for the future.
Such repercussions, if they come, would develop from the international response to the strike. Already, countries have been responding to Trump’s decision, and some of their reactions haven’t been very supportive. Russia, Iran, and China strongly oppose the strike, condemning the United States’ decision and even suggesting that Trump violated international policies by acting against Syria.
More complications could ensue if it turns out that Trump did break international law. According to the United Nations Charter, which the United States has ratified, the only valid reasons for using force on another country’s soil are for self defense, or with the permission of the United Nations Security Council. Trump’s reason for attack — preventing Syria from further use of chemical weapons — was not self defense. The Council, like Congress, was not a part of Trump’s decision. One can argue many reasons why the attacks were necessary, and many reasons why they weren’t. What remains, however, is that the decision should have been more carefully deliberated.
Can we applaud the choices of a man who acts with no serious thought for those he leads or what impact his impulses may have on a global scale? Can we condemn an action that might have been an important stand against the slaughter of innocent men, women, and children in a country that has suffered for far too long? With an issue as nuanced and volatile as this one, perhaps the best way forward is one that involves many careful minds working together and carefully weighing every option. Trump needs to be sure he comprehends the serious impact his actions could have as he considers his next move. The lives of those suffering in Syria are of utmost importance, but so is the safety of Americans and other people across the globe..

2017-04-17,CMU,China,"Members of Carnegie Mellon Student Pugwash attended the Student Pugwash Conference 2017 at Purdue University. The conference focused on space exploration and policy, ranging from topics like “Repeat Mars Missions” to the “Future of International Space Exploration”. Each of these talks had interesting angles on how the world could approach space exploration. This article focuses on the talk on international progress on space ight given by Dr. Daniel Dumbacher.
Dumbacher framed the entire presentation in the form of the past, present, and future. For the past, he focused on the progress of the United States in space exploration, starting with the last lunar mission and ending with the closing of the space shuttle program. He also noted that, at the moment, space exploration has ventured to every planet in the solar system. Dumbacher drew parallels between space exploration and the Lewis and
Clark expeditions, suggesting that expeditions in unknown territory result in the eventual expansion.
He moved on to the current state of space exploration. At the moment, the International Space Station (ISS) remains one of the few international projects still in operation. There are also robotic exploration missions on Mars. Currently, the biggest movement in space exploration is commercial space ight. Companies are driving new and innovative technologies like reusable spacecraft.
The current plan for space exploration follows  ve phases. Phase zero, the current phase, focuses on continued experimentation on the challenges of space-  ight on the International Space Station. Phase one will include missions in cislunar space with emphasis on deep space transportation. After this, we must face phase two’s emphasis on deep space transport, which includes continued missions to the moon. Phase three will start testing the viability of manned Mars missions. From there, in two more phases, humanity could potentially accomplish the goal of manned missions to Mars.
First, we must tackle the question, “How can this all be done?” The solution to this would be a focus on a space- centered economy. Such focus would spur the development of technologies that bene t terrestrial and space society. At the moment, one example of a block to such international cooperation is the status of China in space. China was blocked from access to the ISS, so it produced its own space program and station.
Another issue is time. Dumbacher suggested that space exploration may follow the rise of commercial aircraft. Aircraft arose through many years of development and growth, with gradual growth in adoption. Similar development processes occurred with the prevalence of computers and cell phones. Dumbacher suggested that, although space exploration and travel is pricey, with time it may become some- thing attainable to the public. Maybe, even space tourism could be on the table..

2017-04-24,CMU,China,"As part of Carnegie Mellon’s Information Networking Institute (INI) celebration of Carnival weekend, Valerie Plame was invited to give a keynote speech on the issues of nuclear proliferation and cybersecurity, two major threats that affect all of us today.
When you meet her, Plame may look like a regular activist for causes that all of us can relate to. But many may also remember her as the subject of the infamous 2003 Plame affair, which ended her twenty-year career as a covert CIA agent.
In her keynote, Plame gave a brief overview of the events leading to her career at the CIA and the subsequent Plame affair. She described herself as “very honored” to have had the opportunity to serve her country by working for the CIA, continuing her family’s legacy of public service. Her expertise was in the issue of nuclear proliferation and the covert cyber-operations relating to it. She described the multifaceted training that she had to undergo, which included surviving in the wilderness, jumping out of planes, shooting automatic weapons, and recruiting foreign intelligence sources.
In the years after 9/11, the U.S. government was preparing to invade Iraq with the justification that Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons. Her husband, a diplomat named Joe Wilson, went to Niger to investigate uranium transactions there and to figure out if any of them involved the Hussein regime. Wilson concluded that America’s justification for the war was false because he could find no evidence that Saddam Hussein was trying to buy nuclear weapons or nuclear material. After the war started, Wilson wrote a column discussing his findings. Shortly after, Plame’s identity as a covert CIA agent was leaked to the Washington Post, which she believed was done by administration officials as political retaliation for her husband’s article. She was forced to resign from the CIA. Plame described the situation at that time as a “complete loss of privacy.”
“You don’t know what it’s like until you have photographers on your lawn snapping pictures of your toddlers,” she remarked, reflecting her concern at that time about the safety of her family and the intelligence networks she had cultivated for two decades. She believed that the media firestorm and personal attacks on her that resulted reflected the increasing unpopularity of the war among citizens. The leak became known as the Plame affair.
After summarizing her story, she moved on to the topic of nuclear proliferation. She first started by calling election night “just ugly,” and said that the current president is very unstable and says many conflicting things. She remarked that none of the attributes she just described of President Trump “should be in the same sentence as nuclear weapons.” She believes the problem isn’t that President Trump has access to the nuclear codes — it’s that they even exist in the first place.
Plame gave a brief history of nuclear weapons, starting with the Cold War. During that time, there was a policy of mutual annihilation if either the Americans or the Russians were to use nuclear weapons, which worked as a deterrent. However, by 1982, American citizens got tired of this perpetual brink-of-war state and approximately a million of them took to Central Park to protest the existence of nuclear weapons. She remarked that the good thing that came out of it is that the American stockpile has been reduced from 60,000 nuclear weapons during the height of the Cold War to 15,000 today. The protests in 1982 forced Reagan to talk with the Soviets and come up with an agreement to destroy nuclear weapons. Some of these materials were used for nuclear power plants. Yet this decommissioning of nuclear weapons has reversed for a few reasons — there are more countries with nuclear weapons now (nine instead of two), terrorists have increased interest in attaining them, and there has been a rise of new U.S.-Russia tensions.
Plame brought up an issue that she said “rarely comes up in discussions” about nuclear weapons: the President is not legally required to consult with anyone before he launches a nuclear strike, because nuclear weapons are on “high alert” status. She believes that people now are less aware of the nuclear threat than they were during the Cold War, and one of her goals as an activist is to raise awareness among the public on this issue.
Despite criticizing Trump for being unstable and unpredictable, Plame said that the president can lead the world into nuclear disarmament if he decides to. She suggested a few policies the president could change to lessen the nuclear threat, such as changing the high-alert status of nuclear weapons and changing the policy of nuclear-striking anyone who uses nuclear weapons in the world.
She also discussed cybersecurity, which is increasingly important as we become more connected than ever before. As an example of how much of a threat poor cybersecurity can pose, she cited the example of a bank whose computer system was hijacked in a sophisticated attack that took over the systems and obtained a lot of confidential information. She offered an analysis on why some hostile parties act the way they do: Russia to carve out a sphere of influence, China because it is behind the U.S., Iran because it wants to be a revolutionary (she believes the deal is essential to keeping Iran from disrupting the US more), North Korea because it is starving for attention, and terrorists because they’re just hateful. She believes the Sony and Democratic Party hacks were influence operations, and that in terms of cyber attacks, it just keeps escalating and there is little deterrence in play.
As a way to tackle cybersecurity issues, she said that the government must support the private sector more instead of making them comply with orders from the Department of Defense. This way, it would be easier to cooperate in the event of a cyber-threat and make use of the advantages that the private and public sector each have.
During her conclusion, Plame asserted that we are living in unprecedented times. While we often shake our heads at every blunder — she gave the examples of Sean Spicer’s botched comparison of Hitler and Assad and United’s violent removal of a passenger from an overbooked flight — this leads us to lose sight of the real threats out there. She called for more diplomacy and increased citizen engagement and knowledge in regards to social issues. She also encouraged young people to explore public service as a potential career, despite lower pay and what she termed her “crazy story.”.

2017-05-01,CMU,China,"Prior to the 2016 presidential election, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump released the ""Donald Trump’s Contract with the American Voter."" By doing so, he announced his ""100-day action plan to Make America Great Again"" for the first days in office. He packed his first 100 days to the brim with controversial plans that would, as proud Trump supporter Tomi Lahren stated, ""shake up Washington."" On January 20, 2017, Trump was sworn into office, and the first hundred days began.
Although the majority of voters who cast their ballots for Trump do not regret their vote, Trump's presidency had a 44 percent approval rating, making it the first time in the history of modern polling in the U.S. when the majority of U.S. citizens did not approve of their president at such an early juncture. These statistics have come to life on the streets through events such as the Women's March, A Day Without Immigrants, and the March for Science. Even Trump himself seems to be at least somewhat unhappy with his presidency. In a recent interview with Reuters, he stated that he expected being president would ""be easier"" than his old life and in fact misses his ""old life."" Of course, Trump is not the first president to express nostalgia, but it seems rather unusual that he shares this sentiment so soon after becoming president.
Regardless of expectations, it is important to not delve too far into the pathos of Trump's presidency and remain conscientious of both the ethos and logos. With Trump having just passed the hundred day mark on April 30, 2017, it is time to reflect back on his contract and evaluate how well he has kept his promises and trust with the American people.
He had three main objectives for his first days in office. The first was to drain the swamp in D.C. By doing so, he hoped to restore the public's trust in the government and bring change to Washington. However, the extent to which D.C. continues to be swamped is debatable. With such controversial picks such as Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Trump has definitely hosted a radically different environment from the one under the Obama administration. Despite the credentials that many of Trump's picks lack, perhaps he felt that their connections to key special interests would compensate for their shortcomings.
The next goal was to take measures in protecting American workers. Trump saw, and currently sees, trade as a potential threat to America, hence his announcing a plan to renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He denounced the TPP as a step towards the ""continuing rape of our country."" Furthermore, he wanted to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. Trump did withdraw from the TPP via executive order. However, he backed out of withdrawing from NAFTA; Trump's team was divided, and President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto, as well as Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, greatly discouraged him from doing so. Just as Trump's opinion on NAFTA shifted significantly, so did his stance on China. Trump no longer publicly denounces China as a currency manipulator. Rather, he is trying to create a stronger relationship with China in order to potentially gain help from China in confronting North Korea, which he sees as a top threat.
The final task to accomplish was to restore law and order, just as he promised in the presidential debates held prior to the election. This involved stringent regulations for immigration and the implementation of what he and his administration described as ""extreme vetting."" Although he was not implementing these policies unopposed, he has been somewhat successful in keeping his promises. His controversial temporary travel ban barred people arriving from seven dominantly-Muslim countries from entering America, and as a consequence, an undetermined number of U.S. residents were left unable to return to the country after traveling. However, the endeavors of Trump and his administration do not stop there — there are still strides being made to deport illegal immigrants regardless of the lack of criminal records, and more plans to enforce the immigration ban that could even cause the First Lady to be deported. Of course, law and order would not be complete without his firm plans on building the wall, which has remained constant throughout the campaign trail and his presidency despite the billions of dollars that would be involved in a wall that may be ineffective against immigration across the southern border.
The Trump administration has been eventful, to say the least. He has signed 30 executive orders, more than any other president has within his respective first hundred days in office. Already, Trump has had a rough beginning of his presidency, leading to many questioning his abilities to be president at all. However, at the current trajectory America is heading towards, the people must live under a Trump administration for just over 1,200 days, and whatever course of action Trump takes next is surely to be marked in history..

2017-09-11,CMU,China,"Hurricane Harvey inundated much of Houston in several inches of water in a matter of days. This week, Hur- ricane Irma’s 185 mph winds are devastating the Caribbean and heading for Florida next. We’re right in the grips of hurricane season, so it seems like there’s a storm every other week. In fact, there are two others forming in the Gulf of Mexico right now: Hurricanes José and Katia.
I found myself asking what exactly causes such power- ful storms, and why they occur at this time of the year, every year. I wonder if these storms are getting stronger and more disastrous with time (Irma is the strongest recorded hurricane), and if climate change is to blame. Is such a quick succession of storms normal, or are we see- ing something that has never happened before? Some of these questions have de nite answers, and the others are more ambiguous, so let’s begin from the top.
A hurricane is a rapidly rotating storm system with a low pressure center (called an eye). These storms are characterized by heavy rain and strong winds. Hurricanes are always born over oceans in tropic regions. They can range in diameter from 100 km to 2,000 km (about the width of Brazil), packing more energy than several nuclear bombs combined.
Large bodies of warm water cause hurricanes, acting as their energy source; the tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are most opportune. Angular momentum imparted by the Earth’s rotation, along with ocean currents and temperature changes along latitudes and longitudes drive the swirling winds. All three of these factors are needed to sustain strong storm systems, which is why hurricanes quickly dissipate upon landfall.
So many other factors affect hurricane formation. For example, the southern hemisphere experiences fewer hurricanes because of its high rates of vertical wind shear and low number of oceanic jets.
I've always thought hurricanes have interesting names: Katrina, Ike, Harvey. It turns out these aren’t randomly selected, or the names of the meteorologists who first spot the storm forming (a false claim I believed for years). They're names chosen from a register controlled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which meets annually to discuss the storms of the season and retire hurricane names. If more than 21 storms strike in a season, names are then chosen from the Greek alphabet.
Hurricanes aren’t all doom and gloom. They disrupt harmful weather patterns, preventing susceptible areas from prolonged droughts. They also carry thermal energy away from the tropical regions and distribute it to the higher altitudes, helping to regulate global climates.
What I want to know is if the 2017 hurricane season is unusual. I don’t ever recall seeing such strong hurricanes strike in such quick succession. Moreover, scientists have always warned that severe climate change will exacerbate natural disasters. Is that what we’re witnessing right now?
Firstly, it turns out 2007 saw the greatest number of hurricanes in a single year, so 2017 has competition. Secondly, scientists and news outlets have concluded that unusually warm oceans gave Hurricane Irma its record-breaking strength. Hovering over waters at 29 degrees, Irma has access to leagues of energy.
Interestingly, hurricanes aren’t unique to Earth’s atmosphere. The most well known extraterrestrial storm is the Great Red Spot, found on Jupiter. This swirling cloud of red gas is larger in diameter than the Earth itself, and is essentially perpetual; it has been observed continually for 187 years (since 1830). The high pressure zone below Jupiter’s equator is ample for forming what’s called an anticyclone.
Hurricanes are a natural consequence of classic physical principles like conservation of energy and angular momentum. Even though they deliver unimaginable damage and destruction to coastal populations, hurricanes also regulate the atmosphere and dissipate energy concentrated at the equator.
Perhaps, the most unfortunate aspect of hurricanes is that they devastate regions that do not greatly contribute to global warming. The Caribbean islands and coastal towns, for example, will bare the brunt of even more powerful storms in the future, as large industrial nations like China, India, Russia, and the United States continue to pump large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
There is no quick fix. Agreements like the Paris Accord might not do enough or act fast enough. Until we change our relationship with energy and fossil fuels, natural distaters will only increase in strength and category..

2017-09-18,CMU,China,"Karl Marx has a legacy and influence that has dramatically changed everyday political and social life. The Prussian-born political and economic theorist is best known for the Manifesto of the Communist Party (colloquially known as The Communist Manifesto), which he co-authored with colleague Friedrich Engels, and Capital, a seminal text in politics, economics, and philosophy. The influential political philosopher, born on May 5, 1818, is now more relevant than ever due to increasing income inequality, the aftermath of the global financial crash in 2008, and a new skepticism of capitalism among the post-Cold War generation.
Dietrich College faculty members Kathy M. Newman and David Shumway have created a year-long series of celebratory events that will culminate on Marx’s 200th birthday this spring. This series of events — Marx@200 — is one of the nation’s only year-long programs devoted to Marx and his favorite themes.
On Thursday, Sept. 14, Marx@200 kicked off with Newman and Shumway’s lecture, “Why Marx Now: 200 Years Later.” Richard Scheines, Dean of Dietrich College, was first to speak and provided welcoming remarks as well his personal experience with Marx growing up. For most of Scheines’ early years, Karl Marx was known as the “author of Communism,” and as a child raised in the aftermath of McCarthyism, Scheines was unsurprisingly a product of anti-communist propaganda, where none of his high school education “even probed slightly beneath the surface” of Marxism. What struck him in this experience is the importance of institutions like Carnegie Mellon to support the freedom of thinking beyond the propaganda every citizen experiences from birth. Individuals must take seriously the role of incorporating all political perspectives, and they “can’t be unwilling to celebrate Marx,” or be dismissive of any thought that might compromise conventional thought. The series of scholarly events to celebrate Karl Marx supports this notion.
Kathy Newman, an associate professor in the department of English, studies and writes about the relationship between the masses and mass culture, specifically the relationship between television, film, and media, and the socio-political world our culture reflects and creates. The theme of her talk incorporated artists like Wang Yuyand, Claire Fontaine, Jorge Mendez Blake, and Christin Lahr, with Marx being their common denominator. Some like Fontaine delve deeply into Marx’s philosophy, using art as modern tongue-in-cheek commentary, while others like Wang Yuyand take the literal substance and translate it into data, combinations of 1s and 0s, to create morphed and distorted sculptures.
The modern resurgence of Marxism surpasses art, said Newman as she described the international phenomenon of Marx’s popularity. East Germans are especially affected, “rooted in nostalgia for socialism.” A Guardian survey found that 52 percent of their citizens believed the free market was unsuitable, and 43 percent said they want socialism back. As the single most cited scholar in the humanities by a factor of 22, Marx has become steadily more popular around the globe and Newman moves on to speculate why.
Newman’s first hypothesis for the growing popularity of Marxism was the global financial collapse of 2008, which “made Marx’s critique of capitalism look fresher than ever.” Marx predicted cycles of collapse and consolidation and his analysis explains how inequality deepens during times of capitalist crisis. Moreover, the post-Cold War generation view socialism and communism more favorably than during anytime since the 1940s. Newman referenced a scholar at Tufts University who claimed that millennials are more skeptical towards capitalism than their parents, especially because many of them graduated into the worst job market since the Great Depression. Millennials also see Scandinavian countries as models of democratic socialism, rather than current or former communist countries like Russia and China. This is not so much for a utopian inspiration, but instead they are seeking to understand all the ways capitalism is failing ordinary people. They’re bringing us a Marx whose contemporary value is in explanation and critique.
David Shumway, professor of English, mirrored Newman’s arguments through a different lens, as noted by the title for his part of the talk, “How Marx Now,” instead of “Why Marx now.” The ability to reexamine Marx can transform the understanding of Marxism, and this reexamination is the foundation of Shumway’s lecture.
Shumway’s arguments were that Marx is best understood as a liberal and not an opponent of liberalism, and that historically, Marx has made a significant impact on politics that is seldom recognized, which is that his ideas are the basis for the many changes in liberal democracies associated with the welfare state. From the translation of Marxist ideas into new policies, Shumway contends that Marx’s influence, despite the fact that a literal interpretation of his views at the time which would be against social democratic reforms, gave way to the right and inevitable rise of the political system. Shumway uses text from Capital to enhance his arguments. He emphasizes the value of freedom on both ends, for the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is just that the dictatorship of the proletariat will be more liberal than the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
In the wake of extreme political and economic unrest before the 1950s, many western countries turned into welfare states, where national governments take at least some responsibility for the welfare of their citizens. The fear of a communist revolution led the bourgeoisie to concede some economic authority to the public. Thus, fear of the extreme left allowed a more moderate left to rise. Marx was accidentally the founder of social democracy, formed out of the dregs of bourgeois fear.
Both lectures sufficiently summed up the relevance and importance of Marx in the modern age. As we look ahead to the rest of the year and the uncertainty of our current economic and socio-political landscape, we know that for whatever large-scale issue that will be thrown at us, Marxism can offer a theory of its underlying causes. The next Marx@200 event will take place on Thursday, Oct. 19 at 4:30 p.m. in Porter Hall 100 entitled “Robotics, Pittsburgh, and the End of Work.”.

2017-09-18,CMU,China,"Privilege — a word we’ve all become acquaintanced with. We are constantly told to check how aspects of our lives, many of which are outside our control, give us societal advantages and blind us from potential hardships others face. White privilege, male privilege, class privilege... we have heard about those. It is important to keep this dialogue going and understand how our privilege can shape our perspectives so that we can better understand those from varying backgrounds. However, there is one that is not discussed but probably should be, especially in light of current events such as the current political climate in Venezuela, which is currently heading toward a dictatorship.
The privilege of not having dealt with the impacts of communism is the one we will be discussing today.
I am privileged in this sense, too. The only exposure to communism that I have faced was reading about it from a safe distance in the comfort of the school’s classroom. I could read and stay up studying for my exam on the Cold War, but I understand that learning about the facts in such a sheltered environment could not fully convey the human costs that communism bore.
I can fully understand why one may find communism appealing, especially in this political climate. In a time when job prospects look bleak at best and the gap between the economic haves and have-nots increase, people want change from the status quo and will be more willing to risk venturing off to an economic policy that promises a chance for equity and overall well-being for all, not just a select few.
It is worth stating that every economic ideology has flaws. A pure laissez-faire economy is another extreme end that is not sustainable, and economists will generally agree that some government intervention is necessary to ensure a fair economy. One of the ten principles of economics states that “governments can sometimes improve economic outcomes.” By stimulating the economy when the market is not running smoothly, government can stimulate an otherwise struggling market and give it the boost that it needs to pick back up again.
Thus, we find ourselves in the middle — a relatively free market that provides some subsidies as a safety net to provide for the poor. Services such as food stamps and unemployment benefits attempt to close the gap between those who are and are not struggling socioeconomically. However, many could argue that society is not doing enough and that the people deserve a much more radical change — specifically, breaking away from capitalism and straight into communism.
To some extent, this seems logical. If something is failing — in this case, our economic policies — try to implement a change in input to get a change in output. However, we cannot dismiss history or contemporary events while we make our decisions. To be able to dismiss the hundreds of lives affected by China’s Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) or the rising death tolln Venezuela now as “not real communism” is to display one’s privilege and complacency. Perhaps these were horrible implementations of communism, but it is worth noting that one of the problems with communism is that people are virtually incapable, if not completely, of transforming this utopia into reality.
This was seen here at Carnegie Mellon on Sept. 13 in Porter Hall 100. English professors Kathy M. Newman and David Shumway discussed communism through differing lenses. Professor Newman used the visual arts, which illustrated Marx as if he were a pop icon instead of a theorist, and Professor Shumway used reasoning to explain the logistics behind communism. The artwork could be universally agreed to be aesthetically pleasing regardless of politics, and the wish for communism was logical. No sound person would be able to object to a society where liberty and equality reign, yet the actual implementation of Marx’s utopia is not nearly as simple as verbally advocating freedom and equality. Yes, capitalism has heavy flaws, and people from all areas of the political spectrum must converge to create a society in which we can ensure the well-being of our people and our society as a whole. However, forcing a radical economic change, especially one in a short amount of time, is catastrophic at best.
Perhaps Karl Marx had his heart in the right place, and perhaps he would have been appalled that his ideology was used to defend the regimes that claimed to center around his vision. However, the fragility between life and death is merciless and does not bow down to intention. Che Guevara, who originally wanted to end class struggles and emotionally expressed it in his autobiography The Motorcycle Diaries, ended up claiming lives in order to progress his ideology. Fidel Castro, whom Justin Trudeau infamously considered a ""friend"", had a drastically different perception by Florida senator and Cuban-American Marco Rubio, who felt the impact from a far more personal level.
Not having been impacted by communism is not the issue at hand. Willfully ignoring the blood on communist regimes’ and rulers’ hands is..

2017-10-30,CMU,China,"A new artificial intelligence (AI) has reached a new landmark in mastering the strategy game of Go, shattering records using a fraction of its predecessor’s time and processing power.
Go is an ancient Chinese board game several thousand years old, with strategies and goals similar to chess. In Go, the players win by surrounding opponents’ pieces with their own.
AlphaGo, a computer program that plays the board game Go, made revolutionary achievements last year when it beat two of the world’s greatest Go players: South Korea’s Lee Se-dol and China’s Ke Jie. AlphaGo, developed by Google DeepMind in London, has been in the limelight for months, partially because its victory over human players came much earlier than expected. Because Go is an extremely complex mind game with more possible legal moves than there are atoms in the universe, AlphaGo’s win marked a huge milestone in the development of AI.
But just a few days ago, a new program called AlphaGo Zero vastly surpassed the feats made by AlphaGo. AlphaGo Zero “began with a blank Go board and no data apart from the rules, and then played itself,” according to BBC News. Within 72 hours of being given the rules of Go, AlphaGo Zero beat AlphaGo 100 games to zero. While AlphaGo took a few months for it to be developed enough to beat professional Go players, AlphaGo Zero took just three days, despite taking less processing power than its predecessor.
Board games like Go are one of the most effective ways to test the potential of AI software. Because these games involve responding to a separate player’s moves, winning the game requires more than just the average algorithms used in computer software; the software needs to mimic processes that take place in the human brain.
In addition to AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Google DeepMind has also developed another AI: an algorithm known as the deep Q-network. The deep Q-network was presented at the 2016 WIRED event, a large-scale conference for business professionals to present industry developments. DeepMind’s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman showed that the deep Q-network had learned to play 49 Atari 2600 video games given only the bare minimum amount of background information. The AI agent had mastered various types of games, from martial arts games to boxing games to 3D car racing games.
These are all significant improvements in the field of artificial intelligence and computer programming, indicating a more promising future for areas other than just board games where AI can have an influence. According to Demis Hassabis, a DeepMind co-founder and chief executive, researchers’ knowledge of complex algorithms has impacts far beyond beating world-class game professionals. “This is just games, but it could be stock market data,” Hassabis said. “DeepMind has been combining two promising areas of research — a deep neural network and a reinforcement-learning algorithm — in a really fundamental way. We’re interested in algorithms that can use their learning from one domain and apply that knowledge to a new domain.”
From DeepMind’s relatively older efforts in developing artificial intelligence to the more recent achievements by AlphaGo Zero, work done by researchers in AI is yielding results with a clear trend: computer software is beginning to outsmart humans. Earlier versions of Go software based their moves upon human strategies; AlphaGo Zero developed techniques that professional players had never seen before. In other words, the constraints of human knowledge no longer restrict the potential of AI — it is able to create new knowledge from a completely blank slate, with minimal human input.
Though this is a huge achievement deserving worldwide attention and applause, at this point we should be asking ourselves: what does this mean for the future of humanity?.

2017-11-06,CMU,China,"Since the country was founded, the rhetoric of U.S. immigration policy has been a major focus of politicians. This holds especially true for the most recent presidential election cycle. Current U.S. President Donald Trump quite literally made the “wall” — metaphorical or physical — the slogan of his campaign, proposing a supposedly simple and clear-cut strategy to magically solve all the problems going on in this nation by keeping the people he views as inferior out.
As ridiculous as this kind of argument sounds, Trump went on to become the most powerful man in the country and is now implementing a plan against immigration in a country that was essentially built on immigration.
And yes, it’s sadly true that you have probably heard this argument enough times that you have grown numb to the unfortunate situations of undocumented immigrants; there’s not much you can do about it, because you are probably just an idealistic, powerless student. The situation is probably not that relatable anyway, because most of us at the university are either protected by the country as citizens or permanent residents, or are here with a valid visa, which means we don’t have to worry too much about being deported for literally just breathing the air in the United States. Maybe you even developed some kind of psychological coping mechanism and have already accepted the fact that life is just unfair like this. But for some, the problem is far more pressing, and far harder to escape.
Earlier this week, a children’s health facility in San Antonio, TX received ten-year-old Maria Hernandez, who has cerebral palsy. She was rushed to the hospital to undergo emergency gallbladder surgery. Her mother, who lives in Laredo illegally, could not come with her past the checkpoint north of the city. She is not alone, however. Her hospital room is guarded by police from Border Patrol, waiting to deport her right after she is released from the hospital.
And her way to the hospital was not exactly smooth. Diagnosed with several kidney stones about a month ago, Hernandez’s doctor said she would need an emergency gallbladder surgery. Her ambulance was, however, stopped at the border to Texas that is located after Laredo because of the new hard-line policy put in place by the Trump administration. She was detained at the border with all other juvenile undocumented immigrants before she was sent to the hospital, accompanied by the police. She is effectively arrested and waiting to be deported at the moment, despite her disability and the fact that she is still waiting for treatment.
According to President Trump’s logic, preventing immigrants from coming into the country will solve monetary and security problems, and strengthening the border by pouring taxpayer money into expanding police forces is the only way to go. Trump’s administration not only beefed up the manpower at the southern U.S. border but also changed the priority of the deportation process.Prior to this administration, U.S. police forces focused on deporting criminals and other individuals that could pose harm to society. A lot less emphasis was placed on the undocumented immigrants who found work and a shelter in the U.S. and lived up to all the expectations and laws with the only exception of one missing document.
But now this landscape has changed. The administration gives all illegal and undocumented immigrants the same priority, meaning that anyone who stays in the United States without valid identification will be deported immediately. This policy abuses the “expedited removal,” a process put in place by earlier administrations to speed up the process of removal of criminals and avoid prison overflowing by skipping the process of going through a judge.
This abuse of expedited removal is an attempt to cut down the cost of deporting harmless civilians who most likely just want to work in the United States, but there lies an irony so glaring that it’s hard to overlook: the money, time, and manpower that go into hunting down illegal immigrants and stopping them from coming into and staying in the country is ridiculous, and could be spent on doing more productive things, such as stopping children from dying. Somehow “turning our nation into an emergency room for the rest of the world” — the words of George Rodriguez, a conservative politician — is worse than blowing piles of cash to make sure that a disabled girl is detained and will get deported at the end of her treatment, arresting people who are working hard and trying to make a living in the United States, and building a physical wall at the southern border of the United States, which might have been a great strategy over a thousand years ago in China to keep the Huns outside the border, but is almost certainly outdated in a world where people can just casually fly across the border by purchasing an airplane ticket. The entire “saving money” consideration seems to break down when you really look into these aspects of the policy.
The homeland security argument, which seems like a somewhat valid concern at first, is also full of irony in the execution of the policy. How exactly is the administration going to make America a safer place when they spend all their time, manpower, and money on deporting people who are not threats to society? This change may create more jobs — we will need a lot more policemen to make sure that the undocumented criminals get deported — but just keep in mind that all that money could be spent on curing the sick instead of keeping them out of the hospital.
The fact that the government implements policies like this should disturb you every time. The majority of the people who call themselves “Americans” come from somewhere else, or their ancestors are from somewhere else. You could argue that you, or your ancestors, deserve to be treated better by the government because you are a part of the reasons why this nation turns out to be successful and strong, but also keep in mind that most of these immigrants left their homeland to produce their own successes, and they are making the nation stronger. It should disturb you that the government uses the money you make to watch people who need help die right in front of their eyes. We must make lawmakers aware that we will not stand for such deprivation of human rights just because someone is not a citizen of the U.S..

2017-11-20,CMU,China,"In the United States, as one of the first countries founded on the basis of democratically electing government officials, the practice of gerrymandering, defined as drawing election districts in a way that favors one political party over another, is almost as old as the country itself, starting with some of the first elections in this country. In 1788, Patrick Henry and his Anti-Federalist allies tried to draw districts in such a way to keep James Madison out of the U.S. House of Representatives, although they were unsuccessful.
More recently, the GOP has increasingly been criticized for using sophisticated algorithms to draw districts in such a way that heavily favors their own party, using methods such as packing minority voters (who tend to vote Democratic) in as few districts as possible, or splitting opponents’ voters into as many districts as possible so the opponents are in the minority. Currently, the Supreme Court is in the midst of a case related to Wisconsin’s redistricting practices that some have criticized as unconstitutional.
In order to alleviate this problem, some states have hired independent commissions to draw districts. But Carnegie Mellon researchers see another solution without involving independent commissions. Ariel Proccacia, associate professor of computer science, and Wesley Pegden, associate professor of mathematics, recently submitted a paper detailing an algorithm using computational social choice theory to ensure fair division, research that was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Sloan Foundation and the Office of Naval Research, according to a university press release.
The algorithm can be thought of as an extension of the method children use to divide a cake into two — one child cuts the cake in half while the other child takes his or her preferred piece, reducing envy. Applied to gerrymandering, the algorithm would entail having one party divide up the districts, then having the other party choosing one district to “freeze” — or finalize so that no one can subsequently change it — and re-mapping the remaining districts according to its preferences, and so on until all the districts are “frozen”.
In their paper, Proccacia, Pegden, and Dingli Yu, a visiting student from China’s Tsinghua University, detailed a mathematical proof of why this division protocol puts both parties on equal footing.
“If one party attempts to pack districts, for instance, the other party can simply not choose to freeze a packed district [one where specific concentrations of voters are packed into a district]. And because that party can then re-map the districts to eliminate the packing, the first party would not get the opportunity to freeze a packed district either,” details a university press release regarding the intuition behind the fairness of the algorithm.
In an interview with The Tartan, Pegden detailed the motivation behind the project and why he and the team wanted to apply cake-cutting techniques in particular. “The mathematics of fair division is all about leveraging competition between two sides to get a fair outcome; cake cutting is the classic example. If we want to be able to draw fair districts and we don’t know how to find truly independent agents, then fair division algorithms were a natural thing to aim for,” explained Pegden, who had previously done research on detecting gerrymandering.
Proccacia saw gerrymandering as a natural extension of the ideas behind cake-cutting. “The viewpoint [behind cake-cutting] seems natural in the context of redistricting (replacing ‘good’ with ‘state’), as we would like to see the two parties interact in a way that gives rise to a districting both sides perceive as fair,” said Proccacia.
Pegden and Proccacia’s goal is that ultimately, states will adopt this protocol as their method of redistricting. They hope to promote this method through more press coverage and start a grassroots national conversation surrounding fair redistricting techniques. .

2017-11-20,CMU,China,"One of the greatest powers of the United States lies in the ability of its higher education system to attract diverse and talented students from all over the world. According to the 2017 Open Doors Report by the Institute of International Education, the international student population in the United States increased by 3.4 percent to 1,078,822 students this year. This large presence of international students amounts to around $32 billion that is brought into the U.S. economy.
Recently, however, many universities around the U.S. have seen a dip in the number of foreign applicants. A survey of 250 colleges, conducted by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), has found that “39 [percent] of responding institutions reported a decline in international applicants.” The survey further observed that the highest declines in applicants were from the Middle East, while the number of applications from India and China was also impacted. 
“[Many international students] said they were concerned about the Trump effect,” said Wim Wiewel, President of Portland State University, in an interview with The New York Times. “I’d say the rhetoric and actual executive orders are definitely having a chilling effect.” 
Indeed, many call this decline in applicants an outcome of the ""Trump effect:"" the effects that President Trump's actions, words, and political agenda bring to the U.S. both on a domestic and an international level. From what I see, this decline in the number of foreign applicants to U.S. colleges can be divided into two main attributes. First, the visa application process has become more difficult under the Trump presidency, especially for students in the Middle East, preventing many students who wish to come to the U.S. from pursuing such an academic career. Second, the political climate of the United States has put much worry into many families around the world, prompting many students to look to domestic higher education systems or those of other countries like China, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom. 
As an international student myself, I have experienced both of these challenges in choosing to come to the United States for college. While I was fortunate to reside in the United States previously, making my visa application process easier than most, I have a couple of friends in South Korea who were caught in the bureaucratic mess of the visa application process, which prevented them from attending U.S. colleges in the fall of 2017. As for the political climate of the U.S., Trump and his agenda have instigated a changed reputation of the United States in the eyes of countries around the world. The words and actions of the President — the travel bans imposed by the administration, for example — and the many displays of violence and national division — mass shootings and the more public presence of white supremacy, to name a couple — have certainly proven to many families around the world that the sentiments of isolationism and nationalism are growing. In essence, it has become harder and less attractive to be an international student in the United States.
""Are they going to be welcomed in the United States? Are the Americans going to treat their sons and daughters well? Are they going to be safe on U.S. campuses and in U.S. cities?"" asked Gary Bergman, founder, and president of College Study US, in an interview with Newsweek. ""A lot of the comments that are coming out of the current administration are leading a lot of families to really take a step back and wonder if the U.S. is really a good place to go for their education.""
As Bergman comments above, for many foreigners, the United States is no longer seen as the ""land of immigrants."" The once deeply held values of diversity and openness seem to have changed to become more exclusive rather than inclusive. As such, it is expected that fewer and fewer students will choose the U.S. as their destination for higher education; it is the reputation that the U.S. displays on the international stage that has caused such a phenomenon. In order for the U.S. to continue enjoying the large presence of international students on its campuses, its reputation in the international community must be revived. If the Trump administration continues its agenda on immigration, maintaining its stance and proceeding to make negative remarks on foreigners or immigrants, the United States will no longer be at the frontiers of higher education and potentially risk the intellectual leadership of many of its academic institutions..

2017-12-04,CMU,China,"One of Pittsburgh’s many neighborhoods, Squirrel Hill is a student hotspot for great food. It has a wide variety of choices in Asian cuisine, boasting Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian restaurants, among others. Chengdu Gourmet, a Chinese restaurant, sits on Forward Avenue off Forbes Avenue. From campus, the 61C and 61D buses will take you all the way down to Forward. If you’re up for a walk, the 61A and 61B lines to Forbes and Murray Avenue work as well.
Outside, Chengdu Gourmet is bright yellow with a red trim, decorated with Chinese paper lanterns and multi-colored garlands. Inside, there is an open space that feeds into a larger room for diners. There are several booths running along one side of the room, small square tables, and larger circular tables arranged around the room.
Chengdu Gourmet has an extensive menu that caters to different customers. It has the classic Chinese-American dishes, General Tso’s Chicken and Triple Delight, as well as a few Thai choices, such as Pad Thai. If you’re in the mood to try something a little different — and more authentic — jump to the traditional Chinese menu, which offers several different kinds of pork, casseroles, and noodle soups.
Eating family style, my friend and I decided to order an appetizer, a vegetable entrée, and a meat entrée. Both entrées came with bowls of rice. The service was fast and efficient. The food was out not too long after we ordered, and the waiter walked past to check on us but didn’t intrude.
For the appetizer, we chose scallion pancakes, a staple in Chinese cuisine and something from our moms’ cooking that both of us craved. The scallion pancakes were wonderfully flaky, cooked with just enough oil, and went very well with the sweet soy sauce they came with. We could’ve ordered three more of them for our entire meal and would’ve been full and content.
The vegetable entrée we chose was dry sautéed green beans with minced pork. The green beans were very flavorful, the minced pork making a nice compliment. The green beans were slightly salty and soggy, but overall, they were a nice contrast to what we ended up choosing as out meal entrée.
The meat entrée of our choice was diced chicken with dried peppers Chongqing style. Food from Chongqing, a city in southwest China, is part of the broader Sichuan cuisine, which is known for bold flavors and spiciness. The chicken lived up to its name. The dried peppers gave the chicken a particularly numbing spiciness commonly found in Sichuan cuisine. However, the numbing spiciness overwhelmed all the other flavors from the chicken itself. I’m not the most tolerant of spicy foods, so I was constantly drinking water (which the waiter promptly refilled) and eating bites of green beans and rice after.
The appetizer and two dishes were more than enough for the two of us — we were absolutely stuffed after the meal. We chose Chengdu Gourmet because we wanted to try a new place in the area that served authentic Chinese food. For the most part, we weren’t disappointed. I’m excited to go again and try different dishes on the menu..

2017-12-04,CMU,China,"Beijing police have taken a 22-year-old female teacher into custody for allegedly drugging and molesting her kindergarten students. RYB Education, the Beijing-based and New York-listed company that runs the kindergarten, apologized to the children, parents, and public in a press release issued Nov. 25 of this year. The company operates in approximately 300 Chinese cities and runs about 1,300 daycare centers and 500 kindergartens. The company said they fired the teacher and the head of the kindergarten and suspended other teachers involved. The company also promised to provide psychological counseling to the victims, upgrade safety measures, and set up an independent supervision system. However, like many people have expressed on social media, I agree that the company’s response to the incident has been less than adequate.
Parents of the children at the school are horrified that such an incident could happen at a prestigious school (one that costs as much as 5,000 yuan, equivalent to $750, a month). In fear, many parents have pulled their children out of the school. As a result of the incident, RYB’s stock plummeted about 40 percent, and the company announced a plan to buy back shares worth $50 million. This shows how the company puts profit before public interest, as they made their announcement before even holding a press conference about the incident.
This isn’t the first time teachers at an RYB-run school have faced sexual abuse charges. In two cases in northeastern China, four RYB teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing 17 children. This begs the question: How can this current incident be unrelated? The answer: it’s not. There are undoubtedly corrupt practices occurring behind the scenes regarding the way that teachers are hired. The number of teachers accused is too high for anyone to think otherwise.
The incident has brought in much attention to child abuse and sexual molestation laws in China. The laws in place now are extremely vague and lax, leading many cases to go unreported, especially in rural areas. The media in China has documented many cases of sexual abuse in childcare facilities. In an investigative piece published last year, only 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported. With such flimsy laws, how can anyone be confident enough to report abuse to the police?
RYB’s insufficient response and action towards the incident has led many parents to take responsibility upon themselves to educate other caregivers on how to look for signs of abuse on their children. I believe it is disheartening that parents have to resort to helping each other protect their children through these means when laws should be changed to give stricter punishments to molesters. This would, in turn, give parents the confidence to report more of these incidents to the police.
The most heartbreaking stories to read were of parents' responses to how they found out their child was abused, and the effects it had on their child. One mother told reporters her three-year-old daughter was asked to strip after being injected with a brown liquid, along with other children, before being ""examined"" by a naked adult male stranger. The mother, as well as other parents of the victims, told reporters they found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies. A grandfather picking up his four-year-old granddaughter said the four-year old mentioned her classmates were being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret. Yet another mother reported that her child told her that the teacher said it was a secret and they cannot tell anyone, not even their parents. The mother said, ""She now bursts into screaming at night, saying, 'I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?'""
It is painful to even imagine what these children and their parents have been through, and simply suspending or firing the teachers responsible is not enough. More severe punishment must be doled out to the perpetrators to ensure that people get the message that such disgusting, immoral acts will not be tolerated or dealt with lightly. However, since this incident received so much attention, other parents with small children were prompted to check on their children. This led to the uncovering of dozens of instances of abuse at a Shanghai kindergarten run by a leading Chinese travel agency. In response, the Chinese government has ordered a nationwide investigation into all kindergartens, and has promised stricter punishment for perpetrators of child abuse. However, posts and comments on social media, and public fury at this scandal may reflect a deeper anxiety and uncertainty among ordinary Chinese citizens.
This incident is eerily familiar to the abominable incident in 2002 in Boston, MA, where former priest John J. Geoghan was charged for molesting children. Since the mid-1990s, more than 130 people have come forward with horrific recollections of how former priest John J. Geoghan fondled or raped them during a three-decade spree. These children were afraid to speak up because they were afraid of the consequences, and they were unsure of how to handle the situation, because it was their priest, a friend of their family, who had done this to them.
This shows how it’s not just in China where incidents of molestation go unreported. There are numerous cases, not only in the U.S., but also in other countries, that are not brought to light because people are afraid of the repercussions, and in most cases, the law is not strong enough on child abuse to give victims confidence that they will be supported. There aren’t enough words to express my disgust towards the perpetrators for harming these children. It angers me further how the teachers were simply suspended or fired, and harsher punishment is not being dealt to them. I believe, however, it is the media’s role to seek out these stories and report the truth to spread awareness of such situations, because, sadly, they happen around the globe and more often than we suspect..

2017-12-04,CMU,China,"Alton Lu is pursuing a Master of Public Policy and Management – Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. He is interested in using data science to solve human-made challenges. Lu is currently a research analyst at the University of Washington.
Ensuring security, promoting peace, and spreading influence across the world have been cornerstones of every American president’s foreign policy initiatives. However, North Korea has challenged these goals since the 1950s, and it has become difficult to deal with the competing objectives of China, South Korea, and Japan. Multiple rounds of U.N. sanctions have done little to curb the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s nuclear ambitions, and no international appeal has prompted China to apply stricter sanctions. Japan and South Korea — two American allies — face continual threats from North Korea militancy, which forces the United States to engage in the region. The result has been the continual advancement of the North Korean nuclear program despite denouncements from the rest of the world. Understanding the competing objectives of major nations in the North Korean issue is essential to resolving the issue peacefully.
Since the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)entered into force in 1970, the five official nuclear-armed states have had an interest in limiting proliferation to maintain nuclear exclusivity, while smaller states have had an interest in preventing proliferation for their own security purposes. Since nuclear programs are expensive, many small states would prefer the continued equilibrium and safety that exists with the official nuclear club.
But that small-state interest doesn’t apply to North Korea. Facing threats from the United States and South Korea, the DPRK has continued their nuclear weapons programs for self-defense. The state’s paranoia is not unfounded. Back in 1953, Secretary of State John Dulles told the U.N. Security Council that use of nuclear weapons may be required to end the conflict in Korea. Forty years later, the DPRK pulled out of the NPT, stating that “we [have taken] the resolute action of pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and have manufactured nuclear arms for self-defense to cope with the Bush administration’s evermore undisguised policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK.” After a recent test in 2016, North Korea released another official statement: “The DPRK will take further measures to bolster the state nuclear force in quality and quantity for safeguarding its dignity and right to existence and genuine peace from the U.S. increasing threat of a nuclear war [sic].” These perceived threats from the United States have been the reasoning for continued nuclear weapons development.
But even if North Korea had convincing evidence that the United States posed no threat, North Korea still wouldn’t disarm. Kim Jong Un, like most dictators, is concerned with maintaining and holding power. Robert Manning, of the Brent Scowcroft Center stated, “the Kim Jong Un regime’s very identity is so bound up with nuclear weapons that he changed the country’s constitution to declare North Korea a nuclear state. The bureaucratic inertia of four decades in the development of nuclear weapons and deep mutual distrust between the United States and North Korea are a powerful combination precluding denuclearization.”
One of his key objectives is to ensure the Kim family rule in perpetuity, which is only possible with the continued development of the nuclear program. For the last three generations of the Kim family, nuclear weapons have provided a symbol of independence, security, and self-sufficiency. It represents the power, not just of Kim, but of the entire DPRK. Any sort of discussion that even considers a disarmed North Korea is doomed to failure. A reversal in the nuclear program for North Korea would be akin to a denouncement of democracy in the United States.
The United States is now struggling to determine a policy in Asia that reinforces the nuclear umbrella while minimizing the possibility of a North Korean attack on American soil. Balancing the protection of Japan and South Korea is difficult when the North views these moves as a threat to their sovereignty. While the United States struggles to fully commit to either umbrella reinforcement or threat minimization, support for nuclear weapons development in South Korea and Japan grows. Yet, this is also at odds with another United States goal — to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There are no good options for the United States. On one end, the U.S. can recommit to the nuclear umbrella and face the threat of losing Seattle to save Seoul. However, to minimize the possibility of attack on the mainland, the United States may have to accept further nuclear proliferation in East Asia.
However, further proliferation in East Asia is also at odds with China’s objectives in Asia China’s primary goals are to restrict nuclear weapons proliferation in Asia while maintaining a stable North Korea. China has no desire to be surrounded by nuclear weapons. Russia, India and Pakistan already possess nuclear weapons and surround China from the north to the west; a nuclear Japan and South Korea would bring weapons to the east and south. However, China also wants to avoid a humanitarian crisis and American soldiers on its border. China doesn’t see itself as a charity and sees North Korea as a useful buffer towards U.S. soldiers in South Korea. Like the U.S., China seeks two-mutually exclusive visions — the stability of North Korea and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. To this date, China has chosen stability.
Creating a coherent strategy for North Korea is essential to securing American interests in Asia. Ensuring that American influence continues in Asia is increasingly important as China seeks to solidify their power in Asia. American resolve for nuclear deterrence is already being questioned in Japan and South Korea. Pulling back and allowing this crisis to continue will only weaken American influence at a time when China has begun to flex its global power. To solve this crisis and return to a long-term focus on America’s role in Asia, the United States needs to fully consider options that align with the objectives of every other nation in the game — namely China and North Korea.

2018-04-02,CMU,China,"Thirteen Korean beauty products have been taken off the shelves after high levels of antimony were found. At first glance, this may appear to be just another recall. However, when looking at the recalled products, one can see that a significant portion of them came from brands that perform animal testing. Animal testing is performed in hopes to ensure the safety of different products, whether it be new medicines or cleaning supplies or, in this case, cosmetics. However, the fact that brands that tested on animals appeared to have the same proportion of products recalled in comparison to their non-tested counterparts raises the question: how effective is animal testing?
The brand Amorepacific produced about half of the recalled products, yet it tests on animals ""if animal testing is required or bound by local governments or laws."" Similarly, many other brands on the list, such as Black Monster and Etude House, are pressured by laws to test their finished products on animals. The purpose of such laws is to protect people from potentially harmful products, yet somehow animal testing was not enough to stop these products from ending up on the list more than their cruelty-free counterparts.
Animal testing involves taking live animals and putting them under harsh circumstances. For testing the efficacy of a new drug, animals, many of which are genetically modified, may be deliberately placed under distressful situations or otherwise harmed in hopes that the researchers can learn something about the drug. In the realm of soaps and detergents, animals' fur will be ripped off and the bare skin will be exposed to potentially harsh chemicals. The list of ways animals are tested on goes on, but nearly all of them end with the researcher euthanizing the tested animals.
In 2016, India's government banned animal testing for Indian companies that produce soap, cosmetics, and detergents. However, there have been no adverse effects on the people in this regard. Furthermore, the European Union banned animal testing in 2013. This includes a testing band and a marketing ban, which prohibits the testing or selling of animal-tested finished products and their respective ingredients. Again, we fail to see a rise in recalls or any sign of concern pertaining to safety.
Animal testing isn't even the cost-friendly way to go when it comes to testing the safety of products. As of 2013, it was estimated that the U.S. spends anywhere between $12 billion to $14.5 billion on animal testing. While safety should come before monetary cost, it is important to remember that the accuracy of animal testing may not be the best. In vitro testing is up to twelve times more cost efficient in comparison to animal testing and does not involve an invasive procedure that infringes on a sentient being's life.
Alternatively, testing using paid human clients is another alternative. At first, testing on humans may seem to be less ethical than testing on an animal, but this level of heightened caution that researchers feel about testing on humans may provide heightened incentive to be more cautious about testing. On the participants' end, participants must give consent to be a part of the procedure and may withdraw at any point they choose, a freedom that animal subjects do not have. Additionally, humans can hold the researchers accountable. Should any ethical guideline be broken, they can take the researchers to court; such justice is much harder to do for animals.
What we learn from such studies is nothing to scoff at. Participant-based studies have allowed cosmetic brands to test out new products that consumers can enjoy. Case studies involving human participants allow us to learn more about the efficacies of new medicines and treatments. The world of possibilities exceeds what we can imagine, but we are confined by the mentality that animal testing is the best testing method.
With all these cons, why do we continue to test on animals? Many brands and companies are able to skip the animal cruelty at a hefty price: cutting mainland China's population out of their consumer population. Currently, China (excluding Hong Kong) is the only nation that mandates animal testing. Part of the reason lies in their attempt to combat counterfeit products that may be circulating the market. Many of these counterfeit products are not held to the same safety standard that reputable brands must undergo, thus being potentially hazardous to consumers.
However, as mentioned previously, animal testing is not the most efficient or ethical method of ensuring product safety. Instead of requiring reputable brands to test on animals, perhaps a good step towards countering the damage of counterfeit products is to have tighter copyright laws that protect brands.
China is projected to be the largest cosmetics market. Denying a market that is currently $29 billion is a significant loss that cruelty-free brands must accept in order to avoid testing on animals. However, there is room for hope. In 2014, The Chinese Food and Drug Administration claimed it would begin to be more open to alternative testing methods and waived animal testing for some non-special-use cosmetics, such as nail care and perfumes. In Sept. 2016, China’s Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control opened a lab in collaboration with the Institute for In Vitro Sciences, a U.S. non-profit. Together, Chinese scientists have been trained to test using reconstructed skin cells. If this progress continues and China lifts its animal testing policy, companies will greatly lose any incentive to test on animals.
Scientific discoveries allow us to find new solutions to problems and improve the future. Animal testing may have, at one point, been the most ethical way to ensure the public's safety. However, that is not the case anymore. Just as our technology is evolving, so should our methods of testing..

2018-04-09,CMU,China,"What does Natalie Portman have in common with Mickey Rooney, Tilda Swinton, and Scarlett Johansson? 
These actors, all of whom are white, have acted in film as characters who are of Asian descent, or who are of Asian descent in the original iteration of the character. 
Rooney’s degrading portrayal of I.Y. Yunioshi, Audrey Hepburn’s landlord in 1961’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s, is the classic example of “yellowface,” the portrayal of distinctly Asian characters by white actors, and the use of racist stereotypes in film. In 2016’s Doctor Strange, Swinton plays The Ancient One, who was originally Tibetan in the comics. For the film, the character was “reimagined” as Celtic. Johansson plays Major Motoko Kusanagi in 2017’s Ghost in the Shell, a live action remake of a Japanese anime film. Her casting was a blatant sign of whitewashing an Asian character with a white actress.
In this year’s Annihilation, released last February, Portman portrays the protagonist who is described as a character having part-Asian descent in the original novels written by Jeff VanderMeer. The whitewashing in Annihilation has reignited an on-going conversation not only about the whitewashing of Asian-Americans in the American entertainment industry, but the continual racial and cultural ignorance that permeates the United States. 
As an Asian-American, I am used to not seeing myself and characters who look like me on screen. I am usually surprised when I see an Asian-American character on screen that is a speaking, or is a developed character that matters. But, I am tired of the film industry constantly misinterpreting and ignoring my culture, and of the blatant absence of Asian-American representation in Hollywood.
According to a 2016 study from the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, of all speaking or named characters evaluated across film, television, and streaming services, only 5.1 percent of them were Asian, and at least half of the projects had no Asian characters at all. 
There is a clear lack of roles for Asian-Americans in Hollywood. If there are roles, particularly high-profile ones, they often go to white actors, like Portman. This leads many Asian-American actors to either abandon their attempts to break into the acting business, or to settle for stereotypical and one-note parts that service lead characters, who are often white. They play IT guys, geeks, prostitutes, if they’re present at all. This is not a problem unique to Hollywood. Stereotypes in American culture consistently reinforce a shallow and hackneyed image of Asian-Americans in society.
American society continues to be racially and culturally ignorant of Asian-Americans and their culture, appropriating their culture without true understanding, and reducing them to stereotypes. Despite the prevalence of the internet and the information about other cultures it provides, despite a shrinking world that is more connected than it ever has been before, despite the fact that Asians have been living in America since at least the 17th century, there remains an underlying sense of otherness — that Asian-Americans are foreigners and aliens that should “Go back to China!”
Not only does this sentiment ignore the many Asian-Americans who were born in the United States and consume the same culture, eat the same food, attend the same schools, and so on, but it also overgeneralizes the diversity among Asian-Americans themselves. Many are just as “American” as any paragon of American cultural identity.
Stereotypes in film reflect the stereotypes of society. Asian-American culture and identity is often brutally simplified to IT guys, geeks, prostitutes, Kung Fu and ninja masters, comic relief, or weak, fragile characters, which in turn, are depicted on screen. This is not reality. Entertainment is an integral part of popular culture and, in many ways, directly influences social discourse in everyday society. 
In 2016, the Academy Awards received intense backlash for the lack of diversity among the nominees, called #OscarsSoWhite, which plagued the build-up to the award ceremony. African-American actor and comedian Chris Rock was chosen as the host in reaction to the controversy, and he spoke extensively about it in his opening monologue. Later in the broadcast, Rock introduced three Asian-American kids dressed in oversized business suits as “Academy accountants” in a skit. This was planned and written by the ceremony writers and executed by Rock. The irony, hypocrisy, and tone-deafness of the skit exemplifies how people in Hollywood, even those that advocate for representation and equality, continue to play into stereotypes and be ignorant of Asian-American identity and culture.
Hollywood’s enduring depiction of these restrictive stereotypes about an entire ethnicity is both hurtful and detrimental. Asian-Americans, like other minorities, are tired of seeing themselves flatly portrayed on screen, or not portrayed at all. We are tired of being boiled down to thinly-drawn roles that are often created solely to fit tokenism, a superficial practice of including minority characters simply to check off the diversity box. We want to see ourselves properly represented in popular culture. We want to have our stories told.
Many have celebrated the diversity and progressiveness of Annihilation, a science-fiction studio film with a predominately female cast, including African-American Tessa Thompson and Latina Gina Rodriguez. But, does this diversity and progressiveness stop before Asian-Americans are represented? Casting Thompson and Rodriguez is wonderful, but does casting them seemingly mean that other minorities can’t also be represented — that the minority of the lead character that is explicitly described in the novels can’t be correctly portrayed?
How is this acceptable, in 2018, when Hollywood is (rightfully) beaming in the goodwill of Black Panther’s success, which celebrates not only diversity and inclusion, but an appreciation and understanding of a non-white and non-American culture? African-Americans have been able to finally see themselves beyond the basic stereotypes of black characters, or in the backdrop of slavery and poverty. They have experienced an empowering, representative film that they can relate to. This is something I want to see on a movie theater screen, something I, as an Asian-American, want to experience. 
Your move, Hollywood..

2018-04-23,CMU,China,"With both the 2018 Formula 1 (F1) and IndyCar championships three races in, it is shaping up to be an enticing, drama filled year for the two motorsports series. In F1, the highest level of world-wide open-wheel racing, Mercedes’ long-held dominance appears to finally be over, with Mercedes languishing behind the quick race pace of the Ferraris. In IndyCar, an America-only open wheel series, 2016 Indy 500 winner Alexander Rossi has extended his strong second half of 2017 into the new year with two podiums and a race win so far, while reigning champion Josef Newgarden, with one 2018 win to his name, is not far behind.
In 2014, F1 cars switched from screaming V8 engines to turbocharged V6 hybrid units, and the “hybrid era” has since been controlled by Mercedes. The team handily won in 2014, with their driver Lewis Hamilton beating his teammate Nico Rosberg to the Drivers’ title. 2015 was much of the same, although Rosberg put up a stronger fight. In 2016, the teammates clashed both on and off the track, with several collisions causing their relationship to deteriorate as they fiercely battled for the championship; Rosberg won and subsequently retired, with Mercedes yet again easily taking the Constructors’ trophy. 2017 saw Ferrari begin to catch up: while Hamilton and Mercedes still triumphed, Ferrari driver and four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel won five races and even led during the first half of the season.
With the dust settled from the first three races of 2018, it is evident that Mercedes no longer has the clear upper hand. The season’s first grand prix in Australia saw Vettel win due to excellent strategy from Ferrari, pitting with the lead when a stopped car brought a Virtual Safety Car (VSC) period, allowing him to retain the lead since Hamilton had to slow down to obey the VSC speed limit. The other Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen was also fast, placing third, while the other Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas finished a distant eighth due to a crash in qualifying dropping his starting position to 15th.
In an action-packed Bahrain Grand Prix, Vettel barely coaxed his worn tires to a second victory, ahead of the chasing Bottas, who finished a mere 0.699 seconds behind. Hamilton desperately searched for pace, finishing six seconds down in third, while a mistimed pit stop sent a Ferrari mechanic to the hospital with a fractured leg and a disgruntled Raikkonen back to the garage with no points.
In China, Ferrari seemed to retain their advantage over Mercedes, with Vettel quickly crafting a sizable lead over Bottas while Hamilton struggled to keep up. However, the safety car appeared when the two Toro Rosso cars collided on lap 31, letting Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo pit for new tires, giving them more pace when the race restarted. The two Red Bulls blew past Raikkonen and Hamilton, but Verstappen tried an ambitious late-braking move against Vettel on the 43rd lap, causing both drivers to spin out. Verstappen was promptly handed a ten second time penalty, putting him down in fifth behind Hamilton, while Vettel slid down the field, coming home a measly eighth. Meanwhile, Ricciardo set after Bottas, eventually grabbing the lead on lap 45 with a ballsy move down the inside of the Mercedes into the tight right-hander of turn four. While Hamilton finished ahead of Vettel and inched closer in the standings, the Mercedes duo had trouble matching the speed of the Ferraris all weekend, and the quick Vettel was an unfortunate victim of Verstappen’s overzealous passing attempt.
Vettel currently leads the championship with 54 points. Hamilton is nine points back, with Bottas a further five behind that. Ricciardo is nipping at the Mercedes’ heels after his race win with 37 points, while Raikkonen sits fifth with 30. Verstappen’s difficult start leaves him in eighth, getting him tangled up in the intense mid-field battle between the McLaren’s Fernando Alonso, Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg, and Haas’s Kevin Magnussen. In the Constructors’ Championship, Mercedes leads Ferrari by a single point, while Red Bull lurks 29 points behind.
Over in the United States, the IndyCar season is providing lots of exciting racing as Rossi looks to build an early championship lead. The opening street race in St. Petersburg, FL saw four-time champion Sebastian Bourdais snatch his 74th win, after Rossi made contact with rookie Robert Wickens on lap 108 of 110 while battling for the lead. Rossi fought back to finish third. The reigning champion Newgarden had a tricky race down in seventh, while Graham Rahal finished second.
Newgarden had better luck at the oval circuit of Phoenix, where he used a late pit stop to don fresh tires and make up four places in seven laps to win ahead of Wickens and Rossi.
Rossi stormed to an assertive win at the Long Beach street circuit, where he led all but 14 of 85 laps. Former champion Will Power finished second, while Ed Jones rounded out the podium. Newgarden yet again finished seventh, while Bourdais finished down in 13th despite some masterful passing moves. The win elevated Rossi to first in the championship with 126 points, while Newgarden sits second with 104. Rahal and Bourdais are third and fourth with 93 and 88 points, respectively.
IndyCar moves to the race circuit of Barber Motorsports Park for the Grand Prix of Alabama on April 22, while F1 travels to the capital of Baku for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on April 29..

2018-04-23,CMU,China,"It’s that time of the year again — when Carnegie Mellon students pick up their drills and strap on their hardhats to build booths. Booth is one of the biggest attractions of Spring Carnival, featuring multistory structures, interactive games, and beautiful decorations. After unrelenting weather among other challenges, Carnegie Mellon’s Greek and student organizations persevered to build booths centered on this year’s theme, Myths and Legends. These organizations compete in four categories: Sorority, Fraternity, Independent, and Blitz. Participating but not competing, Alpha Phi Omega built a Greek Underworld-themed concession stand, where all proceeds went to fundraising the service fraternity.
One of the biggest sorority booths was Kappa Alpha Theta’s Titanic. Built to resemble the iconic ship, the two-story booth featured elaborate decorations: a spiral staircase, paintings of the characters from the 1997 movie of the same name, and jellyfish lighted with eerie green lighting. The booth did a wonderful job telling a story, and combined the experience with a digital escape room game; you entered as a passenger on the Titanic, walking through the main “lobby” of the ship and up the staircase. Red lighting and fire cutouts signaled that the ship was on fire and going down, as visitors walked down the stairs into the briny green ocean. Exiting the booth meant you successfully escaped the ship and survived. Kappa Alpha Theta won second place for their Titanic booth.
Right next door was Alpha Phi’s Narnia. This booth told the story of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, from The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. With large 3D paintings of characters like Aslan and the White Witch, the booth showcased Alpha Phi’s incredible art and design skills. On the second floor, visitors could play a shooting game with a toy bow and arrow, participating in Aslan’s final battle against the Witch. The many elaborate decorative chairs and a small swing decorated with flowers and butterflies made the booth a popular photo spot for Carnival visitors.
The first place winner of the sorority booths, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s Alice in Wonderland, was a sight to be seen. Beautifully painted and fun, the two-story booth featured a wall of roses, referencing the Queen of Heart’s rose obsession, a room lighted by black light to simulate the craziness of Wonderland, and a short interactive game where the player would collect items as Alice. Kappa Kappa Gamma’s hard work payed off with their impressive display.
Delta Delta Delta built a booth featuring the Greek god of the sea, Poseidon. With an impressive painting of the god of the ocean at the entrance, the one-story booth told a fun tale of ocean-themed Greek mythology. The booth also featured a ring toss game, where the player would toss rings onto a coral sculpture. If the player won, they got to walk out with a small prize: a laser-cut dolphin. 
The last of the sorority booths was Delta Gamma’s Santa’s Workshop. Cleverly decorated with small pieces of plywood to create a brick wall, the cheerful booth made the recent snow less miserable. With cute cutouts of Santa’s reindeer, colorful Christmas lights and a Christmas tree, Delta Gamma brought back the spirit of Christmas to Carnival.
One of the biggest fraternity booths was Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Star Trek. Emblazoned with a Star Trek-themed logo and the show’s iconic USS Enterprise, the booth featured a number of tech-based displays. The bottom floor had an impressive transporter bay, while the top floor featured an incredible interactive game. The elaborate booth placed second place in the fraternity category. 
Just across Midway was Phi Delta Theta’s Moon Landing. This booth was an especially popular one due to its green screen photo booth and two-story-tall rocket. 
Proudly displaying the organization’s flag and many of its members photoshopped as astronauts, the booth featured incredible artwork and created a fun, cohesive theme. Next door was Alpha Sigma Phi’s The Sandlot. Based off of the movie of the same name, the small single-story booth was a fun baseball-themed game. Even though they were partially deterred by the previous nights of terrible weather, the booth was fun and extremely popular with kids.
Another two-story fraternity booth was Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Legend of Zelda. Using artwork inspired by the various Legend of Zelda games, the booth incorporated interactivity into its decorations. Using a small Zelda-decorated coin, the visitor could interact with objects in the booth, causing them to light up or make a sound. The booth was beautifully decorated with faux stained glass windows and sculptures of Zelda-themed enemies, and featured a small video game on the second floor. The booth placed third in the fraternity category.
The winner of the fraternity category was Delta Tau Delta’s Harry Potter booth. Built to resemble part of Hogwarts castle, the booth took the visitor on a journey through the many locations in the world of Harry Potter. From Ollivander’s to the halls of Hogwarts to a running fountain on the second floor to paintings of the iconic characters, the booth was incredibly well-designed and well-built. One of the many cool aspects was an interactive plate sorted visitors into Hogwarts houses.
Located at the entrance of Midway was KGB’S Aliens booth. Single story, it featured conspiracy-related decorations and articles, all pointing towards the existence of alien life. Coming to the exit of the booth was an Operation-based alien game, where the player could extract miscellaneous objects from the body of an alien. KGB members were expert participants, quickly crafting tin foil hats to protect their visitors from potential dangers — alien or otherwise.
Fringe built a Robin Hood-themed booth, with a beautiful banner and cut-outs of the animated movie’s characters decorating the front of the booth. You walked through Robin Hood’s forest, passing by sculptures of trees and even more beautifully painted characters, exploring the world of the movie. The booth also featured a shooting game, where the player could use a bow and arrow to hit targets mounted on the wall. Although they didn’t place, the booth was fun and well-designed.
Second place in the Independent category was Student Dormitory Council’s (SDC) Trojan Horse. Decorated with the enormous head of the Trojan horse itself, the booth was one impressive game. As you passed by Greek-themed urns and pots, the visitor could read up on the tale of the Trojan horse. In one game, the player could use small cutouts to simulate the battle. In the other game, the player could use a nerf gun to hit timed targets. The SDC’s hard work resulted in an impressive and entertaining booth.
The Singapore Students Association (SSA) built a Merlion booth. With the head of lion on one side of the entrance and the tail of a mermaid on the other, the booth was covered wall-to-wall with blackboard. Visitors could draw and decorate the booth using chalk provided by SSA, which resulted in a colorful array of messages and doodles. Along the walls were lit-up laser-cut sculptures of the ocean and other Merlion-related locations. In the center of the booth was a small sandpit, which was popular with kids and families.
Winning first place in the Independent category was the Taiwanese Student Association’s Arabian Nights booth. Complete with sand, a magic carpet, the soundtrack of Aladdin, and a blue genie, the booth took the visitor on a trip through Agrabah. With its elaborately painted decorations, the booth really told the story of Aladdin and wonderfully encompassed the world of the theme.
The last Independent booth was the Asian Students Association’s (ASA) The Legend of Korra. This booth told the story of the animated series using a variety of lights and sculptures, taking the visitor on a journey through the streets of the main city and into the spirit world. Featuring a fun game where the player could “bend” evil spirits into good ones and a cute tea party-themed photo op by the exit, ASA earned third place with their exciting booth.
The last category is Blitz. Where other booths are allowed to bring in already-built frames and pieces, Blitz booths cannot pre-build anything. Starting only a couple days before opening, these booths expertly managed time and weather to create single-story structures.
The Chinese Students Association built a booth on the theme of China’s Great Wall. Beautifully decorated with Ancient Chinese-themed art and motifs, the booth was impressively designed and painted. 
The American Society of Civil Engineers built an Area 51 themed booth, located at the end of Midway. While small, the booth featured a “conspiracy map”, with tacks placed where all of Carnegie Mellon’s affiliated schools were located (including Central Michigan University). Visitors could look through a periscope to see the rest of Midway, as a form of surveillance. But, most entertaining was the booth’s wall of index cards — each with a different “conspiracy” on them. Featuring theories such as “Water is wet” and “The real Avril Lavigne is Dead,” the wall was a fun way to incorporate visitor participation. The playful booth won second place in the Blitz category.
Winning third place was Astronomy Club’s Constellations-themed booth. The main attraction of the booth was its large wall-to-wall video game, where two people played as spaceships trying to track down the correct constellation. Decorated with amazing artwork of constellations and celestial bodies, the Astronomy club showed off their art and technical skills. Kappa Sigma’s booth was built on the legend of The Yeti. Impressive in its own right, the booth featured “cool” artwork and a well-designed structure. Along with their theme, the organization sold ice cream to passing Carnival visitors.
Winning first place in the Blitz category was Math Club’s Merlin’s Quest booth. With the story of Merlin’s multiple quests written on the walls, visitors could decode Merlin’s messages using a variety of historical ciphers. Once the many messages were decoded and the puzzles solved, the visitor could “pull” the sword in the stone out of its boulder to reveal 
collectible stickers. The booth rightfully won first place with its clever games and fun design.

2018-04-23,CMU,China,"Ever since Donald Trump announced he was running for president, he remained skeptical of the status quo of trade. His ""America first"" vision involved pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and hefty negotiations with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He pledged to declare China a currency manipulator. Trump claimed that ultimately, he can bring back jobs to America. However, the people who Trump appealed to and promised to help are now becoming fearful for a trade war that will ultimately hurt them.
Earlier this month, Trump threatened to burden Chinese goods with a hefty $100 billion tariff. Consequently, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on CNBC, recognized the ""potential of a trade war,"" which led to Dow Jones plummeting. The Chinese government responded to the threat of a tariff by saying that it would ""fight at any cost."" This included a proposed retaliatory tariff on soybeans, corn, and other row crops, biting at the farmers here in the U.S.
Even those who believe that the U.S. is being taken advantage of by unfair trade policies and demand change are wary of the potential trade war. Farmers, especially, are beginning to fear a trade war and what that would mean for them. Already, the threat of a trade war was enough for the price of soybeans to plummet. If tensions were to escalate to a trade war, Americans should anticipate higher price tags on imported goods. Conversely, struggling farms would be slashing prices to try to make ends meet, if they can even stay in business at all.
As bleak as some farmers' futures may be, not all have lost faith in Trump or are completely disenchanted. Some perceive the threat of a tariff to be a gateway for negotiations. A threat would catch attention; striking a deal would come after. Some others do believe that he acted harshly, but regardless of the possible motives, there is a theme that ties all the speculations: hope that Trump would be a man for the working class. After being left unsatisfied during the Obama administration, farmers wanted someone who would bring something different and who would change the status quo. Clinton would deliver no change; Trump, on the other hand, would.
Unfortunately, the change that was anticipated was not the fear of a trade war.
Yes, the U.S. has a trade deficit of approximately $375 billion. However, slapping on tariffs is not the way to go. This resonates with the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act during Herbert Hoover's term. The Great Depression made isolationism appealing, and the act appeared to be a potential solution to pull the U.S. out of the depression and protect U.S. farmers against agricultural imports. However, this tariff led to the over-production of agricultural goods, causing farmers to drop their prices. Farmers cannot indefinitely drop prices; once they pass the break-even point, selling their crops would cause them to lose profit, not gain profit, leading them to go out of business. More than a thousand economists urged Hoover to veto the bill, but the bill was signed and the depression was further exacerbated.
Just as it was in the 1930s, there is not much room for optimism in Trump's threat to burden China with tariffs. If the mere threat of a tariff was enough to trigger a change in prices in soybeans, it is hard to imagine the reach of actual tariffs implemented. Additionally, this would create further tensions with China, something the U.S. cannot afford to do.
There is a significant reason Trump is reluctant to explicitly label China a currency manipulator despite the fact he promised to do so on the campaign trail. In 2017, Trump tweeted, ""Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?"" If the U.S. has strained relations with China, Trump would have a harder time pressuring North Korea to de-nuclearize. Given the potential stakes and unpredictable behaviors of North Korea, Trump cannot ruthlessly provoke China for possible personal gain.
Of course, no single person or political figure can singlehandedly start a trade war, and President Trump is no exception. However, trade is essential to the U.S. economy and President Trump does have power and influence. If he truly wants to put ""America first,"" perhaps he should reconsider provoking a major trade partner and instead create policies that would actually benefit the working class and those he promised to help..

2018-09-24,CMU,China,"Not everyone likes rap, but every person I’ve talked to has at least heard of Eminem. It’s not that surprising, however. As a 15-time Grammy winner, Eminem has reached legendary status in the music industry. His road to greatness was full of obstacles - a poor background, an absent father, an abusive mother - making his success even more uplifting and inspirational. 
I first heard Eminem (and hip-hop in general) when I was in middle school in China. My friends blasted “Love the Way You Lie” from Eminem’s 7th album Recovery as we played video games, and I was hooked not by Rihanna’s catchy hook, but by Eminem’s thumping rap verses. After that, I started looking him up myself and streaming his older songs, like “Without Me,” “Lose Yourself,” “Mockingbird,” “’Till I Collapse,” and so on. The things I love about Eminem, and what I think distinguishes him from most other rappers, are the emotions and energy he puts into his delivery. Words spew from his mouth like a fast-flowing river, as I the listener sit on a raft, barely able to keep my balance but enjoying every moment of the ride. 
Maybe it was because of my high expectations that I was disappointed by Revival, his ninth studio album, which came out in 2017. First of all, just by briefly skimming through the tracklist, one can see that it was filled with features. Of course, there is nothing wrong with features - this formula has worked out really well for Eminem, evident in the success of “Love the Way You Lie” and “The Monster.” His previous album The Marshall Mathers LP 2, also included lots of features. On Revival, however, he had really gone over the top. Additionally, his rap verses had become more monotone and lacking in flow. Moreover, his bars on some of the tracks, such as “Heat”, or the single “River” featuring Ed Sheeran, sound very awkward. Other songs, like “Framed”, have decent rap verses, but then the hook kicks in and ruins the whole feel of the song. Overall, the production was lazy, badly planned, and the three singles from the album (“Walk on Water”, “River”, “Nowhere Fast”) were all very questionable. 
Critics’ responses were polarized, but most people can agree on one thing: Revival is the worst Eminem album. Eminem, of course, had been hearing these criticisms since the album’s release. In a remix of the song “Chloraseptic” released in January, he threw in extra verses in response, with lyrics such as “‘Walk on Water’ sucked? B****, suck my d***.” 
Maybe that’s why when Eminem dropped Kamikaze on Aug. 31, some of his fans weren’t so surprised. Eminem has dropped many diss tracks in his career, so why not a whole diss album? In 12 out of the 13 tracks on Kamikaze's tracklist, Eminem takes shots at people he either dislikes, or who have criticized him in the past, ranging from rap artists and singers to music critics and government officials. 
All of these tracks were written, recorded, mixed, and produced in less than a year, and yet this album to me is a truer album than Revival. His inflated ego and flamboyant hostility make a comeback in many of the tracks such as “The Greatest” (not hard to see from the title), “Not Alike”, where he called his alter-ego Slim Shady a “demi-god” and rapper Machine Gun Kelly a “blond fairy cornball”; and “Fall”, one of my personal favorites, where he again emphasizes his greatness and his legendary status. The production is also much cleaner, and his flow reminds me more of some of his old albums.
The release of Kamikaze has caused an uproar in the music industry. Many of the people Eminem dissed on the album have given their responses. The most famous of these is probably Machine Gun Kelly’s diss track “Rap Devil,” a name chosen to mirror Eminem’s self-proclaimed “Rap God” title. These responses, however, are exactly what Eminem welcomes. The purpose of Kamikaze is equivalent to the WWII Kamikaze planes, with Eminem as the pilot. He’s throwing himself at those he sees as “enemies”, resulting in a powerful explosion. To me, music is just a tool for artists to channel their inner thoughts and emotions, which in Kamikaze is anger. Revival did not revive Eminem’s career: Kamikaze does, in his signature way. .

2018-09-24,CMU,China,"The calendar says 2018, but it feels like we’re living in George Orwell’s 1984.
If there is one thing President Trump has achieved during his tenure, it’s to normalize lying. It seems that the President feels the need to lie on an hourly basis, whether to slander his rivals and the media, assuage his own ego, or just for the sake of tweeting something.
Being an ordinary liar is bad enough, but the problem becomes exponentially worse when that individual also inhabits the most powerful and prestigious office in the nation, if not the world. As a result, Trump isn’t the only one blasting ludicrous untruths; staunchly conservative news outlets (e.g. Breitbart and Fox) and Congressional Republicans back him at every turn, the latter willing to turn a blind eye if it’ll help them force their agenda through without bipartisan support. Who needs checks and balances anyway, right?
This is tantamount to gaslighting the American people, desensitizing us and whittling away at our common sense with a ceaseless barrage of fabricated statements, gradually convincing us that the administration is doing a great job when in reality, it’s working toward the pro-life and gun-toting country that the NRA and radical conservatives dream about.
President Trump isn’t the first demagogue to ever inhabit the White House: American history is riddled with similar characters like Andrew Jackson and Warren G. Harding, and every president is controversial in some respect. However, Trump stands out in the sense that he lies boldly and frequently to the people, and many of his claims are offensive and inappropriate.
And nothing proves that better than the recent tweet regarding Hurricane Florence.
Crises are generally seen as proving grounds for a president and depending on how well the sitting commander in chief responds, the public may reward their efforts at the polls and ballot boxes; this was evident when George W. Bush’s approval ratings jumped significantly following the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
Hurricanes aren’t comparable to something like the falling of the Twin Towers, but they can still destroy millions of homes and take countless lives, leaving wide swaths of destruction in their wake. In these dark times, Americans look to their leader for comfort and support, relying on them as they face the tremendously difficult task of rebuilding.
As Florence made landfall, battering the coast with its strong winds, torrential rains, and dangerous flooding, Trump not only offered few meaningful words of consolation, but he felt the need (as he often does) to correct a past “mistake” by the fake news media. So, on Sept. 13, Trump took to Twitter and proved that even pathological liars can reach new lows:
“3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000…”
Trump then goes on to blame this “incorrect” reporting on the Democrats:
“...This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!”
So not only did the president actively deny the deaths of 3,000 American citizens following Hurricane Maria, he then had the audacity to blame the “false” number on the Democrats, taking what was a tragic situation and politicizing it to meet his own twisted goals.
Although this outburst sickening, it proves that much like the authoritarian state of Oceania in Orwell’s dystopian world of 1984, Trump will say anything to make himself look better and to preserve his position of authority, even if it means crossing the line. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s tweet drew fire from Democrats and Republicans alike. But underlying the vociferous denunciations was the sad realization that this was the norm and that things are only going to get worse.
The reason this tweet is so concerning is not only because of the insensitive content, but also because it provides more insights into Trump’s ghastly character, painting him as an unstable, impulsive narcissist who makes questionable and outright poor decisions, such as when he seemed incapable of criticizing the Neo-Nazis and white supremacists after the Charlottesville protests, insisting that there were “good people on both sides.”
This is the person in charge of our international relations and trade, domestic policies, and the nuclear launch codes. Frankly, that’s not a little disquieting, especially in the context of the current controversy over Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court and the escalating trade war with China. Trump’s amorality may have served him well in the business world, but running a country and a company are worlds apart.
It’s important to remember that even though things seem bleak, as college students, we don’t always feel the full force of the administration’s capricious policies, the exception being specific policies targeting international students or students without established American citizenship, or policies affecting federal loans and financial aid. For the most part, the consequences of the government’s decisions manifest among the non-matriculating, working and middle-class citizens of America. But just because we are not directly affected doesn’t mean that we’re exempt from action.
We are lucky to be in such an insular atmosphere during a time rife with uncertainty and fear, but it’s equally important to remember that with that privilege comes responsibilities. Historically, colleges have been hotspots of progressive thinking and political activism, and we should do our best to educate ourselves about the State of the Union and the world. To that end, I encourage everyone to read literature from both sides of the political spectrum and to engage in the dying art of civil discourse, reaching across the chasm that our Congressional representatives seem incapable of bridging. Through understanding opposing perspectives, we can better discern fact from fiction and form our own educated judgments and conclusions about the news we encounter every day.
Political activism is the duty of every citizen because a democracy cannot stand on a foundation of ignorance. But activism doesn’t mean that we must have weekly protests over every single controversial issue; just the simple act of staying informed — and voting when elections roll around — is enough. After all, we are the future, and if we do our best to become worldly citizens who stand upon a foundation of truth, then our representatives will reflect our values and restore some much-needed honor and dignity to our politics.

2018-10-15,CMU,China,"The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) demonstration at the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) misses the point.
Shortly after the TOC (which I couldn't attend), I read a Tartan article reporting on this action. I felt the Carnegie Mellon SDS's actions were debatable, and their reasons as reported by The Tartan simplistic. On the action themselves, this action is unlikely to have any effect on the four companies targeted (why those four and not include Boeing, for instance?). At best, they may decide to go recruit elsewhere, but this is not going to impact their behavior and profits in any way. This is not going to have the sort of impact as the Stanford April 3rd movement. 
On the other side, it may have some negative consequences on the image of Carnegie Mellon and its alumni, as this protest will be associated with Carnegie Mellon's image. Student outreach and fostering a debate on other opportunities could have been as appropriate without publicly involving the school. But regardless of the actual action, I have been unable to get any further information on the reason and the objective of Carnegie Mellon's new SDS movement apart from The Tartan reporting and the previous SDS article. Saying that corporations that work for the U.S. military (usually with close cooperation with the federal government) are ""bad for humanity"" is quite naïve and imprecise, and Lockheed Martin profits come basically from the federal government (either federal contract or exportation obtained by the US diplomacy). Those profits from selling weapons are, and the use of said weapons are, as much the federal government responsibility as from the company. Also, like Ukraine, the South China Sea, South Ossetia, and many others can testify, some geopolitics actors are keen to use force and military might in order to achieve their end, meaning that democracies cannot get rid of their armed forces, and consequently there will be an industrial base to produce the said weapon. That said there are indeed several actual problems with the military-industrial complex in the United States, which require precision.
The term ""military-industrial complex"" was coined by President Eisenhower in his final address, where the WWII general warned the USA to guard against its military-industrial complex. His point was not that there should be no industry dedicated to fulfilling the need of the armed forces, but that the people and its representative should not let the military industrial unchecked and exert oversight and control over the military. And today, sadly, the representatives of the United States citizens has failed to keep this complex in check. The modern United States tends to have a big respect for its soldiers and veterans but fails to make the criticism it badly needs. The Vietnam war was followed by actual criticism of the decision taken and changes. The last military operation that was a strategic victory is 91 the First Gulf War. Several unsuccessful military operations later, no criticism of them is in sight. While all the other budget is reduced and federal investment in infrastructure, healthcare is usually opposed by part of the public opinion. It is worth mentioning that the biggest federal infrastructure investment since the end of the war — with the interstate network built by the same Eisenhower — managed to pass it on the defense budget. This issue will not be solved by protesting the companies but by getting involved in politics and holding your representative accountable.
The selling of weapons to dictators and their use against civilians is the responsibility of the government that approved this exportation (of which the U.S. is far from being the only one guilty). This is also the point where I’d like to remind people that a lot of military technologies have dual purposes and that without the military industrial complex a lot of technologies would simply not exist. The internet was made possible by the involvement of DARPA. GPS was a military network, and even more so, satellites are still launched over derivative of ICBMs. (Who would have bet that Nazi V2 would lead to such a vital technology?). Less well known, the Silicon Valley ecosystem emerged because of the military industrial complex research on radars during the cold war.
Military research has its ethical issues, but precise cases need to be invoked. Who denigrates Einstein, Oppenheimer, Fermi for their involvement in the Manhattan project and in the two atomic detonations over Japan? They served their country in a time of war, and the decision was made by the president of the United States. Today, the ethical issue over armed drones, the use of neural networks for target acquisition are actual real things that deserve to be debated. For instance, my home country has decided against having armed drones, and drone pilots are projected to the theatre and instead of operating from the metropole and going back home after a day job of shooting people like U.S. drones operator do. Autonomous vehicles, targeting without humans in the loop, are subject that need to be debated and on which we may decide on the red-lines that we refuse to cross (similar to the ones making obvious that no one at Carnegie Mellon is ever going to work on offensive chemical or biological weapons).
And yet, as the latest issue of The Tartan mentions, the DARPA Urban challenge is one of the things that made possible the self-driving vehicle ecosystem that has hired many from Carnegie Mellon (Uber, Waymo and others).
To sum up, military industrial complex involvement at Carnegie Mellon is not a ""bad"" thing, by itself, but individual research project ethical issue should not be overlooked. The SDS should strive to tackle specific issues along with participating in a broader movement to hold accountable the government. And as the issues of the military complex are mainly political, for you readers that are U.S. citizen, it is also precisely time to express yourself in the coming midterms (the elections, but good luck everyone for the midterm exams too).

2018-10-29,CMU,China,"Imagine that you are arrested for making an anti-government comment. It doesn’t matter if it was serious or a joke, or if you meant any harm by it; the feds just show up at your door one day and drag you off to jail.
For those of us born and raised in the United States — a Western democracy founded on the principles of free speech, press, assembly, protest, and practice — this idea seems inconceivable. Today’s media constantly publishes content critical of the President and his administration (much to Trump’s chagrin), adolescents and adults alike crack political jokes and frequently engage in serious discussions, and late night talk shows seem incapable of being apolitical (not that that’s a bad thing).
The story, however, is quite different in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich monarchy whose material wealth often overshadows its moral corruption. There, activism is strictly taboo, with protesters often arrested and held captive by the state. Some are outright killed, and others are locked away forever, never to be seen again. This is all in the name of maintaining power and control at the highest levels of government — there’s no other way for an absolute monarchy to remain viable in the face of increasing globalism and rapidly spreading democratic values than to wipe out dissent wherever it may arise.
Saudi Arabia has long come under fire from the international community for its human rights violations and efforts to hide its misdeeds. However, the kingdom came under increased scrutiny recently, following the recent murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.
Khashoggi was living in Virginia under self-imposed exile after fleeing Saudi Arabia, fearful of being targeted by the government for siding with progressives. During his time in the U.S., he was approached on multiple occasions by operatives of the Saudi government, all trying to lure him back with promises of wealth and status, as reported by The Atlantic. Khashoggi never returned to Saudi Arabia — despite the tempting offers — but did go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to finalize divorce papers, officializing his separation from his ex-wife so he could marry his fiancée, as reported by BBC.
He was never seen again.
When news of his disappearance first surfaced, many feared that Khashoggi had been killed by Saudi agents. At first, Saudi Arabia denied these accusations, claiming that Khashoggi exited the consulate through a backdoor entrance. The only problem was that there was no corroborating evidence, and the international community was not satisfied.
What followed was a string of contentious negotiations between the Saudi, Turkish, and U.S. governments; an inconclusive search of the consulate facilities by a Turkish task force; the Saudis rapidly backtracking on their initial narrative, offering instead that Khashoggi was killed by rogue agents and that his death was not affiliated with the crown; and increased uncertainty for the future U.S.-Saudi relationship.
As tragic as Khashoggi’s killing is, the response from the U.S. government was especially troubling. When pressed about the disappearance of Khashoggi on live television, President Trump at first deflected, showing indifference and claiming that the incident was of lesser importance given that Khashoggi was not an actual American citizen, as reported by Time. He then continued onwards, focusing not on the loss of life and the potentially egregious actions of the Saudi government, but rather, how he would have to reconsider U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, framing the issue economically.
The president’s comments are not surprising, with his racist history and denigration of the press, branding it as the “enemy of the people” and frequently encouraging violence against journalists at his many rallies.
But while the president’s words are nothing new, the underlying message remains disturbing: if you are of a certain ethnicity, citizenship status, or political orientation not agreeing with Trump’s vision of a xenophobic, nationalistic, and racist America, then you are less valuable. It is a soulless way to approach the task of governance and undoubtedly springs from Trump’s business background.
In the past, premeditated deaths of Americans abroad have always met with severe consequences, ones befitting of the crime. The America of yesterday seems very different from the America of today, where how much you matter to those in power depends on how much you agree with them.
This is the message that Trump, and his administration, is sending the world, and it’s dangerously emboldening for the dictatorships out there. Rather than the U.S. upholding and defending human rights on a global scale and acting as a refuge for those seeking asylum, Trump has narrowed his scope solely to the nation’s borders, even declaring himself a nationalist at a Houston rally, as reported by The New York Times. And of course, Trump isn’t going to focus on all of America, just the demographics that he cares about.
With the most powerful nation in the world becoming increasingly nationalist, countries like Saudi Arabia see it as an opportunity to do as they like, asserting their totalitarian ideologies over their citizens and crushing their opponents through any means necessary. We already see this in Russia, where enemies of Putin often don’t live to see election day, and also in China, where President Xi Jinping scrapped term limits to make himself “president for life” this March, as reported by BBC.
This sets a very dangerous precedent for progressivism around the world, making it clear that you can no longer escape the grasp of these heinous regimes. While it’s important to consider a nation’s sovereignty, it’s equally important to ensure that people, regardless of nationality and geography, are treated humanely. We as a country and as members of the international community cannot stand idly by as these voices are snuffed out.
As with many of the problems that we face, the issue originates from the top of the political pyramid, and if we hope to change anything, we must first ensure that our leaders are worldly and compassionate, not paranoid and hateful. Only by doing our part as citizens in this social contract can we ensure that the US continues as a place of safety, freedom, and growth, spreading those noble values beyond the confines of our country. After all, as The Washington Post is fond of saying, “Democracy dies in darkness.”.

2018-11-12,CMU,China,"On Oct. 26, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) sacked the Prime Minister, Ranil Wikramasinghe of the United National Party (UNP), ending a three-year-old alliance often marked with internal turbulence, and setting off a Constitutional crisis in the island nation. He then installed an ally-turned-foe-turned-ally, Former President Mahindra Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as Prime Minister. Two weeks later, on Nov. 9, President Sirisena dissolved the Sri Lankan Parliament and called a snap general election to be held on Jan. 5. He also suspended the House until Nov. 16, based on reports released at the time of the writing of this article.
This latest political tussle between Rajapaksa and Wikramasinghe has experts and lawyers divided on the constitutional legality of Sirisena’s action. Under Article 33 (2)(c) in the 19th Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution, “in addition to the powers, duties, and functions expressly conferred or imposed on, or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall never have the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.” The president’s ardent supporters cite this article to defend his actions. However, there are also serious problems, as Article 70(1) of the 19th Amendment also states that the president cannot dissolve the Parliament before four and a half years into its five-year term unless requested by two-thirds of its members.
Article 33(2) is also a general provision describing the powers and functions of the president, including the power of the president to dissolve the parliament. But Article 70(1) is a specific provision that limits this power of the president in regards to the dissolution of the parliament. And based on the standard rule of interpretation, a general provision must always be read subject to a specific provision. 
As the Wikramasinghe-Sirisena coalition had lasted a little more than three years, this renders the Sirisena’s move to dissolve the Parliament unconstitutional, according to several legal experts.
In 2015, when Sirisena and Wikramasinghe’s parties, which are rivals and ideological polar opposites, teamed up for the elections to defeat incumbent Rajapaksa, it caused ripples of surprise all around. However, now that Wikramasinghe’s political star and public popularity has waned thanks to slowed economic growth and several internal tussles between the former-rivals-turned-allies, Sirisena covertly formed an alliance with Rajapaksa. One of the main reasons, according to reports, is Wikramasinghe’s strongly worded statement that he issued in New Delhi after meeting the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Oct. 20 about the delay in Indian projects in Sri Lanka, that seemed to be blaming the president. Wikramasinghe’s visit to India also came in the backdrop of reports in which Sirisena accused the Indian government’s Intelligence Agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), of plotting his assassination, which Wikramasinghe repeatedly denied ahead of his visity in order to maintain Indian confidence in his government. Another reason, analysts speculate, could be the rejection of two of Sirisena’s nominees for the Supreme court and an Appeals Court.
Whatever the reasons may be, the Rajapaksa-Sirisena alliance is back, sparking fear of violence in Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa is known for quelling the insurgency and ending the civil war with the ethnic Tamilian separatist group, Liberation of Tamil Tigers Eelam (LTTE). But the massive human rights violations, including the murder of LTTE chief Prabhakaran’s 12-year-old son, who was handed a pack of biscuits before being executed, have cast the international spotlight on the various methods of suppression used by Rajapaksa and the Sri Lankan army in Tamil-dominated regions like Jaffna, even after the war ended. Rajapaksa is also very pro-Chinam and his tenure saw massive amounts of Chinese investments, including the construction of a port in Sri Lanka. In fact, when he lost the elections in 2015, Rajapaksa accused India of orchestrating his defeat.
Reports indicate that prior to his firing, Wikramasinghe had argued with Sirisena about a proposal to grant the development of a Colombo port project to an India-Japan joint venture. Wikramasinghe had allegedly argued that the decision should respect the memorandum of understanding signed by Sri Lanka, India, and Japan. However, reports suggest that Sirisena wanted to reject the proposal. 
These reports seem to suggest that the tussle for power between India and China for investments in Sri Lanka may have led to this latest political crisis in Sri Lanka. While India remains concerned that China intends to turn Sri Lanka into a military outpost, which could greatly harm India’s security and territorial integrity due to its proximity to Sri Lanka, China continues to grow its portfolio of investments in Sri Lanka, welcoming it into its ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR) program in 2017 and subsequently increasing investment. 
Wikramasinghe’s United National Party is going to the Supreme Court to challenge what it calls the illegal dissolution of the Parliament by Sirisena. Meanwhile, countries around the world are observing the situation cautiously. The Japan International Cooperation Agency put a $1.4 billion soft debt to a light railway project in Colombo on hold, while the U.S. Department of State released a statement calling on President Sirisena to reconvene the Parliament to let democratically elected representatives decide who will lead the government..

2018-11-19,CMU,China,"Being the beauty product fiend that I am, I wanted to check out the latest products trending on Sephora's website in light of their store-wide fall sale. When I clicked on the ""Beauty's Rising Stars"" tab, I was shocked to see that so many of the brands were Korean. For this week, Kaja's Cheeky Blush Stamps made it to Sephora's Beauty's Rising Stars. This is not the first time Sephora featured a Korean brand as a Rising Star; skincare brand Saturday Skin was featured in Volume 14 in Jan. 2018.
Before Sephora gave these specific products shoutouts, I was well aware that K-Beauty was increasing in popularity in recent years. I saw Western beauty gurus on YouTube testing out these exotic products packaged in cutesy containers. Cushion foundations, sheet masks, and BB creams were entering drugstores' shelves — all products originating from Korea — and covered the shelves of practically every beauty section in every drugstore I visited. Seeing brands that are more popular in the U.S., from affordable brands like Wet n' Wild to luxury brands like Lancome, try to adopt trends set by Korean brands filled me with a sense of great joy.
Obviously, I'm not the mastermind who invented any of those products. However, being able to share them with my loved ones lets me feel like I can share a part of my world with others. Imagine having a friend who lives far away from you visit you. You take them to your favorite restaurant and share the experience of enjoying your favorite dishes. Now, take this experience and amplify it. That's essentially what it feels like to be able to go shopping with my friends and be able to recommend products that I grew up watching my mother and other empowering women in my life use.
My mother recently saw her sister for the first time in over two years. One of the things they got to bond over was an emerging Korean skincare brand, Belif. ""How'd you know about this brand; it's a Korean brand!,"" my aunt said. I had actually recommended my mother this skincare brand after receiving some free samples.
Unfortunately, I have yet to test out my mother's favorites from back when she was in college, as many of the brands still test on animals due to China's requirement for products to be tested on animals before hitting brick and mortar shelves. However, if the animal testing policy were to be lifted, something reminiscent of my mother's college days could linger even decades after she graduated on the opposite side of the globe. Luckily, an end to China's animal testing policy may be on the horizon. Once that domino is toppled, brands will no longer have incentives to continue animal testing, as other methods, such as in-vitro testing are more ethical, accurate, and cost-efficient.
Of course, there is room for improvement in Korean beauty. Because of their origins, the shade range for Korean complexion products is extremely lacking for Western standards. Some brands with a larger international reach such as Laneige has expanded their shade selection beyond the traditional four or five most other brands offer, but potential consumers with darker or lighter complexions often don't have many options, if any at all. It makes sense that Korean products mainly cater to light beige skin colors, as Korea's demographics are much more homogeneous than America's. However, as K-beauty increases its global spread, I think it's safe to say that brands will expand and allow not just those with light beige skin to enjoy their products, but also people with all other skin colors.
There is room for optimism. Julep, a brand owned by Korean entrepreneur Jane Park, offers thirty shades for concealers. Park remembered what it was like to immigrate from South Korea to Canada at the age of four, and she remembered what it was like to feel like she had no voice. Now, through her nail care, skin care, and cosmetics line, she is aspiring to inspire women everywhere to build confidence and take risks. Julep is one of the fastest-growing beauty brands and sets the example of how to make Korean beauty more inclusive to a diverse population. Similarly, Kaja's models display the versatility of their product range by showing how their products work on the fairest and darkest skin tones.
It's fantastic that I can finally get my K-beauty fix without paying ridiculous international fees or asking my friends and family in Korea to send over some goods. However, nothing can truly replace the unique experience of going into a store with some friends or my mother, and testing out different products on the back of my hand (and consequently turning my hand into a shimmery painter's palette). It sounds silly that I find so much value in beauty products; at the end of the day, it's just powders and creams. However, for me, I also see them as experiences I get to share with others. As I count down the days until I get to see my mother, I cannot wait to chat over sheet masks with her..

2018-12-03,CMU,China,"Dr. Barbara Shinn-Cunningham, director of Carnegie Mellon’s new neuroscience institute, spoke with The Tartan about the potential of neuroscience research on campus and beyond. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.
What is the current state of Carnegie Mellon’s neuroscience institute?
We’re doing organizational planning behind the scenes. We’ll be launching in the spring semester. We are going around and talking to various people at the university and in the Pittsburgh community about what we are about, and putting together websites and things like that, so that when we launch, we have a public space ready to go.
What sort of partnerships can we expect from the institute?
There are partnerships both within the university and then within the Pittsburgh area, and even more broadly. Within the university, I report to the dean of the Mellon College of Science as well as the dean of Dietrich. Within the institute, we have members in not only Mellon and Dietrich but also the School of Computer Science, the College of Engineering and even the College of Fine Arts. 
If you step back even further within the Pittsburgh area, the Institute will make sure the CNBC (Center for Neural Basis of Cognition) continues. It’s been around for a very long time, and supports cognitive neuroscience efforts that are collaborative between Pitt and CMU.
The institute is already reaching out to other partner institutions. We had two different visitors just this week, for instance, who are heading neuroscience institutes in China to talk about the potential for collaborations, and exchange of students and faculty.
Could you elaborate on the research that will take place? 
Right now there’s about 40 faculty, and their areas of research fall in three or four bins. There’s a bunch of people like me, who do human work, who study perception and the brain and neuroimaging. 
Then there’s a large effort within engineering and computer science; there are people who are doing development of devices to measure or even manipulate brain activity so if you have someone, for instance, with Parkinson’s, you can stimulate portions of the brain and alleviate the symptoms.
Another set of people, within engineering, are doing brain-computer interfaces, which has usually been applied to help people who have spinal cord injuries, and can’t move their bodies or portions of their bodies. 
There are a bunch of people in biology, they’re really looking at the brain at a cellular level. 
And then finally we have collaborators in machine learning and statistics who are helping unravel all the data that new techniques to measure brain activity are generating.
How are you going to incorporate cross-disciplinarity in the institute?
It’s really fun — one of the things that already happens naturally within CMU is collaboration across these different fields, so it’s very easy to come in as a director into CMU and just nurture what is already happening. For instance, the people who do brain-computer interface include people on the biology side who collaborate incredibly tightly with people from biomedical engineering and electrical and computer engineering. A lot of what my job is, in coming into this, is to make sure that those people who want to collaborate don’t have things standing in their way.
Another thing that we’re doing is holding small meetings of faculty who have more interest in talking about other ways we can build collaboration. We’ll be holding some meetings open to the public that are scientifically intense workshops, and we’ll be focusing them on areas where there’s already a lot of strength at CMU. We will also be bringing in some external speakers to interact with the great scientists we already have here.
You also mentioned technological approaches, such as machine learning and data-driven science. Do you believe these types of techniques are the future of the field?
I believe it’s a really important tool to help us understand the neural code in data that are being generated today. It used to be that people who are measuring from the brain would look at a single cell, and figure out how a single cell reacts to different inputs. From that they’d try and figure out what that single cell was encoding. Now, people are up to measuring thousands of units at a time, and that’s a tiny percentage of what’s going on in the brain. Trying to figure out from observing their firing pattern, for instance — what mental plan is being encoded at a particular instance — is a challenge. We need to have people in machine learning working hand in hand with neuroscientists to understand the kind of information likely to be meaningful in this data.
You mentioned different levels of complexity: from single cells to the whole brain. Do you find that integrating these different levels of complexity is a challenge?
Most scientists in academia tend to study one small problem — one sub-sub-subfield of some bigger field — and in neuroscience that’s especially true. There are people who work at the single unit level; there are people who work at the network level; there are people who work at the whole brain level. There are people who come at it from a behavioral standpoint and try and relate that to the brain. And all of these different levels are intricate and complicated and difficult to work on. What’s fun about CMU is people work across those scales pretty naturally, which is unusual.
What role do you believe the new neuroscience institute can play in the field of neuroscience as a whole?
CMU isn’t a huge university — if you look just across the street at Pitt, there are so many more people doing neuroscience than CMU will ever have. We can’t compete in sheer numbers, yet we are going to play a big role. All the things that CMU is known for in the external world are exactly the tools that neuroscience needs right now at this junction: technology and analysis and machine learning and data science and statistics. And that is why I’m excited to come to CMU.
I’m an electrical engineer by training, so I came at neuroscience from an information theory kind of viewpoint: what information is in the brain, at what moment, in what place. That kind of automatic analytic approach to understanding the data that comes from the brain is what I think the field needs, and what CMU can do uniquely..

2018-12-03,CMU,China,"For better or for worse, Chinese geneticist He Jiankui may have just opened the Pandora’s box of gene-editing.
He, a researcher based in Shenzhen, China, claims to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies. “Two beautiful little Chinese girls, named Lulu and Nana, came crying into this world as healthy as any other babies,” said He in a YouTube video posted on his company’s channel on Monday. Before being implanted in the womb as embryos, Lulu and Nana’s genes were altered to prevent contraction of HIV. He used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to perform gene surgery in order to reproduce a natural genetic variation that confers strong resistance to HIV-1 infection.
He’s actions have caused a global outcry, with scientists worldwide expressing shock and outrage. More than 120 Chinese scientists issued a joint statement on Monday, condemning He’s use of the CRISPR-Cas9 on a baby as a “huge blow” to the ethical standing of Chinese biomedical research. Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, described the experiment as being “far too premature.”
“We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being,” Topol explains. “It’s a big deal.”
A few scientists have spoken out against the criticisms, however. George Church, a famed geneticist at Harvard University, argued that He’s research is “justifiable” as a valiant attempt to battle HIV, “a major and growing public health threat.”
The Chinese government has halted the work of He’s lab, having ordered immediate investigations into the experiments. Furthermore, Professor He’s university, the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said it was unaware of the research project and that Professor He has been on unpaid leave for the past few months. Gene editing outside of lab research is outlawed or restricted in many countries, including China.
The CRISPR gene editing technique used by He was developed in 2013, and while its potential has been widely praised, it is still considered experimental. Many unintended mutations, capable of causing genetic problems later in life, including cancer, are associated with the procedure. As explained by Feng Zhang, one of the key inventors of CRISPR, “when you change one thing, something else gets changed, too.”
Several scientists have reviewed the experimental materials that He provided to the public and said the tests are insufficient to confirm whether the editing worked or caused harm. 
It was also noted that the evidence may suggest that the editing was incomplete and left various changes to a patchwork of cells. Moreover, even if editing worked perfectly, the imposed HIV-resistant gene variation is known to increase risk of other viruses and diseases. Such evidence begs the question of how much there was to be gained in terms of protection against HIV.
Professor He’s lab has altered embryos for over seven couples, but only one of the experiments has led to pregnancy. Many are unsettled that the participants may not have given fully informed consent to the treatment, as He’s consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program.
However, He maintains that the patients were well aware of the nature of the research, saying that he personally explained the forms to each family “line by line.” He also promised to provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and medical follow-up until the children reach adulthood.
According to He, the parents involved refuse to be identified or interviewed. He also would not disclose where the parents are from or where the work was done.
Professor He recognized early on that his work would cause much controversy. However, he believes “families need this technology,” He explained.
If the treatment causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”.

2018-12-03,CMU,China,"“Wrap up the fall season with TEDxCMU’s coziest event of the year!” This was the tagline for TEDxCMU’s Fall Mini Event, and between the complimentary doughnuts, coffee, and Red Bulls, the Christmas lights strung around the railings of Giant Eagle Auditorium, and Baker Hall’s sheltering warmth, the event certainly lived up to this standard.
Four students spoke at the Mini Event: first was Sarah Boyle, a junior in Drama, who spoke about comedy as an agent for change. Next, Zirui Zheng, a masters student in Information Systems discussed his journey of self-identification. Third, senior in Biological Sciences Raashmi Krishnasamy detailed three steps that Carnegie Mellon students can take to succeed happily. Lastly, Ethan Yang, a freshman in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, spoke about how an accidental haircut got him out of his comfort zone.
Boyle began by explaining that “playing to the truth” and being believable to the audience is crucial in a successful performance. She said that stereotypes are important in improv comedy because they make the situations believable, but they may be demeaning to the characters.
Improv can also be used to change people’s ideas of what is normal and believable, Boyle explained, and spoke on the power of diversity in comedy. When an improv troupe has more diversity, it contains more personal perspectives, which it can use to help normalize more diverse ideas.
The second speaker, Zheng, spoke about the experiences he has had since coming to the United States from China seven years ago, and the lessons that he has learned. When he first moved to the U.S., he adopted the name Michael. Afterward, he began to contemplate the balance of Chinese and American culture in his life.
After living in America for a few years, he learned many valuable lessons. First, he learned that stereotypes can be true sometimes, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Zheng also emphasized the importance of uniqueness and being comfortable with that uniqueness. He explained that everyone is unique, but that uniqueness only shows when people are comfortable being themselves. And when you are yourself, people respect that. Lastly, he spoke about how the United States is full of unique, diverse cultures, and how it is our job to bring out this uniqueness and diversity in everyone.
During her presentation, Krishnasamy explained that happily succeeding at Carnegie Mellon can be achieved in three steps: by asking yourself why you are making your current choices, being truthful with your answer to the first question and striving for excellence rather than perfection.
One day, Krishnasamy ended up in the hospital, and she discovered that her illness was partly caused by stress. She realized that if she had asked herself why she made certain choices, like why she was taking 15-112 as a pre-med student, and more importantly, been truthful with her answer, then she would have realized earlier that she was studying something she was not truly passionate about.
Lastly, Krishnasamy explained that Carnegie Mellon students should not strive for perfection because perfection is unreachable, citing Carnegie Mellon’s stress culture as a driver behind students’ quest for perfection. She suggested that our students should be striving for excellence instead because excellence is limitless. When a student has passion, purpose, and takes these three steps, then that student is on their way to happily succeeding at Carnegie Mellon.
Yang, the fourth and final speaker at the Fall Mini Event, spoke about how a haircut helped him to become more comfortable with all aspects of himself. When Yang was in fourth grade, he was diagnosed with moyamoya, a disorder caused by blocked arteries in the brain. After a stress-crying fit, he passed out and then needed brain surgery, which left incisions on both sides of his head.
He was so worried about being different that he always kept long hair to hide his scars. However, in his junior year of high school, his barber slipped up and gave him a haircut in which his scars were completely visible. When he went to school, he was bombarded with questions about them. At first, he was very uncomfortable talking about it, but after a while, he grew to be comfortable with it.
Yang said that getting out of his comfort zone led to a lot of personal growth. He left the audience with this message: “It changed my life — try it and see how it changes yours.”
Samuel Yip, the co-president of TEDxCMU, said that these speakers were chosen because the messages of their speeches were very pertinent to Carnegie Mellon students. 
Anyone interested in hearing their speeches can find them on YouTube. Yip said the TEDxCMU team is working hard to prepare for two upcoming events: the spring Mini Event, which will take place in February, and the main event, which is scheduled for March 30, 2019..

2019-02-11,CMU,China,"Last Friday, the Chinese Student Association (CSA) hosted their New Year Extravaganza around the black chairs of the Cohon University Center to welcome the “Year of the Pig” of the lunar calendar. The entire event was well balanced between hyped performances and intermittent food breaks, allowing the attendees to enjoy exciting performances while tasting indigenous Asian night-market food provided by different student organizations, such as the Japanese Student Association (JSA), the Korean American Students’ Association (KASA), and the Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture Organization (ARCC).
I attended the event as one of the dancers representing KASA dance. However, it was a total situational irony that led me to the event. Even though I am Chinese, I did not plan to go because of a potential time conflict. But, as a member of KASA dance, I was invited back to the event as a performer, dancing in front of my Chinese friends while wearing colors representing Korea. Korea! I thought in disbelief. It took me a while to internalize the turn of the event without feeling weird. For those who are acquainted with the cultural hot pot of America, this probably would only merit a shrug, a “Yeah, so what?” But as one of the Chinese international students coming from a homogeneous society, where everything about New Year is patriotic and strictly emphasizes China, seeing outside cultural elements dominating the center stage was a brand new experience for me.
I noticed the mentality difference when our KASA dance choreographer, Christine, proposed that during our performance we can wear shirts with “Korea” spelled in large letters in the front. Out of reflex, I immediately uttered a jammed “no, no, no” in response to her proposal. For a second, she frowned and looked at me in confusion. At that moment, I realized that I could never properly translate my previous eighteen years of Chinese New Years’ experience, but can only change my mindset to accept and discover the beauty in what used to be utterly unimaginable, yet is now a different kind of reality.
I remember standing on the second floor of the UC, overlooking the crowd, seeing a variety of people converging at the food stands, then forming a semi-circle to view the performance, amazed by how intercultural and welcoming CSA had made this event to be. Each body feeling the beats in their own rhythm, each mind taking in this occasion through their own lenses, each person contributing a little something unique and taking away a little something unique — just like how they also transformed my Chinese New Year from family reunions, firecrackers, red decor, and traditional Chinese customs to now, food from all over Asia, people from all over the world and a new reality that shines in the beaming beauty of intercultural experience..

2019-02-11,CMU,China,"With the Lunar New Year, many countries in Asia celebrate the new year according to the traditional lunar calendar. In China, nian gao is a popular rice cake made to celebrate the New Year, which is also known as the Spring Festival. Nian gao literally translates to “sticky cake,” but can also mean ""year cake"" or ""higher year"" due to the homophonic nature of the language. 
There are many types of nian gao, according to the different cuisines of various regions of China. Shanghai nian gao is savory and white, stir-fried with beef, pork, and vegetables. Northern nian gao is sweet to taste, usually steamed or fried. Guangdong’s (Canton) version is also sweet, with a distinct dark color due to brown sugar. It is steamed first, then fried, and dipped in egg. Traditionally, nian gao is steamed or fried because most families did not have ovens. In the United States, the prevalence of ovens led to the popularity of baked nian gao. This recipe is a gluten-free Chinese American baked concoction, closest to the Guangdong style that has been refined through thirty years of trial and error.
Yield: 25-30 pieces | Prep time: 15 minutes | Cook time: 50-60 minutes
Ingredients:

2019-02-11,CMU,China,"Last week, The Tartan reported on Carnegie Mellon's latest partnership with the U.S. military, the Army AI Task Force. As the article states, “the Army AI Task Force represents only the most recent chapter in a 70-year history of Carnegie Mellon working with the Department of Defense.” Nevertheless, this is a particularly outrageous chapter, and the justifications for it are deceptive and inhumane.
In support of the Task Force, Army Futures Commander General John Murray says that “the ‘character of war’ continues to evolve,” citing “quantum computing, ventures into space, directed energy, AI, and machine learning.” He predicts that very soon, “artificial intelligence will be ‘in everything, and everywhere.’”
In this way, General Murray seems to portray technological change as a natural force that humans don’t cause and couldn’t possibly redirect. In fact, the U.S. military has intentionally brought AI into war, dumping military funding into related technical areas. Their strategy has been to incentivize engineers and scientists at universities like Carnegie Mellon to work for war profiteers, to coax them into ignoring their conscience even as people everywhere, including in this country, are increasingly skeptical of the U.S.'s status as “leader of the free world.”
The U.S. military is currently occupying or bombing seven countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and it maintains special operations forces in over 100 others. It provides weapons, targeting assistance, and diplomatic support to the human rights-abusing regime of Saudi Arabia even as that government carries out a genocide in Yemen and regularly locks up and executes activists and dissidents from its own country. Right now, the U.S. military is threatening undemocratic regime change in Venezuela and Iran. To be clear, this is the institution that Carnegie Mellon's AI Task Force is supporting.
According to General Murray, the Carnegie Mellon-Army partnership will both “make our soldiers and units of the future more effective,” and “better yet” create a situation where “there will be nobody in the world who will challenge [the U.S.].” The General’s first point is a typical canard of pro-war discourse: even if you disagree with U.S. foreign policy, you should support any decision that “helps the troops.” We should reject this framing. The central issue is not the soldiers and units, but the policies they are carrying out: coups, bombings, and other acts of unprovoked violence. Why should we want such policies made “more effective”?
With his second point, General Murray betrays a desire for total U.S. domination. But we have seen, since 9/11, how U.S. occupation of regions like the Middle East has not brought ordinary people great benefits — to put it mildly. Globally, income and wealth inequality are increasing. Climate change and environmental degradation are accelerating. Migration crises, horrible in their own right, are creating political space for rising fascist movements in Europe, Asia, South America, and elsewhere. This is how things stand now, with the massive U.S. military encircling the globe, commanding advanced weaponry that our closest competitors could hardly dream of. Does it seem just to give the military even more power?
Discussing advances in AI, Secretary of the Army Mark T. Esper argues that “whoever gets there first” will be given a “decisive edge on the battlefield for years to come.” Again, this implies that changes in technology are simply occurring somewhere “out there” in the wild, with the Army’s technologists “discovering” them. In reality, U.S. leaders are actively fostering these changes in a race to the bottom with similarly militaristic war planners in China and Russia.
We don’t have to approach the issue that way. After decades of bloody proxy wars, it was direct negotiations that ended the Cold War with the Soviet Union in 1989. If negotiations had been more consistent, it may have ended much sooner. In his second term, President Obama’s administration held direct talks with Iran, a country that President Bush had relegated to the “Axis of Evil.” The result of Obama’s diplomacy was a multilateral agreement that made the world safer. If the U.S. wants to prevent AI from being used by China or Russia, it should work cooperatively with these and other world powers on a global AI weapons ban.
Instead, even our very own university president, Farnam Jahanian, is committed to war over diplomacy and negotiations. The Tartan reports that President Jahanian “excitedly stated ‘Carnegie Mellon stands ready to assist the Army.’” This is unacceptable. The President did not seek the input of students, faculty, or staff before proffering this view on our behalf — or indeed, before committing Carnegie Mellon to the Army AI Task Force itself.
For our part, SDS members stand ready to hold the U.S. military accountable and check its power at our university. When President Jahanian states that AI military applications “benefit society,” we strongly disagree. Any Task Force designed to keep the U.S. at war forever, dominating and controlling the world, is anathema to democracy, peace, and social justice.

2019-02-18,CMU,China,"This past week's Valentine's Day festivities got me thinking about good date night food and even good food ideas to make with friends. What's something you can cook together that's a bit nicer, more than pasta or mac'n'cheese (nothing against those — I absolutely love comfort food), and a bit more challenging than throwing chicken and veggies in the oven? As a student, it's difficult to commit to making a full meal with the right balance of protein, veggies, and grains that's not too expensive or hard to make.
The menu recipe below is a combination of some of my favorite things to make when I'm in a fancier mood. Salmon is one of my favorite foods, so it is very much the star of this meal. Asparagus is such a simple vegetable to make that goes well with everything, and fried rice is always a great fall-back for your grains — there are so many different ways to make it! So invite some friends over, or plan a night in with your significant other and enjoy a fun night of food, friendship, and fun.
Pan-seared and Oven-baked Salmon
This is one of my favorite dishes, and it's my go-to for almost any occasion. Cooking it takes two essential steps, the pan-searing and the baking, but it only takes about 10 minutes total.
Ingredients
- salmon fillets
- salt and pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- garlic, minced
- 1 fresh lemon
- 1 tbsp cooking wine
- spring onion, chopped (optional)
- cilantro, minced (optional)
Directions
1) Preheat the oven to 400°F. Pat salt and pepper into each side of the salmon fillets, according to preference.
2) Cover a thin layer of a skillet with olive oil, and stir in the minced garlic. On medium-high heat, pan-sear the fillets, skin-side down, for two minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice and pour cooking wine over the fillets. Add in the cilantro and spring onion if you would like (I'm a huge herb and spice person, so I tend to throw in whatever I have). After the two minutes, carefully flip over the fillets and sear them for two more minutes, skin-side up.
3) Transfer the fillets into a bake-safe dish and bake in the oven for 7-8 minutes. I also like to squeeze in more lemon juice, and chop up the lemon itself and throw it in with the fillets.
Stir-fry Asparagus
This is a standard stir-fry recipe, and it works with any vegetable I can think of. Other choices I like to eat with my salmon are broccoli, green beans, and snow peas.
Ingredients
- asparagus
- garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt, to taste
Directions
1) Chop your asparagus to the size you want. I like to make mine about an inch long, but any size will do.
2) Heat the olive oil in a skillet, and stir in the minced garlic. Stir-fry the asparagus in until deep green. Add in salt to taste.
""Breakfast"" Fried Rice
Full disclosure: this fried rice isn't really called ""breakfast"" fried rice, nor is it typically served as just breakfast. It's one of the many standard fried rice recipes I grew up eating. But I call it this because this is the kind of fried rice that is always served at the complimentary breakfasts of the hotels I have stayed at in China.
Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cooked scrambled egg
- 1/4 cup spring onion, chopped
- optional: cooked shrimp, peas, sausage, ham, etc.
- salt, pepper, spices, to taste
Directions
1) Heat the oil in a skillet. Dump the rice in and mix, breaking up compact and sticky parts.
2) Stir in the scrambled eggs and spring onion, mixing it into the rice. By this step, you can add other cooked ingredients (my favorite being chopped Taiwanese sausage). Add salt, pepper, and other spices to taste. Fry until the rice is as soft or crispy as you like. Personally, I like my rice soft but with a slight crisp on the edges, so I only cook for about three minutes.
Now, set your table, serve, and enjoy!.

2019-02-18,CMU,China,"This past Thursday, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers, killing 45 men in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. This incident is the latest in a series of attacks on the Indian Army in the ever-turbulent Kashmir, and Pakistan-based terrorist organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed, has taken responsibility for the attack. The horrific killings have drawn massive outrage all across India and led to growing calls for revenge, some calling for outright war against Pakistan and others demanding that a surgical strike gets carried out, the likes of the one that took place as retaliation for the attack on an Indian Army post in Uri in 2016. 
As an Indian, I share the collective grief, pain, and anguish that is being expressed in my nation. Scrolling through my Twitter feed and reading the names of the men who were killed and their stories made it even more tragic. 
The problem is that terrorism in Kashmir has become multidimensional. For example, Jaish Chief Masood Azhar, who was the mastermind behind the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai that killed over 200 civilians and now the attack in Pulwama, has been allowed to contest elections in Pakistan and even preach to the public while China blocked India from listing Azhar as a designated International terrorist in the United Nations Security Council. Since 2017, China has kept the listing of Azhar on “technical hold” by citing “lack of consensus” in the UN sanctions committee.
This listing decision also comes months after the Wuhan summit, which was meant to thaw the icy Indo-Chinese relationship post the heightened tensions in Doklam in 2017, in which both Indian and Chinese forces had a standoff near a trijunction area when Indian forces opposed Chinese construction extending a road into an area which was claimed by both China and Bhutan, which is an Indian ally. 
But whatever progress was made during Wuhan will undoubtedly take a backseat after these attacks, as China still cites technicalities to refuse listing Azhar as a terrorist. 
With general elections only a little more than a month away in India, the Modi government is already under immense pressure to retaliate. India has stripped Pakistan of its “Most Favoured Nation” status, which had previously allowed it to enjoy low trade tariffs and high import quotas. It remains to be asked why the government did not remove this status from Pakistan immediately after Uri. Though there are heightened calls for another surgical strike on terrorist camps in Pakistan, the very idea of a surgical strike demands an element of surprise that would be lost if the other side knows in advance and prepares for an attack, potentially catalyzing a warlike situation between the two nations leading to the further loss of life. 
India could potentially pursue the isolation of Pakistan diplomatically and pressure it to arrest Mazhoor. However, India’s response to China will be one of utmost interest as China’s technical hold is the only obstacle to Azhar’s designation as an international terrorist. At this time, it is important for India to gather support from around the world to increase pressure on both Pakistan and China. 
But beyond this affair, the real test for the Modi government is figuring out how to reevaluate its policy on Kashmir to provide a robust solution to the ongoing violence in the valley. While Pakistan provided training and China prevented the mastermind from being designated a terrorist, the militant suicide bomber who claimed 44 lives was from Kashmir. The problem in Kashmir has become multidimensional with multiple entities and multiple agendas, including independence and religion, and it is imperative that the government find long-term solutions to achieve this end..

2019-02-25,CMU,China,"It is estimated that almost 30 million people in the U.S. suffer from an eating disorder, and college students are some of the most susceptible to developing them. Sufferers of the illness may feel as though they are alone in their struggle, but in reality there is a significant chance that at least one of their classmates shares a similar situation.
Many students are not aware of resources both on-campus and off-campus that are available to help them. Even then, Carnegie Mellon does not offer many specialized services for eating disorders on campus. When thinking about what Carnegie Mellon has to offer, the response I received was mostly limited to the Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) offered free-of-charge for students. However, the accessibility of the services remains a concern to some.
Some have found that it is difficult to schedule an appointment, taking up to weeks. The cost of off-campus services such as therapists, intensive outpatient (IOP), and hospitalization can be out of students’ budget or can be a daunting time commitment. Further, the stigma surrounding mental health and seeking help may further steer students away. However, when I reached out to people on campus, there were a handful of students who wanted to break the silence by opening up about how eating disorders impacted their lives.
Dietrich sophomore Sarah Shaheen is nearly the ideal college student. She seems to strike a balance between a strong academic performance and an active social life. To others, she is perceived as happy and confident. However, she also happens to struggle with anorexia. Already existing struggles with anxiety, combined with issues with body image, pushed her into a vicious relationship of restricting food and exercising. It didn’t take long before she realized she had to “choose between [her] eating disorder and a life in college.”
Freshman orientation week required stamina that an eating disorder couldn’t sustain. Classes became more demanding. Many social events, from get-togethers to on-campus organizations, included food somewhere. Some people close to her started picking up clues to her illness. Although she thought she was recovering, she found out right before spring break that she had hit her lowest weight. As a result, she spent her first spring break at college at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). After inpatient treatment, she was recommended to follow through with IOP, but the demanding time constraint seemed to be too much to balance with school. Ultimately, she decided not to. She was not aware that a significant number of Carnegie Mellon students have gone through IOP care through UPMC during their time in college, and accommodations to help students receive treatment while pursuing their education are available. When hearing this, she reflected and said that knowing this may have impacted how she evaluated her pros and cons and perhaps even her final decision.
Like Shaheen, CIT freshman Kaylee Liang’s struggles with eating disorders began before she came to college. She, as well as some others, found that the rigors of university helped her keep her mind off her disorder and thus aided with her recovery. However, she cites stress as one of her main triggers of urges to relapse, which is a common trigger for many other college students who suffer from the illness. New pressures, such as moving away from home for the first time and academic stress, can often push students towards a desire for control or perfection, especially at such a competitive school as Carnegie Mellon.
Liang also brings up an important aspect of the discussion of eating disorders: cultural pressure. Eating disorder rates are climbing in East Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Korea. The booming plastic surgery industry in Korea, for example, may drive people towards unrealistic body images. It doesn’t help that with the relatively collectivist nature of the cultures in these countries, this pressure can further reinforce the stigma around mental health and impose a desire for conformity, potentially discouraging individuals from talking about their struggles or seeking the help that they need.
Racial minorities, in general, tend to have higher rates of undiagnosed eating disorders, an aspect of eating disorders that commonly gets overlooked.
Other sides of the issue on campus are block sizes and dining options. Some students have encouraged the university to make changes to meal plans. Shaheen suggested a sample guideline to show what healthy portions look like for different types of people. Eating disorders can be sneaky and can be “hard to tell when you’re slipping up.” What can make recovering from an eating disorder so difficult lies in trying to bounce back to “normalcy.” It can be hard to recall what normalcy was or even define what a healthy diet even consists of.
A sample guideline, Shaheen argues, could give students at least a loose benchmark as to what “normalcy” might look like given their activities and their basic needs. University Health Services (UHS) does have a nutritionist on staff, but only for two days a week, making it potentially incompatible with the schedules of students who may need help.
Food insecurity has also been cited as a problem. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, had struggled with anorexia in the past. Today, she is still struggling with the illness and the physical consequences she has been battling for years. The burden of food insecurity places additional pressure on her, often leaving her no choice but to restrict her diet, further exacerbating her condition.
Those in her situation may also find that having an excuse to continue previous behaviors may hamper efforts to recover. To help with the broader problem of food insecurity, Carnegie Mellon recently established a food pantry.
The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) announced that this week is National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. The theme for 2019, “Come as You Are,” aims to broaden the conversation of eating disorders and promote more unifying conversations on the topic.
Although topics like healthy eating habits and positive body image pop up in events like our annual Fresh Check Day, it is imperative that students know that there is help available, and that there is no shame in seeking it. “You don’t have to hit rock bottom before you get help,” Shaheen says. Prevention and early detection are some of the most effective ways of treating eating disorders. If you or someone you know may be struggling, The Tartan encourages you to reach out..

2019-03-04,CMU,China,"Originally planned as a two-day event, the most recent summit between the U.S. and North Korea ended abruptly ahead of schedule, with President Trump claiming that the talks had run aground due to President Kim Jong-Un’s unreasonable demands to lift all current economic sanctions in exchange for closing the Yongbyon nuclear facility, a key research and production site. This is the second meeting between Trump and Kim, a follow up to their first summit in Singapore, which was the first time a sitting U.S. president had met in person with a North Korean leader.
At the outset, the summit seemed promising. Unlike past presidents, Trump appears to have a good rapport with Kim, with the two frequently exchanging letters and showering each other with praise. Indeed, each summit has been marked with excessive pageantry and constant flattery, each leader playing to the other’s ego and projecting an image of friendship and collaboration that feels worlds apart from the inflammatory rhetoric of the past.
Although it is worrying that the current president is so willing to trust and defend dictators and autocrats (Trump has similarly espoused his closeness with Russian president Vladimir Putin), there were hopes that the apparent camaraderie between two of the most aggressive leaders in the world would lead to a deal that not only tackled the complicated issue of denuclearization, but would also end the Korean War and help ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. There was also a marked shift in Kim's priorities for his nation: while he previously focused on reinforcing North Korea’s nuclear and military power, he is now looking towards the future, hoping to bring his country back onto the world stage and earn the respect of the international community. After all, remaining an isolated country in the 21st century is a disadvantage, and Kim realizes that modern prosperity is inextricably linked to globalization.
In the end, little progress was made and the summit failed to live up to the hype, although this is hardly surprising. Lifting all economic sanctions in exchange for the shutdown of one nuclear facility is a deal that decidedly favored North Korea, since the nation possesses other research centers and a stockpile of missiles and bombs, products of its long-running nuclear program. To accept the deal would have shifted the balance of power and allowed North Korea to increase in power and influence, while continuing to maintain its arsenal. North Korean officials contest Trump’s claims, saying that the demands were not nearly as extreme, but regardless of whether the president was exaggerating, conceding one nuclear center out of many for the removal of sanctions is an unfair bargain. In that sense, walking away is still better than a concession.
The path moving forward with North Korea is riddled with uncertainty, as a second inconclusive summit has damaged the relationship between the two nations. While Trump continues to remain enthusiastic about his ties with Kim, claiming that the two remained very good friends and allies, Kim claims that he has lost some of his desire to negotiate with the U.S., and that if a deal cannot be reached, he will seek other avenues that circumvent Washington entirely.
How future negotiations will play out remains to be seen, but one thing that the U.S. needs to keep in mind is that they do not have the upper hand in this situation. The fact that Kim is willing to negotiate at all is evidence that North Korea has already solidified its nuclear power, so advancing their weaponry is no longer the top priority. Because of the country’s past conduct, there is not much that past U.S. administrations and the international community could have done beyond sanctions, as Kim uses the threat of nuclear war to ensure that he retains his position of power, well aware that no one would be willing to spark catastrophic annihilation.
A key part of North Korea’s continued survival is its support from China, which provides the country with food and fuel, acting as their biggest trade partner. While China has historically supported North Korea’s regimes, they have gradually shifted towards condemnation, seeing the country’s nuclear development as a threat to peace. Yet despite these concerns, the two countries continue to maintain close economic ties, in effect enabling North Korea’s continued defiance of international accords, despite the heavy sanctions.
America’s relationship with China is a complicated one given the ongoing trade-war, which hurts the possibility of collaboration between the two nations. While China is one of the biggest economic competitors to the U.S. and has done questionable things in the past, it and North Korea might have to consider a joint approach to try to denuclearize North Korea. By disconnecting North Korea from its closest ally and supporter, it is conceivable that the impoverished country would be more receptive to outside demands. Of course, China is unlikely to stop trade with North Korea, but it has become clear that direct U.S. confrontation with North Korea is unlikely to resolve the problem, and international rebukes are similarly ineffective; denuclearizing North Korea and stabilizing the peninsula is a complex problem that requires new and multilateral solutions.
Hopefully, negotiation and communication between the U.S. and North Korea will continue, as nothing’s worse than letting evil fester in darkness. If the Trump administration wishes to make any significant headway, they need to rethink their strategy and draw on the support of other nations to present a united and tangible front. International condemnation and American intervention have not worked in the past and likely will not work in the future: there needs to be a different approach if we wish to resolve one of the most dangerous and complicated imbroglios in foreign policy..

2019-03-25,CMU,China,"On the night of Feb. 28, student members of the Korean Student Association (KSA) were preparing to host their biggest event of the year. March 1 marks the 100th anniversary of the March First Movement, an independence movement that spread across Korea in 1919 in protest against Japanese colonial rule, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. In collaboration with Liberty in North Korea (LINK), KSA was planning to commemorate the day by painting the fence and tabling in the University Center with snacks and cards that informed students about the history of the event. But that night, something dampened their spirits.
The day before, Feb. 28, University Libraries hosted filmmaker Craig Baldwin at their Library Speaker Series. A poster used to advertise the lecture was very similar to the flag of the Japanese military flown during occupation rule of Korea, known as the Rising Sun Flag.
The flag is viewed by some people in Korea and other East Asian countries formerly occupied by Japan as a symbol of Japanese imperialism. It serves as a reminder of an excruciating past in which Japan committed numerous war crimes and atrocities. In Korea alone, many people were forced into labor camps, 200,000 women were trafficked as sex slaves, and an unknown number of civilians were killed in horrific experimentations. “To us, the flag is like a Swastika,” said Eun Soo Koh, a board member of KSA.
The poster was included in a weekly newsletter sent to all international students from the Office of International Education (OIE). The insensitive poster was supplied by Craig Baldwin, who has used it for lectures going back to April 2017.
When some students saw the Craig Baldwin poster the night before March 1, they found it hard to believe it was a coincidence. The only difference between the poster and the Rising Sun flag are the color scheme and overlaying text. News of the poster spread among Korean and Korean American students on March 1, causing outrage and pain. KSA’s commemoration of March 1 went on as planned, but some participants were confused and unenthusiastic.
“It is still too raw,” said Eun Soo. She continued, “I’ve personally met and worked with former victims of sex trafficking. Many of them suffer from agoraphobia and face hardships post social integration. There are only twenty-five registered victims left. March 1st is and always will be a day I remember their stories.”
International students from countries formerly occupied by the Japanese Empire — Mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Myanmar — comprise 24 percent of the student population, according to data released by the Office of International Education. 264 are from Korea, making up nearly 5 percent of the student body. Almost 39 percent of Carnegie Mellon University’s student body is comprised of International students.
KSA attempted to raise concern about the incident in a Feb. 28 post on the Carnegie Mellon Overheard Facebook page. The post was removed the next day.
The organization sent a letter to President Jahanian on March 2 addressing the incident. They asked that President Jahanian inform the entire Carnegie Mellon Community of the insensitive poster and reiterate Carnegie Mellon’s stance against acts of hate and bigotry, as he did on Nov. 29, 2018  after a book defaced with anti-Semitic symbols was discovered in Hunt Library. The letter was signed by the KSA, LINK, Korean Graduate Student Association, Multicultural Greek Council, Korean American Student Alliance, as well as professors Kyu Ha Shim and Tae Wan Kim.
President Jahanian responded via email on March 3, reaffirming that “cultivating a diverse and inclusive community is one of [his] top priorities.” He asked Vice President Gina Casalegno and Dean Keith Webster to investigate the incident.
In response to the incident, Hunt Library has modified its policies. They will now only use posters produced or commissioned by Carnegie Mellon. This was made clear to Eun Soo in two meetings with Jen Gilbride-Brown, the Assistant Vice Provost for Student Success and Equity, Linda Gentile, the Director of the Office International Education, and Shannon Riffe, the Director of Marketing & Communications for CMU Libraries.
Eun Soo told The Tartan that while she appreciates the effort that representatives of Carnegie Mellon’s “diversity-related departments” have put forward, she can’t help but feel frustrated. She says she has been told repeatedly by representatives of Carnegie Mellon that their “circumference of influence” does not grant them the ability to promise an official letter from the school.
“I have always felt proud to be part of this community that endorses diversity. I felt safe here, almost like a second home,” said Eun Soo. “Now I wonder whether that feeling had been mutual.”.

2019-04-29,CMU,China,"One Night In Beijing (ONIB) is an annual showcase presented by Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC). Every year, ONIB features a play recreated from a well-known story or a legend in Chinese culture. The play is interwoven with dances of different genres, such as traditional Chinese minority dances, hip-hop dances, Wushu performances, and this year, ONIB even added a piece performed by Carnegie Mellon's Ballroom Dance Team. 
The play of this year’s ONIB, Journey to the West, is an adaption of a short excerpt from the complete novel of the same name, one of the four great classical novels in China. It told the story of Sanzang Tang and his three disciples’ arduous pilgrimage to the west, during which evil Yao Guai (loosely translated as “monsters”) would take advantage of Tang’s group's weaknesses and sins to prevent them from reaching their destination. The only way for them to finish the journey was through purifying themselves. Journey to the West is a fantasy story that incorporated both cultural and religious elements of ancient China, making it a suitable choice for ARCC to present to the campus.
ONIB cleverly used each dance piece to convey the setting of a specific scene in the story. Chinese minority dances were used to establish the extravagant illusions Yao Guai created in order to lure Sanzang Tang into her trap; the Wushu performances illustrated the fights between Sanzang Tang’s disciples and the Yao Guai. The two pieces that I took part in were both urban dances, one introducing the dangerous creatures living in the mountains ahead and the other setting an intense mood for the final combat between good and evil. The mixture of acting and dancing gripped the audience’s attention and filled them with anticipation for the entire two hours. In the dressing room, I would hear excited screaming coming out from Rangos, wondering what I had missed.
I have to confess, as a dancer for the ONIB showcase, I put way more time into preparing for the show than I expected. On top of the regular duty of remembering the choreography, we also had to attend extra rehearsals to help ONIB weave the show together. I am often impressed by how efficient and professional students are, and this showcase was definitely another example that boosted my regard. On Friday night, we had one full run-through of the showcase, and while I was sitting in a corner in Rangos watching the rehearsal, I saw actors forget their lines, stage props not in place, and directors making up impromptu standing positions; all I could do was try to focus on my homework instead of soaking in disappointment. The second run-through was scheduled to start on Saturday morning at 8:30 a.m. I came in reluctantly, expecting nothing from the showcase. However, I ended up completely mind-blown by the improvement the acting team made overnight. All the mistakes were fixed, actors unleashed their inner energy, and along with face paint and costumes, the show’s quality magically increased exponentially. 
I guess when you put together a group of perfectionists and workaholics who take on countless tasks for the thrill of the challenge and refuse to compromise on the quality of their work, you make magic happen. On Friday night, I comforted myself that I was only there to dance, but by the end of Saturday night, I had learned yet another lesson from my meticulous peers in ARCC..

2019-04-29,CMU,China,"I am a Chinese doctoral student attending Carnegie Mellon University and have spent almost five years on campus. Since the first day I arrived at Carnegie Mellon, I have been  surprised by the large Chinese or Chinese-American student community here. I sincerely appreciate the university's policies and assistance that make us feel at home — like the support to the Chinese Student Scholar Association (CSSA), language assistance to  Chinese students, and other China-related extracurricular activities — while concurrently providing us with the same knowledge, English language abilities, and the values of the U.S. that are extended to any other students regardless of their nationalities and ethnicities. 
However, a news article on this weekend concerns me a lot. A Carnegie Mellon professor of the Institute for Politics and Strategy, Kiron Skinner, made an anti-Chinese racist remark during the Future Security Forum of the think tank New America on April 29. When she talked about the escalating competition between the U.S. and China, she argued that ""it's the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian."" While I do not want to comment on her opinion toward the trade war and mounting tension between the two countries, I am offended by her claim that since China is not a country of Caucasians, it should be treated differently from other ""white"" countries by the U.S. I feel that this kind of remark from a Carnegie Mellon professor is in contradiction of the values held by the university, and perhaps also by this country. Considering the large population of Chinese at Carnegie Mellon, such a remark has a detrimental effect on many students and scholars because there is a professor holds such a discriminatory view. 
I would like the university to take this incident seriously and assure Chinese students and scholars that they will be treated fairly, regardless of the trade war or other confrontations between these two countries.
The author is a Chinese doctoral student who wishes to be anonymous due to potential professional repercussions..

2019-08-19,CMU,China,"Beware: this movie is not as advertised. The Farewell is billed as a heartbreaking tearjerker of a movie, but the movie is more like a comedy with some tender moments. Its tender moments are often nostalgic and cathartic, rather than dramatic.
However, the only beat that truly misses the mark is the last two minute long attempt at catharsis, which reverses the most tender moment of the film. That isn’t to say the movie isn’t one of the most emotional, or one of the most successful, of the year to date, likely only rivaled by its A24 distribution companion, The Last Black Man in San Francisco.
The Farewell is a tight, technically sound piece of small budget Hollywood cinema that draws heavily from the American independent cinema of John Cassavetes through Andrew Bujalski and Joe Swanberg and the rest of the mumblecore crew. All of the long takes and unobtrusive editing allow the movie to create an atmosphere of something resembling naturalistic conversation, and the lack of a soundtrack, save a few key emotional moments that are obviously non-diegetic, resemble the technical creations of a mumblecore movie. There are just a few more bells and whistles in The Farewell, and obviously, a better camera.
Much like the 20- or 30-year-old unsuccessfully artistic and socially inept characters from which mumblecore has earned its name, Billi (a stellar Awkwafina) is a 31-year-old writer and Guggenheim Fellowship applicant who can’t afford to pay rent anymore. But instead of mumblecore’s emotionally incapable group of friends, Billi turns to her family for help. We quickly learn that her family is even more incapable of honest emotional communication than a group of 20-year-olds that are stuck in an extended adolescence.
Another advertisement billed the movie as dressed in tradition, but the only appearance of tradition is a fake wedding ceremony and the withholding of information from Billi’s Nai Nai (grandmother), played by Zhao Shuzhen, about her lung cancer. Supposedly the premise of the movie, the lie is a simple piece of dramatic irony to keep some semblance of plot in an otherwise plotless movie. Otherwise, the lie is not important. It doesn’t register as a tradition to many of the characters in the movie; it’s just something people do, similar to how you won’t tell a decrepit old man that he’s dying. The lie is less an active impropriety on the part of the family than a willful ignorance of the proximity of death. Nobody wants to hear they’re dying, especially when death is close anyway.
The advertising of the movie, while commercially successful scoring a sound 11 million dollars at the box office already, bears little relation to the content of the movie.
The Farewell is about the small conversational moments around a dysfunctional family: the multiple men in the family who lie about their smoking habit, Billi’s father with a drinking problem, the relations who stayed in China that hold a grudge against the relations who left, and most importantly, the inability to communicate emotions with any success.
Much like Noah Baumbach’s The Squid and The Whale (he later wrote and directed the most successful mumblecore movie, Frances Ha), the family in The Farewell is middle to upper class with a significant amount of dysfunction, but the most interesting parts of each movie come with the main character learning to understand a split identity. In The Squid and the Whale, Jesse Eisenberg’s character is split between understanding his two divorced parents; in The Farewell, Billi is caught between her American and Chinese worlds.
One moment in one of the previews where Billi’s uncle says, “That’s the difference between East and West,” and continues to say the least impactful line of the movie is the least interesting discussion of Billi’s understanding of family and her identity in a family caught between the States and China. The line feels out of place in the movie, as if it was put there only for advertising purposes. Otherwise, Billi’s introspection regarding her role as an independent, future matriarch is special. The parallels between Billi and Nai Nai are undeniable. Nai Nai is Billi’s mentor. She is preparing Billi for her future role; it’s part of why Nai Nai keeps asking after Billi’s romantic life. The other part being, of course, the always comedic awkward grandmother role.
Yet, the role of independent matriarch is one tempered by a dependence on the family around you, and the two most impactful images of the film deploy both Billi’s understanding of her Chinese-American identity and her identity as the Nai Nai of the future. In a transitory moment between two narrative points, Billi walks on a Chinese street at the head of her family with a stern smirk adorning her face, but after her return to the States, Billi walks through New York City surrounded by strangers in three-piecesuits and hi-vis construction vests looking lost in a world where she no longer has a family on which to depend..

2019-08-19,CMU,China,"This article is also published in Medium, titled ""Hong Kong, Taiwan, China — can we stop talking about politics?""
I just came across another article about the Hong Kong protests again. This one took a critical stand on the radical behavior of young Hong Kongers, claiming that they’ve followed the wrong role models and were misled by their whims of passion, of course written by a Chinese mainlander. Then I looked through the comments section: it was flooded with flattering words from other angry Chinese mainlanders adoring the authority and intelligence of the author of this completely biased article. So I get it: they are attacking and they are angry, both the Chinese and the Hong Kongese.
To me, anger is such a naïve and hopeful emotion. It's the product of being blissfully brainwashed by only one side of the conflict, a side that indicates that there’s a way out, a right way. I’m jealous of those who still have it when talking about politics. Okay, I do talk about politics. People drag me into these discussions because “I want to hear your ideas,” or they wonder “how could you not care about this thing?” People love it: political conversations are bonding experiences, the colliding of minds feeding onto each others’ bombastic self-confidence to make judgments or assertions on the direction of the world. Suddenly, everybody becomes the all-knowing experts that could rightfully make crucial decisions for countries. Like early teenage girls dreaming about their first dates, the talkers are full of passion and illusions. I’m a bit cynical, a bit broken-hearted. I’m tired of pretending that I’m into this game because every time I talk about it, I’m peeling open my old scars.
A bit of context about me: I grew up in Beijing until I was 14 and then moved to Taipei for four years of high school. Now I call both places my home, and I sincerely love the people in both places. But we all know what this meant: for four years, I went back and forth between China mainland and Taiwan and lived in between their animosity against each other. I was the only Chinese mainlander in my high school and probably one of the few Chinese high school students in Taiwan, considering that student visa was not available for high school students. This meant that when situations arose, silence was my best buddy and the emo phrase “nobody understands me” was accurate. How do I knit together my 14 years of experience to explain to a Taiwanese friend that their casual comments or actions actually hurt me?
First of all, I need to be clear that I wasn’t discriminated in any way. My friends were all awesome and kind human beings. I also had changed myself to fit into the surrounding to the extent that I could perfectly pass as a Taiwanese. For a while, on both the mainland and Taiwan, people assumed that I was a local. But that created the problem: what really hurt me was when the two groups both fully accepted me as a member of theirs and pointed their fingers towards the other. 
From the questions they threw at me, to the direct confrontations between Chinese and Taiwanese in public, both groups were desperate to prove their superiority and paint the other side as the villain. For four years, I encountered millions of small situations where the intent was hurting the people on the other side. Millions of arrows shot from the people I love on this side to harm the people I love on the other side. Nobody else could feel it — people were laughing, people were smiling, then people were angry, people were filled with tears— people were in a current where they could float smoothly forward, where they were blissfully protected by the umbrella of their side. But I was given the complete information of both sides and found all of their actions justifiable. So I stayed silent, in the suffocating in-between spaces. When people asked if I thought Taiwan was part of China, I said “I don’t have any stance on this.""
But to myself, I had to make a choice to explain the sources of all of this pain and save myself from further damage: a choice between humanity and politics. I could either give up on humanity and stop loving people, or I could say that the system of politics was dividing people and turning us against each other. A choice between the calling of a warm beating heart and the desire of a cold steel mind. Obviously, I chose the latter to blame. Politics was an abusive mind game to me. And it was only years later did I realize that I wasn’t playing it right. I ignored the fundamental rule of this game: you have to choose a side. The winning strategies only serve one side at a time. You have to choose a side to win, or else you’ll always be losing, hurting.
So that gives me more unpopular opinions: when one talks about politics, in a way that gives normative arguments, one automatically has opt-in to dividing the world by consenting to the system’s rule that there’s a “they” and there’s an “us”. Or else, one stands in the in-between areas, bearing the burden of empathy and fail to draw the line between people. Unfortunately, there is no way out of this game. The only way to win is by not playing it at all.
I’ve proudly watched the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square. I used to jog around the Summer Palace. I saw fireflies for the first time at the age of 18 in the countryside of Taiwan. I waved the Taiwanese flag with my classmates on a parade for the national day. I did a project on the Nanjing Massacre and I knew all too well about it. I made friends with a Japanese grandpa who sold beautiful hand-drawn postcards in Tokyo, only a few hours before I fell in love with Japan. I’ve never been to Hong Kong, but it isn’t hard to imagine the beauty of the land, of the people, of the culture. It has never been hard.
I’m tired, exhausted, downtrodden by the artificial system that we call politics. I have no solution nor opinion to offer, but I ask that please, if I seek refuge in books and fantasies, don’t drag me back to talk about politics..

2019-09-09,CMU,China,"There is a lot of rhetoric surrounding the unprecedented nature of the current regime’s foreign policy “strategy.” I put that in quotes because the United States hasn’t had a proper foreign policy since 9/11, and arguably hasn’t had one since the Gulf War. But even in both the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era, there was a degree of predictability that the U.S. had followed since the end of World War II. Currently, the U.S. sits in a unique position as the Trump administration has thrown all those precedents out the window. 
As for what those precedents are, it’s good to briefly understand U.S. foreign policy up until the current regime. During the Cold War, the goal was to contain communism. After the USSR’s dissolution, the goal shifted to maintain their hegemony in a unipolar world. After 9/11, the focus became counter-terrorism. Regardless of whether or not you agree with any of the U.S.’s tactics (and there is a lot to disagree with in each era), the nation has maintained a sense of its traditional allies and at least held some respect for regional and multilateral treaties and trade deals. 
Under Trump, allies like Canada and the European Union have been tariffed in the name of national security, and the regime hasn’t agreed to adhere to many of the agreements it was a part of or had committed to. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why. Trying to understand Trump’s mentality is about as futile as the war on terror. But the actual policy is no different than what the U.S. has been engaging in for decades. 
Although the U.S.’s self-imposed responsibility as one of the world’s leading powers is to maintain peace and stability, there are countless examples throughout history that prove otherwise. Propping up puppet dictators and governments in Guatemala, Iran, Chile, and Congo, failing to act on the Rwandan genocide, starting the Iraq War, the drone strike program, and the collapse of the Syrian chemical weapon red line are some examples of the failure of the U.S. to promote peace and stability. If anything, U.S. foreign policy seems more like shots in the dark hoping for the best rather than strategically calculated moves. In short, the U.S. is more an agent of disorder than an agent of order.
Trump’s foreign policy is no different, though he goes about it in less “traditional” ways. His exercise of hard power seems to be more in line with a businessman trying to portray himself as strong and trying to get the other players to call his bluff or fold. Everything he does is designed to gain political points for his base in some way. The randomness of the Chinese trade war, forcing allies to “contribute their share” to the world, and praising or meeting dictators historically considered enemies are all shots in the dark to mask the fact that the rest of his policy is continuing what the U.S. has been doing for a long time now. 
Frankly, the U.S. has lost a lot of goodwill over the years. Any international sympathy or political points gained after 9/11 have been exhausted, and it’s time for the nation to re-evaluate its foreign policy strategy. It surely won’t happen under this administration, but whoever the next president is will have to deal with a world that is quickly changing. With the threat of climate change around the corner, the rise of multiple powers like China, India, and Russia, and an interconnected international system, the U.S. needs to establish its priorities. 
For starters, the U.S. needs to scale back its hard power usage. While hard power is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, it has been abused to the point where it causes more problems than good. This includes getting rid of the drone program, minimizing direct involvement in the war on terror, and reducing mass surveillance. Hard power should be used to intervene in genocides, not to cause one in the name of global security and democracy. In addition, the U.S. needs to take initiative on international climate actions. 
This is an issue that should be uniting the world. The U.S. taking a hardline stance in favor of international climate action will not only be beneficial in the long term for obvious reasons but could potentially bring about some stability by having a chance to collaborate with China, a country that has already has made more promises to climate plans than the U.S. currently has. Most importantly, the U.S. needs to do a better job of accepting its mistakes and rebuilding its soft power and diplomatic ties. This will help in rebuilding goodwill, especially with nations in Southwest Asia and North Africa (I refuse to call it the Middle East). 
Reforming decades of bad foreign policy is not an easy task, and it would be much easier for the U.S. to continue as it has for a while. The suggestions above are easier said than done, especially after the rhetorical damage the Trump regime has caused. The U.S. needs to get rid of the attitude that everything in this world are zero-sum and that every action exists in a bubble. If the U.S. wants to continue being the world leader it thinks it is, it should start acting like one..

2019-09-16,CMU,China,"The 2019 World Para Swimming Championships kicked off last Monday in London, and spectators didn’t have to wait long for excitement and drama to set in. 
The women’s 400m freestyle S6 final, a classification of disability for the athletes, was the second medaling event of the championship, and witnessed a newcomer, 14-year-old Jiang Yuyan (蒋裕燕) of China, facing off against Paralympic champion and world record holder Yelyzaveta Mereshko of Ukraine. 
Jiang came into the competition with a time of 5:31.44, and had put up a time of 5:24.92 in her heat that morning, finishing nearly one and a half seconds behind Mereshko, but qualifying for finals in second place. Because eight out of the nine swimmers in the heat would move on to the finals, the pace wasn’t exactly cutthroat, and neither woman was close to Mereshko’s world record of 5:14.69. 
The finals of the women’s 400m freestyle S6 began with Mereshko having the best start off the blocks (Jiang taking more than a half-second longer). Using the momentum from her start, along with a high stroke rate, Mereshko turned at the first wall nearly two whole seconds ahead of the entire field — a lead which only increased in the subsequent lap. 
At the 200m mark, Mereshko had shaken off virtually everyone, and was several body lengths ahead of all of her competitors, save Jiang. The split showed that Jiang had not only been chasing Mereshko’s punishing pace, but had gained on her. Though she lost some ground to Mereshko during the following length, it was Jiang who pushed off the wall first heading into the last lap, 0.2 seconds ahead of the pre-race favorite.
The last lap saw both women fighting for gold, with Mereshko pushing as hard as she could, but Jiang maintaining her slim lead. Mustering up all the strength she had left, Jiang surged ahead even further in the last 25 meters, finishing with a time of 5:13.32, over 4 seconds in front of Mereshko, and setting a new world record. 
Jiang then went on to win the women’s 100m freestyle S6 final (just ahead of Mereshko again) and set a new championship record. She also took bronze in both the 100m backstroke S6 and 50m freestyle, setting a new Asian record in the latter. In her final event, the women’s 50m butterfly, she once again took first place, breaking another world record in the process. 
Life wasn’t always this like this for Jiang. When she was only four years old, she was run over by a truck. The sheer size and weight of the vehicle crushed the bones of the limbs trapped under it, and after being rushed to the hospital, doctors amputated her right leg and arm. Even after the procedure, bone overgrowth in the residual limbs necessitated many more visits to the hospital. Attempting to aid her recovery and future growth, doctors suggested Jiang try swimming. Her mother enrolled her in a swim program during summer break in 2012, and she’s been in the water ever since.
The journey to a world record was not an easy endeavor. In a translated interview with local media First Hand Investigation (later published by The Daily Mail), Jiang’s mother recalls that some of the other kids cried, calling her daughter “half-a-person,” and told her not to return to the pool. Nevertheless, Jiang persevered, saying that “some kids would cry because they choked on water and would not want to keep swimming. I wasn’t like that. I just picked myself up and kept going.” 
In 2015, she became the national champion in the 50m butterfly. Two years later, she placed first in six separate events domestically and won the 100m freestyle at the 2017 Asian Youth Para Games in Dubai. Now, Jiang is not only a world champion three times over, but a holder of two world records as well. “In the water, I don’t need prosthetics, I don’t need a crutch,” she states. “I can rely on my own strength to determine my direction and goal.” .

2019-09-16,CMU,China,"Dr. Kiron Skinner is back on campus as Director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics after she was fired from her position as Director of Policy Planning at the Department of State.
Politico reported that her firing came as a result of an “abusive” management style, but in an interview with The Tartan this week, Skinner denies these allegations.
Skinner had taken a leave from her post at Carnegie Mellon last September to pursue what she called her “first real deep dive into government.” She’s worked as a foreign policy advisor to the George Bush, Newt Gingrich, and Mitt Romney presidential campaigns, and served as part of Donald Trump’s transition team in 2016, but this was her “first real day job” in government, she said in an interview with The Tartan.
The allegations made by anonymous state department sources in Politco include Skinner making homophobic remarks, accusing staff of having affairs, and abusing her authority. Several members of Skinner’s staff had allegedly threatened to quit if she was not fired, according to a senior State Department official.
At the time of her firing, Skinner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Now, she denies making any homophobic remarks, and characterizes some of the reporting as being “out of context.” “I was trying to build a very different type of office,” Skinner said. “There were people that didn’t like how I was doing things.”
Throughout her career, Skinner says, she’s never been accused of any impropriety. She also notes that no official State Department investigation was made prior to her firing. “You can’t be at an elite university and be a big homophobe,” she said.
Several people came to Skinner’s defense over these reports, including Carnegie Mellon professor and Director of the Undergraduate Economics Program Dr. Carol Goldburg, who told Breitbart News that after working with Skinner for over 10 years, she had “never observed language or behavior that could be considered discriminatory.” Goldburg continued, “As one of the few out lesbians on our campus, I am not tone-deaf to even subtle forms of discrimination such as micro-aggressions, and can categorically state that Kiron Skinner does not engage in such behaviors.”
Skinner says that most of the internal conflict stemmed from her big plans for the Office of Policy Planning. She says she entered an office that had little power, and was “building [it] up from the ground, and also bringing a whole different perspective,” while trying to “build relationships around me,” and “doing it not fully staffed.”
As Director of Policy Planning, Skinner under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Skinner was reportedly working to advance Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy agenda and to diversify the State Department, with more hires that spoke the language of regions of interest and hires from academia. To this, Skinner says, “I did rub some people the wrong way, but I came from a whole different world.”
Despite her firing from the Trump administration, Skinner holds steadfast to what she calls the “Trump Doctrine” for foreign policy. She characterizes it as “an attempt to match American capabilities to new geopolitical realities.” “When [Trump] calls it America First, he means putting national interest at the center,” Skinner said.
The politics of the Trump presidency address “the anxiety of where we’re going and what we will be,” Skinner said. In the geopolitical sphere, “we just have more to worry about now, which means diplomacy matters more now.”
Skinner stresses that China continues to grow as an adversary to the United States, and mentions that “when you look at China and all those who have nuclear weapons, they’re from the global south.” Because of this, “we need diverse teams of people who are addressing these things,” Skinner said.
Skinner’s comments on China’s expanding power have led to pushback. At a public talk in Washington this May, Skinner said, “this is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology, and the United States hasn’t had that before. The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way, it was a fight within the Western family.” With China, in contrast, “it’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”
This statement led to criticism. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson for China called it “simply absurd and utterly unacceptable.” An op-ed in The Tartan written by a Chinese doctoral student stated, “I am offended by her claim that since China is not a country of Caucasians, it should be treated differently from other ‘white’ countries by the U.S.”
To this, Skinner says: “Did I misspeak? Sure.” The criticism “was really legitimate… it’s a legitimate discussion,” Skinner said. Still, she clarifies that “China is very different than other competitors we have had” and that “we have to take China on its own terms. A lot more seriously.”
Away from the politics of Washington, D.C., Skinner looks forward to leading the Center for International Relations and Politics into the future. She stresses the importance of facilitating the range of classes necessary to give students a “broad understanding of American politics and the international sphere.” 
Skinner also looks forward to “growing within the new undergraduate major in Economics and Politics,” a Bachelors of Science degree co-sponsored with the Tepper School of Business coming this fall. It will be the first co-sponsored major within the Institute for Politics and Strategy.
The responsibility to present different ideas to undergraduates cannot be understated, Skinner says. After all, the department is “trying to create the next President of the United States and the next set of cabinet members.”.

2019-09-23,CMU,China,"Team USA's adventure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in China was the story of a young team.
It started as any good young team starts: with a group of rejects and good players who aren't quite good enough to play at the next level, or at NBA all-star level. Some of the best American players, like Anthony Davis, James Harden, and Damian Lillard, decided not to join Team USA, so the team lacked superstars.
The Americans started as a humble squad in contrast to the usual powerhouse. They struggled at first, and they lost an exhibition to Australia before the World Cup. However, the youthful team started to rally, and they won all their other exhibition games before the tournament. Even though they had a target on their backs, Team USA had enough NBA talent to be the favorites for the tournament.
Of course, the players on Team USA were getting ahead of themselves.
The warning signs started in the group stage where the Americans narrowly escaped Turkey, a team whose best players were career NBA backups Cedi Osman and Ersan Ilyasova. Team USA entered the final seconds of the fourth quarter down by two points. It only took a three-point foul by Osman on Team USA's Jayson Tatum and an overtime period in which Turkey missed four free throws for Team USA to win.
Team USA, disappointed with their efforts, were satisfied by bullying Japan and a couple other teams on their way to the quarterfinals. There they met France, and it was unclear whether they would step up against tougher competition.
The Americans could not keep up with a team with more NBA talent, and they lost in the quarterfinal by a score of 89-79. France humiliated Team USA and broke their 58-game winning streak in FIBA and Olympic competition. To make the loss worse, backup New York Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina outscored American star Donovan Mitchell in the fourth quarter.
The Americans then sulked to their consolation game against Serbia, and it showed when Serbia raced to a 25-point lead in the first quarter. Team USA could not come back, and Serbia guaranteed the worst ever American finish in tournament appearances. They then capped off their adventure in China with a win over Poland to secure seventh place.
Team USA's experience in China is one that most of the players will want to forget. By the standards of the teams before them, Team USA in 2019 was too young to bear the expectations of USA basketball. 
It will be easier when their players grow up..

2019-09-23,CMU,China,"In the last several months, international students at Carnegie Mellon University have been targeted by telephone scams attempting to extract personal and financial information. They have been called “sophisticated” scams by University Police Chief Thomas Ogden for their methods and attention to detail.
While the specifics of each scam vary case by case, they have several commonalities. In all cases reported to University Police, the victims were Chinese international students.
“Asian students [are] being contacted by what appears to be the Chinese government,” said Chief of Police Thomas Odgen in an interview with The Tartan. Scammers “typically say that they’re from the Chinese Embassy in New York, that they’re sending American police to arrest [them],” Odgen says.
In some cases, the calls appear to come from the Chinese Embassy, while in another, the caller claimed to be from a Chinese law enforcement agency. Victims are told that to prevent arrest or deportation, they must transfer a specific amount of money into an international bank account.
“They are very professional criminals, and keep students on the line for hours,” said Lieutenant Joseph Meyers.
In each case, University Police have contacted Homeland Security or the local FBI bureau. University Police used official communications in Jan. to report the first case of this nature to students. They informed students that “this is not an isolated incident. We’ve learned that calls pretending to come from the Chinese Embassy or U.S. government agencies are occurring nationwide.”
The most recent case was reported on reported on Sept. 11, after a student received a call from a person claiming to be from the Chinese consulate who demanded money. Because the victim was instructed to transfer funds into the international bank account via wire transfer, University Police hopes Homeland Security and Chinese law officials can do something to track the funds.
University Police cannot confirm whether the cases all come from the same source, but they believe that they all originate in China. They say students and the elderly are the most vulnerable to these scams.
There are several reasons why international students might be targeted. As students away from their home country and family, they need to have access to funds for emergencies, and scam criminals are aware of this. Also, because the U.S. is not their home country, they may not be completely familiar with particular laws or methods of law enforcement.
Due to the high volume of international students at Carnegie Mellon, University Police hopes to get the message out to as many students on campus as possible. Organizations such as the Office of International Education (OIE) and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) have sent out multiple informative notifications since the scams began occurring.
“We have been made aware that graduate students were targeted by these scams,” said GSA President Dacen Waters. “There was an increased volume of these scams around the beginning of the academic year. The timing makes me think that it is something targeted, trying to take advantage of students who have just arrived.”
Students are not the only individuals vulnerable to these attacks. Mei-Yu Wang, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics, has received calls claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy.
“I’ve [received] tons of calls every few days from the China Embassy,” said Wang. The calls were “to pick up a package. I just hung up immediately because I’m not from China, I’m from Taiwan,” Wang mentions. Since she identified the call as a scam right away, she did not report the incident.
While these sophisticated scams have become more common, students may also be subject to other types of scams. Wang received a phone call telling her she owed money to her credit card company. She began to worry and stayed on the phone, but when the caller could not identify which credit card with enough specificity, she grew suspicious and hung up. She spoke with her husband about their credit card company and determined that it had been a scam.
“For the general issue of phishing scams, the best defense is awareness. This is why, in my opinion, incoming students were targeted so strongly,” said Waters. “The GSA is actively working together with [Graduate Education Office, OIE] and other offices to improve the flow of information and resources to incoming graduate students, particularly international students.”
“We want to get the word out that governments will not call you. The only people that would call you are bill collectors,” said Chief Ogden, explaining that government agencies communicate through physical formal documents with a formal letterhead. “We’re not typical police, we’re your police. If [students] aren’t comfortable with police, go to student affairs.”.

2019-09-23,CMU,China,"In a daring move, described as “India’s Kashmir checkmate,” the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, issued a new constitutional order abrogating Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian constitution on Aug. 5, 2019. In doing so, he overrode the 1954 constitutional order that solidified their status in the constitution.
Essentially, Article 370 granted semi-autonomy to the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in most legislative affairs barring defense, foreign affairs, finance, and communication; Article 35A restricted private property rights, preventing Indian citizens who aren’t permanent residents of J&K from buying or owning land. Before the abrogation of the articles, thousands of Indian soldiers were deployed to the region, tourists were ordered to leave, and a communication blackout ensued, as J&K was put on lockdown, which has continued for the last month.
The government’s decision comes at a key flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations. Earlier in February, Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistani-based militant group that has been carrying out terrorist attacks in Kashmir since 2000, killed 44 soldiers in a car bomb attack, the deadliest attack on Indian forces since 1989. This prompted India to carry out their first airstrike since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the first time either country carried out aerial attacks that crossed the Line of Control (LOC), the formerly agreed upon de-facto border and ceasefire line in Kashmir that has been in existence since 1972. The bombing and subsequent strong military reactions all occurred just a few months before the Indian election, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was up for re-election. Since the revocation of Article 370, Pakistan has downgraded diplomatic relations, calling back their top diplomatic official to India, and suspending trade with India.
In 1947, when the British decided to partition India and Pakistan, they asked the princely states, states still ruled by regional leaders in an alliance with the British Empire, to join either India or Pakistan. Maharaja Hari Singh was the Hindu king of the princely state of J&K at that point, which was and still is a Muslim majority area. The reasoning behind the partition was that the All India Muslim League wanted a separate Muslim state. Pakistan thought Singh would cede the Muslim majority J&K to India, leading them to attack him. Ironically, this ended up causing Singh to cede J&K to India, which ended up being the catalyst for the first Indo-Pakistani War in 1947, the first of four wars between the two countries. The Indian government then created Article 370 in 1949, which was then ratified with the rest of the Indian constitution in 1950. By 1952, the Kashmiri monarchy was abolished, and by 1954, a constitutional order was issued that further reinforced Article 370 and supplemented it by passing Article 35A, which created the general framework about Indian policy on J&K. That is, until the new constitutional order issued earlier in August. The articles were always intended to be temporary provisions, and Hindu nationalists have fought for the revocation since the 1950s. These nationalists are now represented by Modi’s party. 
Article 370 and Article 35A have had major consequences for the region. Because it is semi-autonomous, the region has failed to enjoy the same level of economic development as the rest of India because the restricted private property rights prevented non-J&K Indians from opening new businesses there, and the central government couldn't do much to develop the region. As a result, J&K became isolated from India and the rest of the world. This has made corruption and nepotism endemic to the region’s economic system, which has only accelerated the destitution of the citizens of J&K. This is on top of the region being constantly plagued with insurgency and sectarian violence, which further hinders any economic process. Frankly, some strong action needed to be taken in the region to alleviate its issues. 
It’s also important to acknowledge that the articles are an Indian issue, and not an international issue like Pakistan claims. The LOC was there as an agreed-upon line of ceasefire over a region that had two players trying to exert dominance over it, and that line was only relevant when the region had semi-autonomy. But at the core, the decision to give J&K semi-autonomy was a unilateral decision by India, and the decision to remove J&K’s semi-autonomy is also unilateral on India’s part. Pakistan has mostly no leg to stand on. They have famously not only backed insurgents in J&K, but also backed the Taliban and the mujahideen, and the founder of their nuclear program sold the designs to Iran and North Korea. India shouldn’t keep having to appease Pakistan with J&K. 
However, while appeasement should not be Indian strategy, backing Pakistan into a corner should also not be a strategy. Since the decision to revoke Article 370, Pakistan has threatened nuclear action, and India is several steps closer to another war with Pakistan. Based on history, the probability of war is significant, and Pakistan’s response is incredibly unpredictable. 
Pakistan is taking matters to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). While it would seem that taking matters to the UNSC would be a win for India, the main issue is China. China has a stake in a region called Ladakh, a Buddhist majority region of Kashmir located close to Tibet. The Chinese government has also made claims to the region, which Pakistan has recognized since 1963, but India hasn’t recognized it. China has already criticized India for its decision and joined Pakistan in agreement about the violation of international sovereignty. In addition, China has also increased diplomatic relations with Pakistan over the last several years economically and militarily, and India has been a rival to China since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. There is always the threat of China vetoing UNSC resolutions, or worse, China backing Pakistan if a military conflict breaks out. 
More importantly, J&K will become extremely unstable in the short term without a proper plan in place. While Modi’s government, which is run by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant Hindu nationalist party of India, has had the abrogation of 370 on their agenda for a long time, the recent decision is a very clear opportunistic political move. The Indian economy has been showing signs of stagnation, but the recent inflammation of tensions was perfect for Modi’s campaign and turned the primary focus of his campaign and his second term in office towards J&K. 
So far there is no clear plan for what to do with the region afterward. Aside from a bill reorganizing J&K into an official union territory and also splitting Ladakh into another territory, there is no real plan for redeveloping the region or dealing with rising insurgent sympathies. The Indian government’s lockdown is only set to exacerbate issues further, as there have been reports of mass arrests and allegations of torture by the Indian military. The uncertainty of how unstable the region will become and how long the instability will last will create severe problems for any plans to redevelop the region, and there is a major chance the destitution of J&K will only increase. 
Looking at the constitution, the wording of the articles, and precedents, there was a lot the Indian government could have done that was less aggressive and antagonizing. Jawaharlal Nehru talked about the “gradual erosion” of Article 370, and there were legal ways to follow that through constitutional orders and amendments. Instead of removing semi-autonomy entirely, the Indian government could have only removed Article 35A, which would have ended the private property restriction and allow non-J&K Indians to start investing in the region. Before abrogating Article 370, Parliament changed the notification clause, which required that the central government had to inform a J&K Constituent Assembly about any legislative decision. The problem is that the Constituent Assembly dissolved in 1956, so Parliament just changed the clause so that they could proceed to abrogate the article. Instead of doing that, Parliament could have instead amended the article to slowly expand how much of the Indian constitution applies to J&K while maintaining the semi-autonomy of the region. Promoting regional economic development while allowing J&K to maintain its identity would have been an effective way to build back stability in the region and gradually begin to integrate the territory into India. There is already precedent for this, as the Indian government had used economic development as a means to quell instability in regions with Maoist rebel sympathizers. It would be counterfactual to determine which options would be better, but the point is that the Indian government had less aggressive and stronger diplomatic options available. 
In the end, the only thing the world can hope is that any cynical or negative speculation about the abrogation of Article 370 will turn out to be wrong. There is a lot of uncertainty about what actions India, Pakistan, China, and the rest of the world will take regarding this issue. The decision has been made by the Indian government, and only time and hindsight will tell if the decision was the right one..

2019-09-23,CMU,China,"At the start of each semester, in addition to the usual volunteering, multicultural, or academic clubs at The Fair, there are also philanthropic groups with the aim of sending students around the world on alternative spring break trips. Instead of students going home or vacationing with friends for a week, these groups ensure that they spend time in contributing to the greater good. There are multiple options at Carnegie Mellon, including Carnegie Mellon in Puerto Rico, Carnegie Mellon in Haiti, Habitat for Humanity, Global Public Health Brigades, Global Medical Brigades, Outreach360, and more. 
In recent years, however, there has been a growing debate about the true value of alternative spring breaks. Who is it helping? Why do people go? Are these trips really helping communities in the grand scheme of things? Out of this debate came the term voluntourism, which means exactly what it says: turning a trip abroad into a chance to volunteer and give back. Voluntourism is a booming travel option, and can involve building schools, helping orphanages, or even teaching English in nations or cities deemed less fortunate. In some cases, organizations with these aims are explicitly branded as useful résumé boosters, which calls the intentions of undergraduate students interested in alternative spring breaks into the conversation. 
The first name that comes to mind when discussing volunteer intentions is the Global Medical Brigades (GMB). Unlike the Public Health Brigades, this group specifically goes to developing nations — for Carnegie Mellon's chapter, some of these countries include Nicaragua, Honduras, and Panama — to “help communities in all fronts such that these communities will one day be able to sustain a higher quality of life without external assistance.” According to Carnegie Mellon GMB’s website, members run a free medical clinic, work alongside professionals to provide medical care, and even build hygiene stations and lay concrete floors during their week stay. While these accomplishments are admirable and thoughtful, how is the big-picture goal–a higher quality of life without assistance–achieved? 
As long as you get your photo with cute kids, make them smile, help families, and get another experience to write under the ""volunteer"" heading of your résumé, everything is fine, right? Not exactly. For example, Lauren Kasack, a former brigade member, wrote in an op-ed for the Pacific Standard that after three trips to Ghana, local people were not purchasing health insurance since they could expect the foreign health care and medications to be available every few months. And, while communities often request for GMBs (meaning no volunteer steps foot in a nation or city where they are not welcome), there is a dependency relationship that festers as a consequence. The involvement of the Global Medical Brigades in numerous African and Latin American countries, unfortunately, tends to maintain the status quo rather than fix problems, because the systemic and historical aspects of these problems are often not acknowledged. With the format of the brigades as annual, week-long events that are often not consistently in one nation, I cannot help but wonder if these organizations are simply sticking a band-aid on a deeply historically rooted issue–especially when concerning Central American countries.
U.S. involvement in Central America has been credited time and time again for creating and fueling the hostile situations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the latter of which Carnegie Mellon's GMB could not travel to last year due to the high rates of violence and crime. For example, at the peak of the Cold War, the U.S. illegally supported right-wing and military coups and funded harmful regimes, notably in Nicaragua. More recently, under the Obama Administration, Honduras’s reformist president was seized by an opposing military party in 2009, and we, simply put, did nothing. In the bigger historical picture, European colonialism and early 20th-century U.S. involvement in Central America created the dire situations that so many American college students to want to help. But what is the point, when students often do not recognize the turbulent history and cultural differences between the U.S. and Central America? Is giving out glasses and wearing scrubs once a year the solution? There is a stark difference between helping others in the short-term versus the long-term, and that is where many alternative spring break organizations fail.
On the other end of the spectrum in the discussion of intentions behind volunteering are organizations such as Outreach360. According to its website, Outreach360 volunteers partner with community leaders in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua to “host neighborhood camps where students can join for interactive and fun lessons relating to English, Spanish literacy, science, and math.” This a seemingly very innocent, ambitious goal, especially with its claim that one in five Latin American students drop out of school. Carnegie Mellon's chapter of OutReach360 is slightly similar, yet focuses on a trip to the Dominican Republic during spring break. While Spanish fluency is not needed to join OutReach360, they aim to “educate students and provide them with the skills to advance their chances for better opportunities in the future” by teaching them English during a week-long camp program. The academic year, therefore, is spent bonding with other volunteers and fundraising for the big trip in March.
However, behind the videos of laughter and tropical sunsets, is the looming background idea that English fluency is the way out of poverty. Again, because of irreversible history and modern globalization, we are stuck in this moment in time where English is perceived as key to social and economic capital. There are true benefits, such as when English is used as a tool in political protests, or when English mastery increases one’s chance to go to university in the United States. Despite this inevitability, I cannot help but criticize the wording choice of Outreach360 at Carnegie Mellon: how is a week-long trip influencing a child’s “opportunities in the future” when barriers actually keeping them from achieving more are so deeply rooted in U.S. and Latin American relations and history? 
More difficult to digest is Carnegie Mellon's Outreach360’s big pitch: “We don't bring in money and tangible supplies to help the communities -- we serve the kids as human beings with skills that we readily have and would love to share.”  What level of narcissism and blatant neocolonial mindsets is needed to read that and be fine with it? Teaching English is not going to remove brown children from gang violence, crime, and poverty. If anything, GMB provides physical support to struggling communities; here, the “commodity” is English, and that simply does not sit well with me.  
With that said, I would like to make it clear that I am not defacing the entire industry of teaching English to non-native speakers. Like myself, those who are certified in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) urge those interested in teaching English abroad to understand the bigger picture. One teacher shared on their blog the importance of understanding the past interactions that the nation in which they will teach has had with the English language, especially in the context of China, where regional languages may risk dying out. Another begs us to challenge the perceived superiority of native speakers as teachers over non-native speakers who achieved fluency. She argues, in short, that a classroom would actually be a safer place when students are allowed to use their native language from time to time. This suggestion is a total 180 from Carnegie Mellon's chapter of OutReach360, which emphasizes that no Spanish language knowledge is required. Therefore, not only do student volunteers lack historical and cultural understanding, but also any general knowledge of the native language. 
Before I end, I would like to make a couple of disclaimers. First, I have great respect for anyone who is inherently interested in helping people and working towards a better world. I admire those who see how the U.S. government has neglected Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and are representing our university by going and thoughtfully interacting with another culture. I admire those who build homes for others in need, especially considering the focus on the Greater Pittsburgh community. I admire good people with good hearts. Second, I myself have never been on an alternative spring break trip, and have no plans of doing so. Third, the voluntourism industry is showing no signs of stopping; therefore, rather than proposing a total abolition of organizations full of students with the best intentions, it should be modified. Writing for Newsweek, Maya Websey suggests providing parents, professionals, and local leaders with the resources and knowledge to care for their people, rather than focusing on short-term fixes. Like the TEFL teachers mentioned before, I would also recommend training in history, culture, and native language before trying to teach English abroad; and, in the Carnegie Mellon context, I hope Outreach360 chooses to change the language used to recruit new members. 
I know this one article in this one student newspaper will not singlehandedly dismantle the neocolonial roots of the white (or, in the Carnegie Mellon perspective, rich) savior dynamix, teaching English for “better opportunities,” and helping the disadvantaged without much thought of the culture of the place being “helped.” I hope, however, that anyone who participates in these groups is aware of the power dynamics and history associated with alternative spring breaks, especially when traveling to developing nations. These trips are not your chance for a photo-op with brown and black kids; they are powerful, and mean something to everyone involved.    .

2019-10-07,CMU,China,"Dr. Kiron Skinner, the Director of the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) and the former Director for Policy Planning at the Department of State, is back on campus after being dismissed from her role in the State Department. The Tartan spoke to three current students and one alum of the International Relations and Politics program, which Skinner directs, about the circumstances around her dismissal from the State Department and her return to the University. All were willing to go on the record with The Tartan under the condition of anonymity,  because they’re currently under her authority in IPS or for fear of future career repercussions.
“There’s an environment of fear and intimidation that permeates people who especially rely on her for any sort of hope of career advancement as a student. If you want to succeed, you need to lean on her connections to get you where you want to go in D.C.,” said one alum of the program. Politico reported that Skinner was dismissed from her role in the state department over an “abusive” management style, with anonymous State Department sources alleging that she made homophobic comments, accused people of having affairs, and abused her authority. In an interview with The Tartan, she denied making any homophobic remarks and characterized some of the reporting as being “out of context.”
“I think in terms of my experience with her as an instructor, she was strict but fair. It was really when I brought up concerns about the new masters program where things really got out of hand,” said the alum. The alum, during their time as a student, had brought up concerns about the master’s program which were perceived by Skinner as criticism, leading to “nasty” conversations between them.
A current undergraduate student of the program brought up concerns about the reputation of IPS. “As a student, it personally hurts me to have someone like her be the head of the department when I’m seeking future work — it hurts my personal reputation as a Carnegie Mellon student to be associated with her and her track record.”
Another undergraduate student said that they are still cautious, as they haven’t been here that long, nor do they know Skinner personally. Attempting to sort through everything that they’ve heard and choosing what to believe is very difficult. “Especially among the undergrads, we are very scared to even talk about what happened because it’s just not within our power. There’s an obvious, huge, power gap between us, as undergrad students, and Skinner, who’s the head of the department.” It’s difficult, they say, to ask questions, since as an undergrad in the department “your chances are riding on what you say and what you do.”
Several students want the administration to be more transparent. “CMU definitely struggles with the perception that it doesn’t care about its students,” remarked the previously mentioned alum.
“CMU loves to be neutral on everything; as long as Dr. Skinner didn’t literally set fire to the White House, they’ll be okay with her,” a current student expressed. “And it’s really unsettling that Dietrich just wants to bury this instead of addressing it head-on.”
Another student commented, “I think transparency is just the biggest thing. Because right now, what it feels like is happening is just everyone’s left in the dark, and we’re just hearing from outside sources and vague statements from Skinner and trying to maybe address what’s going on but not really. If people were more forthright and direct about what’s going on, I think the students would feel less ambivalent about the situation.”
In an interview with the Tartan in September, Skinner admitted that she misspoke when she made a controversial statement during a security forum in Washington D.C. regarding the U.S.’s relationship with China as a growing power. Skinner had said, “it’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian,” and accepted that the criticism directed towards her was legitimate. She clarified that “China is very different than other competitors we have had” and that “we have to take China on its own terms. A lot more seriously.”
Skinner is holding a discussion on US-China relations on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. In an email announcing the event, she acknowledged the previous controversial remarks she had made during her tenure in the State Department on competition between US and China. She wrote, “It is therefore my duty as an academic within a world-class university to open up dialogue with our students to hear their concerns about US-China relations, with particular regard to global competition and the trade war, so that we can work together towards building a strong US-China policy.”
One of the students who spoke to the Tartan welcomed the event, expressing hope that “being able to hear it directly from her” instead of from the media, which they said could be conflating and exaggerating her points, would help get more insight into her foreign policy thinking and her controversial statements. “In regards to the other more personal issues, I don’t think that will probably ever be addressed,” the student said.
Skinner declined to comment on this article, saying she could not effectively respond without advance viewing of the article.
The discussion on US-China relations will be held by Skinner on Monday, Oct. 7, from 4:30 pm to 5:30 pm in the Cohon University Center’s McConomy Auditorium. A second meeting, also led by Skinner, was announced Sunday night, in which all IPS students and faculty are invited to attend. That meeting will take place from 5:30 to 6:30 pm in the same location, immediately after the previous meeting..

2019-10-14,CMU,China,"I guess it’s time for me to join the list of people blacklisted by the Chinese government. Let’s talk about China and basketball.
So Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, spoke out about the Hong Kong protests and stood with protestors. I mean, what was he thinking? He’s an American! How dare he speak out against human rights abuses committed in a country where he doesn’t live? He doesn’t know what’s going on there. All he has seen is out-of-context video evidence of police brutality against unarmed protestors and the violent crackdown by the Chinese government. Also, Morey is just the general manager of the most popular basketball team in China. Sports, morals, and politics can never mix, and that’s a known fact.
Of course, the owner of the Rockets was quick to shut down Morey and apologize for his comments, and the NBA “regretted” Morey’s views. Good on them. Morey’s comments were a clear threat to the NBA’s profitability in China, and we all know that profit is more important than human rights. Even Morey walked back his statement, talking about how little understanding he had of the situation and how he has understood Xi Jingping and the Communist Party’s perspective. Oh I’m sorry, I meant ""other"" perspectives.
But then the NBA (sort of) walked back their walk back of Morey’s comments? Adam Silver, the NBA Commissioner, backed Morey. But he also didn’t back Morey? Silver said that the NBA couldn’t censor their players, but they don’t endorse or agree with what they say. China Central Television (which, aptly, spells CCTV) responded immediately, and said that endorsing views that threaten “national sovereignty and social stability” shouldn’t be permitted.
Now that’s ice cold China. Honestly, I don’t get why the NFL isn’t more popular there. Also, what’s with the fence riding Adam? You’re either with the Chinese government or against them. You can’t be both. Do what Blizzard did. Ban your athletes and anyone else who speaks out, take their money away from them, and obviously, don’t do it for the Chinese government. Do it because you don’t want to have players make “divisive statements” that are in violation with your (and Tencent’s) code of conduct.
However, I will admit, the fence-riding makes sense. He wants to show Americans he is taking a stand, but also, he wants to keep the Chinese market open as he goes to Shanghai for damage control. In essence, he wants to have his cake and eat it too. But is paying lip service to your values worth losing 4 billion dollars? I’m a bald, dumb 20 year old in an overpriced college who hasn’t played sports in six years, and even I’d think twice about losing that much money in my international sports franchise. Like, why punish hundreds of millions of Chinese viewers by making them lose access to their favorite sport? Think about the poor viewers in China who will be deprived of their basketball.
In all seriousness though, cut ties with China. Honestly, every American company should. It’s not acceptable. Let’s actually start pretending we value the things we say we do instead of being capitalist cronies seeking profit by making a deal with the devil, who in this case is an authoritarian Winnie the Pooh..

2019-10-14,CMU,China,"In between the brick academic halls and green lawns of Carnegie Mellon University’s campus is a fence. It is widely known as “The Fence,” and nearly every day it is covered in a new layer of paint. The Fence has been painted hundreds of times.
The Fence functions as a campus-wide message board. Student organizations paint the fence to celebrate victories, advertise events and, sometimes, to commemorate tragedies. Rarely does it get political.
CSA paints the fence
On Sunday, Oct. 6, Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Student Association (CSA) painted the fence red to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the formation of the People’s Republic of China by the Communist Party of China (CPC). Oct. 1 was National Day, a holiday celebrating China’s history.
“October 1st means the same to us all Chinese students, the same as July 4th means to people in the US,” said Yifei Yang, the President of the CSA.
On Monday, students were greeted with a fence coated in red paint. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHINA,” was painted on the center of one side and the yellow stars of China’s flag on the other.
Many Chinese students were pleasantly surprised. Jiaqi Pan, a masters student in the Language Technologies Institute, said that she “never expected this could be here, so prominently on campus.” She called the painting “creative” and “cool,” and translated some of the Mandarin text painted on the fence to “Why are there tears in my eyes? Because I love the land so deeply.” It was the refrain of a poem by the famous Chinese poet Ai Qing.
One student asked a passerby to take a picture of her in front of the poem, and he then asked her to do the same. She said that the painting made her feel “proud.” She identified herself as a grad student but did not wish to share her name.
But not all students felt so warmly about the CSA’s painted fence. Cuneyd Taoglu, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering was walking across campus to an event for the Muslim Student Association (MSA) when he saw the fence. He was shocked.
“I was just shocked to see how we allow the glorification of an authoritarian regime,” said Taoglu.
Aidan Place, another board member of MSA, said that he was “disappointed to see” the fence commemorating a country that is “in my opinion, and I think most people’s opinion, actively carrying the destruction of a cultural ethnic group.”
Place and Taoglu were referring to the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group, who live in have reportedly been detained in “re-education camps” by the Chinese government.
Taoglu’s family is Turkish. He said that he has a particular concern for the Uighurs “because they were the first Turk people to mass convert to Islam, and they’re the reason why I’m Muslim today.”
MSA and HKSA paint the fence
There are rules to painting the fence. It can only be painted between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., only with paint bushes (no spray cans or rollers) and only in its entirety (no graffiti).
To claim the fence, an organization needs to have two people stationed next to the fence at all hours. They need to do the same every night if they don’t want another organization to take the fence.
Taoglu and Place saw that the fence was unguarded and immediately had the idea to paint it in response. They got in touch with the Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA) and made plans in conjunction that night.
By 10 p.m. a large group of HKSA and MSA students had gathered at the fence. They sat in lawn chairs and on picnic tables, ate Voccelli’s pizza, and drank Turkish coffee in plastic solo cups.
At around 10:30 p.m., according to several members of MSA, police officers went to the fence and notified them that someone had anonymously called the Carnegie Mellon police to notify them that something was going to happen at 12:00 a.m.
Students said that they weren’t worried that anything would happen, because they had such a large group. There were 36 students present. But for safe measure, two Carnegie Mellon police officers returned at midnight.
Students dipped their paint brushes into cans of sky blue and black paint and got to work. Others held out their phones as flashlights.
When the sun rose on Tuesday, half the Fence was painted in blue and the other half in black. Star and crescent crests and the flower emblem of Hong Kong were painted on the posts. “DON’T FORGET ABOUT US,” was painted at the center. The other side read “STAY STRONG HONG KONG.”
Taoglu explained that MSA painted the fence as a response to the “the atrocities that the Chinese government is perpetrating.” “It’s not directed at CSA,” added Place.
The HKSA later clarified in a Facebook post that they “painted [The Fence] in hopes that CMU would become more aware of our political unrest in Hong Kong.”
Students from the MSA and HKSA staked out the fence in lawn chairs all day. Mansour Elsharawy, another MSA board member, said that the response they received was generally positive. “People have been coming and saying like, ‘this is great, thank you’,” Elsharawy said.
Later that day, Place posted on Overlooked CMU, a Facebook page dedicated to the discussion of social issues, about pushback that the MSA had received.
Place wrote “I personally have been subjected to online abuse and threats after people linked me to the painting. Most recently, this morning a student came up to the fence to warn me to be careful and safe, saying people on WeChat were threatening me.”
Hundreds of students showed their support. 429 people reacted to the post on Facebook, 100 of whom used sad emojis. In the comment section students went back and forth over a range of topics, including the CPC’s reported actions.
On Wednesday night, the MSA and HKSA held “S’mores and Dialogue at the Fence” event to continue the campus dialogue. “There were some really good, peaceful discussions,” said masters engineering student Ansh Nasta in a comment on Overlooked CMU.
The next night, The Originals, a Carnegie Mellon a cappella group, painted the fence to advertise a joint concert.
Highest Priority*
By the end of the week, all of the students originations involved came together to emphasize that respecting one another was the highest priority.
The president of the CSA, Yifei Yang, told The Tartan that “Our fence has no intention to be political, and we do not want any difference in opinions and perspectives raise unintentional conflicts in our CMU community.”
On Thursday, Thomas Wong, senior in Physics and Mathematical Sciences, posted a statement on Overlooked on behalf of HKSA. The HKSA decried “the cyberbullying and threats to MSA members” as “failures on everyone’s part to uphold the core values of this community.” They also said that “CMU is a collaborative community, but none of that works if we do not treat each other with fundamental empathy and respect that we deserve as human beings.”
On Friday MSA, HKSA and CSA posted a joint statement on Overlooked addressing the tension. “We acknowledge that a difference of opinions, beliefs and opinions, is inevitable given the diversity of CMU’s student population and originations.” It continued, “however, we believe that this does not warrant or justify any form of threats to anyone’s safety and wellbeing.”
They concluded that “differing political opinions should never give way to any extreme action that would intimidate or target any individuals or organizations on the premise of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or country of origin.”.

2019-11-25,CMU,China,"This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Imagine walking around campus on a cold November Saturday. Maybe you’re going to the Cohon University Center to get some homework done, or you’re on your way to Hunt Library or the Gates-Hillman Center for a group project meeting. Say you pass the Cohon University Center and hear some commotion outside. It’s the football field, also known as (but rarely referred to as) Gesling Stadium. A group of students have taken to the field with banners demanding that Carnegie Mellon divest from fossil fuels, that the university must do this to combat climate change.
The football players are along the sidelines, helmets off, confused about whether half-time is over and wondering when the student protestors will leave the field. The small crowd, mostly players’ family members, a couple friends, and some athletes from other sports teams, is also confused about what is going on. Perhaps one dad yells out that he wants football, and for the students to get off the field. Perhaps a mom is explaining to her younger child what the students are protesting about.
The students are ushered off the field, and the football game resumes after a 48-minute delay. Was the protest successful? Well, at a school like Carnegie Mellon, who knows if a majority of the student body will even know this happened.
Now, this is all hypothetical — this did not occur this past Saturday at the Tartans’ final game of the season. It actually did happen at the historical Harvard-Yale football game on Saturday. Students from both Harvard and Yale took to the field at half-time to protest the schools’ continuing investment in fossil fuels and to call the schools to begin divestment. Climate change protests are all well and good, but the real genius of this plan was that it happened at this particular game. The protests invaded the only popular Ivy League football game of the year and ""divested"" the focus from football.
In the immediate aftermath, the protest seems successful. The Harvard-Yale game is the most prominent football game in the Ivy League and regularly has sold-out crowds wherever it is played (which, this year, was in New Haven). The game was broadcast on cable television and the protest was featured on ESPN. Yale was trending on Twitter, which I guarantee is the only time the school will ever trend for anything related to sports. The response ranged from complete support to conservatives blasting the students for being ""elitist fake news nuisances"" to a vast majority of people confused as to why an Ivy League football game was showing up on ESPN and their socail media timelines.
I can only imagine what something like this would look like at Carnegie Mellon. We don’t have a storied Harvard-Yale game, and we definitely aren’t ever going to be on television. The closest team we have to a rival is Case Western, but only people like sports writers for the school paper and actual football players know that. And unlike the Ivy League, which is Division I, we’re Division III, with no athletic scholarships and little chances of players making it to the NFL. You would have a better chance of reaching people for a protest at the black chairs on a given weekday than the small number of people who show up to football games on Saturdays.
Carnegie Mellon is a relatively apolitical university — indeed, I’ve had many friends wonder why there isn’t anything going on prominently on campus related to climate change or military investment in research. There have been some protests and political messaging on campus this semester, such as protests against Palantir and ICE in Gates and the China-Hong Kong discourse at the Fence, but overall, this activity is minuscule when compared with any liberal arts school you can think of.
Let’s go back to the opening scene, to a hypothetical protest at a football game at Gesling Stadium. Perhaps the Tartans are playing their biggest rival, Case Western, or maybe it’s Grove City or Geneva. Students on campus might look over to Gesling Stadium to see what’s going on, but will continue walking to their destinations. Such is the nature of a relatively apolitical university student body. If it were me, I’d just laugh at the absurd choice to do it at a Tartan football game..

2020-02-10,CMU,China,"As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows, governments and administrations have been taking preventive measures to protect the general public from further spread of the virus, including restricting travel to China. Carnegie Mellon University is no different. Recently, the university has begun taking precautionary actions to protect the community from possible infection of coronavirus.
On Jan. 22, University Health Services (UHS) sent an email to members of the Carnegie Mellon community regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Dr. Beth Kotarski, the Executive Director of UHS, advised the community to take health precautions, including washing hands, staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, getting plenty of rest, and getting the seasonal flu vaccine.
In a statement to The Tartan, Dr. Kotarski stressed the importance of hand washing: “It’s not too far off the mark to say that hand-washing literally flushes germs down the drain… if everyone on campus reading this would make a personal commitment to hand-washing frequently (every few hours and before and after every meal, lavatory use, after coughing or sneezing), then we would all benefit.”
Along with advising the community to take health precautions, UHS reported that they were “monitoring the emerging facts about the disease and working very closely with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) to understand and enact best practices for screening and treating any student who may report with symptoms.” Although there are few cases confirmed in the United States, “the concern with this virus is that it is new, and therefore health officials do not have experience with its long-term effects.”
One week later, an email from Provost James Garrett and Gina Casalegno, Dean of Students and Vice President for Student Affairs, announced that Carnegie Mellon had issued a restriction on all Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff from traveling to China for university purposes. They strongly advised those who were traveling to China for personal reasons to reconsider, following the U.S. State Department’s restriction on travel to China.
“Out of an abundance of caution,” the university asked that “anyone who has traveled to China within the last 14 days to immediately self-isolate before coming to campus,” and that “any student with fever and cough who has been to China within the last 14 days should report to, or call University Health Services.”
On Monday, Feb. 3, President Farnam Jahanian followed up with an email urging the community to come together in support for those who have been affected by coronavirus: “Let’s look out for each other, be extra kind to others and lend a helping hand, or a listening ear, to ensure the well-being of every member in our community.”
Maureen Dasey-Morales, Associate Vice President for Community Health and Well-Being, told The Tartan that people who have been distressed because of the virus can also turn to resources provided by the university. “Student Affairs staff, including house fellows, college liaisons, residence life staff, CaPS, the Office of the Dean of Students, and Community Health and Well-Being staff are all available to provide support and have been reaching out to persons that may need additional support,” she said.
As President Jahanian wrote to The Tartan, “Together, we need to support those members of the CMU community who are experiencing high stress, whether they’re directly or indirectly affected… Let’s look out for one another and offer kindness.”.

2020-02-24,CMU,China,"Last week in this series I started with Korean cinema, since Parasite had just won best picture, and I praised Korean films for being over-the-top in a way that’s believable and really entertaining. Then I realized that statement also describes a lot of Japanese films, so it made sense to explore Japanese films for the next installment of this series. The Japanese film industry has been thriving for a good amount of time, and it’s a shame that the technical achievements aren’t more well known to people.
For anyone who’s really into movies, the name that often pops up in discussions of Japanese cinema is Akira Kurosawa. He is my personal favorite director, and I’ve seen almost all of his films. There are whole books and video essays about why he’s so great. Star Wars, a few late Westerns, and many other American films and directors, including Martin Scorsese, are influenced by him.
Every single one of his films is visually arresting and distinct. The camera movement, lighting, and, in his later films, color, all come together to make every shot look like the watercolor paintings he often used as a visual reference. The editing is also seamless. There’s a saying that the best editing is the type where you don’t see it. Kurosawa’s movies are the best examples of that. Every Frame a Painting on Youtube has a really good video about the visuals and movement in Kurosawa’s movies and he articulates it way better than I can.
There is a distinct theatricality and sense of grandeur to his films, which makes sense because he has adapted a lot of Shakespeare’s stories. Throne of Blood is based on Macbeth,* The Bad Sleep Well* is based on Hamlet, and Ran is based on King Lear. He also directs actors to be larger than life, and combining that with the visuals creates an experience that is so rewarding and satisfying.
If you want to delve into his filmography, I would start with his samurai classics. My favorite of the bunch are Rashomon, Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress (aka Star Wars), and Sanjuro. Ikiru, High and Low, The Bad Sleep Well, and Stray Dog don’t feature samurai, but they are still awesome. My favorite of his films is Ran for which he got a best director nomination in 1986. This is a great one to build up to because it is a culmination of everything he does best and then some.
Another influential director, and one of Kurosawa’s peers, is Yasujiro Ozu. He is the man who famously defied all the “conventions” of the time, like not using over the shoulder shots and breaking the 180 degree rule. But his films are sort of the opposite of Kurosawa’s. They showcase a different type of great directing that can still be cinematic.
Whereas Kurosawa is theatrical in his presentation, Ozu is more intimate and minimalist. For example, his best film, Tokyo Story, is mainly dialogue driven and slow-paced. The intricacies of the family drama are the highlight of the film, and plot beats are not the focus. Everything he does is a clear effort to make the viewer focus on the characters as much as possible. I haven’t seen a good chunk of his filmography, but An Autumn Afternoon and Floating Weeds are also both great films.
One common, silly stereotype about Japanese cinema is that it’s all weird, probably driven by people finding YouTube videos of absurd reality TV, commercials, and out-of-context scenes from certain movies. But Japanese horror films embrace the discomfiting, existential weirdness, and that’s what makes it so effective for me. That’s going to be off-putting for a lot of people, but if you find that entertaining, then here’s a list of Japanese horror to watch.
My favorite J-horror film is Audition, directed by Takashi Miike. The story follows a widower who creates a fake audition to find a new partner for life and how progressively worse it gets. It’s stomach churning and stressful in all the right ways, and it’s bizarre in a way that makes it more frightening. Miike also directed Ichi the Killer, which is about a sadomasochistic yakuza enforcer. It’s one of the most perverse, violent, and horrifying things I’ve ever seen that makes me laugh uncomfortably.
Sion Sono is another director with great J-horror under his belt. I personally didn’t like Suicide Club as much, which is a story about police investigating a string of suicides, but I know some people will get a kick out of it. However, Riaru onigokku, or Tag, is really riveting and a great, intense blend of sci-fi and action.
The Ring was a remake of the 1997 Japanese original, Ring. The Ring is fine, but it’s still the more standard, American, in-your-face horror. Ring, on the other hand, is a psychologically challenging and made it hard for me to sleep after watching it. Even though it’s more subtle, it still manages to be stranger and more twisted than the American version by a long shot.
The film also has an interesting exploration of a common theme in many Japanese films: the forced modernization of Japan post-World War II and its clash with Japanese tradition. It’s a common existential theme that has been explored through films as far back as Yasujiro Ozu. In Ring, it’s used to a chilling effect and shows how that clash has impacted the collective mindset of Japan.
If you have always hated The Hunger Games like me and wished the movie was only about the game, then Battle Royale is the movie for you. Japanese action is insane, and the stuff I’ve seen is all really brutal and jaw-dropping. 13 Assassins, also from Takashi Miike, is an awesome historical action film and has a great 45 minute ending battle.
Versus is a really cool zombie action film shot on a low budget. Killers, which is an Indonesian and Japanese joint effort, is a really intense action thriller. For some older ones, Lady Snowblood and Harakiri are excellent action dramas that give Kurosawa a run for his money. You can also never go wrong with any of the Godzilla movies released over the years.
Of course, anime should be given attention. Studio Ghibli is the most famous anime studio, with Hayao Miyazaki being the most recognized director. If you haven’t seen Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, Kiki’s Delivery Service, or My Neighbor Totoro, those movies are a good place to start. 
Ghibli also had Isao Takahata, who co-founded Ghibli with Miyazaki and passed away two years ago. He directed Grave of the Fireflies, which made me ugly cry for 20 minutes. The movie is so devastating that they had to release My Neighbor Totoro alongside it so that audiences could watch something uplifting after crying. He also made The Tale of Princess Kaguya, which has a really unique animation style for Ghibli and is unlike anything I’ve seen.
While Ghibli is a studio with the most consistent filmography, there are loads of other great anime films. Akira, which I talked about at length before, is a great cyberpunk thriller, as is Ghost in the Shell. Satoshi Kon directed Perfect Blue and Paprika, which are both amazing, fantastical, psychological dramas. A Silent Voice is one of the best anime movies to come out in the past few years, and I thought it was a Ghibli film at first.
Finally, I am going to mention my favorite contemporary Japanese director: Hirokazu Kore-eda. He makes some really great, humanistic dramas that explore themes about family. Like Father, Like Son takes a switched at birth premise and actually makes it interesting. Our Little Sister is a really moving story about a broken family. But my favorite film is Shoplifters, which is about a non-biological family in poverty resorting to shoplifting to get by. The film combines his exploration of family themes with themes about class consciousness.
Japan has a really well established and influential film industry that is continuing to thrive. The growing popularity of anime is also helping a lot of Japanese films gain recognition, and hopefully, directors like Hirokazu Kore-eda get some more recognition in the U.S. For the next installment in this series, I will talk about Indian movies, and no, that doesn’t mean only Bollywood movies.

2020-03-02,CMU,China,"Since July of 2019, the U.S. Department of Education has been investigating undisclosed foreign gifts at elite schools. These investigations are an extension of federal government scrutiny about overseas income reporting practices in higher education. Carnegie Mellon is among the universities being investigated.
Other universities being investigated include Cornell, Yale, University of Colorado Boulder, Texas MD Anderson, MIT, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, Boston University, and Texas A&M.
It is unknown what fraction of these foreign gifts Carnegie Mellon received. The U.S. Department of Education has not revealed what any other implicated school received either.
Past gifts that were reported by the university total around 1.4 billion dollars. Carnegie Mellon has been funded by 29 different countries since 2013. Carnegie Mellon’s established top ten foreign donors, starting with top donors, include: Bermuda, Qatar, Thailand, Portugal, Japan, Rwanda, India, China, Hong Kong, and Canada.
About half of that 1.4 billion dollars was paid by the Bermuda company Marvell Technology Group Ltd. in 2016. The donation was for a legal settlement for a patent on a computer data recovery technology invented by Carnegie Mellon.
It is also known that Carnegie Mellon received about 374 million dollars in contracts from Qatar and another 27 million in a contract from Rwanda. This funding has likely been directed into running Carnegie Mellon campuses in those countries.
Carnegie Mellon has acknowledged the report that there is an alleged $3.6 billion in foreign gifts that had previously been unreported.
University spokesperson Julie Mattera told The Tartan and other media outlets: “Carnegie Mellon has always taken seriously our obligation to report contracts with and donations from foreign persons and entities, and we believe we have accurately disclosed these contracts and donations in compliance with Section 117 of the Higher Education Act. We have not changed the way we report.”.

2020-03-02,CMU,China,"The discourse was inevitable. With Asians making up at least 18 percent of the Carnegie Mellon student population as of the Fall 2018 Academic Year, the effects of the coronavirus outbreak were bound to be discussed on campus at large. Heated debates about sinophobia, racism, and the coronavirus already surfaced about a month ago on the Facebook page “Confessions at Carnegie Mellon”. The page posted a confession about an adjunct professor joking about the disease outbreak.
The Tartan reported the university administration’s response to the disease outbreak two weeks ago. However, The Tartan has yet to synthesize the conversations on “Confessions at Carnegie Mellon” and analyze the social effects of the coronavirus outbreak that extend beyond infected areas. Now is the time to talk about the sinophobia and racism that came with the media coverage of the coronavirus. The excessive media coverage of the coronavirus perpetuates sinophobia and racism that have real, harmful consequences for local Asian communities.
Ever since the World Health Organization released a statement declaring the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic as a “global emergency,” universities around the nation, including Carnegie Mellon University, have issued travel bans and have strongly encouraged people coming from China to self-isolate for 14 days. Although these precautionary measures are intended to prevent the disease from spreading to campuses, the policies inflate the severity of the coronavirus's social, rather than medical, effects and heighten public fear of Chinese people. Even though the flu is more likely to kill Americans than the coronavirus, the coronavirus receives more attention and needs specialized prevention policies. The recommendation of self-isolation seems drastic when the major concern of the virus is its novelty. The policies’ focus on people from China — despite cases of coronavirus being reported in Western countries such as Italy, Spain, and France — singles out China as the sole harbinger of disease. Therefore, avoidance of Chinese people becomes associated with coronavirus prevention.
With the mainstream coverage of the coronavirus came the racist jokes on social media. These jokes, appearing as typical Gen-Z dark humor, circulate misinformation about the spread of the coronavirus by appealing to Chinese stereotypes of uncleanliness and “disgusting” food preferences. A popular conspiracy theory about bat soup causing the Wuhan virus outbreak was repeated in different tabloids to personally blame Chinese people for the epidemic. The jokes normalize racism against Asians. They treat the alienation of Asians as a casual, humorous response to a tragic crisis and reinforce the undesirability of Asians.
The global sinophobia caused by the media is of important consequence. People use the coronavirus as an excuse to harass Asian university students and bully Asian children. Sinophobia killed a man in Australia as bystanders refused to perform CPR, fearing that he might carry the disease. Chinese restaurants are losing business, as people irresponsibly believe that all Chinese food is contaminated as a result of the outbreak. The coronavirus fear spread over the media needs to be addressed. It’s hurting Asian communities by rationalizing blatant racism.
Luckily, government officials in the U.S. and China are already working to crack down on misinformation about the coronavirus. U.S. lawmakers are encouraging major social media platforms — such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter — to cooperate in promoting credible information about the virus outbreak.  Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China must exhibit transparency in reporting the outbreak by releasing accurate information in a timely manner. However, individual community members must also join efforts to curb misinformation and sinophobia if Asians are to feel welcome in their communities. Everyone must speak out against racist memes and condemn sinophobic news coverage so that Asians can be included in solving the coronavirus epidemic..

2020-09-14,CMU,China,"One of the biggest events in the film industry last week was the release of Mulan. Originally planned to release in theaters in March, Disney pushed the release date back due to the coronavirus pandemic. This movie was a live-action version of the original Mulan, also made by Disney, and Disney hoped to build on the original's success with this new version. However, this movie did not get off to a good start, despite the initial hype among both Chinese and Western viewers.
Mulan is based on an old Chinese fairy tale of a female warrior who wanted to save her old-aged father from compulsory military service by pretending to be a male and serving in the place of her father. The original fairy tale was a very touching story, and it was very well known in China, which meant that the movie was supposed to do great in the Chinese market. 
But Disney decided to botch the storyline of the movie by changing the movie from a touching personal story of Mulan saving her father into a John Wick-style action movie that was not at all representative of the original values behind the fairy tale. The fairy tale was supposed to celebrate Mulan’s will to save her father and her bravery in serving in an all-male military as a female, but Disney changed Mulan into an action superhero who could single-handedly save a country’s emperor, forgoing her family obligations. 
There were also unnecessary additions of characters into the movie, such as the witch who can apparently fly into cities and kill everyone inside before the troops even arrive. There is no witch in the original fairy tale, and it just added confusion for viewers, especially Chinese viewers who probably can recite the ""Ballad of Mulan"" verbatim, leaving a sour taste in the minds of the Chinese viewers.
Disney also hired the wrong costume and makeup designers. Costumes used in this movie were representative of the Tang Dynasty, which was more than 500 years later than the original time period of the Mulan story. The choices of props used were also questionable, with Mulan’s house following a typical style from southern China, despite the story taking place in northern China, a clear mismatch that should not have happened. These factors compounded made the movie unsavory for the Chinese audience, and this was shown in the poor reviews on Chinese movie-review sites.
With the unexpected failure in the Chinese market, Disney must hope that the Western market can become the saving grace of this movie, but that is becoming less likely. The lead actor of the movie, Liu Yifei, was embroiled in controversies in 2019 after she made a statement on social media supporting the Hong Kong Police, who were cracking down on Hong Kong democracy protests during that time. Another actor, Donnie Yen, was also accused of being pro-police and pro-Beijing by Western activists. These led to a boycott movement in 2019, and it was refreshed by activists in several countries/regions, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand, where netizens together formed an alliance called the Milk Tea Alliance, boycotting the movie. The deteriorating relationship between China and the United States also did not help the movie succeed. 
However, there might be some saving grace for Disney and Mulan, as the viewership count on Disney+ for this movie was high, and there were some positive reviews coming out from critics, mainly praising Liu Yifei’s superior acting skills, as well as Disney’s efforts in making Chinese culture more approachable to the average Westerner.
The movie was plagued by its botched attempts to please the Chinese audience, while still offending some Western viewers. The timing of this movie could not have been worse, with rising tensions between China and the United States and a growing anti-Chinese sentiment in the States. Despite these setbacks, the movie still received high viewership and some positive reviews, but this movie will not be the best movie of 2020. Instead, at least for me, it would be something I would watch if I am on a plane with no other options..

2020-09-21,CMU,China,"This week’s bombshell news in the semiconductor industry was NVIDIA’s announcement of their intent to buy Arm from SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm, for $40 billion. This deal will have widespread implications for both consumer electronics, like the device you are reading this right now, and the larger electronics industry as a whole.
Arm Limited is a UK-based semiconductor company that designs its own CPU architecture called ARM. Prominent customers of ARM include Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm, who use ARM to design their mobile chips — the smartphone in your pocket is almost certainly powered by ARM. 
NVIDIA is also a semiconductor company, but it's based in the US and known mostly for its GPUs, such as the GeForce series for PC gamers, and GPUs designed for AI applications, such as the A100. NVIDIA also designs the CPU used in the Nintendo Switch, which is, as you may have guessed, based on ARM.
The implications of this deal are widespread. NVIDIA can finally step into the computer CPU market instead of only focusing on the GPU market, allowing them to compete with companies like Intel and AMD. This completes NVIDIA’s product folio, which currently does not include CPUs, and it puts the company in line with AMD and Intel, who develop both CPUs and GPUs. GPUs are used extensively in artificial intelligence, allowing NVIDIA to create AI solutions that bundle the advantages of both CPU and GPU technology — which is more difficult for NVIDIA’s competitors.
Second, this deal puts NVIDIA in a very strong position — possibly too strong — now that the company controls the chip architecture others need to design their CPUs. This puts NVIDIA in a powerful position to negotiate against them. A good example of this is Apple, who use chips based on ARM in all their mobile and tablet devices, with plans to develop ARM chips used in Mac laptop and desktop lineup as well. With NVIDIA’s ownership of ARM, Apple might have to agree to use NVIDIA GPUs in their products instead of their current selection of AMD GPUs, leading to the rise of a monopoly.
This can draw significant attention from regulators, which leads to a chance that this deal will not go through. There are a lot of parties at stake here, and there are a lot of incentives to block the deal. The UK, where Arm Limited is based, might reject the plan, since handing the technology to the U.S. could lead to job loss within the UK and more leverage for the U.S. in trade talks. Huawei, and by extension China, is not happy with the deal either since Huawei chips are ARM-based, and handing ARM over to the U.S. could result in more sanctions on Huawei. U.S. regulators might block the deal as well, since it could potentially create a market-dominating semiconductor company that leaves no room for its competitors, which may lead to inefficiencies and lack of innovation. 
NVIDIA’s proposed acquisition of ARM may create a brighter future for the development of AI, but it could also lead to a monopoly in the semiconductor industry, as well as significant government interference. .

2020-10-05,CMU,China,"My doctor has told me that I need to avoid things that increase my blood pressure so that my heart doesn’t give out at the age of 30. Of course, I don’t listen to her at all. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here telling you all about Love on a Leash, a 2011 movie about a woman who falls in love with a stray dog, but the dog secretly turns into a man at night. I figured in quarantine time, it was finally time to watch this. 
So before going into this, I think everyone should know why this exists. I didn’t find out about this until recently, but the voice actor for the dog, Stephen Kramer Glickman, was interviewed about what happened. In the late 2000s, the writer and director of the film, Fen Tian, had convinced a Chinese church that her movie would be about the spirit of Jesus helping people find love. Of course, when the church’s priest found that it wasn’t, they pulled the funding for the movie. 
Glickman was literally paid in cantaloupes to voice act the dog, only to be asked to re-record all his lines later as he was being tapped to play Shrek on Broadway. He also hadn’t met anyone else in the cast, and the editor of the movie asked Glickman not to mention his name in the interview. 
I don’t know where to start with this movie, so we’ll start at the beginning. There’s no music over the opening credit montage of this really cute labrador running around. Then the labrador comments on the hotness of the women at the park, stares at extras awkwardly kissing each other, and notes how much he wants to find a girl. Then he talks to Water Pond — yes, the character is named Water Pond and is quite literally a pond with some random bubbling sounds and sparkle effects added in post — who says that he can turn back into a man if he finds a girl. 
From there, we’re introduced to the other main character, Lisa, who, by the way, is always wearing green clothing. She lives in a green house, has a green car, and everything she owns is green. Glickman had asked the director about this, and her response to him was something about the color green representing horniness in China? I tried to look this up after, and the only things I found were some pretty NSFW results. 
Lisa also has a friend named Paula. She has this running bit throughout the whole movie where she views men as nothing but objects for pleasure and they’re good for “a little something something.” She’s also a Black woman with a lot of questionable dialogue and direction as if the director told her to play a caricature of a Black woman. Then in some bizarre sequence of events that still makes no sense, the dog convinces Lisa to drive him to her home. The dog sings in her car, Lisa gives him a shower in a Benny Hill-type sped up montage, and then he just leaves and sings about how he’s leaving? We are only 5 minutes into this. Good lord. 
At this point, I should say something really quickly about the audio quality of this movie. You know how we’ve all done that one project in iMovie for a class and the audio sounds like it was recorded with a potato? That’s the audio in this movie, except it just randomly cuts in and out, it clips a lot, and there is no music the entire time. So the movie will go from complete silence to audio clipping the next second, and I kept getting jump scared by it. Plus there is some really bad dubbing and even worse audio editing. A shot will end and cut to the next scene, but the dialogue from the previous scene will still be playing over this next shot too. 
In the next 25 minutes, this is what happens in order. Lisa deals with a farting “Karen” at a department store, and then, she gets asked out by a fellow employee named Kyle. The dog fakes an injury to convince Lisa to let him bunk with her. She goes on a date with Kyle, gets convinced by her friend to go get new clothes, and goes shopping with the dog, whose real name, according to him, is Alvin Flang. The dog gets kicked by the store owner but impresses everyone when he manages to pick out clothes and gains the eye of a talent agent. 
Now we see that Lisa’s boss is into her, but he’s harassing her. She’s also being stalked by a weird dude named Frank. It turns out Lisa’s nosy neighbor (?), Rita is trying to set her up with Frank, and Lisa goes on a date with Frank after Paula and Lisa’s mom convince her it’s ok to see multiple guys at once. So she goes on a date with Frank, but Frank’s psychotic, nutritionist mother spends the whole time talking about weight and dieting. Then she calls Kyle over to her house, and he asks her to marry him. But there’s a twist! He says to her it would be a marriage in name only because Kyle is actually gay, and he only wants the marriage for the tax benefits or something.
Now Lisa’s boss breaks into her house and tries to assault her, but the dog saves her. The boss angrily fires her on the spot. Lisa has a huge mental breakdown during which the dog is singing how he is the “king of the castle who’s also a dog and lives in a house that is green.” He tries to make a move, she pushes him away, and then, she tries to overdose on pills. So the dog goes outside to lure a stranger to call 911 by playing dead in the street. He saves her, but the dog is back out on the street singing about how that hurts his feet and makes him sad. 
Lisa goes after the dog to try to find him, who she named Prince way earlier, and she tracks him down at the park. She confesses her love, and how she wants to be with him forever. Then, Prince transforms into a man played by a totally different actor. The man form of Prince explains how he was punished to live as a dog for being a cheating playboy in his past life, which honestly doesn’t sound that bad. There’s a really awkward sex scene, and then in the morning, he turns back into a dog. Water Pond tells him he can only be a man at night. 
In 30 minutes, there have been three subplots resolved, three others established, and the main plot only developed 30 minutes in after the subplots. These are also not happening concurrently, but one at a time, as if someone with short-term memory loss made the movie. To the poor soul reading this [*editor’s note: I can’t believe I’ve been forced to read this*], I have seen some confusing things in my life, and this is far and away the most confusing thing I’ve ever seen. The rest of the movie is even more confusing. 
The audio isn’t the only thing in this movie that’s potato quality. The cinematography is, too. It’s not just that it looks bad, but also the fact that some of the shots just don’t make sense. There are dutch angles everywhere, the actors are constantly out of frame, and there are some really terrifying closeups with the actors lit like they’re in a horror movie. One shot in particular that stuck out was when Lisa’s mom called her to tell her to date four or five guys at a time, and she’s shrouded in silhouette like it’s a Hitchcock movie. 
The actors for the dog are not just different people, but they each play them differently. When the dog is in dog form, he’s absolutely horrible. At one point Lisa is changing her clothes, and she asks the dog “what are you looking at?” He responds “not much.” But the dog in man form is super sweet, just a caring guy who just wants to look after her. It also doesn’t help that they’re all reading dialogue that sounds like it was Google translated from a different language, which according to Glickman, was how the script was actually written. 
The rest of this movie gets a bit dragged out despite having so many subplots, so I’ll breeze through the rest. Lisa and Alvin Flang fall in love and live happily, and Alvin Flang tries to provide for them by going to meet the talent agent from earlier. He films a commercial and makes a lot of money. Paula comes to visit one night, and Lisa tries to hide Alvin. She finds him and scares Paula who feels betrayed, and the two friends fall out even though Paula has been trying to get Lisa to lose her virginity the whole time so far.
Anyway, Water Pond tells Alvin Flang that he has not shown real, true love yet. So he meets Lisa’s mom and her nosy neighbor Rita, which goes well. Of course, the limitation of being a man at night is that by day he is a dog, so Lisa’s mom has a panic attack when she thinks that Alvin Flang ditched her, believing she will die alone as a virgin. Then nosy Rita goes snooping, chases Alvin around in broad daylight, and tries to get him to leave her. Finally, Lisa puts her foot down and shows some backbone for once in this stupid movie. 
Some other stuff happens. They disagree about having a kid. They go to an art museum. They change the rules, so he can only turn into a dog if it’s sunny. There’s a cloudy day, and Lisa takes Alvin to meet the boss of her job to get a promotion. Of course, it gets sunny. Alvin turns back into a dog, and Lisa almost drowns in a pool when she freaks out about it. The dog saves her while calling her a “pizza faced cinder block.” 
They realize this relationship isn’t working, so Alvin leaves her. Then, he talks to Water Pond who imparts some lesson about patience and working problems out or some other bogus lesson that makes no sense. Alvin realizes he loves her and tries to run back to her, but he gets hit by a car in dog form. Lisa holds Alvin, in dog form, in her arms as he dies and confesses his love with his dying breath. I’m not sure if making the dog “act” in this movie counts as animal abuse. 
Years pass. Paula randomly comes back with her grandkids to reconcile with Lisa, and they reminisce about good old times. Alvin Flang is resurrected somehow, which I guess is the Jesus portion of the film Fen Tian told the church that funded this. He’s young, but he touches her hands and turns old. Then, they get married and turn young again, and it ends. 
I don’t know what this is or why I watched it, but I am glad I did. This is a gem. Every line of dialogue in this movie could and should become a meme if this becomes a famous enough cult movie. So I’m doing my part in expanding the Love on a Leash cult by telling you all to watch it. It’s on YouTube right now for free in its full glory, and I really can’t think of a better use of 85 minutes of your time. .

2020-11-01,CMU,China,"“President Trump sends his best to Carnegie Mellon,” was how National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien opened an on-the-record webinar with the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) on Oct. 27. The Zoom event, held one week before the 2020 general election, was co-hosted by IPS Director Kiron Skinner and IPS Senior Fellow Richard Grenell. Seated in the White House Situation Room, O’Brien shared the President’s greetings to Skinner and Grenell, both of whom have held top diplomatic positions within the Trump Administration. 
Speaking to over a hundred virtual attendees from the Carnegie Mellon community, Ambassador O’Brien defended the foreign policy record of the vulnerable incumbent President Trump. O’Brien contrasted the President’s “peace through strength” doctrine with the “era of strategic patience” that preceded Trump’s first term in the White House. “Strategic patience” often refers to the Obama administration’s policy of gradually increasing sanctions on North Korea until it agreed to negotiations regarding its nuclear weapons program. 
In his year-long tenure at the White House, O’Brien has proven a staunch ally to Trump, even on his most controversial decisions. In December 2019, he defended the President’s decision to pardon Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with stabbing an injured 17-year-old ISIS prisoner to death and shooting at least two unarmed Iraqi civilians without provocation. Back in January, O’Brien claimed without evidence, that Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was conspiring to stage an attack on Americans before he was killed by an airstrike that President Trump ordered. Later, the White House released a memo that contradicted that message, stating the assassination was to “deter Iran from conducting or supporting...attacks” on the United States rather than to prevent an imminent threat.  
Throughout the webinar, Grenell and O’Brien hyped each other up about their diplomatic achievements. Grenell credited O’Brien for his work as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. O’Brien praised Grenell’s contribution to the establishment of normal economic relations between Kosovo and Serbia. He also noted President Trump’s close bond with Grenell, saying, “other than Ivanka [Trump], there’s no one the President more enjoys spending time with than Ric [Grenell].” In August, Grenell was tapped as LGBT adviser for the Republican National Convention and has since followed the Trump campaign at indoor ‘Trump Pride’ events in battleground states across the country. 
Grenell and O’Brien’s most recent collaboration was not discussed in the event. Under authorization from O’Brien, Grenell recently met with top Venezuelan official Jorge Rodriguez, according to sources that spoke anonymously with Bloomberg News. During this encounter outside Mexico City, Grenell allegedly sought to negotiate Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s swift exit from power prior to the U.S. elections. Neither Secretary of State Mike Pompeo nor the State Department Envoy to Venezuela were alerted about the trip until after its occurrence. Grenell did not immediately reply to a request for comment on that story. 
Throughout the question and answer session following O’Brien’s initial statement, Grenell, Skinner, and O’Brien extolled President Trump’s foreign policy. Both IPS faculty members claimed that the President’s policies abroad appeal to people across the political spectrum. Justifying that Trump has “left-wing” bona fides, Grenell cited Trump’s summit with Kim Jong-Un and Skinner brought up the Israeli-UAE normalization agreement. O’Brien dismissed claims that America is a declining power, boldly predicting that “this is gonna be an American century” due to our “strong military” and rising GDP. The U.S. is projected to spend around $934 billion on the military in 2020-2021, while high GDP numbers mask a devastating eviction crisis and the millions of U.S. taxpayers without health insurance who face a pandemic infecting 89,000 Americans daily. O’Brien serves on the White House Coronavirus Task Force and himself contracted the virus in July. 
Grenell recently published a piece in IPS’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIRP) journal, entitled “The Trump Turn: Shaping the Next Decade of American Foreign Policy.” In it, he argues that the future of diplomacy lies in “remaking” the world order to “reflect U.S. national interests.” Arguing for a “balance of power” reminiscent of the Cold War era, Grenell asserts that the Trump administration has sought “to reshape a more stable and favorable global system” by embracing competition and rejecting broad international cooperation. Grenell’s views complement those of Skinner, the head of IPS who once described U.S.-China relations as a “fight with a really different civilization” while serving as Policy Planning Director at the State Department. Their nationalistic perspectives represent the core of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy..

Richard L. Weiss, Green Party
https://www.greenslate2020.org/attorney_general
Top issues: “1. Save the taxpayers’ money. Reduce prison population by 50%, by not seeking cash bail, not bringing charges merely for drug possession or consensual relations between adults. Only those who are actually a threat to the community should be incarcerated. Others should be diverted from the prison system to programs designed to help them pay their debt to society and reintegrate into the community. Prosecutorial resources can then be directed to addressing violent crime, combating corruption and consumer protection. 2. Reformation of the system of policing. Citizen Review Boards are only a start. Community and police must establish standards of conduct and need special prosecutors for police misconduct. 3. Promote Restorative Justice.” (League of Women Voters)

(I would like to throw in Honesty and Respect). 2) Racist Laws like the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott Decision show how deep racism is ingrained in our society. Unfair laws and practices like voter suppression, purging voters off lists, and long voting lines must end. 3) Quality Education & Climate Change - Growing up, I remember the fog being so thick, you could not see down the street.

How about the gas tax, or turnpike tolls that are consistently repurposed for other projects? Taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going. Funds should be spent on what they were appropriated for. 2. Covid-19 has signiﬁcantly impacted our state. Areas like education, healthcare, small business and unemployment have all been affected. It will be very important to audit the performance of related programs as well as ensuring that funds were properly allocated. 3. Combat government waste and inefﬁciency. I will work to ensure effective use of taxpayer dollars.” (League of Women Voters)

Top Issues:  ""I intend to use my ofﬁce to push forward an agenda that is future focused and serves the people of Pennsylvania. Every monetary decision I make will consider how we can 1) prepare the State for a Green New Deal by investing in sustainable jobs and eliminating dirty industry handouts, 2) restructure our outdated tax code by closing corporate tax evasion loopholes and providing for equitable taxation, and 3) reform the criminal justice system by ending cash bail and reducing incarceration and recidivism.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Runkle looks to implement changes that increase transparency, specifically around the use of tax money. He also wants to prepare for a more sustainable future by restructuring the nation’s industry.
Joseph Soloski, Libertarian Party
https://joesoloski.com/
Top Issues:  “I will be working to influence the Governor and the Legislature to minimize taxes, and cut the costs of government wherever possible. The budget of the Commonwealth has exploded over the past 20 years and the Republicans and Democrats, who have been in power for more than 150 years, are doing little to curb the runaway growth of state government and advocate for the taxpayers of Pennsylvania.” (League of Women Voters) 
Positions: In office, Soloski plans to cut wages for legislators and push to lower corporate net income tax. 
Police review question
Voters will be asked whether or not police officers should be required to cooperate with Independent Police Review Board investigations. This measure would require police leadership to hear the board’s recommendations before making a decision on disciplinary action and allow the board to conduct performance audits. It also would give the mayor power to remove people from the board, with the potential for city council to override. This measure was unanimously supported by the members of the Pittsburgh City Council. .

2020-11-09,CMU,China,"When Richard Grenell was brought on as Senior Fellow in the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) this past June, students and faculty pushed back citing concerns about Grenell’s actions and rhetoric. Administration attempted to quell the fear about what this appointment would do to the school’s reputation, writing in an Aug. 3 report that “we fully expect Mr. Grenell to abide by all CMU policies, including the stipulation ‘to conduct all business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, accuracy, integrity and respect for others.’” In the last few weeks, more students and professors have argued that Grenell’s actions do no not constitute the “good faith” the university expected.
To his almost 700,000 Twitter followers, Grenell has posted disinformation about president-elect Joe Biden’s mask wearing, which was later deleted, as well as numerous claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which have not been substantiated. He’s called COVID-19 the “Chinese Flu,” has posted anti-mask rhetoric, and throughout the election cycle, has appeared at several political events without consideration of social distancing and without wearing a mask.   
Many members of the Carnegie Mellon community have taken issue with Grenell’s recent behavior, sharing their takes on social media. In an open letter to president Farnam Jahanian posted on the Carnegie Mellon subreddit Nov. 7, one Reddit user wrote, “[Grenell] makes a mockery of our academic community's ethical, health, and cultural norms and has proven himself incapable of being restricted by any standard of decency.” Later in the letter, they state, “I am not a political radical. I do not criticize the political leanings of the recent appointee. I am incensed, rather, by his attacks on our sacrosanct democratic institutions. I am outraged by his vitriolic, racist, hateful speech so to the detriment of the culture of collaboration and unity we have attempted to foster at our beloved university.”
Another post on Reddit asked the university to “drop” him, citing his frequent sharing of misinformation on twitter. One user, who wrote that they had previously worked in the call center that solicits alumni donations, said in a separate post on Nov. 3 that alumni should tell Carnegie Mellon that they’re withholding donations pending Grenell’s employment status. That user concluded, “if CMU doesn’t care about their reputation, I’m sure they at least care about their money.”
On Twitter, a satirical account, complete with the username @CMU_IPS and a profile photo to match, has been quote-tweeting posts of Grenell at public events without a mask. Responding to a photo of Grenell and Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) both without masks, the account wrote, “Thank you to our Senior Fellow @RichardGrenell for refusing to wear a mask and continuing to combat the Fake News China Virus!”
The tweet garnered the attention of the university, which tweeted back from it’s official account, “That is not an official CMU-related account and we have already reported the fake account to Twitter” on Nov. 3. 
That tweet marked the first university comment related to Grenell’s recent actions. To it, one user responded, “it’s not a fake account, it’s a parody. Y’all staff EMBARRASSING people and we like to joke about it!” Another chimed in, “might want to rethink these priorities.”
On Oct. 30, Jonathan Aldrich, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, posted a blog entry titled “What to do about Richard Grenell?” The piece argues that Grenell has not upheld the basic requirements for employment at Carnegie Mellon, specifically, those of the university’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Grenell’s use of the term “Chinese Flu” after being hired, as well as his lack of compliance with the university’s COVID-19 guidelines, Aldrich says, have demonstrated that the concerns the community had upon Grenell’s appointment have been realized. “[Grenell’s] behavior has not changed simply by being hired at CMU; even if we will not fire him immediately for it, it does demonstrate pretty clearly that hiring him was a mistake,” Aldrich wrote.
Aldrich says the Grenell situation has illuminated the need for greater “checks and balances” in the hiring process at Carnegie Mellon. “CMU’s policy of giving department heads discretion to hire high profile visiting faculty and staff is fundamentally flawed,” Aldrich writes, “One person can make the decision to hire, with no checks and balances – despite the fact that the hired person can contribute to a hostile environment for racial minorities.” Aldrich urges the university to understand that “academic freedom is about individual teaching and research, not about administrative hiring.”
In an interview with The Tartan, Aldrich said that his gripes with Grenell stem not from anyone’s political beliefs, but from Grenell’s actions. “We've seen very partisan behavior from [Grenell] as part of the Trump campaign, and that's expected. I don't have any opposition to faculty or staff members at Carnegie Mellon being involved in politics. But I do have a problem with misinformation,” he said. Any Carnegie Mellon staff member, especially those that are prominent enough to be a “voice of the university,” Aldrich says, have an “obligation to the truth.”
Referring to the lack of administrative action regarding Grenell’s frequent incompliance with university COVID-19 policy, Aldrich said, “maybe [the administration] figure this doesn't matter, because maybe [Grenell] actually is never on campus, and never in a room with students.” But, given the public reprimand that a CFA professor received for violating COVID-19 guidelines on Oct. 24, Aldrich said that “it certainly seems at least a bit hypocritical to have this very public flaunting of COVID guidelines by a senior [staff member] without any comment.”
Conlon Novak, a masters student in Human-Computer Interaction, saw Grenell’s lack of COVID-19 safety on social media and began reporting instances of it to the university’s ethics reporting system on Oct. 14. So far, Novak has reported 4 of Grenell’s violations of COVID-19 guidelines to the university. In an interview with The Tartan, Novak said that he reported these violations in the spirit of A Tartan’s Responsibility, the university’s guiding principles for COVID-19 behavior, which stipulate that “every member of the Carnegie Mellon University community has a shared responsibility to uphold a culture of safety that balances health considerations with our desire to fulfill the university’s core mission.”
Novak said that the university has “been encouraging everyone to use these reporting resources when they see faculty, staff, students not following protocols.” Since Grenell is a staff member at IPS, “I made sure to pass along everything I saw violating the code as I understood it,” Novak said.
Novak, like Aldrich, says that trying to get the university to enforce COVID-19 guidelines, or reevaluate hiring practices, is not at all politically motivated. “This is the furthest thing from a political question, which is, I think, one of the reasons why this discourse seems to be so charged,” he said. “In actuality, this is a university who has bent over backwards to justify the hiring of someone who is not upholding their good name and reputation, and I genuinely can’t figure out why.”
“I don't want to call for anyone to lose their job, but I don't want to see anyone endanger the health and safety and lives of these students,” Novak said. He plans to keep reporting Grenell’s public COVID-19 policy violations to the university. 
Carnegie Mellon spokesperson Jason Maderer said in a statement to The Tartan that university leadership have “received reports from members of the community about Ambassador Grenell’s campaign appearances”, and that they “have advised [Grenell] that these appearances, often while not wearing a facial covering or maintaining physical distancing, constitute high risk behaviors.” The statement continues, “as with all CMU community members, [Grenell] must comply with our COVID policies if he is going to come to campus or engage with other members of the community in person,” including a 14-day quarantine prior to arrival on-campus, the practice of physical distancing, and the use of a facial covering. “We are not aware of him being on campus or engaging with community members in person,” Maderer said.
When asked about Grenell’s unsubstantiated claims about the election, Director of IPS Kiron Skinner told The Tartan in a statement, “Like all CMU employees, the Institute for Politics and Strategy faculty and staff are free to engage in political activity on their own time.""
Richard Grenell did not immediately respond to request for comment on this story.

2021-03-08,CMU,China,"In an email on Thursday, Feb. 25, Provost Jim Garrett announced that Dr. Kiron Skinner has decided to step down as director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Politics and Strategy (CMU IPS). As its inaugural director, she was instrumental in the creation and development of IPS and the degree-granting programs it offers. She has also directed the Center for International Relations and Politics, Carnegie Mellon University’s Washington Semester Program, and the Institute for Strategic Analysis. Thanking her for her contributions, Garrett noted that she will continue to serve as the Taube Professor for international relations and politics.
He wrote in the announcement, addressed to faculty, staff, and students of IPS, that she made this decision to “enable increased focus on the completion of two books currently in process, her work with The Heritage Foundation on an Atlantic Strategy initiative, and her involvement with the newly formed Forum for America and the World.” Skinner declined a request for an interview for this article. 
This move came weeks after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that she is considering running as a Republican for Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate seat in 2022. A well-known academic, especially in conservative circles, Skinner had served as a member of former President Trump’s national security transition team in 2016. She also worked on the presidential campaigns of former President George W. Bush, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) when he was Governor of Massachusetts.
Skinner had previously taken leave of her post at Carnegie Mellon in September 2018 to work in the Trump administration’s State Department as director of Policy Planning, a move she termed as her “first real deep dive into government.” She worked on advancing former President Trump’s “America First” foreign policy agenda and diversifying the State Department. However, she returned to campus in less than a year after being dismissed from the State Department, which Politico reported was due to allegations of an “abusive” management style. Anonymous State Department sources alleged that she made homophobic comments, accused people of having affairs, and abused her authority, all charges that Skinner denied. In an interview with The Tartan, she characterized some of the reporting as “out of context” and denied making any homophobic remarks. She claimed that most of the internal conflict had stemmed from her big plans for the Office of Policy Planning. She also noted that no official State Department investigation has been made prior to her departure. Several high-profile diplomats and colleagues, including some at Carnegie Mellon, came to her defense over these reports.
In October 2019, some current and former IPS students spoke to The Tartan under the condition of anonymity about the circumstances around her dismissal from the State Department, and expressed mixed feelings about her return to Carnegie Mellon University and disappointment at her controversial remarks on China. 
More recently, Skinner has come under scrutiny for her appointment of former Ambassador to Germany and Acting Director of National Intelligence in the Trump administration Richard Grenell as a senior fellow at IPS, which sparked swift backlash among students and faculty members. The announcement of the appointment in June 2020 was met with condemnation as many felt that Grenell’s highly divisive rhetoric had no place at Carnegie Mellon. As calls increased to rescind the appointment, including signed petitions from thousands of students and hundreds of faculty members, Skinner released a statement defending her department’s decision, citing her commitment to “intellectual diversity.” In an interview with The Tartan, elaborating on her department’s decision to hire Grenell, she stated that she hired Grenell not for his viewpoints but because of his background. She also explained that it is standard to bring former government officials into academia, a practice that is now being scrutinized as universities face pressure to vet ex-officials from the Trump administration. The controversy surrounding his hiring reignited, drawing local and national press coverage, after the 2020 presidential election when Grenell started spreading election misinformation about voter fraud after Trump’s defeat. 
On Jan. 7, the day after the Capitol Hill riots, Skinner sent an email to colleagues who expressed their disappointment at a press release that IPS put out congratulating Grenell on being awarded the National Security Medal on the same day of the riots. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that when presented with Grenell’s false claims about the election, she wrote that “Many people are seeing different facts and parts of the story about what happened in each state” in an email chain, redacted screenshots of which were leaked on the Overlooked at Carnegie Mellon Facebook group. While she conceded that she had made “process fouls"" in terms of the timing of the press release, she rejected claims that Grenell’s incendiary tweets could have had an effect on the Capitol Hill violence. She also did not respond to the questions in the email chain on whether she believes Biden won (she admitted later that she believes Biden won when pressed in an interview by The Chronicle of Higher Education).
In the announcement email about Skinner stepping down, Garrett wrote that Carnegie Mellon University and Skinner “remain unwavering in their commitment to the mission of IPS and to fostering an environment where all viewpoints and the free exchange of ideas are welcomed as the bedrock of our academic community.” He also announced that Dr. Mark Kamlet, university professor of economics and public policy and provost emeritus, will assume interim leadership of IPS..

2021-10-25,CMU,China,"We are motivated to speak following many dismaying reactions to the GSA's March 8, 2021 statement within the Carnegie Mellon University community. We recognize that the specifics of the GSA's statement are divisive and the tastefulness of many aspects are debatable. We are alarmed, however, by larger trends within Carnegie Mellon which were illustrated by this incident — specifically the perceived punishments for discussing the on-going atrocities in East Turkestan (aka Xinjiang), and the widely expressed denial of these occurrences. Our central concern is ensuring truth, representation, and awareness continue to evolve at Carnegie Mellon, and that none of these pillars be stifled by any crowd reaction, no matter the size. To this end, we stand behind the following:
To the extent that the international community knows anything about events in the world over the last several decades, we acknowledge that the events mentioned in the third paragraph of the GSA's statement are true and accurately reported. 
Of particular note, we recognize that there are systematic attempts to push the Uighur people and distinct cultures of East Turkestan into extinction — facts that could imply a cultural genocide and exploitation of an ethnicity for forced labor (for instance, [2 - 25]). The seriousness of these claims requires complete frankness in any community which dedicates itself to diversity, equity, inclusion, and general human rights. Members of Carnegie Mellon’s community must, at a minimum, continue to discuss these verified stories and spread cognizance of these issues. Not only are discourse and growth of understanding in line with the foundational values that any legitimate university should have, they are essential to ensure that all members of our community — especially those whose own lives are being radically reshuffled by the events cited — are not disserved by silence at Carnegie Mellon.
We are gravely concerned that recent reactions to the GSA's statement at Carnegie Mellon give a false message that those who speak supporting these reports’ veracity will face consequences, regardless of whether that signal was intentionally sent or not. Many reactions we observed have included vocal and deeply disturbing denials of facts — troubling responses which at best result from lack of prior informedness regarding the distressing accounts. In the face of these reactions and their magnitude, we believe that our statement — and continued efforts by Carnegie Mellon’s members, organizations, and administration — are adequate steps to ensure that the growing seeds of awareness and discourse are not stomped out.
Carnegie Mellon can, and should, lead by example in fostering a dynamic academic environment conducive to its core values and hopes — principles also broadly held by its community. We make our statement to aid in that pursuit, in order to counter fears which promote stagnation, increase silence, disserve underrepresented members of our community, and otherwise run counter to the core values of the university. Neither silence nor ignorance are virtuous, productive, or kind — they are often the default and easiest paths. It is up to all of us at Carnegie Mellon to ensure these are not the paths taken, especially when confronted by serious events that stand entirely antithetical to human dignity.
To sum up, this resolution by the Turkish Student Society (TUSO) and the Iranian Student Association (ISA) at Carnegie Mellon University calls on all members of this prestigious institution to recognize and denounce racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance in all their incarnations — and particularly in the outrageous forms being executed in East Turkestan.
Appendix: Referenced Material and Brief Overview of Claims
Reports of human right abuses in East Turkestan (aka Xinjiang) have been raised by numerous independent media outlets and international organizations, spanning multiple countries and cultural spheres. Reports cover an astonishingly wide range of practices apparently geared toward the erasure of the Uighur ethnicity and cultural identity, including, but not limited to: forced sterilization; forced abortion; involuntary reeducation camps for adults and children; forced labor; systematic rape and torture; mass surveillance; separating Uighur children from their extended families, including by involuntary adoption; compulsory housing of government overseers in Uighur family homes to enforce anti-religious, pro-party customs; thinning of the regional Uighur population density by coerced relocation to elsewhere across China; systematic attempts to erode Islam in East Turkestan by banning attendance of mosque, religious head-garb, and traditional phrases with religious etymologies (e.g., as-salamu alaykum), as well as compulsory consumption of haram nutriments (e.g., pork and alcohol); and destruction of mosques and landmarks indicative of the local cultures in East Turkestan.

2021-11-15,CMU,China,"Just two weekends are left ahead of the International Skating Union’s (ISU) 2021-22 Grand Prix Final (GPF). With the conclusion of the 2021 NHK Trophy held in Tokyo, Japan, only the Internationaux de France and Rostelecom Cup are left in the series. The majority of Grand Prix Final places are still up in the air, and athletes will be vying for them over the next couple weeks. However, a few standout skaters have already earned enough points to solidify their place in the tournament.
In the men’s singles category, Japan’s Shoma Uno, alongside Americans Vincent Zhou and Nathan Chen, have secured Grand Prix Final qualification. Uno and Zhou, both having garnered 28 points, mirrored each other’s performances, with Zhou taking gold and Uno taking silver at Skate America back in October; before Uno went on to take gold as Zhou took silver at last week’s NHK Trophy.  Chen, with 26 points, put on an uncharacteristic performance at Skate America, finishing third behind Uno and Zhou, but Chen made a spectacular comeback the following week at Skate Canada, scoring over 300 points and solidifying his spot in the Grand Prix Final. Neither Uno nor Chen are strangers to the Grand Prix Final, with both athletes set to make their fifth appearance at the tournament, but Zhou will make his Grand Prix Final debut. Chen, having won the competition the last three years, will be looking to defend his title as Uno looks to dethrone him. Despite this being his first time competing at the Grand Prix Final, Vincent Zhou is not an athlete to write off, given his commendable performance this year.
Cha Jun-hwan of Korea and Makar Ignatov of Russia are both in qualifying positions with 18 points each after placing third and fourth at the NHK Trophy, respectively. But with Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama (15 points), American Jason Brown (13 points), and Russian Mikhail Kolyada (13 points) all slated to compete in the next two weeks — Kagiyama and Brown in the Internationaux de France and Kolyada in the Rostelecom Cup — neither Cha nor Ignatov are secure in their qualification status. In the likely scenario that Kagiyama, Brown, and Kolyada all finish in fifth place or better in their respective competitions, these three athletes will join Uno, Zhou, and Chen at the Grand Prix Final.
Qualification for the Grand Prix Final in the women’s singles category is still completely up in the air, with no guaranteed qualifiers. As it stands, Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto leads the pack with 24 points following her gold medal performance at the NHK Trophy, followed by You Young of Korea with silver last week and 22 points total, Japan’s Mai Mihara with 18 points, and American Alysa Liu with 16. With Russians Anna Shcherbakova (15 points), Kamila Valieva (15 points), Elizaveta Tuktamysheva (13 points), and Maiia Khromykh (13 points) set to compete — the latter three in the Rostelecom Cup and the former in the Internationaux de France — among other athletes, it is still anybody’s game.
China’s Sui Wenjing and Han Cong have dominated the pairs field, winning gold at both Skate Canada and the Gran Premio d’Italia for a total of 30 points and guaranteed qualification for the Grand Prix Final. Russians Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov have also guaranteed their qualification, following closely behind with 28 points thanks to a gold at Skate America and a silver last week at the NHK Trophy. Japan’s Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara trail with 24 points, as do Americans Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc with 20. Qualification for these two pairs is likely, but still not set in stone.
Four Russian pairs will be vying to knock the current qualifiers down the rankings for a spot in the Grand Prix Final. Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov (15 points), Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin (13 points), Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (11 points), and Iuliia Artemeva and Mikhail Nazarychev (11 points) will all be looking to better their positions across the next two weeks’ competitions in order to skate in Osaka come December.While the chances of either of the latter two pairs making the Grand Prix Final is low, all four of these pairs continue to pose threats to Miura and Kihara, as well as Cain-Gribble and LeDuc.
Americans Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donahue are the only current guaranteed qualifiers in ice dance, with a gold at Skate America and a silver at the Gran Premio d’Italia, totaling 28 points for the pair. Trailing just behind are Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates with 26 points, who  successfully supplemented their second-place performance at Skate America with another silver last week, as well as Spaniards Olivia Smart and Adrián Díaz, with 20 points, and Americans Caroline Green and Michael Parsons with 16.
While Chock and Bates will likely qualify for the Grand Prix Final, neither Smart and Díaz nor Green and Parsons can be confident in their position. French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron (15 points), Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier (15 points), Russians Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov (15 points), and Italians Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri (13 points) are all presently scheduled to compete in another competition. It is relatively likely that one or more of these pairs will be able to overtake the current second- and third-placed qualifiers to earn a place in the Grand Prix Final.
With Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu out of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating after an ankle ligament injury forced him to withdraw from the 2021 NHK Trophy last week, it looks like we will probably be seeing a clash between Shoma Uno, Vincent Zhou, and Nathan Chen for this year’s Grand Prix Final men’s singles gold. In pairs, Sui Wenjing and Han Cong will be looking to keep up their momentum and stave off Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov. Ice dance faces a similar situation, as Hubbell and Donahue head into the tournament with Chock and Bates hot on their heels. With women’s singles being the sole category where no athlete has guaranteed their Grand Prix Final qualification, it will be interesting to see how things shape up for these skaters in the next two weeks..

2021-11-22,CMU,China,"With the conclusion of the 2021 Internationaux de France, the 2021-22 International Skating Union (ISU) Grand Prix of Figure Skating is approaching its climax: the ISU Grand Prix Final, scheduled to take place in Osaka, Japan during the second week of December.
Yuma Kagiyama of Japan won his second gold of the series, recording both the highest short program score and the highest free skate score to finish over 20 points ahead of his closest competitor. Having also won the Gran Premio d’Italia earlier this month, Kagiyama moves into the top qualifying position for men’s singles with a total of 30 points, ahead of fellow countryman Shoma Uno and American Vincent Zhou. With Kagiyama, Uno, Zhou, and American Nathan Chen guaranteed to appear in the Grand Prix Final, just two spots remain in the men’s singles category.
American Jason Brown is sitting in the fifth position with 24 points after the Internationaux de France, with Shun Sato of Japan closely behind with 22 points. Neither are fully secure in their current position, however, with Russians Mikhail Kolyada (13 points) and Evgeni Semenenko (11 points) scheduled to compete this week in the Rostelecom Cup. Brown is in a relatively safer spot, as there are only two scenarios where he does not qualify for the Grand Prix Final: either Semenenko winning gold at the Rostelecom Cup as well as Kolyada winning silver, or Kolyada winning gold at the Rostelecom Cup while Semenenko wins silver and puts up a combined score higher than 267.74 points (over nine points better than his current personal best combined-score of 258.45). In contrast, Sato’s chances of making the Grand Prix Final are slim to none. Either a podium finish by Kolyada or a top-two finish by Semenenko at the Rostelecom Cup — both likely events — would displace the Japanese athlete. With Kolyada performing well in recent competition and poised to win gold at the Rostelecom Cup, it seems likely that it will be Kolyada and Brown who join Kagiyama, Uno, Zhou, and Chen in Osaka in December.
In women’s singles, Russian Anna Shcherbakova dominated both the short program and the free skate to win gold. Having also placed first in the Gran Premio d’Italia, she becomes the top qualifier in her category with 30 points. Kaori Sakamoto of Japan’s gold medal performance at the NHK trophy proves to be enough, as she is also now guaranteed to qualify for the Grand Prix Final with 24 points. Russian Alena Kostornaia, having finished second at the Internationaux de France, also sits at 24 points, but her qualification is not guaranteed, as is the situation with You Young of Korea (22 points) and Mai Mihara of Japan (18 points), trailing closely behind.
Russians Kamila Valieva (15 points), Elizaveta Tuktamysheva (13 points), and Maya Khromykh (13 points), as well as Belgian Loena Hendrickx (11 points), are all slated to compete this weekend. With Valieva and Tuktamysheva having gone one-two at Skate Canada, it is likely that these two athletes will perform similarly at the Rostelecom Cup. Khromykh and Hendrickx placed second and third, respectively, at the Gran Premio d’Italia, and are certainly fierce competitors as well. With this being the case, it is unlikely for either Mihara or Young to retain their qualifying positions. If either Tuktamysheva, Khromykh, or Hendrickx win gold at the Rostelecom, Kostornaia will likely not be able to qualify for the Grand Prix Final, as is the case should Valieva take gold, Khromykh the silver, and Tuktamysheva the bronze at the Rostelecom Cup. If Khromykh takes bronze and Tuktamysheva takes silver, it will likely come down to a comparison between Tuktamysheva and Kostornaia’s combined scores across both of their assignments. For women’s singles, it is likely that the lineup in Osaka will be Shcherbakova, Valieva, Sakamoto, Tuktamysheva, Kostornaia, and either Khromykh or Hendrickx.
Russian pair Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (26 points) join fellow countrymen Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov (28 points), as well as China’s Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (30 points) in guaranteeing their Grand Prix Final qualification after a gold medal performance at the Internationaux de France. Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara of Japan, as well as Russia’s Iuliia Artemeva and Mikhail Nazarychev trail close behind at 24 points, followed by Americans Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, and Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc at 22 points.
It seems unlikely for either American pair to make the Grand Prix Final, with Russian pairs Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov (15 points) and Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin (13 points), as well as Italians Nicole Della Monica and Matteo Guarise (9 points) set to compete at the Rostelecom Cup. Unless Della Monica and Guarise put on a gold medal performance while the two Russian pairs take silver and bronze, Miura and Kihara, as well as Artemeva and Nazarychev, will qualify for the Grand Prix Final. In all likelihood, the pairs appearing in Osaka in December will be Sui and Han, Tarasova and Morozov, Boikova and Kozlovskii, Mishina and Galliamov, Pavliuchenko and Khodykin, and Miura and Kihara.
In the ice dance category, French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron put up a fantastic performance at the Internationaux de France, placing first in both the rhythm dance and the free dance to win gold. With a total of 30 points, they become the top qualifiers for the Grand Prix Final in ice dance. Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier took silver and also guaranteed qualification with a total of 28 points. The Canadians sit shoulder to shoulder with Americans Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donahue, who guaranteed their qualification with a gold medal performance at Skate America, followed by a silver at the Gran Premio d’Italia.
Fellow Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates trail right behind with 26 points, followed by Russian pair Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin (22 points) and Spaniards Olivia Smart and Adrián Díaz (20 points). With Russians Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov (15 points), Italians Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri (13 points), and Canadians Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sørensen (11 points) still set to compete at the Rostelecom Cup this weeken. However, it is unlikely for the former three pairs to all qualify for the Grand Prix Final. While Chock and Bates are likely to retain a qualifying position (the only scenario in which they do not qualify hinging on the unlikely scenario of Beaudry and Sørensen winning gold at the Rostelecom Cup while the other two pairs medal), Sinitsina and Katsalapov, as well as Guignard and Marco Fabbri, will almost certainly perform well enough to overtake Stepanova and Bukin, and Smart and Díaz. For ice dance, the Grand Prix Final qualifiers will likely be Papadakis and Cizeron, Hubbell and Donahue, Gilles and Poirier, Sinitsina and Katsalapov, Guignard and Marco Fabbri, and Chock and Bates.
With only the Rostelecom Cup left in this year’s Grand Prix series, it will certainly be interesting to see which athletes will excel and surpass their competitors to claim the last qualifying spots for the ISU Grand Prix Final..

2022-01-30,CMU,China,"Despite the competitive nature intrinsic to the Olympic Games, shared excitement surrounding the event stokes a sense of international unity. Across the globe, billions of eyes are peeled to screens boasting athletic feats so impressive fans are likely to curb their national pride and watch in awe, untethered. The delirium surrounding the 2022 Games may drown its most critical component: China is hosting. 
Human Rights Watch reported that China’s Communist Party “sees human rights as an existential threat.” And they have the track record to prove it. CCP leader Xi Jinping has enforced militant rule via constant surveillance, stringent censorship, travel restraints, historical erasure, unexplained disappearances, mass incarceration, forced sterilization, systematic rape, labor camps, and reported genocide. 
After accusing a public official of sexual abuse in November, a tennis star disappeared, resurfaced, and retracted the assault claim. A Hong Kong news site was shut down last month to accommodate Beijing’s agitprop standards. The indoctrination, torture, and murder of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is state-sanctioned. 
The U.S. joined several other countries in diplomatic boycotts against the Beijing Games, yet Xi remains confident. The upcoming Games, he says, “demonstrate [China's] commitment to building a community with a shared future for mankind.”
Pray that that future — replete with human rights abuses — does not come to fruition. Pray and, more importantly, boycott. Viewers are vital stakeholders more than ever before because no tickets are available for the 2022 Games. Pandemic precautions mean that visibility and revenue are only possible through television screenings.
Broadcasting rights comprise 73 percent of the International Olympic Committee’s funding; they are beholden to broadcasting services. If viewership plummets this year, broadcasting companies will be loath to invest as much in future Games. This, in turn, incentivizes the IOC to hold host countries to a higher humanitarian standard. If viewership does not drop, the IOC has no reason to change. 
Xi wants to put on a show, but no one is making you watch. Tuning into the Olympics is an active choice. Is an hour of speed skating worth rewarding China with your attention? If you believe in our democracy enough to vote, then believe in human rights enough to boycott. Whether by vote or view, our choices are powerful. 
Though watching the Games can be fun, missing its coverage is not by any means catastrophic. Xi’s increasingly violent authoritarianism is. There are plenty of alternatives to sate your winter sports cravings. Scour Netflix, watch past Games, experience the sport for yourself. 
The 2022 Games are part of Xi’s broader campaign to bulldoze rights concerns. He’s seen plenty of success; even missteps that have been felt across the globe have been grossly downplayed. Recall late 2019, when doctors in Wuhan noticed something was wrong. Too many infections, too many deaths, all happening too fast. What was going on? Nothing, the government said. “Hospital leaders refused to authorize masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) because it would cause panic,” wrote Annie Sparrow in a Foreign Policy report. “Hospital leaders insisted that spread among humans was impossible — that no staff members were infected — even altering diagnoses that suggested otherwise.” Doctors who documented the virus disappeared. 
When evidence of COVID-19 became indisputable, CCP leaders announced that they had vaccines with incredible efficacy. Except they didn’t. Case counts continue to be falsely reported, and why shouldn’t they be? The consequences imposed on China for its COVID-19 policies — and the havoc it has wreaked — are negligible. Pandemic dishonesty has been swept into the corner of international conscious, entangled somewhere between dictatorship and genocide. 
Over a quarter of the world watched the last Winter Games. Activists hope that percentage plunges this year. “We postponed the Olympics for a pandemic,”  Tibetan activist and Mount Holyoke student Tsela Zoksang said. “I don’t see why we can’t postpone for genocide.”
Amidst the severity and scope of China’s human rights abuses, it may seem impossible for individual intervention. But action is simple: Boycott the Beijing Games..

2022-02-07,CMU,China,"It is surreal that in 2022, the United States is closer than ever to the brink of war with Russia, but here we are. There’s not much to really think about at this point. Russia has placed thousands of soldiers at the Ukrainian border, intelligence reports are warning of an imminent invasion, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is building up deterrence and defense capabilities in Eastern Europe, and potential NATO expansion is now the big flashpoint that could very well lead us into war. Putin has the support of Xi Jinping on the matter, with Xi publicly opposing NATO expansion in solidarity with Putin. Deep down, every war hawk in the United States is cheering internally while panicking externally, likely feeling vindicated for sticking with their harsh, incessant rhetoric for years. 
Great power competition has made its return, a relic of an era that many don’t truly know because they weren’t born yet or they’ve just forgotten about it by now. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States didn’t exactly know what to do with its place in the world as the only major power left. Foreign policy and war doctrines evolved over the next decade until the next major shock: 9/11. From there, the U.S. cultivated troops into a counterinsurgency force and explored other forms of warfare that were more suited for conflicts with non-state actors. This allowed the U.S. to intervene in other countries’ affairs with a greater degree of efficiency that didn’t require total occupation (but opted for total occupation twice anyway). Of course, counterinsurgency was a mixed bag with many more negatives than positives, but before Americans had time to really reckon with the consequences of that era, interstate power competition has begun to rear its head once again. 
With this, Americans really have to grapple with how interconnected everything is. The United States is in an awful spot domestically. Between book burnings in Tennessee, rising rates of crime and costs of living, homelessness, debt, and callous politicians more interested in their paycheck and power than fixing issues impacting millions of Americans, fighting a war may look like it doesn’t alleviate those issues. That’s because it doesn’t. War is a form of foreign policy, albeit the most destructive option. If Americans are choosing to fight a war, it isn’t just for power. It’s for survival, too. But the motives for survival are hard to discern when Americans have been watching their government fight so many pointless wars and intervene in so many conflicts to seemingly no avail for decades. 
There are two ideas fundamentally at conflict with each other in U.S. foreign policy. On one hand, Americans want strong relationships and commitments with their allies, an idyllic international system that is beneficial for all who take part in it. On the other hand, Americans want to be the leader of that international system because then they get to shape how people take part in it and put down all those who oppose that system or don't implement the values of the international system the way that the U.S. sees fit. During the Cold War, the U.S. committed atrocities and undermined sovereignties constantly while preaching about how atrocities are bad and sovereignty is good. But ultimately, the collapse of the Soviet Union was vindication for everything the U.S. had done, even if the collapse of the Soviet Union had less to do with U.S. foreign policy and more to do with the Soviet Union’s decaying social and economic conditions through the 1970s and 1980s.
Through the 1990s and the U.S. counterinsurgency era, the American government refined its Cold War-era strategies. Since the Soviet Union, the main power threatening American hegemony, was gone, new opportunities emerged for the U.S. to push even further in its goal to become the ambitious leader of the world. Technological breakthroughs and economic imperialism accelerated this process, and 9/11 sealed the deal by adding even more heavy-handed nationalistic sentiments and reactionary political ideals into the mix. 
Now, in 2022, this ambition is being tested in a way that the U.S. has never quite experienced before. The U.S. is no longer the only major economic, technological, or military power. Both the U.S. and its allies have key economic and military partnerships with those rival powers like China and Russia. The U.S. government has willingly shown that it will fight conflicts that don’t need to be fought and engage in nation-building efforts to keep the United States' strategic positioning, continuing to posture themselves as world leaders. Failure to act on this new flashpoint with Ukraine wouldn’t just be a blow to whatever little bit of credibility we have left after our disastrous counterinsurgency era. It would be the final straw to break the hypocritical camel’s back, fully exposing the U.S. as the selfish, egotistical, short-sighted, and reactionary empire that it is.
To be quite honest, I don’t think a lot of Americans will know or understand what to do. Even world leaders don’t know what the best strategy is. The U.S. is truly in dark, murky waters right now, and another war is the last thing people (or at least a good number of people) want. I certainly am one of them. None of us know how this is going to play out, but we have to be ready. Looking at the course of history, war has always been a part of its development. Most of history has been shaped by wars. The U.S. was created by wars, too, whether it was for expansion or survival. Americans can try all they want to move past it with modern sensibilities on peace, conflict, violence, and human rights, but this sensibility is coming too little too late. 
Situations like the current predicament with Russia and Ukraine were what America’s alliances, international structures, and foreign policy apparatus were meant to avoid, and whatever Americans do here is going to define the future. The ideal situation is that Russia doesn’t invade Ukraine and the U.S. is able to negotiate another deal with them that would respect Ukrainian sovereignty while acknowledging and addressing both Russia’s and Ukraine’s security concerns, as well as ours. The world rarely works in the ideal way. If Russia does invade and the U.S.-led NATO acts, there will be a war which is deadly, costly, and awful for everyone involved. But if there is no action, then the modern  values that have defined international affairs since World War II will truly mean nothing, and it will make the imperialist strategies and visions of U.S. rivals bolder. No matter what your opinion is on the role of the U.S. in the world, I don’t think any American reading this is going to be ready to live in a world where the U.S. isn’t the dominant power, even its most vocal critics. It’s something that is taken for granted, and Americans are now in a lose-lose situation where every option leads to some undesirable outcome. The U.S. is officially at Russia’s mercy, and all Americans can do is hope their government doesn’t mess the situation up further. .

2022-02-14,CMU,China,"If we take a step back and analyze the pandemic-accelerated supply chain shocks, we can see that they were inevitable. In the specific context of semiconductors (integrated circuits/transistors/processing units), the disruptions to the fabrication process have demonstrated the need to explicitly define the intersection of innovation and interests. The discussion needs to shift from “semiconductors are vital to everyday life” toward a more grounded realism. Every step of the fabrication process, from the design to diffusion, presents unique challenges that require more nuanced discourse in the public policy sphere.
Investment in more advanced domestic semiconductor fabrication should be mainstream, particularly when discussing strategic competition with countries like the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Trade wars and military buildup do not exist in a vacuum of instrumental modality. Semiconductors, both their capabilities and security, are vital components of communications networks, imagery and reconnaissance satellites, threat detection networks, naval ships, and of course, smart refrigerators. For this reason, the Department of Defense  awarded Intel  a contract to develop, in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), new structured application-specific integrated circuits for more efficient and secure military-use microelectronics.
However, that partnership represents only a fraction of the total amount of secure microelectronics and networks that the military, and other agencies, utilize. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces the most advanced processors that guide Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lighting II and supplies other manufacturers such as Xilinx  (freshly acquired by AMD). For several CPU architecture generations now, Intel has been falling behind in node technology compared to TSMC, specifically for desktop and server-grade processors. As modern capabilities require more computational power, strategic competition with the PRC continues to unfold in the military technology space.
It is critical that we continue investment in more advanced semiconductor technology to stay ahead of hardware vulnerabilities that stagnant development presents. In 2018, the public became aware of security vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre, raising discussions about the penetration process and payload type. While the impact of these vulnerabilities is undetermined, it is well-known that malicious actors can exploit a processor’s internal buffers to extract encrypted information and keys. Aging military technology and the vast quantities of equipment that can store encrypted information mean that potential targets and exploits are likely more numerous than mainstream discourse suggests.
Within this context, I argue that current partnership programs and Congressional funding for domestic semiconductor fabrication are woefully inadequate in addressing the impact of sourcing the majority of electronic and circuit components from Taiwan, which has been subject to constant encroachment by mainland China. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act fails to address the timeframe in which its lofty ambitions fall subject. Although passed by Congress last January, the act has yet to authorize any funding for the programs laid out in its mandates. As I mentioned previously, Intel is years behind the bleeding-edge node technology that TSMC has made readily available at the consumer level. For example, Intel has finally transitioned from nearly a decade of 14 nanometer FinFET technology to 10 nanometer (which is conveniently labeled Intel 7) whilst TSMC enters the final phases of its risk production of three nanometer node technology. Intel designs and manufactures its own semiconductors, whilst TSMC supplies the physical die to fabless companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). All these discussions continue as Congress has yet to agree on how to actually allocate funds to the programs designed to alleviate the issues I highlight.
The one element that permits this lengthy and ongoing discussion is the fact that China has yet to successfully produce highly-advanced semiconductor technology domestically. It has largely been forced to import the more advanced processors from the US and has significantly invested into the design, testing, and diffusion of semiconductors that are beyond the low-level logic chips that it currently produces in bulk. And yet, that certainly is not to say that the current state of domestic semiconductor production in the U.S. can continue indefinitely. It is time for Washington to seriously consider the future of its capabilities through the lithography of advanced computing..

2022-02-28,CMU,China,"prologue
When my grandmother went to Egypt, the third time, she brought me back a tiny golden camel statue. If you open the hump on its back, you won’t find water, but air. A place to place a diamond or two. A ring, a ten cent Euro. Or, in my case, a tiny scrap of paper from a notepad with an owl motif. 
That paper was blank when I first put it in there, as is my memory when I try to recall that date. But I put it on a shelf high above my head, allowing the camel to watch me grow. Allowing it to observe the passage of time. Now, I know what you’re thinking. Being the only child in the house made me lonely, but never that lonely. I mean, I never personified the gift, assigning it the role of a sentinel. But I did give it an even greater responsibility, which was keeping my own growth a secret from my future self.
“You keep what in the souvenir I brought to you from Egypt?” my grandmother would absolutely say if I ever told her about the tendency I have—you know, the one that involves periodically opening the camel’s back, removing the scrap of paper, signing it with a sentence of encouragement and the date on the calendar, and putting it back in its hideaway, after it is perfectly folded, of course? That one?  
I don’t know why it started, but I do know the most recent time, not the last time, I climbed up on my bed frame to retrieve it. Today. I wrote on that paper today. Just as I have been writing on it since circa 2015. 
This tendency is weird, and I will not be surprised if I go my whole life without finding anyone else who does anything like this. I feel as if I am trying to describe a concept so familiar, yet because the context exists only on the pinpoint of my identity, it feels impossible to articulate. But I want myself to remember who I am. More importantly, I want myself to remember who I was. Where I’ve been, what I’ve been through. The mundane. The altering. And if anyone decides to dust that shelf one day, or if anyone decides to get a closer look at that golden souvenir, then I suppose that they’ll get to remember, too. 
The truth is, I’ve gone merely twenty years existing on the same plane of other human beings who also have the ability to remember who I am, and each interaction I have had could fill a million souvenir camels, and then some.

My friends just huddled around me in our design studio, trying to decipher the agricultural symbols on my turtleneck. Should I tell them that I only bought it at Goodwill because I thought it was a Christmas sweater?
How many of these moments do you want to remember? Seriously, I’m asking. How many trees have you carved your initials into, just to prove you’ve stood under its branches? How many times have you taken a polaroid and written the date in the blank space below? Or, better yet, jumped in the background of a random group’s picture, just to include yourself in their memory of their good friend’s birthday dinner? It’s all wet cement, these moments in time, and these actions are our handprints that we just have to press into the ground before it dries. And that camel of mine is no different. 
something to remember me by
When I evacuate this place for the last time, not the first. When I follow the road signs, the blue circular metal, that help me seek higher ground—a ground so high, I’ll never have to come back down again. Traveling inward. Running like the wind and the water to somewhere high and dry. Not a roof, not a mountaintop. Some place higher, but not too high so I can still see the flood make a river out of a road. That fervor is something I’ll have to see. 
And after it’s all over, no matter how little water is still pooled in the potholes of the pavement, I won’t be coming back again. I probably won’t even continue to stare. Instead, I’ll wonder. Will you stand on my doorstep? Will you spray paint an X on my wall? 
What will you look for? What will you find?
When I evaporate with the water, when I blow in the breeze with the birdsong, I’ll visit your windowsill with the warmth of the Sun. I’ll tap dance on your tin roof, then sit on the horizon line to give my legs a break. Perhaps on that bench, the one the lake and sky made for me in a mindless collaboration, I’ll open a book or five, and never finish any of them. They’ll just sit on my bedside table with pressed flowers for bookmarks, turning more into decorations with each passing day. 
Maybe that’s what you’ll find: those unfinished books of mine.
When I burn like paper in the heat of July, I’ll rise with the smoke and billow in the sky. I’ll hang there for a while, until your chimney smoke meets me on a night in November. I’ll lay on my back, gazing at the atmosphere as an outstretched cloud, until the sunset uses my back as a canvas. I hope you’ll step outside and watch as I turn pink and blue. The most beautiful artifact hovering above your eyes. And I pray you find it: the miraculous halo of a cotton candy sky.
When I dissolve like spun sugar that lands on your tongue, I’ll stay and listen for the laughter in your tears. I’ll listen for words I’ve never heard before, and if my curiosity piques, maybe I’ll begin to use them, too. I’ll fill my senses with your sentences about tonight’s lasagna and tomorrow’s worries, and I’ll look at the world through the gaps in your teeth, and it’ll still be as beautiful as it was from above. It’ll be just as confusing and dangerous and maddening and bare. 
But it won’t be silent.
So when these words dance on your lips as you read them to yourself, your voice will fill the world. And I’ll float out with each consonant and comma, drifting to my highest point—my final point—feeling perfectly content that I was able to leave you with something to remember me by..

2022-02-28,CMU,China,"Ukranians were jarred awake at 4 a.m. local time by the trembling of tanks and the explosions from rockets, as the Russian government dropped all pretenses and launched an invasion of their smaller neighbor. Troops entered from the previously annexed Crimea, aiming for Mariupol in the South and Belarus from the North, to conquer the capital, Kyiv. Battles have begun in other areas, including the rather ominous region of Chernobyl. The existence of the Ukrainian state may soon cease, and as the international community watches on, the question emerges: ""Why did this conflict, and its four-month-long build-up, arise at all?"" If you look at speeches from Putin, you will get answers ranging from “the denazification of the country” to anger at the fact that NATO “encroaches on Russian borders”; however, the true answer is found from a rambling speech he gave a couple of days before the invasion, reiterated once again during the declaration of war, where he stated that Ukraine never really “existed” and instead is rightfully a province of Russia. One may question the merit of these claims, and, unsurprisingly, they have no merit whatsoever.
What would become Ukraine during early antiquity was a site where Greeks, Slavs and — later during classical times — Romans and Proto-Iranians (Cimmeranians, Scythians, etc.) interacted. During the early medieval era, the Hunnic and Turkic migrations greatly reshaped the east of the region that would later be Ukraine, while new groups of Slavs migrated from Carpathia (around modern-day Romania) into the Northern and Central part of the region. This arrangement was upended by the exploits of the Varangian Rurik and his Slavic viking syncretic state the Kievan Rus.  Occupying the Dnieper influenced a choke point between the Baltic-Byzantine trade route, this quasi-tribal meritocratic trade federation became the major power in eastern Europe, ruling from the Baltics to Crimea, and the concurrent source of pride for both Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. Trade shifted, steppe wars weakened the polity, and the Mongols brought the death knell to the Kyivans with the synecdochic city’s sacking in 1240. 
After the Mongols fractured in the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania (which united soon after) and the Crimean Khanate divided the region amongst themselves, sparking a period of foreign rule within the region. Migration into the region began from Poles, Armenians, Germans, and Jews. Regional autonomy waned, as the Polonization of the Ruthenian (pre-Ukrainian) nobility began to occur, which along with the deterioration of the peasants' conditions, caused discontent within the region. The most interesting consequence of this was the failed attempt to reconcile local Orhtodox traditions with the Polish promulgated Catholic Church, and the rise of another set of powerful horsemen, the Cossacks. 
Arising from the south of the Dnieper in their Sich (stronghold), now referred to as Zaporizhzhya, these “adventurers” were peasants tired of subjugation and disaffected wanderers from the nobility and burgher classes, who signed agreements of mutual protection with local nomadic groups (i.e. Cuman descendants) and one another, and elected their local leader, or Hetmans. These Cossacks fought against Tartar invaders, and for their democratic values against the encroaching monarchical authoritarian Muscovian Grand Principality (who would later become Russia). They joined the Orthodox brotherhood of Kyiv in 1620, and sparked a cultural revival that would lead to the Kyvian Mohyla Academy’s establishment, Ukraine First University. Khmelnytsky, a Cossack Hetman, caused a major war within the region in order to redress his grievances with the Polish Monarchy. In the process he established the roots for an independent Cossack-headed Ukrainian state, but incompetence from his successor would lead to the partition of the region between the Left and Right Banks of the Dneiper. While the Left Bank closed in on Muscovy, and saw it as “Little Russia,” the Right Bank tried to remain independent, before succumbing to Poland, and later Russia, who took all of Ukraine after late 18th Century Polish partitions. 
Russian domination over Ukraine would cause the rise of the city of Odessa, intermigrations from other parts of the empire, the disastrous Crimean war where Western Europe decided to stop the expansion of Russia into Ottoman Crimea, and failed Russification, as a 19th Century Cultural Literature movement spurned ideals of Ukrainian nationalism. After the Russian Revolution, Ukraine refused to acknowledge Soviet authority until subdued in the ‘20s. Afterwards the Lenin New Economic Policy allowed a limited recovery of Ukrainian prosperity, which was completely undermined and destroyed by the Soviet genocidal Holodomor and the Nazi invasion. Kruschev ceded Crimea to the Ukranians in the ‘50s, and as the Soviets weakened, Ukrainian nationalism strengthened. So, once the empire collapsed, the Ukranians were free once more. However, after ceding their nukes for Western protection, corruption and oligarchical machinations stymied the nation, and kept it hamstrung between the eastern European and Western spheres, until Russia’s current invasion.
It is clear that Ukraine has a clear history of independence, expansion, subjugation, and rebellion. Thus, claims that it is just a borderland (as its name translates to) are completely fallacious. However, Putin and other nationalists like him care little for historical accuracy. Whenever he claims that he is fighting the Ukrainian Nazis, he is gaslighting and attempting to distracting from the fact that his casus belli is spurious. Nationalists only like a narrative that fits them, not a critique of their misdeeds, but as the common aphorism goes, those who fail to understand history are doomed to repeat it.

2022-04-04,CMU,China,"For most Pittsburgh residents, recycling day just means you throw all your plastics, cardboard, and glass into a blue bag or bin on the sidewalk and wait for the next week you have recycling. But what happens to the items after you leave them on the sidewalk? How much of it is really recycled, and how much of it is thrown away?
The City of Pittsburgh's process is as follows: a refuse worker comes by to pick up recycling, which is squeezed into a truck to fit as many items as possible. The recycling is then taken to Recycle Source, a materials recovery center. There, the items go through a machine that tries to separate the different types of recycling, and sells it to places for profit. This recycling process, in which cities collect many different types of recyclable materials at once, is called single-stream recycling.
Single-stream recycling can pose many issues for the city. Recycling, in the city and Recycle Source's eye, is not just a service to the public, but a business, and every recyclable material is a commodity. But there are many things that residents do that decrease the value of these commodities. For one, everyone knows that recycling is good for the environment, so many people dump as much into the recycling bin as they can, with the wish that the items may be recycled, even if they are not actually recyclable. The City of Pittsburgh website calls this ""wish-cycling,"" and deems it one of the biggest challenges they face. 
The issue with ""wish-cycling"" is that it not only creates more work for the city to sort out the recycling, but that non-recyclable materials can also contaminate the recyclable materials, leading the city's recycling program to throw it to the landfill. Many try to recycle materials with food on them, such as pizza boxes stained with grease, or aluminum foil tins with remnants of cake. Food is decidedly non-recyclable, and the food from one material can get onto other recyclable materials in the same bag, rendering the entire bag non-recyclable. The recycling program even advises not to recycle biodegradable, compostable plastics, because they can often have additives that are not compatible with other plastics.
Some recyclable materials can also contaminate others. Glass, while recyclable on its own, breaks almost instantaneously when packed into the truck that delivers the recyclables to Recycle Source. These tiny shards intermingle with other materials such as plastic or paper, the latter referred to as ""speckled paper."" Different types of glass can contaminate each other, leading to lower quality glass. The same goes for plastics and paper — some plastics are thinner and more brittle, different paper materials use different fibers, and mixing them leads to materials that are difficult for collection places like Recycle Source to sell.
There are also many materials that, while recyclable, can clog up recycling machines. Many Pittsburgh residents are used to putting their recyclables into blue plastic bags for recycling workers to pick up. However, plastic bags can get caught on the spikes of sorting machines.
Single-stream recycling is still valuable to the city, however. If residents separated items, the city would have to designate different trucks for different materials and make many more trips to Recycle Source than with single-stream recycling. The city also estimates that single-stream recycling receives twice the amount of recyclable materials as it would if they required residents to separate items. And recycling materials is also financially beneficial for the city: to take items to landfill, the city pays between $25 to $29 per solid waste ton. To take items to Recycle Source, the city earns 60 percent of the items' value, minus a $68 sorting fee per ton. This was estimated to save the city over $639,000 in about 22 months from 2016 to 2017. 
But recently, recycled material has become harder to sell. Most recycled materials are sold to China, which before 2017 was importing 6–7 million tons of waste plastics. But after encountering issues with smuggling and environmental contamination from recycled materials, China instituted a stricter ban on importing contaminated recycled materials, instead favoring domestic recycling and waste. This has led to some recycled materials going to the landfill, simply because no one will buy the materials.
While a solution to reducing waste, recycling has its own host of issues that needs to be solved. As individuals, it is difficult to control the recycling system, but what we can do is make better choices as consumers and understand the recycling system enough to get the most value out of it..

2022-04-18,CMU,China,"CMU RESEARCH: 
Creating artificial gravity in space
As NASA continues to answer our questions about space, they will require increasingly longer trips in space. To do so, their personnel will likely need to stay in a station with artificial gravity, but generating artificial gravity requires the station to spin, and people can't handle too much spinning without getting sick. But, to get the same artificial gravity with minimal spinning, you need a giant station. Zac Manchester, an assistant professor in the Robotics Institute, paired up with Jeff Lipton from the University of Washington to propose an idea to create a kilometer-length station that folds up into a small space during launch, but will unfold to its full length in space. NASA granted the pair $500,000 over the next two years to continue their research and build prototypes of their proposal.
Using extracellular vesicles in body tissues
When body parts like joints fail, some get metal implants that supplement or restore their body's function. But sometimes the body recognizes the metal as a foreign object and tries to reject it. Researchers in the biomedical engineering and material science engineering department are investigating a way to build body tissues that are less likely to be rejected by the body using extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles can encapsulate lipids, nucleotides, enzymes, and other things used to repair body tissues, with an outer layer that prevents the immune system from reacting. However, extracellular vesicles are often cleared from the body very quickly, requiring high doses to offset how quickly they are cleared. To combat this, the researchers added a chemical tag to the outer layer of the extracellular vesicles that better immobilizes them in implants, allowing them to more effectively repair body tissues.

He and collaborators illegally used CRISPR gene-editing technology by forging ethical review documents, then attempted to edit genes in twin embryos that were in-vitro fertilized before implanting them into the uterus. While scientists don't completely know the status of the babies' health, critics say that we do not understand the repercussions of gene-editing technology enough to warrant its use.

TECH: Elon Musk tries to buy out Twitter
Elon Musk is offering to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, amounting to $43 billion in total. Musk wants to privatize Twitter, though he insisted in a Vancouver TED conference that this was not for profit. He claims his main objective is to promote Twitter as a platform of free speech by adding features such as editing tweets, making the Twitter algorithm open-source, and changing content moderation. He already has a 9.2 percent stake in the company, and was offered a board position, which he initially accepted but later rejected. It is possible that he will not go forward with the offer. However, Musk says that if his requested changes are made, he may retract his bid, and experts doubt whether he truly has the spending money to buy another company when most of his wealth is tied up with his other companies. Twitter's board of directors also do not seem to take kindly to Musk's offer, responding with a ""shareholder rights plan"" that would allow other shareholders to buy stock at a discounted price if Musk attempts to buy out the company's shares, diluting Musk's share.
COVID-19: As COVID-19 cases rise again, Shanghai goes on lockdown
As cases in Shanghai climb, China's zero-COVID policy means that the city is to be completely locked down until there are no more cases. In the current situation, many Shanghai residents are losing income, lack access to food, and have to stay in poorly maintained quarantine centers. So far there have been few serious cases: 90 percent of cases are asymptomatic, with only nine becoming seriously ill, and no deaths. Experts say that severity is low right now only because the cases are in the younger generation, but since China has not focused on vaccinating older generations, if the elderly get infected, their cases could be more severe. Many cities in China are now trying to incentivize the elderly to get vaccinated, with door-to-door campaigns and even giving out 500 yuan ($78) gift cards..

2022-04-25,CMU,China,"“Pass the scallops, boy,” shouts a conspicuously pointy-headed new hire at Josh’s Lobster Hut. 
I’m writing this from the back of the eating area at the Mobile, an Alabama seafood restaurant where the newest season of ""Undercover Boss"" is taking place. Each episode, employees get the opportunity to work with their boss, though they don’t know who he or she might be. To celebrate the 157th Anniversary of the Ku Klux Klan, this season’s undercover boss is none other than the Mobile Chapter’s Grand Wizard.
“I’m still trying to suss out who it could be,” says busboy and junior rally organizer Argus Underwood. Part of the fun of this show, I’ve found, is trying to determine who the boss is. Obviously, the makeup and costume team is hard at work obscuring their appearance, but usually there are “tells” that give them away. At an automechanic, the boss might look like everyone else but be unusually concerned with customer satisfaction. At a McDonalds, the boss might apply fake acne and hair grease but have a bizarre obsession with loss prevention. But at Josh’s Lobster Hut, famously a front for America’s favorite hate group, it’s harder to suss out the Wizard from the merely hateful Warlocks.
“Seafood spots have been a Klan haven since, hmmm, I’d say about the 50s,” reports local Klan historian and hopscotch Bronze medalist Mackey Dodgeson. According to Dodgeson, locations just like Josh’s Lobster Hut serve as easy places of work for what would otherwise be unemployable bigots. “Put a Klansmen in front of a cash register anywhere else, and they just cease to function. The register has black keys? The products are from China? The receipts are vaguely Semetic? Forget it. But somehow the smell of hush puppies and popcorn shrimp overrides the part of 'em that hates. Me, I just think they make a mean crab leg!” says store assistant manager and aspiring gay wedding cake-denier Cathleen Redmayne. I can’t help but agree as I dunk the delicious sea bug’s appendage into golden butter.
Watching the workers puzzle out the identity of the Grand Wizard among them reminds me of my childhood. I’ve seen the same expression of racist confusion on grandmas and truckers alike as they tried to find out if I was mixed or just Dominican. From arranging fries into incorrect swastikas to see who corrects them, to playfully dropping hints that they’re ok with race-mixing, I feel like I’m watching a game of white-supremacist cat and mouse. Of course, I know who’s the Grand Wizard; but as a Texan, I know how to keep a racist secret around delicious food. 
All I will say is, tune in this week for the conclusive episode! And after that, keep the tube on to see the shocking reveal of the fourth property twin, whom they’ve kept locked up in the basement of just the nicest brownstone you’ve ever seen!.

2022-09-12,CMU,China,"While people were worrying about “murder” hornets last year, another invasive species was also making its home in the United States: the Spotted Lanternfly. The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive insect that has made its way across the ocean from China and was first reported in Pennsylvania in September 2014. Spotted Lanternflies feast on the sap of various plants and trees, especially farm crops like grapes, hops, and fruit trees. Additionally, the maple syrup and Christmas tree industries have felt the effects of the Spotted Lanternfly.
In 2019, an economic impact study estimated that if the Spotted Lanternfly population continued to grow uncontrolled, this insect alone would cause more than $324 million annually, along with costing more than 2,800 jobs.
Spotted Lanternflies are also known to excrete a sugary waste called honeydew. Honeydew attracts bees, wasps, and other insects and builds up on any surface that Spotted Lanternflies rest on. The build-up of honeydew has also been linked to the growth of sooty mold and black-colored fungi, both of which could decrease the quality of life of residents in impacted areas. 
Any effort to stop the spread of the Spotted Lanternfly is helpful; this includes killing them on sight and destroying their egg masses. Mature Spotted Lanternflies are a beige color with black spots on the wings. Their hindwings (which aren’t normally visible) are a bright red color. Spotted Lanternfly egg masses typically look like dried mud spots. 
Sightings of Spotted Lanternflies are supposed to be reported through an online portal or to 1-888-4BAD-FLY (1-888-422-3359). While no action will directly be taken from the report, it will help government organizations keep track of which areas are being affected by Spotted Lanternflies, especially if they are outside the current quarantine zone. 
In Pennsylvania alone, 34 counties — including Allegheny County — have been placed under a state-imposed quarantine for Spotted Lanternflies. They can also be found in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia. Residents moving in and out of quarantine zones are highly encouraged to check their belongings for Spotted Lanternflies and their eggs.
Though not common in an urban setting like Pittsburgh, Tree-of-Heavens serve as one of the main hosts of this pest. Removal of these trees help contribute to controlling their population. Some pesticides have also been known to help kill off Spotted Lanternflies, but all residents of affected areas are highly encouraged to kill them on sight. .

2022-10-31,CMU,China,"After coming to the United States for the eighth time, I thought the feeling of displacement would be minimal. However, I was still unnerved by the new form of reality that persisted after the pandemic.
From my parents to my friends’ parents, everyone who knew that I was going to university in the States kept “educating” me on the importance of safety and how I should try to minimize time of going out by myself and to always stay alert on the streets — words that I rarely heard even when I left home to go to a boarding school in another city in China. I wanted to say that their understanding of life in the U.S. was only a misconception, but I could not seem to find the courage to convince them as even I was further dissuaded from coming. 
When you scroll through Chinese social media, there are increasingly more negative comments about the West, especially targeting America. We see not only comments and criticism about America’s diplomacy but more importantly, the increasing number of reports of mass shootings, violent crime, and anti-Asian hate crimes. Needless to say, some of the content was published under the influence of the post-pandemic world. But as the number of the incidents grew, more reports were issued in both the Western media and later in the Chinese media. As a result, the Chinese public started to respond more vigorously and negatively to such incidents. When all this information is pieced together, this image of America as an incubator of bloodbath emerges, infiltrating our minds and constructing an unrealistic reality that is worshiped by a number of the Chinese public.
Being someone who grew up in a culture and country that doesn’t promote or protect the right of self-armament, such reality was received with horror and disbelief, stoking much fear amongst the Chinese students traveling to study in the States. We are unaccustomed to such forms of reality, visibly seeing people carry arms even if it was for the purpose of self-defense (I remember the shock I experienced when someone recommended buying a taser off Amazon so I could be less worried when walking the streets after dark). We don’t know how to react to the news of other incidents like those on the New York City Subway. In our eyes, we feel that such incidents are much closer to us than we expected, however far away they might really be. 
More importantly, perhaps, we don’t know how to assess the information. As most international students have not lived in the States, we face great information asymmetry when we see these reports especially in Western media. From easily misleading statistics to attention-grabbing (possibly inflammatory) titles such as “Anti-Asian hate crimes increased 339 percent nationwide last year, report says”, our understanding of the world in the West and the States have been distracted from the reality. 
We assume that we will experience stronger feelings of othering and stares of more pairs of hostile, judgmental eyes because we are the targeted. The news stories call for us to unite against this new prevailing discrimination when in actuality we are further discouraged from discussing this with others in our position, because we don’t want to hold onto our identity of the “othered.” 
In our time where media often profits from and preys upon our fears and insecurities, what can we use as our looking glass to see the truth of the society?.

2022-11-07,CMU,China,"TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been hiring former U.S. Intelligence from the CIA, NSA, FBI, U.S. Cyber Command, and State Department. 
Such officials have made the career swap in both the public and private eye. Sasha Ingber of Newsy explained that government websites have confirmed that an NSA target analyst recently took at job at TikTok, and past analysis has included at least three former CIA officers and three former FBI officers, including “a crisis management unit chief and supervisory special agents,” have also taken jobs with TikTok. 
TikTok isn’t alone in hiring former government employees — it’s actually a fairly common business practice. Al Mayadeen of MintPress explains that after analyzing employment and recruitment websites, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other sites hire “ex-spies.” This analysis puts the number of individuals who made the jump from government to tech in the dozens.
Twitter is a similarly interesting example. Mayadeen notes that Twitter specifically tends to recruit from the FBI, with both the current Director of Corporate Security & Risk and the Director of Corporate Resilience at Twitter having spent 20+ years at the FBI. However, he furthers that Twitter has also hired former NATO and CIA personnel, and also employs active army officers. Similar analysis can be made of Facebook, which entered a partnership with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, and whose head of intelligence is a former NATO Press Secretary. 
Across the board, most of these hires are in areas related to their government experience. Dana Sanchez of Moguldom Nation explains that often the employees entering these technology and social media companies are former high-level directors, legal counselors, and analysts. She furthers that the positions they hold are often in security, trust, safety, and content. Similarly, Ingber explains that for TikTok’s specific acquisitions, the officials often work in “TikTok investigations, threat analysis, and law enforcement outreach.”
There is division over what this means for the industry. 
Mayadeen notes that there is backlash against such hires because of the belief that it undermines the neutrality of social media sites and their ability to check the power of the government. He furthers there is a striking similarity in the ways that companies like Twitter handle controversies and global topics and the ways that U.S. organizations like the FBI view them, citing disinformation campaigns as their example. A striking example is the cautionary messages added to tweets from Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba, but the absence of such warning for the U.S., E.U., or other allies. 
Further controversy for TikTok specifically comes from the connections between TikTok’s owners, ByteDance, and the Chinese government. Ingber notes that because of blurred lines between the government and private businesses, there is questions over whether these hires can reveal information about the U.S. intelligence agencies through monitoring of the former U.S. government employees actions and how they do their jobs, or whether these officials will end up unknowingly aiding China’s intelligence services. While TikTok rejects such claims, Ingber notes at the very least this could be a public relations move to downplay the controversies concerning the Chinese ownership of TikTok and widespread use by U.S. citizens. 
Yet, others note that this seems to be standard for the industry. Ingber reported the views of Lindsay Gorman, former senior advisor for technology strategy at the White House, who sees these hires as “giving TikTok a stamp of legitimacy.” They are following along the path of large social media companies before them, and hiring talent with lots of experience. Gorman furthers that “this is a normal reaction to the growth of a company,” and that when hiring threat intelligence analysts to handle this growth, former law enforcement and intelligence officials are a “popular talent pool.”
Indeed, national security lawyers did tell Ingber that just taking jobs at these social media companies after working for the government intelligence community isn’t illegal, despite what some critics may worry about.
At the end of the day, what intelligence officials do after their government jobs is their business. But now that TikTok has officially hopped on the trend of hiring former government workers, the likelihood that those officials end up working for “the clock app” looks pretty decent. .

2022-11-21,CMU,China,"Last Tuesday, the world’s population hit 8 billion people. This is based on United Nations projections, which reported another billion reached just 12 years after the population hit seven billion. 
The UN said this is the fastest increase they expect to see, and birth rates will decline from here. Tara Subramaniam of CNN explained that demographers place the current growth rate as less than one percent per year, which is causing the population to plateau as that rate gets closer to zero. As the population continues to grow, the UN expects the world population to hit nine billion in 2039 (17 years after eight billion).
The UN estimates that the world population will peak at 10.4 billion people in the 2080s, plateau until 2100, and then decline. Daniel Victor of the New York Times said around 70 percent of the growth from seven to eight billion people came from low- and lower-middle-income countries mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, with the same demographics projected to account for 90 percent of the growth from eight to nine billion. 
The country-by-country breakdown also has notable changes. Victor explained that India is likely to pass China as the country with the largest population in summer 2023. Dan Ikpoyi of PBS reported that in 30 years, Nigeria is projected to grow from 216 million to 373 million, tying with the U.S. for third most populous country. Other nations with notable growth include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Egypt, Pakistan, and the Philippines. 
Some countries' populations declined, although not enough to offset those that are growing. Ikpoyi said that  61 nations are expected to experience population decline by one percent or more. The UN attributes this to emigration and low fertility rates, with over two-thirds of the world’s population living in areas where lifetime fertility is below replacement level (roughly 2.1 births per woman). 
In honor of the population milestone, a baby was chosen to be the symbolic eight billionth baby — well, two of them were. Baby Vinice Mabansag of the Philippines and baby Damian of the Dominican Republic were given the title.
But what does this population growth signal for the world? Experts don’t see it as a death knell for the human race. In fact, Ikpoyi noted that the issue isn’t the number of people on the planet, but the behaviors of the people who are here. He quoted Charles Kenny, who stated that, “Population is not the problem, the way we consume is the problem.” How we handle population growth isn’t by looking at the underdeveloped countries that contribute to population spikes, but at the developed countries that use resources too fast.
This includes environmental harms of our consumption, which Victor said is unsustainable, leading to “climate change, deforestation, and the loss of biodiversity.” Add this to the challenges of meeting the needs of everyone, whether it be with education, public health, employment, water, or sanitation, and we are trying to do more with less. .

2022-12-05,CMU,China,"CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
Robots that can sense layers of clothing
To humans, folding something like a jacket or pants is easy. To a robot that doesn't quite understand the concept of multiple layers of cloth, picking up and folding everyday clothing can be hard. Because robots primarily use their vision to sense objects, when they see clothing, they often only see and pick up the top layer. This makes it difficult for robots to perform household tasks like folding laundry.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon's Robotic Institute speculated that what the robots needed was to have a sense of touch in addition to their sense of vision. They partnered with Meta AI to develop ReSkin, an inexpensive tactile sensor to be attached to robot fingertips, also released as open source. ReSkin senses changes in magnetic fields from depressions or movement of the skin, so that when a robot pinches clothing, it can determine how many layers of cloth there are. In experiments, they found that this tactile sensor improved how well it grabbed multi-layered clothing.
Legged robots that climb up stairs and recover after slipping
Carnegie Mellon and UC Berkeley researchers have created a four-legged robot that adapts according to the terrain, climbing slippery stairs and rocky terrain on hills. The robot is controlled by a small onboard computer with a machine learning model trained on 4,000 clones in a simulator, giving the robot ""six years of experience in a day."" It also has a vision system that is directly connected to the robot's controls: Instead of first mapping the environment and planning actions, the robot acts on whatever it sees. This allows for faster, more adaptive response to changes in the environment. This functionality also makes the robot 25 times cheaper than alternatives.
In addition, the researchers added functionality that mirrored the way humans and four-legged animals move. For example, when humans walk up stairs, they use their hips to rotate their legs to the side to give them more space. Cats and four-legged animals have hind legs that mimic the movements of the front legs, avoiding the same obstacles without needing another pair of eyes. 
A noninvasive ICP monitoring practice that doesn't require drilling holes in heads
While intracranial pressure (ICP) is important to monitor in cases of traumatic brain injury, types of brain hemorrhaging, and other life-threatening brain conditions, in many instances monitoring ICP requires drilling a hole in the skull. A probe is then placed inside the skull to measure the pressure. ICP is also an indicator of brain health. 
However, this practice is expensive and risks giving the patient an infection or even damaging the brain. The practice hasn't changed much since the 1970s despite numerous attempts to find a noninvasive alternative. 
In light of this, Carnegie Mellon biomedical engineering researchers have managed to find two noninvasive approaches for ICP monitoring. These approaches utilize near-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy in which a sensor is placed on the head and measures how much light has interacted with the brain. A machine learning algorithm examines the blood flow change data from the sensors and determines ICP.
Jana Kainerstorfer's biomedical optics lab then partnered with UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in a clinical trial with 15 participants, and found that the results from noninvasive approaches were similar to those of invasive approaches. The findings were published in Journal of Neurosurgery.

Does the decline of Twitter mean the rise of Mastodon?
Amid the chaos of Twitter, smaller but similar social media platforms have been gaining attention. The most attention-grabbing is Mastodon, which calls itself ""decentralized social media.""
Mastodon is part of the fediverse, which the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as ""a large network of independently operated social media websites."" Basically, anyone on the network can host a Mastodon server, or an instance, for their community and connect them to other instances. Each instance operates like a hashtag of Tweets, except each instance moderator can decide who joins and can block posts from other instances. As Mastodon likes to say, ""Everybody owns Mastodon.""
Despite some Twitter users claiming they would join Mastodon if Twitter's situation doesn't improve, some analysts beg to differ. An article from NewsScientist reports that ""Of more than 140,000 Twitter users who announced they were moving to Mastodon, just 1.6 percent have actually quit Elon Musk’s social media platform.""
COP27 Recap
This year's United Nations Climate Change conference COP27 took place in Egypt from Nov. 6. to Nov. 20. Here's a quick recap:
The Loss and Damage Fund: The UN agreed that richer countries would pay for the ""loss and damages"" faced by poorer countries due to climate change and established a dedicated fund for it. The idea is that larger countries have contributed more to global climate change, and therefore should pay for the consequences caused in other countries. The EU and U.S. have previously been against it, but at COP27 agreed on the condition that China, classified as a developing country, also pays for loss and damages.
The small wins: As the global temperature continues to rise, weather extremes and natural disasters will increase. The UN has released the Early Warning for All plan to warn people in low-income countries of climate-related hazards such as extreme storms and floods. The plan calls for $3.1 billion over the next five years, and hopes to use machine learning and data tools to provide these warnings. The U.S. and dozens of other countries are formally pledging to cut down on methane emissions.
Trouble getting nations to explicitly agree to cut down on fossil fuels: Some nations called for cutting down on fossil fuels to be explicitly included in the final agreement. However, oil lobbyists and speakers from UN nations that profit largely from fossil fuels discouraged including such statements. Instead, ""countries should cut down on how much coal they use unless they're taking steps to reduce emissions, and it says countries should stop giving subsidies to the fossil fuel industry that make it harder to cut emissions,"" as NPR reports..

2022-12-05,CMU,China,"The Tartan granted full or partial anonymity to the people we interviewed to protect them and their families.
On Friday night, roughly 300 Carnegie Mellon and Pitt students gathered at the Fence to mourn the 10 people killed by an apartment fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang. They also protested China’s strict Covid policies and human rights abuses. For most students, this was their first protest.
Organizing on eggshells
On Monday, a Carnegie Mellon student began a Telegram group chat to protest the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They shared poster ideas, printed copies, and posted them around campus. By Friday, the chat had 172 members.
According to a Carnegie Mellon sophomore from Ningbo who helped organize, the group chat was a compromise. Everyone’s identities were hidden, but that also meant there was no screening process.
“There is a spy in our group,” said Haoxun, a Pitt graduate student from Chongqing. He was in the Telegram group and helped organize efforts to paint the Fence the day before the gathering.
Around 20 students painted the Fence at midnight on Thursday. A Carnegie Mellon undergraduate from a city in southern China near Wuhan said that everyone met each other for the first time that night, but it felt like they already knew each other. One student brought a heater to shield others from the 30-degree weather.
The sophomore from Ningbo said he was the last to leave the Fence and sent the Telegram group a picture at around 2:35 a.m. Design slogans included: “End Brutal Lockdown,” “Release Protestors,” and “Stop the Genocide.” When a student came to retrieve her heater less than an hour later, she saw that the Fence had been defaced.
Someone had painted “shit” over “genocide.” They also painted Chinese characters in black paint which, according to the original painters, used “derogatory and insulting terms to refer to the people behind the protest.”
The Graduate Student Association and Undergraduate Student Senate condemned the vandalism on Friday afternoon. “We express our unequivocal support for the students who painted the Fence,” they wrote to Carnegie Mellon students, “and we denounce in the strongest possible terms the act of intimidation and harassment against them.” They added that the vandalism violated the Student Government’s Graffiti and Poster Policy.
The vandalism did not deter protesters, who attended in numbers twice as high as organizers expected. Roughly 15 people spoke, much more than the five who anonymously expressed interest to be a speaker in the Telegram group.
“We don’t want to be slaves,” protesters shouted in Chinese. “We want to be citizens.” In October, a man hung a banner with the slogan over a Beijing overpass. Authorities immediately detained the man, quickly removed the banner, and wiped the internet of posts that included “bridge” and “Beijing” within hours. But the banner galvanized Chinese protesters at home and abroad. Protests erupted on hundreds of college campuses. Carnegie Mellon students mimicked the banner in an October Fence design.
Despite unprecedented activism — China hasn’t seen large-scale protests since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 — protesters are cautious. Posters for Friday’s gathering recommended students wear masks and dark clothing to obscure their identities. Many students who spoke with The Tartan were worried that family members in China would be punished if the government discovered that they participated in the protest.
Recent reports claim that China has “overseas police stations” that they use to surveil and police their citizens outside the country.
In an email to The Tartan, one organizer explained that Chinese students may not face repercussions because they are in Pittsburgh, but their families could be punished if the students are identified. The organizer wrote that students risk being “antagonized by other Chinese students who are pro-CCP. The offensive language written in the vandalism is an example of that. It takes a lot of courage for us to attend the event today and express our voices.”
Strained communication, stumbling toward community
Security concerns made it hard for students to organize but so did the lack of protest infrastructure. Afraid of police brutality, protests in China have been reserved, tense, and unofficially organized.
Pittsburgh students expressed similar experiences. “There aren’t a group of organizers, there are people who support,” the student from Ningbo said.
The Carnegie Mellon student from southern China launched the Telegram chat, reported the Fence vandalism, and spearheaded organizing efforts. But she hadn’t wanted to be as front-facing as she was during the gathering.
She thought that someone would volunteer to take charge on Friday night, she told The Tartan. While many people offered to speak for a few minutes, no one took the mantle. “Everyone was nervous,” she said.
Someone brought candles and flowers on Friday. Another person made pamphlets, but it was unclear who would distribute them until people arrived at Friday’s gathering and volunteered. Haoxun spent $160 on paint and brushes for the Fence. At Friday’s gathering, students gave him small monetary donations to help cover the cost.
While some students in the Telegram group said organizing felt touch and go, they also described a growing sense of community.
The student from southern China said that, while students have to be careful about what they say (“You don’t know if the person you’re talking to will report you”), she wants a place where students can speak freely. She thinks the Telegram group could do this with more gatherings like the one on Friday.
Many Chinese international students told The Tartan that they did not plan to tell their parents that they attended the protest.
Richard, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student from Shangdong, said it wasn’t safe to talk about protests and he didn’t want his parents to worry. Ryan, a Pitt undergraduate from Shanghai, said he never discusses politics with his parents. If he wants to post about “sensitive topics,” he said that Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram are his platforms of choice.
Ryan said that when he lived in China he used U.S. social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube to get news. He just didn’t talk about it unless he is with his closest friends. The CCP heavily censors Chinese media platforms.
Haoxun said that he communicates with his family through WeChat, but after sharing videos of Chinese protesters with them, his account was suspended for 16 days. “My parents always warned me of this,” he told The Tartan. Haoxun made a new account which he is using until he regains access to his old one.
While Haoxun has tried to inform his parents about protests, he said he cannot tell them about his own involvement. He said his cousin attended protests in Chengdu and left his phone in his car to dupe police about his location. Haoxun taught his cousin how to use a VPN and told The Tartan that they only discuss politics using a VPN and Telegram.
Newfound motivation
Hyper-surveillance, strict censorship, travel restraints, historical erasure, unexplained disappearances, and mass incarceration are policies many citizens want to protest, but they are also the policies that keep mass protests off the streets. After three years of harsh pandemic restrictions, some citizens are at a breaking point.
On Nov. 24, a fire killed at least 10 people in a Urumqi apartment building. People speculated that a Covid lockdown made it harder for residents to flee and for rescue services to arrive.
China is maintaining its “zero Covid” policy, enforcing neighborhood-wide lockdowns and mandated stays in quarantine centers for close contacts. Despite these efforts, the country’s case count recently hit record highs.
The “zero Covid” policy has caused food shortages, set back the economy, and exacerbated China’s mental health crisis.
“We were forced to stay in our houses and could not step out,” said Ryan, the student from Shanghai. He remembered government officials dropping off mandated Covid tests multiple times a week.
“In the U.S., it’s just Covid,” Ryan told The Tartan. “In China, you’re in lockdown.” The U.S. reported the highest Covid incidence rate in the world.
Ryan said neighborhoods in China could be “sent away to quarantine hospitals that are built up temporarily. It’s killing people.” He said people seeking other medical care are refused because of Covid restrictions, and it has cost some their lives.
One Carnegie Mellon graduate student said he came to the gathering “in memory of people who died from the pandemic. Not just the virus but the ‘zero Covid’ policy in general.”
Chinese officials eased Covid restrictions this week in response to unprecedented protests.
“I want to support my people,” said Henry, a Chinese international student at Pitt. He said the Friday gathering was his first protest.
Lin, a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate from Shanghai, lived in lockdown for three months this year and heard that government workers entered houses, sanitized furniture, and damaged families’ belongings. She said there were protests in the neighborhood next to hers, but “people aren’t even protesting very aggressively. They’re mild.”
A student speaker said that he didn’t think protesters could demand that Xi Jinping step down, but wanted to “leave a record for history” that Chinese citizens condemn their country’s policies. Another student said he wanted looser pandemic restrictions but did not want government leadership to change and did not believe that the CCP was indoctrinating Uyghurs.
Lin said that she did not know about many CCP abuses — including the severity of Uyghur internment camps — until the recent protests.
The Urumqi fire took place in Xinjiang, an autonomous region in China home to many ethnic minorities, including Uyghur Muslims. Reports say that China began its crackdown on Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups in 2014.
Uyghurs cannot have passports and risk internment if they are caught with one. The birth rate in the region has plummeted and at least one million Uyghurs have been detained.
The CCP has used what they call “reeducation camps” and what Human Rights Watch calls “detention camps” to orchestrate forced sterilization, systematic rape, and reported genocide.
Yalkun, a research associate at Pitt from Xinjiang, held a sign protesting the internment of Uyghurs, including his family members. Uyghurs who still live in the province risk detainment if they communicate with people abroad. Before cutting communication with him, Yalkun’s niece told him, “You understand, I am going to kick you out of my contacts.” Yalkun told her he understood. They have not spoken in years.
Kalbi, who is married to Yalkun, has two cousins who were detained. The family has not heard from either since their internment two years ago. Kalbi said there was no political reason for them to be detained. The older cousin, 48, was a news reporter. The younger cousin, 38, wrote something when he was in fifth grade that was published in a kids’ journal that was used to justify his internment.
Sal, who attended the protest with the couple, said he has not spoken to his grandmother in five years. She is from Xinjiang and cut communication when the government began its crackdown on Uyghur Muslims. “She could be in a concentration camp,” he told The Tartan.
Growing activism on campus
In November, it took four people until 4:30 a.m. to paint the Fence in protest of China’s “zero Covid” policy. According to the student from Ningbo, who did not paint that Fence but knew about their efforts from the Telegram group, “There weren’t any organized protests in China. It didn’t occur to us that we should gather together.”
Rain streaked the design, obscuring some of the characters. A student misinterpreted the blurred message and painted over part of the design, thinking that it was anti-protests. After realizing that the Fence design supported protests, the student apologized.
Carnegie Mellon has a reputation of being an apolitical campus, which was another barrier to organizing. But some students have been criticizing the CCP all semester, including four Fence designs protesting the government’s brutality.
Aside from “RIP colonialism” following Dr. Uju Anya’s anticolonialism tweet, the most popular Fence designs this semester have been the ones protesting CCP policies.
During his interview with The Tartan, Ryan walked through the reasons why and lengths he’d go to not to return to China. “I have no choice but to be hopeful about these protests,” he said. “I’m not trying to sound like a refugee, but maybe I am.” Friday’s gathering gave him a space to weigh that feeling.
As students left the gathering, one shouted to organizers, “We are not alone, thanks to you.”.

2022-12-05,CMU,China,"At the close of each year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and society at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the campus and our society.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon for increasing the wages of student workers. For how expensive this university is, there is no reason why students should be working for below a living wage.
A thorn to the Craig St. Chipotle for never having food (especially chips). It’s frustrating when orders are incomplete due to some level of incompetence. We understand working in food service can be difficult, but it’s hard to justify always being out of food.
A thistle to Paul Dano’s Riddler in “The Batman.” Some members of the staff may like you more than others, but without a doubt, your performance stood out in an excellent movie.
A thorn to Ron Desantis for being the Governor of Florida. The “Don’t Say Gay” bill is a major step-back in the fight for equal rights. How are people supposed to learn from history if it’s not being taught?
A thistle to “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” and to Daniel Craig and Rian Johnson both agreeing that they’d like to continue working together on Benoit Blanc stories. Much of the Tartan staff greatly enjoyed your movie, and we look forward to seeing what comes next.
A thorn to Amazon for not being able to ship holiday gifts before break. Sometimes last-minute gifts are a must, while other times we have to wait unnecessarily long for a simple gift for a friend. The inconsistency hurts.
A thistle to the Spotify graphic design team for the incredible Wrapped layouts and design. Year after year, we anticipate seeing what we spent the last year listening to, and your work always brings smiles to our faces.
A thorn to everything becoming a subscription model. Why can’t we just make a one-time purchase of something and own it? We don’t want to have to continually pay for something we might rarely use.
A thistle to TAs in office hours carrying classes, filling in for gaps in content and alleviating students from the misery of answering poorly worded questions. Without you, students would be much worse off.
A thorn to 70-degree weather in November. Though the warm weather is appreciated, it’s a sign of a larger problem: global warming. We hope we are not one of the last generations that gets to live in a comfortable climate.
A thistle to Craig St. Starbucks unionizing! Unionizing is an important part of workers’ rights. Unions are fundamentally needed and a great demonstration of democracy in the workplace.
A thorn to finals being on a Sunday. Sunday is supposed to be a day off for students to relax and study if needed. Who thought it was a good idea to make it an exam day?
A thistle to Scotch’n’Soda’s production of “Something Rotten.” Without question, Scotch’n’Soda has put on another great show that many members of our staff enjoyed watching. From the props and costumes to the actors and musicians, everyone and everything involved was fantastic.
A thorn to Ye and those who still support him. Enough with the antisemitism and racism.
A thistle to the My Chemical Romance reunion tour. Many members of our staff enjoy your work and it was great to see them in-person and releasing new music.
A thorn to Vladimir Putin. Your invasion of Ukraine is completely unjustified and has resulted in senseless violence and loss of life. Your presidency is filled with corruption and human rights violations; you are nothing short of a war criminal.
A thistle to Lou Reed, and everything he’s done. His music is often truly exceptional, and he’s done so much to promote the idea of the “cool Jew” into public consciousness.
A thorn to the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Bodily autonomy — including choosing abortion —  is a fundamental right.
A thistle to having a real fall break. It was much needed and members of our staff were very relieved to have a break in the middle of the semester. There’s no denying being a student is a lot of work, and fall break helped alleviate some of that stress.
A thorn to the 112 staff for making students feel panicky about a class they don’t really care about.
A thistle to South Korea and Japan in the World Cup. South Korea beat Portugal and Japan beat Germany and Spain, both securing a place in the knockout stages of the tournament. Fans can look forward to potential deep runs towards the quarters, semis, and perhaps even finals.
A thorn to Qatar for using slave labor for the completion of World Cup stadiums. Soccer is a unifying game, but its enjoyment should never come at the cost of human lives.
A thistle to protesters everywhere who are fighting for change. In Iran and China, protesters are risking their lives to fight for what they believe in: freedom for the government. We honor all those who have lost their lives in their struggles and hope for quick change..

2022-12-05,CMU,China,"Dear Tartans,
As a Chinese student, I am writing to you about the ongoing disaster and protests happening in the People’s Republic of China, caused by the so-called “zero Covid” policy.
If you have not followed recent news from China, let me introduce some background. Contrary to all other countries in the world, China has maintained its hardcore “zero Covid” policy even after the Omicron variant dominated case numbers.
It is not surprising that the extremely high infectiousness of the Omicron variant has made this policy extraordinarily difficult; the “zero Covid” lockdowns have caused a number of tragedies that are hard to even read about. 27 people in Guizhou died in a car accident when being unnecessarily sent to quarantine; a three-year-old died because first-aid didn’t arrive in time; and a fire in Urumqi killed 10 because firefighters weren’t able to approach the building.
The inconvenience and economic loss caused by such lockdown are even more massive. Across the country, markets are closed, businesses are down, workers and young people have lost their jobs, and small businesses and ordinary families are under unprecedented pressure.
Therefore, in recent days we have seen some really extraordinary scenes. The Chinese people are protesting against their government with a courage that has not been seen in a generation. City after city, university after university, residents and students are gathering in protest against the lockdown and demanding political reform, even calling on the President to resign.
Such protests are extremely rare and risky in an authoritarian China. However, it sends a clear message to the world that even under the most brutal regime, we, the Chinese people, still long for democracy and human rights. So today, I ask you to please notice and support our brave citizens, who are fighting for a brighter future for our country. It is exactly their courage that roused my responsibility and made me feel obligated to say this today.
Thank you!
A Chinese student and citizen.

2023-02-13,CMU,China,"On Tuesday night President Biden gave the State of the Union address. This was the first State of the Union address since the Democrats lost the House of Representatives to the Republicans, a fact exemplified by the presence of Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) standing behind him as the Speaker of the House, a position he has been serving as since early January of this year.
The president had a divisive audience, not only with a split Congress, but also with American households throughout the nation. According to the Associated Press, a new AP-NORC poll only 37 percent of Democrats support a  Biden-Harris 2024 re-election campaign, down from 52 percent in October 2022. The decline is concentrated mostly in Democrats aged 44 and younger, only 23 percent of whom support re-election. According to the poll, the main issues concerning both Democrats and Republicans are inflation, the economy, and governmental spending.
“Two years ago, our economy was reeling … we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.” He assures us that the economy is coming back around from COVID, due to his governmental policy while also taking credit for the decrease in the inflation rate we are seeing, now at 6.5 percent, down from the 9.1 percent we suffered from in June 2022.
Biden affirmed plans to continue his governmental spending policy with the Inflation Reduction Act to deal with rising costs of pharmaceuticals, gas, and groceries. He also vowed to continue granting government subsidies towards student loan-debt forgiveness, and green-energy projects. 
Biden plans to pass legislation to make multi-billion dollar corporations pay an average of 15 percent in federal income taxes. He also plans to crack down on Big Oil, stating that ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and the other supermajors made a record $200 billion dollars last year, then used said profits to “buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.” His proposition: “Quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments.”
When Biden claimed that  “too little” of Big Oil’s profits go to investing in new long-term investments, specifically oil refineries, viewers began to hear outbursts from the crowd. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) the last U.S. oil refinery with significant downstream unit capacity was built in 1976.
Biden claimed that he spoke to oil companies executives on why they’ve barely increased domestic oil production in the past 50 years, who said: “We’re afraid you’re going to shut down all the oil wells and the oil refineries, so why should we invest in them?” Biden said he responded, “Well, we’re gonna need oil for at least another decade.” Many in the chamber, including Rep. McCarthy behind Biden, began laughing.
Biden made the case for Congress to increase the debt limit. He accused the Republicans of wanting “to take the economy hostage … instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.”
Republicans began yelling over the president. Before the address, according to CNN, McCarthy and most Republicans explicitly opposed cutting government entitlements in negotiations with the debt ceiling, though some want Social Security to sunset in the coming years.
Biden also promised to push companies to lower fees and ban them from overcharging the average consumer. He also urged for universal pre-K, reforming police nationwide (in light of the police beating of Tyre Nichols), cracking down on taxpayer fraud, and banning assault weapons.
Biden spoke about the fentanyl crossing into the country from the Southern border, with border patrol “seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.” Deaths from fentanyl, oxycontin, and other hard substances have been growing every year. In 2015, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), 52,000 individuals died of drug overdoses. In 2020, that figure had close to doubled to around 92,000. Biden brought that figure up, only to have a few from the chamber yell “Border!” and “It’s your fault!” Biden did not respond to the heckles and moved on to foreign policy.
America is currently at odds with the People's Republic of China. Both the United States and China are increasing military spending, and Biden made sure to state that any aggression towards the sovereignty of America will be met with retaliation. He concluded with a call to stand America fast to peace, justice, and most of all, common ground. “We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.”.

2023-02-13,CMU,China,"A Timeline of Events
The first balloon was first reported on Feb. 1. It was in Montana near Billings Logan International Airport, and the airport was shut down for a couple hours in response. The reporting brought national attention to the balloon, and it immediately hit headlines across the country. People started wondering where the balloon came from, who sent it, and what, if anything, was its purpose.
The next day, the Pentagon started talking. It was a high altitude Chinese balloon that had been flying over the U.S. for a few days. A second balloon was reported over Latin America, and later that evening, Canada confirmed a third, unnamed incident that it was currently tracking. While the latter of these events was overlooked, the balloon was now fully ingrained in the American news cycle, and the questions started coming. Was it dangerous? Why hadn’t the U.S. done something yet?
It was Friday when China finally commented, with the Foreign Ministry apologizing for the balloon ""straying off course,"" and saying it had no intention to violate any airspace. This started a back-and-forth between U.S. and China officials, with China claiming it was all an accident, while the U.S. pointed out this was a violation of American airspace. The situation became tense as U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, canceled a trip to China, while internal pressure on Biden erupted. The conservative faction of the House, headed by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), put the president on blast, demanding action. China continued to claim the balloon was nothing more than a weather balloon. 
Saturday was the last day the balloon was allowed to fly, and an F-22 Raptor shot it down shortly after it flew over the coast of the Carolinas, while it remained within U.S. waters. A naval mission was instructed to pick up what was left of the balloon, and the debris was shipped to U.S. intelligence for investigation.
Background and Aftermath
Officially, that’s the beginning and end of the 2023 Chinese Balloon incident, but that’s just the end of the flight itself. There’s a lot more, especially in the realm of balloon usage and China’s recent history. While China maintains that the object was meant to report on the weather, there’s reasonable cause to doubt that claim. China has been working on balloon technology at an increased rate since April of 2022, according to Reuters, and as early as 2014, there were papers published in Chinese academic journals calling for the use of balloons in air defense and air incursion. Combining this with China’s current aggressive stance — wolf warrior diplomacy, a nickname for aggressive, confrontational foreign policy, has been noted across almost all Chinese embassies in foreign countries — and the U.S.’s claims hold more weight. 
On top of that, the downed balloon bears no resemblance to any weather balloon currently used. Weather balloons are usually much smaller than the downed balloon, and carry a globally standardized set of equipment. Most weather sensors have not been changed in a while, and the sensors recovered don’t fall in line with weather technology. Data gathered from American U2 spy planes seems to show that the balloon had significant intelligence gathering capabilities, including equipment that would be unusual on a weather balloon or similar meteorological device. The balloon also has claimed electronic tracking capabilities, including the ability to track and capture mobile phone and radio signals and data. 
Further capabilities included the balloon's apparent ability to increase and decrease in altitude to enter favorable currents that would help it travel to specific locations. The balloon entered American airspace at an altitude of 60,000 feet, and was shot down at an altitude of 58,000 feet, seemingly dropping into lower airstreams in order to travel. The wreckage was recovered, and the U.S. identified propellers and rudders for movement, as well as a large solar panel for energy. 
This is not the first identified strange balloon, with two near Japan and one near Taiwan reported recently, though none of those were linked to China explicitly. In addition, the Pentagon released information saying the balloon is one of 40 flown over five continents since 2017, five of which incurred American air space. This is, however, the first of these balloons to spend significant time over the US.
Despite such findings, China has vehemently denied any negative association between the balloon and intelligence gathering capabilities. In fact, the country has continued to raise objections, claiming that the U.S. shooting it down was a violation of international law. The U.S. has responded with evidence that the balloon was not part of a meteorological data agreement, nor was it authorized to be in American airspace at that time, and was therefore a valid target for attack. While the balloon posed no danger to American citizens and was recovered without any accident or damage to American property, the U.S. has still responded to the incident strongly, bringing together diplomats from the U.S. and Canada to discuss the situation with China.
Another object was shot down over Alaska over the weekend, and the situation does not appear to de-escalate anytime soon. China claims the balloon was not meant for spying, and has accused the U.S. of escalating and causing an international incident. As it stands, the two countries are currently negotiating as the U.S. attempts to find more information from the debris.
In terms of domestic pressure, the Republican Party, as well as hawkish Democrats, have called for stronger defense of American airspace, as well as improved early detection and warnings systems to prevent this from happening again.
Recent updates
The U.S. has shot down a number of other unidentified objects over American airspace in the last week. While U.S. intelligence don’t have much information about these objects, and most have been shot down over Alaska and Canadian airspace. The current reports are foggy, but there might even have been a fourth object. Meanwhile, Chinese naval vessels have started moving closer to the Japanese EEZ, and other strange actions have been taken by the Chinese military. On top of all that, China has gone quiet in response to the United States, while planning on shooting down another unidentified object over Chinese ports this time, which they aren’t talking about. The number of unidentified objects being shot down and reported this week is very high, and the government remains exceptionally tight-lipped about it..

2023-02-13,CMU,China,"Are we living through another Cold War? In replacement of the Soviets, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have become our main adversary, and as the spheres of influence grow further and further apart, our hostility towards the CCP and theirs to our democracy grows likewise. The amount of nuclear warheads we have pointed towards each other only assures us that Mutually Assured Destruction lies close on the horizon unless something is done to attenuate such an event.
America, like every other nation on Earth, has a history of war and conquest, with periods of evil and shame. There are many peoples throughout the world that would may want to raise arms against the United States, and depending on the circumstances, I might not blame them. It is, however, possible for it to be true that America is both flawed and also one of the best countries to live in. Much of the world has understood this for generations, and many people, including my very own parents, came to this country for the sake of themselves and their children, because this very land was considered a sanctuary from the tyranny and corruption which plagued much of the world.
It is a complex topic, and one that I do not claim to fully understand, but I can see trends and patterns in history, and one that stands out is that when goodness doesn’t fill the vacuum of morality, evil will take its place. When America does not act to defend freedom, wickedness grows, as it has happened before. Take, for example, the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, in which 59 American and Canadian diplomats were held hostage for 444 days. Then-president Jimmy Carter did not use force, but applied economic pressure via freezing Iranian assets and implemented a series of economic and diplomatic sanctions. Thus, the world saw America reduced down to a “paper tiger”, a term used by both Mao Zedong and Osama Bin Laden to describe the U.S. 
We saw it in 2021 when the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, where a country collapsed to terrorism upon gaining independence of our support. An entire generation of people, especially educated women, who have never experienced the oppression of extreme religious fundamentalism, suddenly had their rights stripped from them. Our adversaries are now willing to test U.S. aggression. The Taliban in Afghanistan, Russians in Ukraine, soon, it’ll be the Chinese in Taiwan if we do not stop this cycle of foregoing our allies for the sake of maintaining international peace. If the Munich Agreement taught us anything, it’s that there is no way to satisfy expansionist totalitarian regimes through concessions.
Just a few days ago, a Chinese spy balloon flew over the entire continental United States, and even after detection, the U.S. military refused to shoot down the craft. The balloon was originally spotted in Montana, the state harboring most of our nuclear arsenal, and made it all the way to North Carolina and the Atlantic Ocean before being terminated. High-ranking Chinese officials deny the balloon was used for intelligence, and are angered that a Chinese aircraft was downed in American airspace (as if we had any other choice).
The question that everyone must have on their minds is: How much will China push before the U.S. opposes them? It’s clear that America and the Biden administration are trying to keep safety and peace above all, but the price for that is freedom — maybe not for us, but our own allies. This is not an advocacy for a total military offensive, but rather a request that we look at the consequences of hesitant defensive actions and America’s refusal to stand up to our enemies’ unjust expansionism.
While it might seem hypocritical to say that America should both stand against expansionism and totalitarianism and also be involved in every foreign conflict whether our assistance is appreciated or not, the alternative to that, isolationism, is far worse. As the world's leading economic and military power, it is the duty of America to stand up for democracy, lest history repeat itself..

2023-02-20,CMU,China,"This week the United States shot down several airborne objects. After the initial Chinese balloon was downed off the coast of North Carolina, three new objects were shot down: one over Canada, one over Alaska, and one over Lake Huron. The objects ranged in size and shape from a much smaller balloon, a cylindrical object, and an octagonal object; none of which have been definitively traced. 
The most recent object, shot down over Lake Huron, was considered too small to be shot down using radar-guided weaponry, which was a problem for the U.S.'s radar-reliant weapons. Without it, guns and a number of missile locks would fail, forcing American aircraft to rely on heat-seeking missiles, which can be significantly less accurate. The object was flying at 20,000 feet, making it a serious risk for passenger airplanes. 
These incidents beg the question: What happened? The U.S. government has indicated that the other objects were likely not spy balloons, and the one over Alaska could have been a hobbyist balloon. According to members of an Illinois-based amateur club, “The thing [the U.S. government] described as having shot down is not inconsistent with what we're flying out there.”
The other shot down balloons have not been recovered, and the U.S. called off the search for their debris. It seems the U.S. and Canadian governments have agreed that neither object threatened the U.S. and do not deserve an exhaustive search. 
Biden has claimed that this isn’t a serious increase in UFOs since last year, and it seems data bears this out. 
While the fear that the U.S. is under attack from an aerial threat seems to have died down, there is now the matter of finding out what else the Chinese balloon contained, why it wasn’t shot down over Alaska when the government first noticed it, and how to counter these balloons without spending a missile on them. The balloon debris remains under the government’s protection, and tests are being taken. Initial reports suggest that the balloon was equipped with steering capabilities, which makes the odds of it just drifting off course very unlikely. Government officials seem to have concluded that China was lying about the balloon based on evidence from their investigation. At the same time, China has yet to confirm their balloon was there intentionally.
Biden has announced an inter-agency task force to figure out what happened, what to do, and how to change U.S. policy in the future in order to close this gap..

2023-02-20,CMU,China,"Last week The Tartan published an article titled, ""America's refusal to show military supremacy will be our downfall,"" and I wanted to respond with this piece.
“History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.” It’s a quote attributed to Mark Twain, one of those authors who wrote way too much in his life to not be quotable. The quote, or one of its derivatives, is used constantly. Hell, it's so relevant that one might start thinking the entire world is just a sitcom created by writers who started recycling ideas centuries ago. Mark Twain essentially says we are living inside the Simpsons. I call being Bart.
My colleague recently wrote a piece talking about one of those apparently repetitive moments in history, proclaiming us to be in a second Cold War, with China replacing the Soviet Union as our global adversary. It’s a very poignant comparison, especially for those who believed that we had achieved the so-called “End of History.”
Perhaps the reason for the failure of that dream is the U.S.’s inability to step up. Perhaps we should have done more, been more willing to flex the might of the largest military in the world. It’s a romantic notion, evocative of “Idealistic Intervention,” something criticized across the board.
Here’s the thing though: ""Idealistic intervention"" is complicated. While it’s easy to point out where the U.S. simply didn’t do enough — like our failures in Iran during Carter’s presidency, or the disaster that was the Afghanistan withdrawal — there are plenty of times the U.S. did too much. One could compare U.S. relations with Yugoslavia or Romania, with our work in South America during the (previous) Cold War. While Yugoslavia was explicitly socialist, the U.S. and Western allies were content working with them in order to further foreign policy, while the U.S. was also willing to aid fascists across South America come to power. Also consider how the U.S. put massive political and economic pressure on the democratically-elected socialist president of Chile Salvador Allende while simultaneously giving help to Ceausescu’s Communist government in Romania. The U.S. stepped up often — and not always in a way that followed the principles the country was founded on. And for every Bosnia or Kosovo, where the U.S. stepped up and saved lives, there’s a Vietnam, where we fought a possible ally in Ho Chi Minh and killed millions.
It’s hard to explain why some of these failed while others succeeded. Our support for the dictatorial governments of South Korea and South Vietnam involved us in conflict, but one of those governments is now a democracy and has one of the largest GDPs in Asia, while the other is no longer a nation (though Vietnam is very friendly to the U.S., and another powerful economy). 
So when it comes to China, the U.S. ought to step up in the way that was popularized during the 90s — make allies and promote friendships. In weeks past, the U.S. negotiated a larger military presence in the Philippines, a country that was once a U.S. territory, then a U.S. ally, but seemed to have pivoted towards China in recent years. These bases represent a pivot back to the U.S., a big step towards unity in the South China Sea and the long-term American goals of a NATO-equivalent in the Pacific. It’s easy to point to the failures of appeasements like the Munich Conference or MINSK II and claim the only solution is to fight, fight, fight, but sometimes it’s not that simple. Americans thought that fighting would give the Afghans the ability to create a stable country. Instead, the Afghan National Army collapsed, and the U.S. realized that nation-building was more than just conflict. We learned the same in Libya, Syria, and South Vietnam. Each was a conflict that expanded in scope and scale and left the regions decimated. 
It’s true that a Chinese spy balloon was flown across U.S. airspace in the last month. It was shot down over the coast of North Carolina, away from any harm it could have caused to civilian populations. Many on the right have claimed that this represents a gap in our defense, a serious issue in American technology and policy that puts us on the back foot against China. To those objections, I point out that NORAD had been tracking that balloon since it approached U.S. airspace. We been knew China had a spy balloon, we just waited to shoot it down. And then we did. It’s gone now. It took a single missile from an F22. 
It’s easy to claim that the time it took to shoot down the balloon is a symptom of a lack of resolve. Biden might be soft on conflict and soft on China. Perhaps the U.S. is missing the bite that we had in the Cold War. Too many peaceniks, in the parlance of the 60s. 
That’s unfortunately not something borne out in the policies of the current administration. Besides the new bases on the Philippines, there’s been more military trade with Japan, as their new “Helicopter Destroyers” are fitted with F35s. Biden reaffirmed America’s support for Taiwan, confirming a 70-year-old policy that we refuse to shift, as major American leaders traveled to the island as a show of support. Canada has finally confirmed purchase of American F35s, making them another part of the American defense complex. And that’s before we even look at Ukraine, Lend Lease Two, and the massive arms donations the U.S. has made towards the country. This isn’t the actions of a country looking for peace above all, but a country concerned with protecting its allies, and affirming its promises. The U.S. destroyed ISIL in 2018, and has continued to remove Al-Qaeda’s leaders in the years after. 
Perhaps you disagree with America’s actions as of late. It’s perfectly acceptable; the U.S. has made unilateral moves. But to call the U.S. too soft, too peaceful, too forgiving is mistaken. The words of Teddy Roosevelt still ring, and the U.S. has continued to carry its ""big stick."" Whether you agree with it or not, the U.S. continues to act. We don’t need to put troops in every conflict zone, we don’t need to deploy the Marines whenever some tin-pot dictator rattles his saber. That’s a trap, a money sink that will drag us into conflicts we don’t understand against nations who aren’t amenable to our aid.

2023-02-27,CMU,China,"The Major League Baseball season concluded in November as the Astros toppled the Phillies in six games to claim the World Series title. Baseball once again returned to hibernation for the cold winter months. Winter turns to spring and the baseball season takes its place once more. This year, though, is slightly different. Before we can watch our favorite teams go to battle, a special tournament will commence. The World Baseball Classic allows players to suit up for their national teams and play for their country. Twenty nations will send their best players to claim the coveted trophy.
The history of the World Baseball Classic (WBC) is rather short. Its first iteration took place in 2006, and there have only been four tournaments since. With each passing classic, it seems the tournament grows in popularity and that trend is almost sure to continue. The WBC is key to help grow the game of baseball and spread it even further worldwide. Baseball is a major sport in many nations, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, but it lacks popularity in other regions. An international tournament showcases the best players on the planet playing, not for money, but for national pride. In the previous events, Japan, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. are the only nations to win. Japan won the first two tournaments in 2006 and 2009 while the Dominican Republic and the U.S. won the WBCs of 2013 and 2017, respectively. 
This year's World Baseball Classic is shaping up to be a great tournament with some nations making their first appearance and others looking to add to their trophy case. The 20 national teams are split up into four different pools. The first round is pool play where five teams will play each other. The top two teams with the best record will move on to the next round. From then on, every game is win or go home. In the quarterfinals, the winner of Pool A will play the second place team of Pool B and the winner of Pool B will play the runner up of Pool A. The same is true for Pools C and D, but on the other side of the bracket. The winners will move on to the semifinals and so on until the final game on Tuesday, March 21 in Miami, Florida. 
The games of Pool A will take place in Taiwan at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. This is one of the weaker pools of the field, as it includes Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), the Netherlands, Cuba, Italy, and Panama. Chinese Taipei will be led by Yueh-Ping Lin in their fifth appearance at the WBC. This squad does not have many big leaguers besides a few players who had quick trips to the big leagues or prospects who have yet to reach that level, but they certainly have experience in the WBC. They have only reached the second round once, so they sure have something to prove to the rest of the world. 
The Netherlands is being led by Hensley Meulens in their fifth trip to the WBC. They have been one of the more successful nations in the first few tournaments, as they finished fourth in each of the last two. They field a number of MLB players such as Xander Bogaerts, Kenley Jansen, Jurickson Profar, and Andrelton Simmons. Pitching is likely the biggest concern for this team, but they have shown to have some magic when it matters most. 
Armando Johnson leads the Cuban National team, which is an easy favorite to win Pool A. For the first time, Cuba is allowing players who defected from the country to play for their national team. This will hopefully give them the spark they have been looking for, as the team has been unable to get past the second round since their defeat in the 2006 Championship to Japan. White Sox teammates Yoan Moncada and Luis Robert Jr. will join Johnson in leading the team, with former MLB star Yoenis Cespedes also on the roster. The pitching looks a little lighter than expected, but many of these players are fresh off the Caribbean Series, so there is little rust to wear off. 
Hall of Fame Catcher Mike Piazza leads Team Italy in their fifth appearance at the WBC. Italy has only made it past the first round once. Royals star first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino, also nicknamed the ""Pasquatch"" or the ""Italian Nightmare,"" should be fun to watch. Former Mets ace Matt Harvey, as well as David Fletcher and Nicky Lopez, are other notable names. This team lacks the star pitching on paper, which is a similar problem of most WBC teams, but they could make some noise in a weaker pool. 
The last team of Pool A is Panama, who are making their third WBC appearance and first since 2009. Luis Ortiz leads this club, which has very little MLB experience. Javy Guerra and Christian Bethancourt are familiar names, but this team will need some unlikely heroes for a deep run. It should be exciting for Panamanians to see their national team playing on the world stage for the first time in over a decade. 
Cuba will likely move on from Pool A, but the second spot is certainly up for grabs. Chinese Taipei would be my choice for the second slot as they will be playing at home, so the crowd will be on their side. 
Pool B will play their first games at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. Japan, Korea, Australia, China, and Czech Republic make up this section of the tourney. Japan is easily one of the favorites to win the WBC, as they have been the most successful country in its history. They are the only nation to finish in the top three of each WBC, and they have the roster to do it again. The Nippon Professional Baseball Organization is the best outside of Major League Baseball, so there are many high level players on this team. Yu Darvish, Lars Nootbar, and Seiya Suzuki are well known MLB players on the squad, while Munetaka Murakami and Roki Sasaki are young Japanese stars who will look to make their mark. It also cannot be forgotten that two-way player Shohei Ohtani will also suit up for Japan. 
South Korea is also one of the favorites in this tournament, as Korea also has their own league in the Korean Baseball Organization League. They finished in the top three in 2006 and 2009, but have failed to reach the second round since. Kang Chul Lee leads this team of ball players who may not have the notable MLB talent of other squads, but they are sure to be competitive. Some key names are Tommy Edman and Ha-Seong Kim who will provide some key leadership in the infield. 
Former big leaguer Dave Nilsson is leading Team Australia. Unfortunately, they have never made it out of the group stage in the four appearances. The club this time around does also not seem to be as strong as it has been in the past. The roster includes some guys who have big league experience, but there are not a lot of names that are recognizable. 
Similar to Australia, China has never made it out of the pool stage of the World Baseball Classic. Dean Treanor leads this squad, which does not have many notable players on the roster. Additionally, the Chinese Professional Baseball League has not resumed since the pandemic. Hopefully, they can be competitive in the tournament. 
The Czech Republic is one of the more exciting stories of the entire WBC, as they are making their first appearance in the event. Pavel Chadim leads a squad full of guys who mostly play for a Czechian Amateur League. Eric Sogard is the only former big leaguer on the team, but it should be a lot of fun to see this team play. This is another sign that we could be seeing baseball grow in other parts of the world. Although Czech Republic is a great story, Japan and Korea are the easy options to escape Pool B considering their talent and pedigree in the WBC. 
Pool C will play their games in Phoenix, Arizona. Pool C is one of the more interesting pools, as it includes the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and Great Britain. The United States is looking to repeat, and it surely has one of the best lineups ever constructed in baseball history. The roster is full of MVPs, including Mookie Betts, Mike Trout, and Paul Goldschmidt, with also a number of other MLB All Stars at each position. The pitching staff is not as comparable, but there are a lot of great pitchers on the roster. The coaching staff also features Mark Derosa, Andy Pettitte, and Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. Everything seems to be lining up for a U.S. repeat at the WBC. 
Mexico is managed by Benji Gil and features a lot of MLB talent. Julio Urias, José Urquidy, and Taijuan Walker lead the pitching staff and there are a number of MLB players around the diamond. Alex Verdugo, Randy Arozarena, and Rowdy Tellez provide thump to the lineup. This team looks like they can compete at a high level and give almost any other squad a run for their money. Mexico is very well rounded and a country with such talent should be moving past the first round which they have not done since 2009. 
Jolbert Cabrera leads Colombia, who are only making their second appearance at the World Baseball Classic. This team is not as star-studded as the others, but there are a lot of good players that could contribute to a winning club. José Quintana, Gio Urshela, and Donovan Solano are good players at the big league level and it would only take a few more pieces for this team to win a game or two. Fifteen-year MLB veteran Ernie Whitt is hoping to coach Canada to their first second round appearance in their WBC history. Similar to most teams, the pitching staff does not jump off the page, but the lineup has some studs. Freddie Freeman is the clear best player, but Tyler O’neil and Abraham Toro are nice pieces. 
Great Britain is another nation making their first appearance in the WBC. Most of their club seems to be players who were born outside of Britain. They are only one of three national teams from Europe, and it would be great to see them win a game. It will also be fun to see the U.S. and Great Britain face off after they played each other in the World Cup just a few months ago. The United States and Mexico are the two clear best teams of Pool C, but Colombia could be a team that could sneak its way into the next round. 
Pool D is probably the best group of the bunch, as it features three very good teams. Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Israel, and Nicaragua will all play in Miami, Florida at LoanDepot Park. Israel had a fun WBC in 2017, as they finished sixth in their first ever appearance, but they may have drawn the wrong ticket this time around considering the other teams. Ian Kinsler is leading this team and he was a part of some winning teams, so hopefully that experience can translate to the rest of the team. Nicaragua is another team that may not have enough talent to really compete against the three teams we will talk about next, but they will be making their first showing at the World Baseball Classic and I am sure they believe they could stun a heavy hitter. 
Puerto Rico has finished runner up in the last two WBCs, so they are hungry to finally win the title. Newly retired and future Hall of Famer Yadier Molina is managing a team full of stars such as Mets shortstop Fransisco Lindor and Enrique Hernandez. They also added Marcus Stroman who was the 2017 WBC MVP for the U.S. The backend of the bullpen is also set and stone with All Star closer Edwin Diaz and Jorge Lopez. 
Venezuela is looking to return to the top three for the first time since 2009 and they have a well-rounded team to do so. Ranger Suarez of the Phillies and others fill out a decent pitching staff who will have the luxury of throwing to veteran catcher Salvador Perez. The infield is full of key players such as Jose Altuve, Andrés Giménez, and Gleyber Torres, but the outfield is where this team truly shines as Ronald Acuna Jr, David Peralta, and Anthony Santander are excellent hitters for a lineup. Venezuela looks to be one of the more well rounded teams we’ve looked at. 
The Dominican Republic is led by Rodney Linares and he certainly will not have a tough time fielding a lineup. This team is probably the best team to ever be constructed with an all star lineup and pitching staff. Every position has an MLB All Star, if not two, to field the position. Some names are Manny Machado, Juan Soto, Julio Rodriguez, Vladimir Guerroro Jr, and Rafeal Devers. The pitching staff has reigning NL Cy Young winner Sergio Alcantara and playoff hero Cristian Javier among a slew of other notable names. Pool D will be very interesting to see as there are three teams who could easily make a run at the championship. Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico will likely be the teams to move on, but it only takes a key win from Venezuela to get a spot. 
There certainly is a talent disparity between some of the countries, as many of them seem to be absolutely loaded with baseball stars while others are mostly full of amateur stars. Baseball is a funny game though and nothing is guaranteed. We have seen plenty of upsets in the past and it only takes one game to get a team on a roll. No matter what, these teams will compete and play their absolute best. The passion and grit that is shown in the WBC is different from any other baseball I have seen. This will be especially true once we get to the later rounds as the best of the best around the World will be vying to hoist the Championship Trophy. .

2023-02-27,CMU,China,"ChatGPT was released in late November, taking the world by storm. While created by OpenAI, the company is now owned by Microsoft following large donations made in 2019 and 2023. It’s widely used, with an estimated 100 million active users in January. In its rise, ChatGPT has also faced significant animosity. China banned the entire system, while companies like Amazon and J.P. Morgan Chase have restricted usage considerably. 
While other companies have attempted to get into competition with OpenAI, there have been some difficulties, especially for Google’s newest product, Bard. Bard has faced several problems in their release, including factual inaccuracies when the program responded to questions. These concerns have cost Alphabet nearly $100 billion in market value, a massive tumble for one of the largest tech companies in the United States. Google has called a “code red” in response to ChatGPT, and it seems Bard will be undergoing additional testing to try to refine it. In addition, China has stepped into the chatbot competition twice, with Baidu’s Ernie building on China’s internet and information base, and Alibaba announcing tests into creating a chatbot in the coming future.
Obviously there’s a lot of value in these chatbots, and the question stands: What use does Microsoft plan on finding from ChatGPT? The project is planned for integration into Microsoft’s Bing search engine and Edge browser, as better information, searches, and completions would streamline their browser’s usability. Considering that Edge is Microsoft’s premier project to regain market share from Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox, the improvement may help the new browser. ChatGPT essentially acts as a phrase generator. It reads a huge amount of data, and it’s using that to predict what the answer would be to the question you ask. It’s a very powerful tool, and by combining it with a search engine, ChatGPT could help users get answers to their questions more quickly, especially more complex requests that a simple Google search would not respond to as easily. Because ChatGPT can incorporate information it reads into one answer, it could help Edge become a more powerful, capable search engine for the average user.
Google’s new Bard, on the other hand, is meant to be a better and more powerful version of ChatGPT, with more options for tone and format. Bard may give a user the ability to get a funny answer formatted in letter form, which would give it considerably more use cases than ChatGPT. While Google admits Bard may have inaccuracies, the warning has failed to prevent concerns due to the incorrect responses from questions asked on stage. In a competition where each percent of search engine market share represents billions in revenue, these small benefits could help Google significantly, and not having a competitor to ChatGPT could cost the company a monumental amount.
While Google still has significant AI research and development, including large language model technology that may give an advantage over Microsoft, the partnership with OpenAI gave Microsoft a huge boost and could, if Microsoft capitalizes on it, make the search engine competition competitive again..

2023-03-20,CMU,China,"China’s president Xi Jinping was endorsed for a third term by the National People’s Congress (NPC) on March 10. The five-year reappointment would make him the longest serving leader of the People’s Republic of China since the country’s founding in 1949, and cements his position in charge of the second-largest economy in the world.
This comes following a 2018 decision to scrap China’s two-term limit for the presidency, and led to speculation that Xi intends to hold onto power indefinitely. In addition to the election, Xi has restructured the upper echelons of power in China in the last few years, replacing many in the Politburo Standing Committee with hardline loyalists this past October. This was preceded by replacing members of the Central Committee with other loyalists and is another consolidation of power. On March 11, Xi replaced Li Keqiang, the Premier — China’s number two, and someone often viewed as a liberal reformer  — with Li Qiang, another close ally of the President. Another major replacement was Liu He, China’s Economic Tsar, considered central to China’s economic transition from fast- to slower-paced growth to tackle structural problems in the country’s economy. He will be replaced with another long-time Xi ally, He Lifeng. Lifeng’s role seems to clash with Li Qiang’s,, and his track record indicates that he may have interest in a statist approach to economic management.
It’s claimed that China’s presidential position is largely a ceremonial one, with a majority of the power over the country consolidated in the leader of the party and the leader of the army. Xi also holds both of those positions.
However, Xi’s new consolidation comes at a time when China is experiencing widespread and increasing issues. The country is grappling with slowing growth, partially due to zero-Covid restrictions, as well as condemnation for their human rights record and a much less positive relationship with the United States. Xi accused the United States of suppressing China and causing its domestic woes. According to a statement he made during the NPC meeting, Xi claimed “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development.” China and the U.S. trade annually for about 180 billion USD, and the United States is China’s biggest trade partner and second-biggest source for agricultural products.
With new policies on the horizon, as well as a new slew of economic crises, China is facing a very different situation than when Xi received his second term five years ago. How the new expected policies play out remains to be seen, especially with the number of Xi allies in power under the new government..

2023-03-20,CMU,China,"""The End of History,"" a 1992 book by Francis Fukuyama, claimed that liberal democracy — the values and beliefs of the European Enlightenment which informed many of the major Western powers — was to be the last form of governance. Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy had ""won"" the ideological war, and it was, essentially, the peak form of government. If history was the story of the development of ideologies and governance, then liberal democracies were the final evolution.
This belief, as naïve as it seems to us, was understandable in 1992. The largest economy in the world was the United States, a liberal democracy. Kruschev had predicted that “We will live to see you buried,” but it had been the United States watching over the fragmentation and funeral of the Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin, the new Russian president, was amenable to the United States, and the U.S. appeared to be on track to become a friend to Russia. The second largest economy was Japan, an incredibly powerful economic machine. 
But in the two decades that followed, this paradigm was destroyed. Japan stagnated more than ever expected, seeing three decades without economic growth. In Iraq, the United States betrayed its liberal principles and pushed away its allies in Europe. The economy that grew to eclipse Japan was the People’s Republic of China, an authoritarian regime more in the image of the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia than the United States, Japan, or Korea.
This is a lot of background for an event that happened in the last few years. Xi Jinping, the current head of the Communist Party of China, the head of the People’s Liberation Army, and now the President of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), has won an unprecedented third term. And while that’s a lot of titles for one man, it represents the strength of his power among the Chinese ruling class. Xi isn’t simply one part of the cog that is the government of the PRC — he is the government.
His government is facing unprecedented crises. Upon pushing through his recent cabinet appointments, Xi is facing slowing economic growth, and significant problems with the housing sector. The PRC has cultivated agreements and relations with countries across the world, but the massive Belt and Road Initiative seems to be wildly underperforming. And as a manufacturing economy, China faces its biggest threat yet — the country recorded population decline, the first time that has happened since a famine in 1961. Demographics are a ticking clock for the manufacturing economy that sustains China. With new policies, Xi has attempted to increase fertility, bring back expats, and rebuild the economy; but unless things change, workers will become a finite resource. When the current working class retires, there will be a much smaller pool paying into the social services necessary to take care of them. 
Xi has announced moves to stem some of the bleeding. First, he wants to take care of investors and make China seem less of a threatening place to park your money. After the three month disappearance of Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, many investors are less than thrilled to trust the country with their assets, and China has started to advertise itself as business friendly in an effort to bring those investors back. With large money managers steering clear of China’s assets, this change should bring cash influx to the economy — money that can be used for more infrastructure and investments to keep money flowing. China has been losing money on high speed rail, and without funding to keep it afloat, the lines — and the staff that maintains them — stand to lose their jobs. 
What remains, however, is the decreasing population. China hopes to attract immigration like the United States, the only major power currently projected to see a population increase in the next 50 years. If China’s population truly has peaked, or if the reports of overcounting are true, then the country will need to transition, fast, to automation and a service economy. Otherwise it runs the risk of a worker-based manufacturing economy without the workers to base it on. While China has increased the number of children legally allowed, this hasn’t done much to alleviate the very low birth rate in the country.
Finally, there’s the thorny issue of Taiwan. Taiwan, as of now, remains the largest and most important semiconductor manufacturer in the world. It houses the best trained, best experienced, and best managed plants, and is responsible for a huge amount of the circuitry that goes into every single everyday object.
That makes it a very big problem for the U.S. and for China. For China, Taiwan represents the old government the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT). While the KMT lost power to the more pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), China still claims Taiwan as Chinese territory, and it has forced many international groups to label the country as “Chinese Taipei.” However, the U.S. has maintained strategic ambiguity on Taiwan, refusing to acknowledge it as a country, but still working with it as an autonomous region of China. After claiming U.S. suppression, increasing excursions into Taiwanese airspace, and saber-rattling at U.S. officials visiting the Island, Xi now faces the reality that the U.S. may defend Taiwan in the same way that it has defended Ukraine. 
With that in mind, as well as the fact that China does not possess the military capability to assault Taiwan, the island has remained a serious problem. Xi announced the need to suppress pro-independence voices in Taiwan at the end of the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting this month, and by replacing much of the reformist or liberal voices in his cabinet with hardliners, may have closed off a diplomatic solution to the island altogether. 
China is currently the largest autocratic regime in the world, with the Russian Federation in close second, and in recent years, has become more and more confrontational against the United States. With Xi receiving what seems to be the go-ahead to hold power indefinitely, this is the newest iteration of the Soviet Union — and Fukuyama’s End of History is put further and further in the distance..

2023-03-27,CMU,China,"Chinese President Xi Jinping was warmly welcomed to the Kremlin on Monday by Russian President Vladmir Putin to discuss and strengthen ties between the two countries as Russia’s Ukrainian invasion remains ongoing. According to the Associated Press, Xi’s three-day visit intends to deepen the “no-limit friendship” between Russia and China, as Xi himself termed it in the past, and begin discussions on an end to Russia’s war. 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has persisted for more than a year now and has become an expensive conflict, not only in terms of the loss of lives and damages caused to both parties, but also to the president’s, as well as the country’s, reputation. According to the New York Times, Russian forces are nearing 200,000 combat-related casualties with a confirmed 17,000 Russians slain. This 17,000 figure is still under debate, as there are estimates of around 50,000 Russian troops as unconfirmed deaths, desertions, or missing, all unrecovered. On the other side, Ukraine was estimated to have lost at least 13,000 soldiers in combat, with civilians casualties also high.
Countries in the Western sphere of influence have also gotten involved, namely members of NATO, and the European Union. The EU alone has provided €3.1 billion to Ukraine, alongside lethal arms, with Poland being the latest to provide significant assistance last Thursday, providing four state-of-the-art fighter jets to turn the tides on Russian air superiority over areas like Kiev. Meanwhile, the Russians are still using outdated and outclassed arms and tanks, some dating back to Soviet technology from the Second World War. 
An increase in war crimes, including the murder of non-combatants, has called for criminal charges against Vladmir Putin, with the International Criminal Court recently issuing an arrest warrant for the president.
By many country’s accounts, including Russia herself, the invasion of Ukraine has been a historically blunderous war strategy that has embarrassed the “Superpower” on the world stage. Seeing a desperate Russia, China has been buying up tons of Russian oil on the cheap due to sanctions making western countries look for other sources, namely Saudi Arabia.
Much of the investment that China has put into Russian markets requires them to bounce back from the turmoil they are currently in, making Beijing have a direct interest in ending this Ukrainian conflict. According to the Washington Post, Beijing has propped themselves up as potential negotiators in finding a cease-fire and has crafted a 12-point proposal to reach such a conclusion.
The 12-point proposition would be bad for Ukraine, as it is absent of any demand to withdraw troops back to Moscow, but rather would either cause an occupied Russian state in Ukraine, or would expand Russian borders to include acquired land. The United States, by way of National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, stated its position on Tuesday that Xi needs to urge Russia to withdraw troops before this conflict ends, and warned Ukraine that accepting any peace agreement now would give Putin “the time and space he needs to try to reequip.”
Meanwhile, last Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida traveled to Kyiv in an effort to symbolize Western support for Ukraine. The two visits by the northeast Asian countries emphasizes the division of interests in that region of the world, with Japan pledging sizable aid and enforcements to the Ukrainian war effort. In February, just last month, Tokyo pledged $5.5 billion in humanitarian and refugee aid to Ukraine. Kishida also traveled to New Delhi before his visit to Ukraine, and there pledged $75 billion to countries in the Indo-Pacific, and thus entering a pseudo-bid war with China in worldly influence in the Asian hemisphere..

2023-03-27,CMU,China,"In case you haven’t heard, the latest development in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is actually related to its potential — though unlikely — end. China may be stepping in as a potential negotiator to resolve the conflict, highlighted in a 12-point plan released last month that emphasized a cease-fire and negotiations. This was emphasized by Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow last week. However, without Russia or Ukraine supporting these negotiation efforts, a peaceful resolution is not exactly the most likely outcome. 
What’s most interesting for me is the fact that China is even trying at all to lead negotiations for this conflict. This isn’t the first time they’ve offered to play a role in ending conflict. Charlie Campbell of Times Magazine describes how China helped broker a truce between Saudi Arabia and Iran, reestablishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. He notes that this represents Xi Jinping’s “new willingness to leverage his economic clout in third-party negotiations,” which goes against how previous Chinese leaders have approached foreign conflicts. How I see it, China is a growing world power and is simply acting in ways that are traditionally associated with world powers – the U.S. has approached conflicts in a similar way in the past, with mixed success. 
Given China’s role in these two conflicts, some have raised the question of whether this is a signal of America’s decline in influence, and a pivot to the East. To me, however, as always, context is critical. When analyzing the relationships between China, Iran and Saudi Arabia — or even with Russia — compared to the one that the U.S. has with those states, we see these nations heavily favoring China. They demonstrate this preference with their foreign and economic policy, but also in their explicit rhetoric. To put it frankly, these are situations where China has an in, and the U.S. does not. The fact that these are major sources of tension in international affairs doesn’t mean that these countries are any more likely to accept U.S. involvement. When it comes to calming tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, it doesn’t have to be a hegemony war. Maybe China was simply the best option for negotiations.
If we remove subtext from these actions, and the goal of any negotiation is simply to end war, why wouldn’t we use the most effective third party negotiator?
Of course, subtext does matter, and these negotiations do play a role in framing which nations are the most influential, have the ability to bring people to the negotiating table, and have conducive conversations for peace. The U.S. should look at how this impacts our international standing, and evaluate why these countries would pivot to China when it comes to negotiations. 
But when it comes to China's new role as a global peacemaker, there's really no need to freak out. Our international community is potentially experiencing a shift from unipolarity around the U.S. to bipolarity between the U.S. and China, and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing — just a different political order. China’s actions shouldn’t just be viewed in how they relate to the U.S., but also for what they represent in China’s broader role in international politics. And here, China’s simply stepping into their role as a major world power, and the negotiating roles that are associated with that.  
Now, I’m not saying that the U.S. should leave China to broker peace in this conflict. The close ties between Beijing and Moscow should certainly be considered before going into a negotiation led by China on a conflict where Russia is a major player. The proposed plan seems likely to leave Ukraine with the short end of the stick. However, I think we need to think twice about the reaction we have to China being a potential negotiating partner in a major conflict. This is neither unprecedented for China nor unheard of from a world power, and should be viewed as what it is: an emerging power taking new steps to fulfill the obligations of that role, and fill the gaps in negotiations left by other players in the international community. .

2023-04-03,CMU,China,"Urho Kekkonen had a singular goal as President of Finland: to prevent further war from gripping Europe, much like what he'd seen growing up. At Helsinki, with a number of countries coming to negotiate terms for a new Europe, Kekkonen did just that. His negotiations and diplomacy set into motion the rules and order that would keep Europe in one piece, set aside unspoken rules of engagement, and bring up the concept that would become critical in future diplomacy — the neutral negotiator. What Kekkonen envisioned was that a neutral country would be the main intermediary in any negotiation between two countries. While that’s not always been the case, it’s been a good guiding principle for fair negotiations between two countries. The U.N. has acted similarly in the current day, with its large, unwieldy general assembly acting as an essentially neutral arbiter. All in all, these factors have helped create a sense for how negotiation ought to be considered.
However, China has now started stepping into the conflict in Ukraine. That is something that should be cause for concern. Last week, a colleague of mine wrote a piece titled, ""China's Russia-Ukraine negotiations plan isn't that unexpected."" She argues that China is just stepping into its role as a new superpower, similar to how it acted in past negotiations between the Saudis and Iran. The thing is, I don't believe that’s the natural step up. With Saudi Arabia and Iran, China had a pretty clear reason to intervene. They are a massive purchaser of oil from Saudi Arabia and a massive ally to Iran. China is friendly with both countries, and they don't have a regional military presence or other goals. They're not neutral in the unaffiliated sense, but they still follow Kekkonen's model for arbiters.
That is not remotely the case in the war against Ukraine. Here, China has a lot at stake, and the country has continued to display that. First, the issue of Ukrainian self-determination is a thorny issue for them, considering that the argument made by the Russians in favor of ""liberating"" Luhansk and Donetsk is based on the idea that those regions are agitating for autonomy — something China is unwilling to give Taiwan. If China were to acknowledge that breakaway states can form, that only strengthens the idea that Taiwan is a legitimate state. But beyond that, China isn’t a traditional negotiator in any regard. They are strongly allied with Russia (the two nations went out of their way to reiterate that recently), and they are neutral, at best, with Ukraine. China remains a purchaser of Russian military equipment, as well as an exporter of previously sold Russian technology. These two things, when combined, puts China as an obvious ally of Russia, an obviously biased party, and ill-fitting negotiator. 
It’s important to discuss this, because China’s only real reason to be involved in this conflict as a negotiator is if it’s trying to do what it claims the United States does. Essentially, China is saying “if the U.S. puts its nose into a bunch of international events, why can’t we.”
That’s where things get a bit complicated. While the writer is absolutely right that this would make sense if China was a world military power — this is a military conflict, not an economic one. That’s a minor distinction to most, but it’s one that needs to be focused on. China cannot park a carrier in the Black Sea and negotiate, it can’t do much of anything. The U.S. can drop a flight ceiling, shut down the air, and stop things from happening. European countries can do similar things, and use their proximity to induce control. It’s a matter of power projection. Europe projects its military onto itself; the United States, through NATO and the U.S. Navy, projects onto most of the world. But China can’t project at all into Europe as it currently stands. These negotiations lack the motivation that would make them make sense — unless China sees this as an attempt to assert power over a region it can't reasonably control.
That’s the crux of this whole thing. It’s not that China is stepping into its role, but I believe that China is attempting to expand it. By applying their economic power into Europe, without the military projection to back it up, China is acting in a surprising way. .

2023-04-10,CMU,China,"Earlier this year, the U.S. shot down Chinese balloons off the east coast, prompting speculation that the balloons were being used as spyware to gather intelligence on the U.S. Recent updates have indicated that the balloons were in fact capturing imagery and signals intelligence from U.S. military sites, and transmitted information back to Beijing in real time. 
While the balloon was passing over the U.S., China was able to control the balloon’s movement, allowing it to make multiple passes over different military sites to gather more information to transfer back to Beijing. The signals intelligence collected was from electronic signals, picked up from weapons systems and communications from personnel. However, the information China was able to gather with these passes was limited because of actions by the U.S. to “move around potential targets and obscure the balloon’s ability to pick up their electronic signals by stopping them from broadcasting or emitting signals,” according to CNN. This is largely due to efforts by the U.S. intelligence community to develop capabilities to track a “fleet” of Chinese balloons, allowing the U.S. to determine the balloon’s path and make necessary adjustments. 
Ongoing analysis on the balloon’s capabilities has given additional insight into the functioning of the device, including its power source and how its algorithms work. Even as this analysis has continued, U.S. officials have continued to release statements emphasizing that the balloon’s intelligence capabilities were not “additive,” and any information gleaned would have also been able to be collected through other means like China’s satellite network.
Despite these reports, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh notes that they cannot confirm any reports of real-time transmission, and that analysis is still ongoing. In response, China’s spokesperson has condemned any “distortion and hyping up of this incident.”
Ongoing updates will only be available as information is deemed appropriate enough to declassify. .

2023-04-10,CMU,China,"On Friday, March 31, I attended Rebecca Fannin's lecture about her recent book, ""Silicon Heartland"" in the Tepper Swartz Center. Her book was the culmination of several years of research across different cities in the Rust Belt of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. She is a tech and business journalist, whose past works include books about the rise of the tech industry in Asia generally, and China specifically. Having studied how the Chinese tech industry exploded, Fannin applied her knowledge to trends and patterns she sees in various Rust Belt cities. She describes how Pittsburgh and many peer cities are seeing the development of ""tech clusters"" —  new centers of manufacturing, research, and development that show promising signs of growth. 
While I won't deny the tremendous amount of research and insight Fannin puts into this project, I came away with the distinct impression that the ethos of this book is founded in misplaced optimism. In hoping that the Rust Belt can become the ""Tech Belt,"" the book misses the point of the term Rust Belt. This region of the country relied on a single industry — steel — in the 20th century, and the term is meant to point out the consequences of a region depending on profit from a single item. The imagery of rust feels like a pretty clear metaphor for how temporary and transient the products of capitalism are. Who's to say that the tech industry won't have a similar boom and bust, leaving midwestern cities hollowed-out and economically depressed once again. It feels misguided to see an industry grow in a region of the country and assume that the short-term gains brought on by the influx of capital to that region would lead to any kind of long-term stability.
There were a number of moments during the Q&A session where I felt that people brought up extremely valid or prescient concerns that the speaker wasn't able to really address. During a conversation about the factors that motivate industrial growth, Fannin brought up the need for ""native venture capital"" — the idea is that VC firms need to set up shop in a region before the local startup economy can bloom. This was followed by someone pointing out that Silicon Valley, the epicenter of American startups, is a notoriously terrible place to live, between its extremely high cost of living and the highly mobile, young workforce that rarely builds roots in the city. They asked if it was a good idea for a city like Pittsburgh to aspire to this to any degree, and I found that her answer did little to address this concern.
I think the business-first, wealth-oriented mindset that is reflected in this sort of tech-optimism can be dangerously short-sighted. Should the Rust Belt actually become the new Tech Belt, we would probably see massive accumulation of capital in the hands of a few industry magnates with very little trickling down to the working class. This would last until the tech industry falters, leaving cities like Pittsburgh holding the check just as they did when steel left the 80s. I would rather see institutions like Carnegie Mellon pioneering things that are practical, sustainable, and conscientious of how they impact those on the margins of society: not just hype for a second gilded age..

2023-04-24,CMU,China,"The Chinese Communist Party has again broken international law, in the same vein as their secret detention of Swedish book writer Gui Minhai and their Operation Fox Hunt campaign. Last week, the FBI arrested two members of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in Manhattan due to the illegal operation of an overseas secret police department with the sole purpose of silencing critics and political opponents of the CCP.
According to Politico, Beijing has been operating a number of illegal outposts across the world, including places like London, Tokyo, and Rome, as a remote arm of China’s security network. Advocacy groups which have begun as opponents to these overseas secret police stations estimate at least 100 countries throughout the world have these facilities seeking to harass international Chinese citizens.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has gone on record in the past rejecting the accusation of China cracking down on dissent, claiming instead that these outposts are for international Chinese people to assist in “renewing their driver’s licenses” and that the operation is completely conducted within international law. On other occasions, Chinese spokespeople have completely denied the existence of these outposts or denied them as related to Chinese police personnel, claiming that to be disinformation aimed at dividing foreign relations between the world and the Chinese government. 
In late 2022, multiple countries began investigations into these outposts, as establishing unregistered police stations on foreign soil is a violation of countries’ sovereignties. A few weeks later, the FBI raided a building in Chinatown, Manhattan, finding evidence of the CCP targeting Chinese-Americans as a way of surveillance. More evidence showed that propaganda was being distributed from these stations to local communities. 
According to the New York Times, the propaganda would consist of stories of people, when a crime is committed against them, seeking Chinese police outposts rather than local authorities, where justice can be served for them through “negotiation and education” of criminals. 
The FBI furthered the investigation into these stations, and have arrested two men operating an illegal Ministry of Public Security police station on the charges of conspiring to act as agents of the PRC and obstructing justice by destruction of evidence of their communications with an MPS official. Records held on the two men show they have a history of assisting the PRC government’s repressive activities on U.S. soil. One of the men participated in counter-protests against members of a religion that is forbidden under PRC law in Washington D.C., circa 2015. In 2018, the same man was enlisted into an operation of blackmail and harassment of a Chinese refugee to return back to the PRC. The victim reported that threats of violence against them and their family were made. In 2022, the man was involved in locating and silencing a pro-democracy activist living in California.
The man denies having done any of these activities, despite the mounting evidence against him. Furthermore, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security claims not to know the two men at all. The men are both facing a maximum of 25 years for both charges. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace made a statement on these findings: “Today’s charges are a crystal clear response to the P.R.C. that we are onto you, we know what you’re doing and we will stop it from happening in the United States of America.”
The Federal Government plans to crack down further into these outposts that are harassing innocent Americans and further preventing the illegal depredations of the CCP on internationals. As more information comes out from what the CCP is doing, it is possible that their reach in “public security” may span further than previously believed. .

2023-04-24,CMU,China,"A few days ago, I was talking to a friend of mine who became a nurse after high school. He’d worked his ass off to get that job, putting in way more hours than anyone else to get his training and license done. I don’t pretend to know how nursing works, but I knew he’d gone through a lot to get his job. 
He’d been in the medical industry for about four years, and yesterday, he told me something I’d never thought I’d hear.
He was quitting his job, and heading to an online college to do computer science. Not because he particularly enjoyed computer science — hell, from what I understood, he hated it. But it was work, and it would probably get him a job. And there was no earthly way he would continue being a nurse.
The pandemic burned out our nurses. It had been day in, day out, trying to keep people alive. Beds overflowed, and when deaths spiked over summer, they were pulling more hours, understaffed, underpaid, and overwhelmed.
It’s not just nursing. The pandemic changed work environments across the country. Dozens of senior level managers, close to retirement age, packed their bags and left. People were unemployed, and yet, there was a job shortage. 
It continued long past the end of the pandemic. Inflation has been rising, and the economy has been anemic. Manufacturing, especially in the U.S., faces a recession, led by the auto industry. Tech, the golden child of all careers, has dried up too, with Facebook — sorry Meta — Google, Netflix, and Apple facing layoff after layoff.
What the hell happened?
The tech bubble was always going to be unsustainable. Tech ebbs and flows, each time focusing on some cool new piece of science that they cheer on, and then get burned out on. In the 2000s, it was the dot com bubble. In the last few years it's been blockchain, NFTs, crypto, and “the cloud” — and now, AI is coming to take our jobs and the sky is falling.
Tech overhired, picking up dozens of devs to capitalize on how terminally online everyone was over the pandemic. Blockchain scammers and crypto hacks marketed their careers to dozens of people, who became unemployed when the rug was eventually pulled.
Nursing couldn’t find enough people, and they worked what they had to the bone. Now, nurses are quitting, and the ones that are left are being worked ever harder.
Manufacturing shuttered doors, the plants stopped working due to health shutdowns, and now, because of shutdowns in other parts of the world, they can’t get the things they need to produce.
And while all this is happening, low-wage labor, the quintessential no-questions-asked job, has been facing fewer and fewer applicants. The service sector is still seeing labor shortages, as people are unwilling to come in to work, not caring enough about the abysmal wages they’re being offered.
It’s not just us. The economy isn’t just in the shitter, to put it lightly, because the U.S. is struggling. Our semiconductor woes are because of Taiwan, our manufacturing crisis partially because of Taiwan, China, and Europe. Germany is facing its own manufacturing crisis — the once-bulwark of the EU’s economy now slowing to a crawl. China has regulated and re-regulated its economy over and over again, each time with more notice of how shaky it is. The global economy, the humming center of the world, which took pears from Argentina and put them in a little plastic cup in a Wawa off the interstate, is still feeling the aftereffects of the virus.
It doesn’t help that the Russians decided to invade Ukraine. Ukraine is a massive grain exporter, and the Russian’s butchering of Ukrainian shipping lines has made famine far more likely in surrounding countries supported by Ukrainian grain. Financial giants are now far warier of investing in Europe, China, or Russia, with all three facing the backlash from the conflict as the EU tries to figure out how to make it go away. Ukraine, on the other hand, is taking pummelling after pummelling, and finance in Europe is scared of what the war’s continuation means.
It’s hard to imagine a solution for this problem; the economy is a slow, annoying beast. It can take months for policy to impact people (by which time brain-eating aliens might have landed in Paris.) But, the hope is that things will change. Metrics keep pointing towards things getting better, and by and large, they’re less bad than they were before. Sure the economy is still pretty bad, but hey, it could always be worse!
The hope is that 2023 is the last year of the slump, and most analysts predict global growth as investment spikes in 2024 and beyond, especially in alternative energy. When the war in Ukraine ends, there will be billions pouring into the industry of that country, which will improve the economy of a number of countries as well. Things should, hopefully, get better.
Knock on wood..

2023-05-01,CMU,China,"It’s been a week since part one of this investigation was released, and I appear to have become a bit of a celebrity on campus. My wonderful fans (median age of 48, standard deviation of 8.4 years) shower me with praise, and I’ve finally received the notoriety and admiration that I ought to have already received, considering my writing genius. A friend that went to Colorado Mesa has been sending me death threats for the past four days. A pair of twins at the dueling Chinese Medical Universities have been hexing me and now I have shingles and a lower back injury. I have fourteen finals. But enough about me, me, me. You are here for the content (what a disgusting weasel-word); I’m more than happy to provide.
Central Methodist University (centralmethodist.edu): Back on American soil at last (Fayette, Missouri). Founded by a Mr. D. Rice McAnally in 1853, this CMU is quite the trivia extravaganza, a veritable “did you know” affair. Despite what some might expect, Missouri basically remained in the Union during the American Civil War. Technically neutral at the start of the conflict, by the time Missouri secessionist government officials attempted to secede, they controlled basically none of Missouri, so most people just shrugged and moved on with their lives. “It’s just a little war, right? Who really cares what side we’re on?” 
On September 24, 1864, Jesse James (before his assassination at the hands of the coward Robert Ford) and over 179 other confederate bushwackers ambushed a group of around 50 union soldiers in Fayette, Missouri, fighting up to the campus grounds of Central College (now notorious under the name Central Methodist University). Despite their strength in numbers, the confederates got their asses handed to them. Thirteen dead confederates, and they managed to only kill Thad Jackson in return. Pathetic display. 
Did you know that the only Prime Minister of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia went to CMU? (Abel Muzorewa, by all accounts a great guy.) Did you know that Steinbrenner (Seinfeld Yankees guy)’s son went to CMU? Central Methodist is a D1 school, so Mongolian football (soccer) player Murun Altankhuyag went to CMU! The only Americans that have heard of Ноён Altankhuyag are degenerate sports betters with 13-leg parlays and 12-step Alcoholic Anonymous programs. Did you know that Tyler “tyler1” “not Ninja Blevins” Steinkamp played football (football) for CMU? (He’s a gamer who gets angry. Your son that never leaves his room will know who I’m talking about.) This CMU’s endowment is approximately one percent of our CMU's, but they managed to have a special CMUEagles app with a fancy green color scheme and a map “so you don’t miss the action.” 
There are three components to the name. Fayette is in the Center of Missouri. According to Central Methodist, “Fayette has long been an area of education”, hence the University. ¯\ (ツ) /¯
And when CMU changed its name to Central Methodist University in 2004, Missouri had the most Meth lab busts in the country.
China Medical University (cmu.edu.cn): I don’t speak Mandarin, I prefer to do my research unaided by demonic machine translations, and I am blocked from visiting this CMU’s website. Nevertheless, I persisted. This was the first medical school founded by the Chinese Communist Party, and it encompasses an impressive 1.8 million square meters (or a significantly less impressive 0.7 square miles) in the heart of 沈阳. It was originally called Military Medical School of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, but comrade Mao Zedong had the brilliant idea to make the name less terrible, so they acquiesced. It is the second best Chinese University for clinical medicine. I’d love to evangelize CMU more, but they are trying to thwart me at every turn. I try to reach their website raw, no dice. Use a VPN, no dice. I even called their phone number (at 3:10 p.m. China time, so don’t you dare tell me they were asleep) and dialed 9 to get to their school section, but they left me on hold for longer than my 15 cent per minute Verizon international calling plan could handle. I’m calling it quits here, and would love for an intrepid adventurer to succeed me.
China Medical University(cmu.edu.tw): Like Mario and Wario, this CMU appears as a reflection of the previous, similar yet twisted. Similar website, just with a Taiwanese domain instead of Chinese. To a layman, this may seem more like a Mario and Mario situation, since the names are identical. However, the Chinese CMU is named 中国医科大学, and the Taiwanese 中國醫藥大學. Some of the characters are different. This looks to be yet another great school in a region full of great schools.
Colorado Mesa University(coloradomesa.edu): These are a bunch of posers. How are you going to stake a claim on the illustrious CMU acronym in 2011? That’s far too late to join the fight. I shouldn’t even mention the college formerly known as Grand Junction Junior College or Mesa College or even Mesa State College in this article, but I know that my Americo-centric audience would whine and moan about its lack of inclusion. I bust my balls cataloguing everything there is to know about some lesser-known institutions of more or less learning. I must applaud this CMU for their student newspaper “The Criterion.” I love its fancy-schmancy website with matching editor headshots! and dropdown menus! (gasp) Their journalism appears competent, and their April Fools issue has some heaters. I specifically liked “CMU hires renowned chemist Walter White."" Their readership numbers seem rather low. Luckily, we don’t post our viewership numbers on our articles. This CMU isn’t without faults though. They are a D2 sports college, legitimately pathetic. Either be D1 with good sports, or D3 with a good school. D2 is just a mediocre sports school with a 32 percent graduation rate. It’s telling that the “Why Choose CMU?” page on their website is three tweets long. But in another life, I could see myself joining the Maverick Network as a CMU alum. The ambiance seems cozy. Hopefully someone on their newsroom name searches this article, and we’ll develop a Criterion x Tartan rivalry.
Capital Medical University (ccmu.edu.cn): This is a Chinese medical university, not to be confused with China Medical University or the other China Medical University. You’ve got to realize that there are many Chinese people (more than 80 million), and therefore many Chinese people necessitating medical care. Once you realize that there are many Chinese people, so much begins to make sense. To us, it can appear that they are running out of names, but this is purely a demonstration of the weakness of the English language, a reverse of the slaying of the Chinese Jaberwocky astoundingly performed by Doctor Yuen Ren Chao, and chronicled in a wonderful issue of “The Believer”. I however am no linguist, and again admit defeat on the Chinese issue.
Central Mindanao University (cmu.edu.ph): Known as the “Academic Paradise of the South,” this Filipino university does not disappoint. First of all, I must thank the anglophone hegemony, centuries of colonialism, and the legendary bag-fumbling of the Spanish empire, for Filipinos speaking English, and therefore letting me read their website without a dictionary by my side. I did my due diligence here, and I can confirm that this is a real, legitimate university. It was founded it 1910, and received its CMU denomination in 1965, two years before we did! They are a research university just like us, and they aren’t another goddamn medical school. CMU PE uniforms are emblazoned with “Mens sana in corpore sano.” Now I don’t speak Tagalog, but that text is actually in Latin, so I can translate it as “Sound mind in a sound body.” This CMU, unlike some others, actually cares about the mental health of its patients. CMU Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Dr. Leo Labrador expounded on this: “Bakit? Ang youth natin ngayon very oriented with the social media, parang, kahit na magkasama sila.” I’d like to see Dr. Jahanian say that.
Central Michigan University (cmich.edu): This is the big one, the big Kahuna, the real CMU. When I search CMU finals schedule, they come up. When I search CMU dining, they come up. “Oh, it says CMU dining, it must be the right link!” NO, YOU IDIOT. That’s CMICH dining, maliciously reported as being CMU dining by the frauds in Google. And I’m not jealous of their award winning student newspaper that has won the National Pacemaker Awards for best college newspaper six times since The Tartan last won. I’m not jealous of their happy students. I’m not even jealous of their location in a town literally called “Pleasant.” Because jealousy is the victim of success, and my CMU is so superior, that listing all its qualities would require 200 pages. But here’s just one bit of C(arnegie)M(ellon)U(niversity) superiority. We may not be the oldest, but our domain sure is! Always on the forefront of technological innovation, we were the first non-DARPA organization to get a .edu page! (And second to get any domain, after Symbolics.) But I’d like to rub it in. Here’s a list of all the CMU website founding dates I could gather (legally). I had to fill out so many CAPTCHAs (name coined at the real CMU btw) to get these, so just be grateful:
Carnegie Mellon (cmu.edu): 24-Apr-1985
Central Michigan University (cmich.edu): 02-May-1991
Canadian Mennonite University (cmu.ca): 15-Nov-2000
Central Methodist University (centralmethodist.edu): 20-Jul-2004
Caribbean Medical University (cmumed.org):31-Jan-2007
California Miramar University (calmu.edu): 05-Feb-2007
Colorado Mesa University (coloradomesa.edu): 08-Jul-2011
So what did we learn? Perhaps that our CMU lives, as pitiful as they may seem to us, are but specks in an ocean of horror that other CMU students reside in. Maybe we can be content with going to a top three CMU. Maybe most of the other CMUs don’t even have enough going on to fill an article. Why can’t you just be happy?.

As the semester comes to a close, I wanted to share a little about my favorite books I’ve read since January (some of which I’ve mentioned in previous Novel-teas). I hope that this inspires your summer reading and makes the light at the end of the tunnel that is finals week a bit brighter.
“Breasts and Eggs” by Mieko Kawakami
This is the best book I’ve read this semester and probably my current favorite. “Breasts and Eggs” is a Japanese lit-fic translated by Sam Bett and David Boyd into English. Kawakami’s prose is unmatched, painting a breathtaking portrait of womanhood centered in Japan. It tells the story of Natsu, her older sister, Makiko, and Makiko’s daughter Midoriko as each faces challenges with their identity and establishing their lives. The novel is split into two parts: “Breasts” and “Eggs.” In “Breasts,” Midoriko has stopped speaking to her mother, a silence which causes each of the women to reflect on their fears in their womanhood and identity. “Eggs” takes place a decade later when Natsu struggles with her career and being unmarried and childless. The novel completely reshaped how I think about my own womanhood and the writing was captivating. I seriously encourage everyone to read this.
“Loop” by Brenda Lozano
“Loop” is a Mexican translation published by Charco Press in 2019. It is a fascinating story about a woman waiting in Mexico City for her boyfriend, Jonás, to return from Spain. The novel serves as a diary of sorts for the narrator where she explores everything from dwarfs to swallows to friendship to the art of writing itself. She treats writing as a coping mechanism and likens herself to Penelope from “The Odyssey.” She explores what it means to wait, love, and to think. Lozano writes in a stream of consciousness style, but her words are more intentional than you can ever imagine. 
""The Twilight Zone” by Nona Fernández
Another Spanish translation, Fernández’s “The Twilight Zone” provides enrapturing insight into Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship. Taking a fictionalized account of the true story of Andrés Valenzuela, Fernández’s terrifying and innovative novel explores the nooks and crannies of trauma and how a society tries to recover. The narrator is a child when she sees a magazine with the headline “I Tortured People.” A member of Pinochet’s secret police had walked into a dissident journal’s office and testified to the horrors he had committed. The narrator explores these terrifying horrors through a comparison to the television show “The Twilight Zone.” She explores how that period in history was so confusing, so painful, that it could be compared to the portals of the “The Twilight Zone.” It is an incredible novel about traumatic legacy and what it means to remember. 
“Interior Chinatown” by Charles Yu
“Interior Chinatown” is not what you expect. An exploration into race and the roles we are forced to play, Charles Yu writes in the style of a script where every character plays a role. The novel stars Willis Wu who “doesn’t perceive himself as the protagonist in his own life”. Willis is simply “Generic Asian Man” until he gets the chance to attain the most prestigious role in Chinatown, “Kung Fu Guy.” Playing with reality and fiction, “Interior Chinatown” is a biting, devastating, engrossing novel about stereotypes and what it means to push back..

2023-05-01,CMU,China,"Last week, President Biden announced that a Biden-Harris re-election bid will be on the 2024 presidential ballot, when he will be at the age of 82 years young. Currently the oldest man to ever be president, Joe Biden will be 86 by the end of his second term if he wins re-election. However, many nay-sayers today criticize him on a number of issues and find him unfit to be president for another four years after 2024. Everyday the American people seem to grow more circumspect of Biden, in particular regarding his age, cognitive ability, and decisions in office. All things considered, if Biden is the best candidate that the Democratic Party has for 2024, they might be in serious trouble.
One particularly loud criticism we hear against Biden is the speculation that he might be suffering cognitive decline. NBC News recently released a poll on what voters think about Biden's reelection; it found that 70 percent of voters — including 51 percent of Democrats — believe that Biden should not run for a second term. 48 percent of them say his age is a “major” reason for that, while 21 percent say it’s “minor.” It doesn’t seem to be politically-charged hearsay that Biden is too old for the position. Anecdotally, from my conversations with people across the political spectrum, my impression is that many people believe we can do better than an old man with a habit for muttering at speeches.
Biden’s speculated decline in mental awareness has garnered comparisons to other presidents who’ve suffered from mental decline. Ronald Reagan was the subject of similar discussions and speculations during his later years as president. Such speculations were validated when in 1994, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Another example is Woodrow Wilson, who late into his presidency suffered a major ischemic stroke in 1919, causing him to effectively be a husk that his wife Edith Wilson moved to run the country. One can find a number of other examples of politicians who have suffered decline in office. Americans found it to be such an issue that in 1967, the 25th amendment was passed in case a president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” 
There is a question of whether such an amendment will ever be used against our current president. In the same way that those presidents had their speculations, President Biden has his. As a matter of fact, speculations against Biden have gotten so common that upon typing “senile” into Google Images, he is one of the first images to show up. It is these speculations which have brought people to demand that Biden not run. Of course, many of these demands against Biden come from a place of political bias. For example, candidate Nikki Haley (R-SC) called for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75, clearly targeting Biden and former president Trump, the latter of whom will be 78 in 2024. But such a sentiment is not uncommon among many voters. To them, it is clear that neither Biden nor Trump should be the decision makers for the American people; rather, new blood in the White House is not only preferred but necessary.
Other issues that people see with Biden are concerning his decisions he’s made as president so far. Approval ratings for the president have not been above 50 percent since August of 2021, the month in which U.S. troops fully withdrew from Afghanistan. Inflation has been a hot button issue for many people since he’s taken office leading to disapproval from all sides. The war in Ukraine, tensions with China, border security, and crime rates are all issues that many voters are condemning Biden for not handling well.
The issue with the Democratic Party come 2024 will be rounding up independents to vote for Biden. Though not as vocal as the parties, independents make up the majority of the votes in the country. If they are not appeased, as they are not now, Democrats will have a rough campaign going into 2024. If electing Biden was a referendum on Trump, we will likely see the pendulum swing the other way — and if the Democrats aren’t ready, Biden may end up being another one-term president. .

2009-01-19,CMU,India,"Sonya Barclay, a recent Ph.D. graduate from Carnegie Mellon, died of cancer Dec. 25 at Presbyterian Hospital. Barclay, 49, received her Ph.D. in history last spring.
Barclay did not pursue the common path in life. She devoted herself to taking care of her sick parents for much of her adulthood, putting off her aspirations of obtaining a college degree until she was in her 30s.
Barclay earned her degree in history from Indiana University of Pennsylvania before coming to Carnegie Mellon.
“When she got to Carnegie Mellon, her first year or two in graduate school were very difficult and very rough,” said Scott Sandage, an associate professor in history and one of Barclay’s advisers. “Five of the six students that came in with her didn’t stay past the first year.”
Barclay, however, was not discouraged. She continued her study of history to the end, despite many hurdles placed in her way.
“Sonya was the bravest person that I ever knew, and that had more to do with the way she lived than the way she died.… The reason that I think Sonya was so brave was that she was the first person in her family to go to college, and many people her hometown and her family circle didn’t understand why she wanted to go to college at all,” Sandage said.
Nothing could stop Barclay from following her dream, though, and receiving her degree last May was the culmination of years of hard work and waiting. 
After graduation, Barclay began a job at her undergraduate alma mater as a history professor while continuing to teach her course, “American Countryside: A Survey of Rural America,” at Carnegie Mellon.
“She was a genuine rural American, from Indiana County, Pa. It seemed to me most remarkable that she was able to engage CMU undergraduates — who must be the least rural student body in the U.S. — in the subject. 
But she did,” said David Miller, one of Barclay’s teachers and a reader for her dissertation.
Others agree that Barclay’s ability to engage her students — especially in rural American history — was remarkable. 
Paul Eiss, an associate professor of history, said, “I remember her walking off to class, carrying farm implements like a butter churn, or a scythe, or any number of other things that I can’t even identify, looking forward to yet another class in which she would use those objects to make rural history vivid and vital to her students.”
Everyone that came into contact with Barclay seems to view her as a talented, committed, and remarkable person, as well as a thoughtful and engaging student and teacher. “She was a determined and creative scholar, as well as a generous one,” said Diane Shaw, an associate professor of architecture and reader of Barclay’s dissertation. “More than that, Sonya genuinely cared about people and had a knack for making us feel special, and that’s why we will miss her so.”
Barclay’s interactions with friend and fellow history Ph.D. candidate Ruth Kittner reflect this as well.
“When I was in Germany, conducting research for my dissertation, she visited my elderly mother nearly every week. I know my mother appreciated her regular visits, hearing about CMU, Sonya’s students, life in the department, and Sonya’s many adventures searching Indiana County for old barns and houses,” she said. “I will miss her far more than I can appreciate now.”
As a teacher, Barclay was dedicated and compassionate, Kittner said. “She cared deeply for her students. She would spend hours reviewing student papers, for example, commenting, suggesting revisions, praising, and encouraging.”
“The other thing I have gathered about Sonya is that she had built up a devoted following among undergraduate students,” Sandage said. “You wouldn’t necessarily expect that a non-traditional student like Sonya from a farming background in a very rural part of Pennsylvania would become a role model for Carnegie Mellon students, and my understanding is that she did, and that undergraduate students really admired her in addition to feeling like they learned a lot from her.”
An on-campus memorial is being planned for Barclay. For more information regarding the date, time, and location of the memorial, contact Scott Sandage (sandage@andrew.cmu.edu)..

2009-01-26,CMU,India,"The lethal wave of cholera that broke out in Zimbabwe last fall is rapidly spreading to other parts of southern Africa, devastating communities in its path. Indian waters are heavily contaminated with pollutants dumped in them by drug factories. Naturally occurring arsenic washes ashore on the coasts of Bangladesh.
All of this contaminated water claims thousands of lives every year. Waterborne disease is hard to battle, but certainly not impossibly so. With the creation of “LifeStraw,” a customized line of water purifiers introduced by Vestergaard Frandsen, high-ranking specialists in emergency response and disease control textiles, combating waterborne infections may not be so hard anymore.
The LifeStraw series includes two water purifying systems: LifeStraw Personal and LifeStraw Family. While LifeStraw Personal is a portable device meant for individual use, LifeStraw Family is aimed at groups of people sharing the water distributed from the filter.
Both systems effectively remove 99.99 percent of all bacteria, viruses, and parasites from contaminated water. Also, both can be used as point-of-use treatment filters. This basically means that they can be located at the faucets in single households, enabling pure water to flow in from residential taps. They can be carried, stored, and even shipped with utmost convenience due to their lightweight construction.
LifeStraw Personal is particularly geared toward the traveler, since it conveniently provides the user with safe, clean drinking water wherever they are. Despite its portable structure, it can filter at least 700 liters of water.
With a high impact polystyrene outer shell, LifeStraw Personal resembles a clinical syringe and has a neck string attached to it. The primary active ingredient used here is halogenated resin that is prepared without using any halogen acids. Halogens deactivate the harmful bacteria, making the water safe for consumption. After careful testing on common bacteria like Escherichia coli B and Enterococcus faecalis (indicators of fecal contamination) and virus MS-2 coliphage (an indicator of human enteric viruses), LifeStraw Personal proved to eradicate large quantities of these contaminants, removing particles as small as 15 microns.
Furthermore, it can be easily used in rural areas that experience irregular electricity supply or are more prone to power outages, since it requires no electrical power or spare parts at any point. LifeStraw Family, on the other hand, is a larger-scale product with a higher flow rate and the ability to purify highly muddy water. It comes with a wide blue bucket to contain the water, while the filter sanitizes the water.
It can filter at least 18,000 liters of water, thus providing hygienic drinking water to a family for up to three years (based on the assumption that a family’s consumption will not exceed 20 liters daily).
Just like LifeStraw Personal, LifeStraw Family does not depend on electricity or battery charge, and does not require any spare parts during its lifetime. LifeStraw Family has undergone tests at the University of Arizona similar to the ones performed on LifeStraw Personal for its lifespan, durability, and microbial reduction performance. 
The water purification systems are equipped with easy-to-clean pre-filters and purifier cartridges.
Vestergaard Frandsen has also launched a program that makes it possible to donate LifeStraw systems to impoverished regions that have restricted access to clean water and where waterborne diseases are rampant.
IMA World Health and Rotary International are some of the major donation agents that supply LifeStraw to these areas. The Danish manufacturers have also conducted a pilot study using LifeStraw in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The LifeStraw line has been approved by the World Health Organization and has received several accolades and awards during the past decade, including the “One of the ‘Ten Things that Will Change the Way We Live’” award by Forbes Magazine and “Best Invention of 2005” by TIME..

2009-01-26,CMU,India,"Mutation increases heart disease risk
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Around 60 million people worldwide carry a heart disease mutation that, according to a study, is most common among people in India. In fact, by 2010, researchers have estimated that India alone will have 60 percent of the world’s heart disease cases.
The mutation is a deletion of 25 bases of the genetic code from MYBPC3, the heart protein gene that was found in two Indian families five years ago. The mutation results in an enlargement or thickening of the heart muscle that weakens it by reducing its ability to pump blood. The symptoms usually become more prominent in the middle age and can cause sudden cardiac death.
Genetic screening can help identify the mutation gene at a younger age so that it can be possible to develop drugs to correct the mutation.

Mono still prevalent among students
Although Mononucleosis, or the “kissing disease,” has been common for a long time, a definite cure or vaccine for the disease still does not exist. Mono is spread by close contact and has symptoms such as fever and severe fatigue. 
Since mono is such a common disease, experts feel that it has not received the importance it deserves.
There is still no vaccine or drug that can combat the Epstein-Barr virus, the herpes virus that causes mono. Doctors have prescribed steroids to patients with mono. The body can never actually get rid of the Epstein-Barr virus, which makes it difficult to find a drug that goes into the cells to treat the virus. Hank Balfour, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota, is optimistic about a new antiviral drug called “valomaciclovir” that may help patients recover faster.

Family abuses dementia patients
There are about 24 million people worldwide who have symptoms like memory loss and problems with orientation that lead to several forms of dementia. Researchers have concluded that people caring for family members with dementia often abuse them by shouting and swearing.
The study, reported in the British Medical Journal, found that a third of the people abusing their family member said that their abuse was significant, in some cases even physical. This abuse is causing some patients with dementia to forget their loved ones.

Clean air increases life expectancy
Cleaner air has caused a five-month boost in the average life expectancy in the United States. The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted by researchers from Brigham Young University and the Harvard School of Public Health.
The researchers say that this is the first study that has shown this increase of a few months in average life expectancy. Since 1978, the average life span has increased almost three years and at least five months can be attributed to cleaner air.

2009-01-26,CMU,India,"“Curry and Cumin: A Night of South East Asian Entertainment” was held last Friday night by Khalil’s restaurant on Baum Boulevard in Shadyside. Dalel Khalil, whose father originally bought the restaurant that has found a home in Oakland for nearly half a century, emceed the event, which featured a completely vegan buffet, an Indian dancer, Pakistani singing, and an exotic Middle Eastern belly dancer. And, needless to say, the “heat and flavor” brought to this event by the combination of so many different cultures was more than enough to guarantee a great evening for all who attended.
The food served at the restaurant encompasses all types of traditional Middle Eastern cuisine, and includes entrees like shish kabobs, lamb, and chicken. However, it is also a great stop for vegans and vegetarians as well. Upon arriving at Khalil’s, it was fairly obvious that the locale was not meant to handle the amount of people who had shown up for this festive event. The hospitality of the hosts was fantastic and the seating and greeting formalities took little time, despite the apparent overbooking of the event. Dalel Khalil recently wrote and published a book titled “From Veils to Thongs,” which offers a comedic yet practical look at balancing life with “one foot in the East and one in the West,” as Khalil put it. When asked about some reasons behind the multicultural event, Khalil said, “My family has always been very cultural and our mother especially taught us to be open to all cultures.”
One of the more unexpected experiences of the night involved the seating. A curtained-off area gave the appearance of cultural authenticity, until the guests were seated on the floor – due to the limited seats, the locale had become standing room only. A slight perturbance was the late start to the evening, which was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. but didn’t actually start until about 8:40 p.m. This was explained by a fellow guest as living on “Indian time,” meaning things always run at least a half-hour late.
As most cultural events begin, food was served first. If the word vegan scares you away, this description should ease your fears. Appetizers of bread and hummus, and rice in grape leaves paved the way for the main buffet entrees of rice and sauce, fried veggies, salad, pumpkin kibi, and a delicious apple and crunchy noodle dish. The food was plentiful and despite what seemed to be an abundance of guests, they managed to never run out. The food was delicious, and even someone who is the furthest from being vegan would go back for seconds and thirds at the buffet. 
Easily the most entertaining aspect of the night was the dancing. Two young women, one performing a traditional Indian folk dance and another who belly danced for what seemed like ages, held their audience entranced for much of the night. The dancing was heated and fierce, and it seemed as if the women made the music work for them. They were truly the highlight of the night and the dancing continued well into the evening as people kept wanting more.
On a more personal level, a break was brought to the evening’s festivities for Kamana Mathur, an immigration attorney who is founding a magazine titled The Pittsburgh Immigrant, which will focus on cultural happenings of all kinds in the city and is set to debut in March. In her address to the crowd, she explained, “I wanted to do something similar to what I did overseas ... helping communication between areas where there was little interaction.”
Overall, “Curry and Cumin” definitely gave more than it was expected to deliver. The food, entertainment, guests, and overall atmosphere of Khalil’s were all excellent. Khalil’s is conveniently located just a short walk down Morewood Avenue at 4757 Baum Blvd. .

2009-02-02,CMU,India,"The past two weeks yielded nothing but excitement for Melbourne, as the Australian Open, the first annual tournament of the grand slam series, just concluded. The hardcourt tournament took a toll on many players due to the intense heat wave and long matches, which led to many retires from even top players like Novak Djokovic. With over 100° weather and even hotter conditions on the court, this tournament was not only a test of mental skill but also a test of physical endurance.
On the men’s side, Spain native Rafael Nadal took home the trophy with a win over his biggest rival, Swiss-born Roger Federer, in four hours and five long sets, 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(3), 3–6, 6–2. This is Nadal’s first Australian Open win, and his fifth time defeating Federer in a grand slam final. With this win, Nadal keeps his number one ranking in the world standings.
The men’s semifinals brought the only surviving American, ninth ranked Andy Roddick, against second-in-the-world ranked Federer. Federer easily breezed past Roddick in straight sets, 6–2, 7–5, 7–5, bringing his record against Roddick to 16–2.
In the other half, Nadal faced fellow Spaniard seventh seeded Fernando Verdasco. The two Spaniards ground out five sets, each refusing to give in, resulting in a five-hour-and-15-minute match. Nadal finally triumphed when Verdasco double faulted on match point.
The women’s final last Friday was not nearly as long, but just as exciting, as the United States’ second-seeded Serena Williams crushed third-seed Russia’s Dinara Safina 6–0, 6–3 in a mere 59 minutes. This is Williams’ fourth Australian Open win and 10th grand slam title.
In the first women’s semi-final match, Safina faced off against fellow Russian, seventh-seeded Vera Zvonareva, eventually winning 6–3, 7–6(4). For the second semi-final, fourth seeded Russian Elena Dementieva faced Williams but fell in straight sets, 6–3, 6–4.
In the bottom half of the draw of the quarterfinals, Williams faced eighth seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, 5–7, 7–5, 6–1. After being down 5–4 in the second set, Williams pulled herself together to win 7–5, and gained enough momentum to crush Kuznetsova in the third set in thirty minutes.
The doubles portion of the open led to an all-sibling teams’ wins. For the men’s doubles tournament, second-seeded American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan took home the trophy with a win over India’s Mahesh Bhupathi and Bahamas’ Mark Knowles, 2–6, 7–5, 6–0. Venus Williams and sister Serena took home a decisive win 6–3, 6–3 over Slovakia’s Daniela Hantuchova and Japan’s Ai Sugiyama.
The next grand slam tournament will be the French Open held in Paris, France on clay courts..

2009-02-02,CMU,India,"Theory explains global warming
John Sternman, a professor of management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, is devising tools to help political leaders understand the nature of problems plaguing the nation. Recently, Sternman decided to focus his work on the climate in order to make political leaders, such as President Obama, understand the severity of the global warming problem our world faces.
Sternman, in his policy forum paper in a recent issue of  the Science magazine, uses the idea of the “Bathtub Effect” to explain the underlying problem behind the greenhouse effect. He explains that the atmosphere is like a bathtub with a partially opened drain. Carbon dioxide from various sources, such as burning fuels, forest fires, and car emissions, is pouring into the bathtub twice as fast as the tub can drain it. The result is a clogged drain that will eventually begin to flood.

Super Bowl ad is featured in 3D
A joint venture between Dreamworks and Pepsi has resulted in the creation of the first ad ever aired in 3D during a Super Bowl game. The commercial promoted Dreamworks Animation’s upcoming movie Monsters vs. Aliens. The ad, which is 90 seconds long, took the creators four and a half years to make. Dreamworks built its own authoring software and hardware for the ad. The movie makers also rigged a video camera that enables the director to move through a virtual scene in real time. This allows the director to decide how to use the z-axis, which adds a third dimension to film, when shooting scenes.

Scientists find Milky Way’s twin galaxy
Astronomers from the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Spain have been able to view the heart of a nearby galaxy known as NGC 253, or the Sculptor Galaxy. Using an instrument on the Very Large Telescope, astronomers were able to witness clusters of light packed around the core of the galaxy. These observations indicate that a supermassive black hole similar to the one in our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*) exists. Scientists conclude that the existence of this black hole confirms that the Sculptor Galaxy is in fact a twin of the Milky Way galaxy.

Scientists make car parts from coconuts
A team at Baylor University has discovered a way to use the outer husks of coconuts to make car interiors, floorboards, and trunk liners. The fibers are blended with polypropylene fibers, and are then molded in different shapes. The material has proven to be just as good, if not better, than current materials used to make automotive parts. Walter Bradley, the engineer leading this team, believes that using coconuts as a substitute for the synthetic polyester fibers typically used has the potential to benefit the world at many different levels. 
The husks do not burn well or give off toxic fumes, enabling them to pass the tests required for use in automotive parts. In addition, using coconuts would create a huge market for countries like the Philippines, India, and Indonesia, where coconuts are an abundant, renewable resource.

2009-02-02,CMU,India,"A recent study conducted by the Tepper School of Business was designed to analyze the life-cycle changes that employees undergo as they make their way up the corporate ladder. 
Although the study was designed to look at executives from all different types of backgrounds and experience levels, some of the most surprising results came when comparing salaries and compensations of female executives to their male counterparts. 
In a world where people sometimes assume that males have a significant salary advantage over females, women were actually observed to earn more than men in some situations.
The data set used comprised 16,300 managers who were included in the Standard and Poor’s ExecuComp database between 1992 and 2006. 
Only about 5 percent of this sample was female, although it was found that women tended to congregate in the lower executive ranks more than men. 
Although the study found that the educational background on average was practically identical for both genders, it did note that “females are on average three years younger than males, have three and a half years less executive experience, and two years less tenure on their current job.”
According to Robert Miller, a professor of economics and strategy at Tepper and a co-author of the study, this observation was just one of many which supported the finding that “women are leaving their positions more than males,” often because of outside obligations, a negative climate within the workplace, or specific desires like starting a family.
This gap in experience was found to hurt female executives considerably in terms of salaries and compensation. 
On average, the study found that the average female compensation is about $440,000 less than that of males, a significant decrease from the admittedly considerable average compensation of $2,460,000 for the surveyed executives. 
These results suggest that because of less executive experience, women are not monetarily rewarded as much as men. 
The difference in pay, however, may vary depending on the field under consideration, as shown by the 2007 Society of Women Engineers (SWE) literature review. 
The review commented that, “interestingly, in such high-demand fields as engineering and computer science, these [pay] gaps are often much smaller than in fields in which there is a larger supply of workers, even in other STEM [science, technology, engineering, and math] fields.” 
The publication also states that, in some ethnic groups, including Latinas, 
African-Americans, and American Indian or Alaskan natives, women engineers actually earn slightly more than men. 
It continues by stating that “non-Hispanic white women on average earned a little less than their male counterparts while Asian/Pacific Islander women and men had the same average salaries.”
The survey performed by Miller and his colleagues found similar results when comparing a male and a female executive of the same age, educational background, and job experience. 
They even noted that, on average, the female executive was observed to earn $100,000 more than her male counterpart. 
This result, Miller stated, could not be explained by any specific factor within the study, but was perhaps an indicator of some “unmeasured ability” that gave women executives a slight edge or showed that companies were trying to enhance gender diversity within their higher- ranked positions by providing this extra incentive for women.
Regardless of the reasons behind this result, the study did show that, at least among executive positions, females tended to fare just as well as, if not better than, males in terms of compensation and promotion. The major limiting factor proved not to be the educational background of the individual, but the tendency of females to leave their positions sooner than males.
Despite this, continued efforts to improve situations for women and minorities in the workforce have opened doors for many individuals. 
As Krystina Teoh, a sophomore mechanical engineering major, put it, “If I had lived even a generation ago, I would not have had access to the same opportunities which are available to me now.”.

2009-02-09,CMU,India,"“What kind of ally is Pakistan?” screams a San Francisco Chronicle editorial, as it brashly flaunts the futility of the U.S.’s “ally in the war on terror” to the new American administration, mocking over five decades of U.S.–Pakistan relations.
I wonder too. What kind of ally objects to being bombarded with massive drone attacks, launched by American unmanned Predator drones? I mean, how completely illogical of Pakistan to, for once, stand up for the lives and rights of its own population, rather than become enslaved by its “ally’s” historically disastrous foreign policy. How unreasonable of the U.S.’s “most allied ally” (as famously termed by Pakistan’s first military ruler and former president Field Marshal Muhammed Ayub Khan) to say that, no, you cannot keep fumbling around for terrorists on our land and shooting down our civilians. For heaven’s sake, why can’t Pakistan strike a magical balance between the transition to democracy and submission to U.S. political and military agendas? What kind of an ally is Pakistan?
The answer to that question is camouflaged in the wilderness of historic events from the Cold War to the current “war on anything remotely un-American” (pun intended).
Containment policy lit the first spark in U.S.–Pakistan relations. Emerging from the influential Truman Doctrine, the policy aimed to restrict Soviet influence in Asia by creating military pacts and political blocs in and around the continent. Urged by the U.S., several Asian countries, including Pakistan, were bundled in a collective defense pact called the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). This alliance was attractive to Pakistan because its status as a pro-Western country would gain it support when in conflict with India. While ostensibly two-way in theory, these pacts were designed to benefit the U.S. only and actually stopped the other country from defending itself from aggression by any country that the U.S. did not determine to be its enemy. Not surprisingly, this obvious imbalance did not initially come under protest by Pakistan, so long as American economic aid kept flowing in and the armed forces kept receiving their military hardware, along with the rest of the benefits that were sealed under SEATO. No wonder the authors ponder — what kind of ally is Pakistan?
It was also during this time that Pakistan, in a misguided demonstration of loyalty and friendship, allowed the U.S. to build two military bases in Pakistan that were used to spy over the Soviet Union and communist China. In 1960, from one of these bases, Badaber, in the North West Frontier Province, Francis Gary Powers took off to spy over the USSR and got shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft missile systems inside Soviet territory. This prompted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to place a red circle on the city of Peshawar in Pakistan and declare that unless the U.S. packed up its base and left, he would obliterate the entire city, leaving it to the imagination of his audience as to what type of weapon he would use to achieve this aim. The U.S. duly left Peshawar after this embarrassing episode, and Pakistan was left alone to pay the price when in 1971 the Soviet Union backed India to the hilt to dismember Pakistan forever. Furthermore, the U.S. also demonstrated immense support for Pakistan’s longtime rival, India, in terms of its economic and military growth. In an attempt to make up for this, the U.S. promised Pakistan that it would consult its anti-Soviet ally before any aid was allocated to India. However, once again the U.S. turned its back on this promise by committing military aid to India, shortly before a flaming war raged between India and Pakistan in 1965. The hostilities lasted only 17 days, but forever shattered the myth of the neutrality of U.S. leaders and policymakers. Almost all of India’s military hardware providers continued to arm India while Pakistan’s principle supplier, the U.S., clamped an arms embargo on it. The excuse was Pakistan’s growing nuclear program, which was perceived as a threat to India and Israel — India being the U.S.’s new heir to progressive democracy and Israel its recipient of military and economic aid since World War II. So apt is the question, what kind of ally is Pakistan?
Come the post-9/11 era, and the U.S. once again begins stirring this cyclical friendship with Pakistan as it seeks its full cooperation in the war on terror. This time, however, Pakistan is propelled to fight a war on its own land, against its own people. Last Friday, at least 20 people were killed by drone strikes near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. While Defense Secretary Robert Gates circulates the falsity that U.S. attacks on its land are blessed by Pakistan, Islamabad publicly denied Gates’ claim, with Prime Minister Yousef Gilani clearly saying that there is no such agreement between the two “allies.”
These were the first hits to the region authorized by President Barack Obama, and probably not the last. This year alone, over 300 civilians have been the targets of both manned and robotic American military assaults on their own soil, particularly in the Swat valley, a once scenic district in the northern areas of Pakistan. The transition in Washington has not affected U.S. foreign policy toward Pakistan but in one facet: Unlike former President Bush, who believed in stabbing the enemy (or friend?) in the back, Obama believes in a head-on collision. Obama stated up-front in his campaign that Pakistan was a key target in combating terrorism, so while the civilian deaths sadden me, they do not come as a surprise. What is indeed baffling is the existing incompetence of the American intelligence. Why, and how, does U.S. intelligence fail to accurately distinguish militants from civilians? Militant groups are on a rampage, blowing up U.S. supply routes to NATO troops in Afghanistan, while the U.S. is blindly attacking civilian homes. Why are these militants not identified in advance by the U.S.? However, as it it sleeps through the destruction of key supply routes, the U.S. deems it necessary to express uneasiness over the release of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program and a “rogue bombmaker,” to the West. No wonder then, preoccupied by non-issues, the most technologically advanced and sophisticated U.S. intelligence network falls short in identifying militant hideouts even after repeated attempts.
While Pakistan continues to be a front player in the U.S.’s conflicts all around the world, it never finds its ally — and the most powerful nation in the world — by its side when in need. Not only do such double standards in an alliance defy international norms, they also churn anti-American sentiments among Pakistanis, and thus blot the big picture of U.S.–Pakistan relations. Obama’s administration needs to learn a lesson from this history of one-sided alliances and ensure U.S. loyalty (if it is to call Pakistan an ally) to the country at times of crisis and when justified. These airstrikes only boost hatred toward the American government and drive the ordinary citizen who has lost everything to the doorsteps of religious fundamentalists. These fundamentalists then arm them ideologically and economically, setting their mind to “revenge” mode.
The surprise raids that kill hundreds of innocent civilians pose no less threats than those that external terrorists pose to the U.S. soil. It is akin to rendering the U.S. Department of Homeland Security useless by stripping it of all their power to protect citizens. Since the onset of the “war on terror,” Pakistan has sent over 100,000 of its military troops into the threatening abyss of the northern tribal areas. Yet it is accused of being an unreliable ally. Perhaps for the first time, the U.S. and Pakistan seem to share a common goal — ousting terrorist networks from Pakistani land. A blatant disregard of Pakistan’s masses is sure to jeopardize this effort. At this point, before setting out on a road to nowhere, the U.S. needs to ask itself the question: What kind of ally is Pakistan?

2009-02-23,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) is known for working its students hard, but this year’s first annual technology showcase, which displayed 12 student engineering projects, showed that all those sleepless nights of coding, soldering, and nervous breakdowns were well worth the effort.
The Tech Showcase was part of the annual National Engineer’s Week, which was hosted by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). The showcase was a new addition to this year’s E-Week events. “The Tech Showcase aims to celebrate the exciting and innovative research and technologies being developed by engineers,” Christine Ho, a senior chemical and biomedical engineering major and co-chair for E-Week, said. “It is an opportunity for students in CIT as well as students in the other colleges to explore the many ways in which engineering is changing the world.” The showcase represented projects from all different disciplines and organizations within Carnegie Mellon.
The three senior capstone projects that were displayed included a gesture recognition glove called “Hand Talk,” a fold-out toaster, and an iPod-charging exercise bike. “Hand Talk” is a project developed by electrical and computer engineering alumnus Bhargav Bhat and fifth-year electrical and computer engineering master’s students Hemant Sikaria and Jorge Meza. The device is aimed to help individuals who have hearing impairments to better communicate with other people. By wearing a glove with embedded sensors, an individual is able to make a gesture that is then transmitted to a cell phone as text.
“The cool thing about our project is that there are a lot [of] these types of gloves out there, but ours is the only one which is wireless,” Meza said. The technology behind the glove is currently being researched in regard to obtaining a patent. “Hand Talk” won the “Most Innovative Design” award at the showcase.
The fold-out toaster, developed by senior mechanical engineering students Akshay Jayaram, Leigh Fortenberry, Ian Price, and Jonathan Goetteler, is a modification of the current toaster design. 
After conducting user studies, the group found that people often have trouble removing their toast from the toaster, causing them to burn their toast, themselves, or both. In order to solve this problem, they designed a toaster in which the side walls open up and out. “We think that this is a very innovative design, and we haven’t seen anything like this in the market,” Jayaram said, “so in the future, we’re hoping to get a patent for it.”
The iPod-charging exercise bike, which was developed by senior mechanical engineers Shobit Tandon, Abe Alexander, Cason Male, and Madhu Bhagavatula, is another example of technological innovation. The design involves attaching a generator to the wheel of an exercise bike which then charges the battery of an iPod. The project won the award for best overall design at the mechanical engineering showcase in the fall semester.
Several student organizations were also represented during the showcase. The Robotics Club’s “Robot Colony Project” aims to replace one large, expensive robot, which can accomplish only one task at a time, with many smaller, cheaper robots. The robots use infrared range finders to avoid collision with walls and other robots. With the help of the range finders and encoders, the club, currently funded by a Small Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG), is trying to develop cooperative mapping behavior to enable the robot to determine its position and environment. The robot will then be able to send the information back to a central server that can then use the data to create a map of the environment. Christopher Mar, a junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering, explained, “We’re programming each robot with a very simple behavior —to avoid walls and other robots—but when you throw them all together, hopefully something bigger arises.” The Robotics Club won the “People’s Choice Award” at the showcase.
Fringe Buggy, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Racing, and Kiltie Kar were three other student organizations that participated in the showcase. 
These three clubs all focus on creating dynamic projects that are entered into annual racing competitions. Each group has performed exceptionally well in each of its respective competitions. 
Fringe has won the annual buggy design competition for the past 10 years, while Kiltie Kar placed second at last year’s national American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) chemical car competition. SAE Racing, which attends one annual competition in Detroit, placed 53rd last year in the overall competition out of 110 competitors, and also placed 23rd out  of 110 in the endurance race.
TechBridgeWorld, a Carnegie Mellon program that seeks to improve literacy among visually-impaired youth, presented the “Braille Writing Tutor” during the showcase. The Braille Tutor uses a digital stylus that interfaces to a computer, PDA, or SimPuter interface. This allows the utilization of text-to-speech software that can provide immediate feedback to the students to help them correct their mistakes while they are learning. After perfecting the use of the digital stylus, the students can then move on to learning how to use the slate and stylus. The system has been tested in India and Tanzania, and will soon be tested in China and the United States. The Braille Tutor won the “Impact Award” at the showcase.
The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) presented its project “Get In Line,” which aims to create interactive experiences for people waiting in lines. Last year, the group created an interactive game for people waiting in line for the annual “Building Virtual Worlds” show. Andrew Federspiel, a master’s student at the ETC, said, “We had maybe 200 people waiting in line playing this game. It’s scalable, so it doesn’t matter how many people join in to play.” 
The game involves players identifying themselves as either left-brained or right-brained, and then, based on this identification, they can compete in games with other players standing in line. The group, which consists of about nine members, is planning to spin the project off as their own company..

2009-02-23,CMU,India,"I subscribe to the thinking that, organically, all humans are fundamentally the same. We all need or desire the same things; we just go about getting them differently. But this happy little ideology of mine was heavily challenged this past summer. I hadn’t seen the impact of my summer abroad in Pakistan until I was in the U.S., two weeks after I had returned from Karachi. I was with friends in D.C., sandwiched in the languorous summer, to feel at ease and be young and act free. We went out at night where all the young and salacious go, but amid all of this, something didn’t feel quite right. My friend said I had been acting differently since I came back from Pakistan, because I was quieter and more serious. I guess I was overwhelmed by this nightlife I was encountering with them — so fundamentally different from the sable Karachi sky.
In Karachi, late at night — even on weekdays — families were out, being busy. Draped in luxurious fabric, the women of these families were guarded by crowds of male relatives and children. I’d admire the women’s long, dark hair and beautiful, delicate wrists. Sometimes I’d catch a clavicle and think, “Oh! How pretty!”
Most of these extended families were out so late in the lively streets to share conversations over a dinner that usually lasted two to three hours. One night, my aunts and uncles took me to a nihari shop, which serves a dish of thick gravy and tender meat, after the eight o’clock prayer. We sopped up the gingery stew with warm rounds of naan, a soft, white bread, as it was spun out of the clay kiln in which it was baked. It was hot, and we were in the “family” section of the restaurant, where the only things that were keeping us cool were the fans that were whirring rapidly. But they still weren’t enough to keep my back from growing moist with sweat, which dampened the print of my salwar kameez, a traditional dress worn by women in Pakistan that I happily sported. We ate with our hands, while I peered at the families, trying to decode their brown, sun-dried faces and deep, expressive eyes. Modest and loyal, the mothers sat proudly, while their children sat on their laps like baby birds, anticipating a hand of food in between the rushed conversation and the cramped tables.
Food became very important to me in Pakistan. It was through such pleasurable social experience that I was able to talk and listen to people whom I was unable to approach. At Aga Khan University (AKU), where I completed a neurology internship, I would enter the cafeteria, shy and alone, and sooner or later, a lonely girl would join me in my corner and I’d make a friend. These girls, once I got to know them, were all so impressive, so aggressive, and so independent. Some would just be finishing medical school at age 24, some were recently engaged to be married, while others were traveling to the U.S. to conduct research in collaboration with Pakistani universities.
In the women’s hostel at AKU, where I lived, all my friends were in their late 20s or early 30s but looked more youthful than I (some women even asked me how many children I had!). We spent most of our time talking and laughing in the air-conditioned common room. The heat was too unbearable everywhere else. They cooked for me and took care of me, and I reveled in their attention and nourishment. We gathered in the common room every evening after prayer and ate bhindi (okra) accompanied with warm bread and freshly prepared dahi (yogurt), both purchased from a man with a cart on the way to the mosque. The man had a crooked eye and tried to get me to pay more than was necessary, which I sometimes did. Occasionally, my friends Rehana and Ambreen would take me to the canteen, which sold crunchy delectable samosas, fried triangular snacks filled with potatoes and spices, and shammi kebabs, skewered mince meat with ground chickpeas, that were securely tucked into ghee-covered parathas, buttered flat bread. After that, we’d walk back with “choco-explosion” ice cream bars from the drugstore on the street corner. The owner of the store had been killed in a robbery and his brother had taken the business over. He had a sad smile and encouraged me to converse in Urdu with his children, who climbed up the shelves like monkeys to get products for customers.
With all that eating, you’d think the women would be “pleasantly plump.” But, in fact, almost all the women I saw were skinny and petite. Only Uranous, a beautiful Afghani student who was named after the planet Uranus, was “healthy,” as Pakistani women termed being chubby, like me. Uranous and I would go speed walking in fast circles below the turbid sky and sticky night, wearing our salwar kameezes, which I disliked having to wear for exercise. We’d talk about the man in her life and she’d teach me Urdu. Sweaty and tired, we’d come back to sit in the common room and watch Indian television shows at 10 p.m. over shared slices of cold mango and leftover kheer, cardamom-spiced rice pudding, from the cafeteria.
My parents were terrified of sending me to what Newsweek deemed “the most dangerous place on Earth,” but I’m grateful they finally let me visit Pakistan. It’s important to test yourself, because being so wrapped up in an unfamiliar country with your own sublime loneliness, you grow and employ facets of yourself that you never knew existed.
When I came back to the U.S., it wasn’t just the country that I was afraid of; it was all the attachments to my identity that I wanted to avoid. My alienation arose out of that night in D.C. My friends and I ended up spending it in an ice cream parlor. I was trying not to be negative, but the raspberry ripple I was eating was flat and gooey. I felt a lump in my throat. We didn’t even know what to say to each other. I had become so used to the Pakistani notion of mealtime — an intoxicating exchange of loud talking and bold flavor –– that this evening was just ending up as a big fat disappointment..

2009-02-23,CMU,India,"Increasingly, international students at Carnegie Mellon who are finishing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are choosing to pursue career opportunities outside of the United States after graduation.
Of the students pursuing degrees in STEM, 49 percent come from outside the United States, while only 20 percent of the total students at Carnegie Mellon come from outside the country, according to statistics on the university website.
Some students feel that this trend of homeward migration is in part a consequence of the general economic recession in the United States. “The crisis on Wall Street is making it difficult for any college student in the U.S. to get internships or jobs,” commented first-year engineering major Karen Yu. “If they [international students] can find better opportunities in their home countries ... there is not much incentive to stay here.” The crisis has affected all potential employees looking for jobs, not just college students.
In addition, many multi-national companies and organizations, such as Microsoft and Samsung, are expanding overseas and creating career opportunities outside of the United States. Yu explained, “Globalization and technological advances are removing geographic barriers, so job-seekers in general are going to spread out.” First-year computer science major Anuraag Jain, who is from India, also added, “I would like to find something (an internship or job during the summer) in California, but ... I’ll probably be able to still work for Microsoft or Apple if I go back to India.”
However, regardless of current events or globalization in the United States, many international students are simply obliged to return to their home countries after graduation. “Our government has awarded many Singaporean students scholarships on certain conditions,” explained first-year computer science major Jun Jie Liang. “After I graduate from Carnegie Mellon, I need to spend several years working in Singapore before I can find a job in the U.S.” The economies in emerging nations like Singapore are increasingly in demand for engineers and information specialists to compete in a more technological global economy. To encourage their youth to pursue careers in these fields, the governments of these nations are awarding full scholarships that characteristically allow local students to pursue degrees in STEM fields at many top universities in the United States or Europe. “Most scholarships require a bond of four or more years of work after graduation,” explained first-year computer science major Joseph Lum. “Our government is making an investment in us to apply what we have learned to stimulate our country’s economy.”
At the same time, the United States is also falling behind in general STEM education. According to the American Society for Engineering Education, China will likely produce almost eight times the number of engineers than will graduate in the United States this year. Students in India are also studying science and engineering at an average rate of three times that of the students in the United States.
“In secondary school, several of the required courses were about computer and information technology studies,” confirmed Jain.
The American Society for Engineering Education did note, however, that these gaps are in part due to a deliberate shift of focus to “soft” areas and liberal arts among many colleges and universities in the United States.
Nevertheless, many experts interpret trends of homeward migration and inferior STEM education as signs of the United States’ decline as a global superpower. STEM graduates play an increasingly vital role in the emerging technological economy..

2009-02-23,CMU,India,"Afghanistan poses a much greater challenge to U.S. foreign policy than Iraq, said Abdulkader Sinno, assistant professor of political science and near Eastern studies at Indiana University, at a lecture at Carnegie Mellon co-sponsored by the Muslim Students Association (MSA), the Arab Students Organization (ASO), the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, Heinz College, and the International Development Group.
Sinno, an expert on Afghanistan and author of the book  Organizations at War in Afghanistan and Beyond, laid out strategies he believes that the Obama administration must adopt if it is to succeed in Afghanistan. He elaborated on what he saw as the failures of the Bush administration, and he evaluated the strategic options that currently remain for the U.S. in Afghanistan.
Last year, the MSA invited a distinguished Iraqi scholar to discuss in a similar manner how U.S. foreign policy could improve in Iraq.
“Sinno’s holistic view of the situation in Afghanistan really broadened my view of the conflict in that region,” said Ziad Al Bawab, a Ph.D. candidate in the electrical and computer engineering department and board member of the MSA.
Sinno mapped out the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan by presenting the historical circumstances that led to it, as well as the present political framework that serves to aggravate it. Besides Taliban rule, he identified ethnic strife, opium trade, and institutional corruption as some of the major difficulties Afghanistan must overcome to avoid becoming a failed state.
Currently, there are about 38,000 U.S. and 32,000 NATO troops in the region, as stated in a New York Times article. Since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, there has been a colossal escalation in U.S. military spending on the war in Afghanistan. 
Last week, President Obama announced the allocation of 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, bumping the total up by almost 40 percent.
“One is forced to wonder why a state so notorious for its resistance to foreign occupation, did not resist U.S. occupation at first,” said Sinno.
According to Sinno, Afghanistan’s lack of active resistance to U.S. occupation in 2001 appeared to the West as a sign of acceptance, when it was in fact the crushing of the warlords that brought Afghans a temporary sense of peace.
Sinno explained the difference between the Taliban fighters that emerged victorious out of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the extremist Taliban faction of today, which dominates a large portion of the region and is known for its predatory behavior against civilians. The former were nationalistic freedom fighters who managed to reunify Afghanistan by protecting its people from the warlords. The latter, however, is a consequence of the U.S. invasion.
The Taliban’s initial agenda of strict law and order gained popularity among the Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, said Sinno, adding that this internal transition was behind the Afghans’ lack of resistance.
“The Taliban [responsible for] the violence in Afghanistan today is a re-emergence of the defeated warlords,” said Sinno.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980s stripped the warlords of their power. In response, the Central Intelligence Agency equipped the Afghan warlords with millions of dollars worth of ammunition. Armed by the U.S. and supported economically and militarily by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, the warlords not only defeated the Soviets but also consolidated power by preying on the local population and benefiting from opium trade in the region.
During the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military patronized the once-defeated warlords who in turn patronized Afghan citizens, said Sinno.
“Bush’s ‘Afghan model’ of warfare was a disaster from a policy point of view,” said Sinno. The Afghan model of warfare refers to the use of indigenous allies to replace American ground troops by employing U.S. air power, special operations forces, and weapons. “It allowed the defeated warlords to re-establish themselves and regain influence, degenerating Afghanistan into chaos,” he explained. 
Further, there has been a dramatic increase in militant and insurgent groups other than the Taliban since the U.S. invasion.
“Warlords and local leaders are seeing where the wind will blow, so they can safely join the winning side. The day these insurgents join the Taliban, the U.S. will lose this war,” predicted Sinno.
Sinno also said that President Hamid Karzai’s government defeats the purpose of establishing a democratic state because it does not allow the creation of parties, centralizing all political power in the hands of Karzai.
In addition to Afghanistan’s corrupt government, the growing drug economy, and poor infrastructure, the instability in neighboring Pakistan deserves immediate U.S. attention, said Sinno.
Instead of further arming Afghan militias by forming the Afghan Public Protection Force, the U.S. must devise a Marshall Plan for Pakistan, said Sinno.
On the recent allocation of troops to Afghanistan by the Obama administration, Sinno said that the surge would only work if it were a part of a broader, more comprehensive strategy to stabilize Afghanistan.
Sinno brought the lecture to a close by proposing that President Karzai must allow the Taliban to run in democratic elections later this year.
“If they accept to run in elections, they will not get a lot of votes. And if they do get considerable votes, they will become a part of the state apparatus,” said Sinno.
President of the ASO and sophomore science and humanities scholar, Bassem Mikhael, said, “An excellent lecture. I was impressed by the conversational nature of the event. We really wanted to generate healthy discussion, and it did exactly that.”.

2009-02-23,CMU,India,"Last week, Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the United States, expressed his optimism regarding the democratic future of Pakistan and the strengthening of U.S.-Pakistan relations as he addressed a packed convocation co-sponsored by Heinz College and the Center for International Politics and Innovation.
The ambassador discussed how the political transitions in both Pakistan and U.S. administrations are likely to shape foreign policies adopted by both nations.
“The U.S. and Pakistan need to establish a strategic relationship based on a shared worldview, and President Obama and Vice President Biden understand that. They know what needs to be done,” said Haqqani.
Silvia Borzutzky, teaching professor of political science and international relations at Heinz College, stated in an e-mail, “Ambassador Haqqani’s discussion of the difficulties involved in Pakistan’s transition to democracy, as well as the expectations that Pakistan has of the new Obama administration, were particularly interesting.”
A former journalist and senior adviser to former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, Haqqani is currently a professor of international relations at Boston University and co-chair of the Hudson Institute’s Project on the Future of the Muslim World. Haqqani is also the author of Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military.
According to Haqqani, the United States has always viewed Pakistan as a “strategic real estate,” from which it can launch its own initiatives without paying much attention to the people of Pakistan.
Pakistan and the United States have been close allies in the war on terror since its launch in 2001. However, the growing Taliban insurgency and al Qaeda safe havens in northern Pakistan, and unauthorized U.S. air strikes in the tribal regions have often soured diplomatic relations between the two countries, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told CNN’s Stan Grant during an interview last week.
In an attempt to destroy alleged terrorist havens, the U.S. has launched 30 air strikes into northern Pakistan since last September, in which over 200 people were killed, as stated in The Guardian.
“We understand that there are components in Pakistan that have gone extreme, but we have to protect our civilians,” said Haqqani.
Haqqani emphasized the importance of the Kerry-Lugar initiative that promises Pakistan $1.5 billion annually in non-military aid. The aid will be allocated to critical areas like education, infrastructure, environmental efforts, women’s empowerment programs, and entrepreneurial projects.
The K-L initiative is an important building block of a partnership between the U.S. and Pakistan, rather than a short-term military alliance, said Haqqani.
“As the ambassador argued, Pakistan is faced with a large number of challenges and as a result the Obama administration will have to balance many contending interests,” stated Borzutzky.
“Future [U.S.] policies will have to be mindful of the need to preserve Pakistan’s sovereignty, the stability of Pakistan’s new democracy, the future role of the Pakistani military and the security services, and the U.S. strategic needs in the region,” she stated.
“As a Pakistani, I was proud of Ambassador Haqqani’s positive and motivated approach towards the welfare of our country and the rest of the world,” said Madiha Tariq, a master’s student in the Heinz Public Policy and Management program.
With regard to Pakistan’s pivotal role in the international community, Haqqani also stressed the fact that Pakistan is only six decades old and thus a relatively new country.
“The government needs time to learn. People who are living in Pakistan are going through more than a transition; they are going through transformation. We are in the process of rebuilding the institutions of state,” said Haqqani.
Under immense pressure from the United States and opposition parties in Pakistan, former president General Pervez Musharraf was forced to hold democratic elections after nine years of military rule.
“None of Pakistan’s governments have been as inclusive and democratic in the past,” said Haqqani, indicating that democracy in Pakistan may not be an illusion after all.
“It seems like Pakistan is rapidly moving towards democracy,” said Inyoung Song, a research associate at the Department of Social and Decision Sciences. “The ambassador did a great job in making sense of the situation in Pakistan,” she said.
Another major aspect of Pakistan’s transformation plan is the marginalizing of militants and integrating “those areas with pockets of terrorism” into mainstream society, said Haqqani.
On the situation in Swat Valley, now dominated by the Taliban, Haqqani pointed out that the media had summed up a complicated situation into attention-grabbing “sound bytes.”
Recently, the Pakistan government allowed the imposition of the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Shariah in Swat, which permits banning girls from school, women from venturing outside, and any form of entertainment.
“The government of Pakistan has not negotiated with the Taliban militants,” said Haqqani, but with the indigenous people of Swat who have long sought a system dictated by Shariah.
“Our purpose is to drive a wedge between the Taliban and the indigenous people,” said Haqqani.
The Pakistan government announced a permanent ceasefire between the Pakistan Army and the Swat Taliban on Saturday. 
However, according Reuters news report, Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah told an illegal FM radio, “We heard that the government announced a permanent ceasefire, but we have announced a 10-day ceasefire and we will consider an extension when it ends.”
“The distinction made here between the Swati Taliban and the indigenous group is an important issue,” said Tariq.
“If this is the real on-ground situation, then the Pakistani media must be allowed to enter the region and report it. Until we do not hear what the civilians of Swat have to say about this, we cannot be certain that this is the right move,” Tariq also said.
The Ambassador also talked about India’s important role in Pakistan’s transformation.
“India and Pakistan can work together in areas of education, energy, and cultural development,” said Haqqani.
Haqqani also said that despite the geopolitical odds faced by Pakistan, it has the capacity to turn them around for its own and others’ benefit.
“Pakistan may be at the crossroads of conflict, but it is also at the crossroads of opportunity,” he said..

2009-03-23,CMU,India,"Robotic fish detect pollution in water 
British scientists have developed robotic carp-shaped fish that can detect pollutants in water. 
The robots exhibit movement similar to fish and are equipped with chemical sensors that allow them to detect pollutants from leaks in ships and underwater pipes. 
The robots then transmit signals back to land through a Wi-Fi system. In addition, the fish do not need a remote control for navigation and are able to move underwater independently. Each fish is about the size of a seal and costs $29,000.
The fish will first be tested in the sea near northern Spain. If the trials of the first five fish are successful, the team hopes to use the fish in rivers, lakes, and seas all over the world.

Astronomers detect  saltwater on Mars
Scientists from the University of Michigan have discovered droplets of salt water present on the leg of the Mars Phoenix Lander. 
The results were based on pictures of the Phoenix lander, in which droplets appeared to coalesce on the leg of the rover. 
Previously, scientists believed that water was present on Mars in the form of ice or vapor, but these findings suggest that liquid water is present on the planet.
The scientists believe that constant temperature changes in certain regions of Mars and the presence of salt in the water prevents it from freezing. This increases the chances of having life on Mars, as liquid water is an essential component for life to exist.

Study proves bird species endangered
A recent study called “The U.S. State of the Birds,” shows that one third of the 800 bird species in the U.S. are endangered. 
The study concludes that causes for the declining population of birds include such problems as pollution and habitat destruction.
The report claims that over the last 40 years, the population of grassland birds has reduced by 40 percent and that of arid land birds has reduced by 30 percent. 
The report showed that the situation is especially dire in Hawaii, which once contained more that one third of all the American bird species. 
Now, most of the Hawaiian bird species are endangered. Scientists believe that extensive climate change will make the situation worse, and that this problem needs to be worked on.

Scientists discover new bacteria
Scientists from the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) have discovered three new species of bacteria in the upper layers of the Earth’s stratosphere that are resistant to ultraviolet radiation.
The bacteria were discovered in samples collected by a balloon sent by ISRO in the stratosphere. 
The samples retrieved by the ISRO contained 12 bacterial colonies and six fungal colonies. 
Out of these colonies, three were of bacteria that had not been previously discovered. Scientists believe that this could be an indication of the  presence of extraterrestrial life.

2009-03-30,CMU,India,"The idea of studying abroad has a fascination that catches everyone’s attention. The thought of traveling away from home and visiting another country, not as a tourist limited to hotel rooms but as a traveler, living and eating the way the citizens do, sounds exciting and adventurous.
Carnegie Mellon offers its students ample opportunities to go on an adventure and learn from another country (read about students’ study abroad experiences in Tales from Abroad), but, for many students, studying at Carnegie Mellon itself is an adventure. International students come from all over the world, ranging from far-east countries like South Korea to European countries like Scotland.
Why the U.S.?
The reasons for studying abroad in the United States are many. Some are studying abroad for the cultural experience, while others because of the academic excellence that the U.S. offers.
Vicki Johnstone, an exchange student from Scotland and a junior English major, sheds some light on her reasoning behind coming here. “I always wanted to do a study abroad but never knew exactly where…. I had been to America twice before on vacation and have always really liked America and all that it offers. I had hoped when I was growing up to be able to live some place like America and felt that going on an exchange to here would enable me to gain some experiences and see how life works here,” she said.
Tubtim Eawchoowongse, on the other hand, focuses on the quality of education she can gain by studying here. She is from Thailand and is a sophomore electrical and computer engineering and economics double major. She traveled here “because the U.S. offers a more flexible education. At Carnegie Mellon, for example, I could take classes outside my department and pursue other areas of my interest.”
Other students base their decision on the difference between the education system in their country and that in the U.S. Young Woong Park, an international student from South Korea and a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, explained in an e-mail that admission into South Korean universities is very difficult and is solely based on academic performance. “However, in the U.S., students are highly encouraged to develop their own interests by participating in club activities,” he went on to write. “Even if a student in the U.S. has a bad GPA or bad SAT scores, if he/she has interesting extra-curricular activities, he/she has a very good chance of getting into a good university. People might have different preferences about these two educational systems; however, I didn’t like the Korean educational system as it forces students to study, no matter what their aptitudes are.”
What’s different?
One of the most interesting things to note is how other countries differ from the U.S. Be it a variation in the units of measurement used or the side of the road on which vehicles are driven, many differences are noted by international students between the way things function in the U.S. as compared to their own countries.
Johnstone complained about the confusing and unhelpful nature of the banking system in the U.S. that constantly results in her getting overcharged with hidden fees. She also noticed that taxes aren’t added until the item is billed at the register. “I always think that I have the right amount and then go to the register to pay and they stick on another 7 percent….!”
Stefan Gutstadt, a junior business administration and French double major, comes to Pittsburgh from Johannesburg, South Africa. According to him, one of the most notable differences between South Africa and the U.S. is that while in the U.S., the predominant language is English, South Africa has 11 official languages. This makes communication in the U.S. much easier.
Gutstadt also thinks that South Africans are more politically active than Americans. “I feel that people back home take current events extremely seriously, and there are often public marches, rallies, or gatherings concerning pertinent issues,” he explained. “Once, I remember a national union stopped the traffic in Johannesburg for several hours during a government wage dispute.”
Park pointed out that the diversity that exists in the U.S. is not present in South Korea. “There is only one race in Korea, but in [the] U.S., there are many different kinds of races living together,” he wrote. “Also, [the] U.S. is much larger than Korea; we can go everywhere by a car in Korea but not in here.”
You say po-tay-to, I say po-tah-to
One of the main difficulties in transitioning into life in a new country is adjusting to the ever-present cultural differences. These differences may be small, like the usage or pronunciation of a word, or large, like the way people interact with each other in social situations.
Manasi Patil, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major and an international student from India feels that culturally, “the way [Indians] define friendship…, the way the weather does or doesn’t affect, the way [Indians] behave with our professors” are just some of the vast differences between Indian and American culture.
Johnstone feels that the major difference between American and Scottish culture is the use of words in different contexts. “I would say the main differences are to do with speech.... We’d say ‘bin’ instead of ‘trash can,’ ‘rubbish’ instead of ‘garbage,’ ‘petrol station’ instead of ‘gas station,’ ‘sweeties’ instead of ‘candy,’ ‘juice’ instead of ‘pop,’ ‘plaster’ instead of ‘Band-aid,’ ‘crisps’ instead of ‘potato chips,’ and ‘chips’ instead of ‘French fries’” she said. “It can get a little confusing!”
In countries like South Korea, China, and Thailand, on the other hand, the cultural differences extend beyond just everyday speech. In these countries, behavior in social situations differs remarkably. It’s important to note these differences so you don’t make a faux pas when you visit.
“Body language,” Christine Lee, a senior economics and philosophy double major, immediately identified a cultural difference between China and the U.S. She emphasized that while people in the U.S. find it normal to hug while greeting guests, this is not the norm in China. Excessive touching is not typical, and people prefer handshakes instead.
The code of conduct in classrooms in South Korea is slightly different. “The first thing I was surprised about when I came to the U.S. was when I attended classes, students crossed their legs and put their legs on other chairs in front of professors, which is viewed as rude in Korea,” Park wrote. In order to be respectful, Koreans maintain decorum in front of elders.
Eawchoowongse seconds this difference in behavior toward older people. “Thai people tend to be more polite and reserved. They also tend to be respectful to elders and would not make fun or tease them unless they are really close,” she said. “Whereas I found that in the U.S.,... a sense of humor is always a bonus, and the best way to connect with others is to approach them actively with a smile.”
Looking more closely at the differences in ways of living, Gutstadt emphasized that “South Africans … tend to have a more relaxed outlook on life.… Several of my friends working in Cape Town have a strict ‘rad waves’ policy to stop work and go surfing if the sea and sun are right.”
Overall, studying abroad is a great opportunity for students to get out of their comfort zone and experience something they have never seen or heard of before. All the students mentioned above affirm that life at Carnegie Mellon has been interesting and exciting, and all the initial adjustments, whether it’s language or weather, are short-lived. So, take a chance and discover another country..

2009-03-30,CMU,India,"Don’tcha wish your girlfriend was hot like Britney?
So do we. 
The Pussycat Dolls opened the Britney Spears’ Circus concert last Friday at the Mellon Arena. Scantily clad women who paid roughly $700 came in droves to trollop backstage, gawking at Spears’ dressing room door and waving good bye to Mama Spears on the way to the VIP standing-only section of the concert floor. 
The Dolls started with a bang, singing live with glittery microphones and wearing midriff-baring outfits. They brought the audience to their feet with live renditions of “Buttons,” “Jai Ho,” and “I Hate This Part Right Here.” All of the Dolls were fantastic dancers, executing complicated moves and painful stretches with ease.
After the opening act, the pre-show began, complete with clown theatrics, acrobatics, and martial arts. Perez Hilton starred in an introductory video and then the curtain went up and the real circus began. 
Spears appeared from under the curtain dressed as a circus ringmaster in bright red and gold and captivated everyone with her hit single “Circus.” After a quick costume change in which Spears donned a tiny black and gold outfit, she came out on stage in a golden cage singing “Piece of Me.”
Each act continued with more extravagance than the last, including a stunt in which Spears was blindfolded and carried into the air by two men attached to a trapeze. Halfway through the performance, Spears announced that she was going to slow things down and began to sing the ballad “Everytime.” She sang this song while sitting in the crook of a suspended glittery umbrella revolving over the stage. 
One of the most vibrant costume dances was Spears and her dancers’ Bollywood-esque performance. With bright and shiny Indian clothes and an Indian beat to “Me Against the Music,” the performance was vivid and captivating. The show was choppy, as it was interrupted by numerous costume changes. During one lengthy costume change, the circus performers from the beginning of the show returned to the stage.  
To show appreciation for her dancers, one segment in the middle of the show spotlighted each dancer showing off his or her individual skills. After two hours of performing, Spears and her crew closed the circus with “Womanizer.” She took her bow, walked off stage, and left the crowd wanting more. Some would say that the show was short, perhaps because no one can ever have enough of Britney.
The concert didn’t feature many songs from Spears’ new album, and the popular, high-energy songs crowds crave were few and far between. While the overall concert performance was amazing, there were some scenes in which Spear’s dancers were definitely out-performing her.

2009-03-30,CMU,India,"Tens of pounds of spaghetti were in sight in the University Center on Friday as students raised money to improve the vision of poverty-stricken families around the world. Alpha Phi Omega, the co-ed service fraternity, hosted an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner with all proceeds going toward Unite For Sight (UFS), a nonprofit volunteer organization aimed at educating people on and eliminating preventable blindness, both locally and internationally.
Lauren Campbell, a junior biological sciences major and member of Alpha Phi Omega, spearheaded Friday’s dinner in an effort to raise money for her volunteer trip to India this summer to work with a rural, poverty-stricken eye-care clinic.
According to Campbell and the UFS website, 80 percent of blindness is curable or preventable, leaving 36 million people needlessly blind.
“There’s a lot of need in this country, but it gets even more extreme when you go abroad,” Campbell said. “You know you’re directly impacting people who really need the help.”
All students wishing to volunteer for UFS in the summer are required to raise $1500 individually for the organization — Campbell hoped to accomplish this goal with the dinner.
In addition to the money, students are asked to get 300–600 pairs of eyeglasses donated to UFS and to shadow an ophthalmologist in order to be ready to assist the doctors in daily treatments, such as vital checks, screenings, and real-life surgeries including cataract removal.
Campbell spoke excitedly about how just one routine cataract removal can mean the return of sight for a person who has been blind for 40 years due to a lack of access to medical care.
While Campbell’s dinner focused on the international goals of UFS, the organization itself has multiple sections.
Alice Zhang, a junior biological sciences major and leader of the local Unite for Sight chapter, explained the difference between the two main branches of the organization at Carnegie Mellon.
“The first part, the fundraising [Global Impact Corps], is for international communities that are stricken by poverty and, in some cases, by war. One hundred percent of the funds goes to areas like Africa and Asia to promote eye care,” Zhang said.
“The second part, the vision screening and vision education, is local to Pittsburgh and something the volunteers in our organization actively participate in.”
“We are teamed up with the Guerrilla Eye Service (GES)  from UPMC, which is a group composed of professional ophthalmologists, residents, and medical students.” 
UFS also hosts a global health conference and, as in the case of Campbell, sends students abroad to help with their eye clinics around the poverty-stricken world. 
Carnegie Mellon has a student campus representative to provide information to students on volunteering abroad through UFS.
Zhang spoke of the importance of eye treatment internationally.
“Without sight, we are crippled. We have those beeping traffic signs in Pittsburgh, and on campus there are Braille signs so that the blind can still live and work normally like everyone else, but in places like Ghana and India, no one is granting the blind these favors, or cutting them any slack at all,” she said.
Ashley Kilp, a junior science and humanities scholar,  leader of UFS’s Global Impact Corps, and campus representative for international UFS volunteers, traveled abroad to India last summer and spoke highly of the experience that Campbell is about to have. “We ran clinic camps in city slums and rural villages where we would screen over a hundred people a day for various eye problems; some we were able to fix with a free pair of glasses, but others required more serious treatment,” Kilp said.
“We brought those in need of further care back to the clinic to receive treatment. I even got to scrub in on their cataract surgeries.”
Kilp spoke of the joy she felt when seeing peoples’ faces light up when they could see for the first time with the distribution of a new pair of glasses, or with the removal of the bandage from a cataract removal.
“The people were so grateful that they often provided lunch for us,” Kilp said. 
“In a clearly destitute seaside village, the people who likely were struggling daily to feed themselves gave us a meal of rice and fish curry. Knowing what they had to sacrifice to show their thanks to us in that way made that the best meal of the trip for me,” Kilp said.
Upon return from her trip, Kilp became the campus representative for the international volunteering portion of UFS, providing information on opportunities to students and assisting in pre-departure advising. 
Kilp also started Global Health Corps, chartered by the national organization, which holds fundraising efforts for the UFS eye clinics abroad. 
Global Health Corps is new this year; despite having only a few members and currently without CoSO (the Committee on Student Organizations) recognition, it is hoping to grow.
Kilp enjoyed her experience so much that she plans to continue her international service. She is going to study abroad again, traveling to Ghana, where she will do much of the same work and also assist on a research project exploring the factors affecting high rates of preventable blindness.

2009-03-30,CMU,India,"Bravely overcoming hurdles that disrupted their “Long March,” Pakistani lawyers were not only successful in forcing President Asif Ali Zardari to fulfill his promise of restoring the judiciary, but also managed to earn Pakistan a commendable reason to be in the headlines.
Earlier this month, a stream of lawyers, activists, and students marched across the country demanding the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry and the 60 judges who had been sacked by former President Pervez Musharraf. To prevent them from challenging the legitimacy of his re-election, the so-called “democratic” government of Pakistan attempted to suppress the movement by mobilizing an otherwise apathetic police force and blocking its advancement with enormous shipping containers.
Images of elderly men and women literally being tossed into police vans splashed across national television. Both inside and outside Pakistan, many view this restoration of an independent judiciary as a critical first step toward Pakistani democracy. Undoubtedly, the people of Pakistan made history by overturning an unconstitutional decision.
Reaping the imagined fruits of this victory, the masses feel empowered, and once again, Pakistanis all across the world are citing the “power of the people” in the war-torn nation. As a Pakistani, I too took pleasure for a while in exploring this beautiful mirage known as “the power of the citizens,” which is a rare sight in Pakistan today. It was refreshing to see that change had occurred in Pakistan not because of U.S. intimidation, but because of the positive will of educated citizens. However, despite my pride and patriotism, I could only avoid the facts and entertain this fantasy for so long.
Besides Pakistan remaining a lawless state buckling under the irrational decisions of its government and the Pakistani Taliban, a major consequence could have arisen from Zardari’s refusal to reinstate the rule of law — and it has nothing to do with the persistence of the “people.” It has very much to do with continued U.S. backing of Zardari, as well as the $1.5 billion in non-military aid from the U.S. (the first influx of a total of $7.5 billion over five years) that has just poured into Pakistan.
Political analysts had already begun suggesting that Zardari was deliberately dodging the restoration of the Chief Justice, since it would unearth the issue of an amnesty provided to Zardari by Musharraf that immunizes him against charges of massive corruption. An independent judiciary may also call into question the president’s day-to-day actions, sapping away a large chunk of his unlimited powers. Zardari’s aides already claim that the president has an “image problem.”
This kind of publicity could not have helped, yet it did not deter Zardari. On the other hand, the leader of the opposition party, Pakistan Muslim League (N), Nawaz Sharif, alleged that the Supreme Court, under Zardari’s orders, stopped Sharif from assuming public office while it deposed his brother Shahbaz Sharif from the position of Chief Minister of Punjab, the second largest province in Pakistan. To defy the criminal and corruption charges against him, Sharif was joined in leading the mass lawyers’ movement that, if successful, would to a large extent nullify all allegations against him. The government placed Sharif under house arrest during the long march, causing his supporters to lead a fueled rally of their own. That is when the riots caught flame.
This kind of anarchy and instability in the region was more bothersome to the U.S. than to the leadership of Pakistan. The reason is simple: The U.S. cannot afford to see the current leadership in Pakistan fall to pieces because such an incident would destabilize the U.S. operation in Afghanistan, as well as hinder the “war on terror,” now resurrected under President Barack Obama as the “overseas contingency operation.”
Furthermore, “told-you-so” sighs from the Indian media, which is committed to endlessly victimizing the nation at the hands of its struggling neighbor, did not fall on deaf ears. The Bharatya Janta Party (BJP) has not restrained from cautioning the U.S., as it provides aid to Pakistan. With opposition for U.S. support of Pakistan soaring in India, a potentially important ally, the U.S. cannot be seen backing an ineffective government.
So when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly threatened to revoke the U.S.’s promise of providing Pakistan a total of $7.5 billion in non-military aid, Zardari was left with little choice.
It is interesting that Clinton has suddenly begin to consider herself an authority on the country, because until last year, she did not have a clue about the election process in Pakistan and believed that if Musharraf was running in elections for the parliament, he must do so according to the same rules followed by all the other candidates, while in reality Musharraf had already elected himself for the next five years.
Moreover, she took the liberty to dictate the course of internal affairs in a country where the U.S., hypothetically, is supposed to foster democracy. Assisting her was the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband. How ironic, then, that the U.S. must feel the need to repeatedly adopt a bullying strategy toward Pakistan, and include its former colonizer Britain in the game, in order to secure its own interests.
It comes as no surprise that shortly after announcing the hefty aid package, Obama also laid out his new strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan. Once again, Pakistan has been paid to compromise its sovereignty and open up its borders to U.S. foreign policy that may not be in the best interest of the people. By means of economic intervention, we have flashed a green signal for complete political and military intervention and established a sense of servitude to flawed U.S. foreign policy.

2009-04-13,CMU,India,"How can we interact more naturally with cell phones, laptops, and robots? How is technology being used in the developing world? How are online social networks changing the way people live? Computer-human interaction research aims to inform the future design of interfaces so that we can interact more naturally with services and devices, which in turn are designed to make our lives more fulfilling. CHI is the foremost research and professional conference of the field, which this year took place from April 4–9 in downtown Boston.
Carnegie Mellon displayed its superiority in the field of human- computer interaction by being heavily involved in the planning committee of the conference and also winning a number of awards. Scott Hudson and Bonnie John, both  professors of human-computer interaction, and Mark Baskinger, assistant professor  of design, were all on the conference committee for CHI 2009.  
Notable among the award winners were the recipients of the student research awards. Zhiquan Yeo, a senior computer science and human-computer interaction major, won second place in the undergraduate student category for his work “KTE2: An Engine for Kinetic Typography”, while Patrick Gage Kelley, a Ph.D. student in the Institute for Software Research, won first place in the graduate student category for his work “Designing a Privacy Label: Assisting Consumer Understanding of Online Privacy Practices.”  
Also, Sara Kiesler, Hillman professor of computer ccience and human-computer interaction, won the lifetime achievement award at the conference. 
The conference also consisted of talks given by experts in the field from Carnegie Mellon and around the world. As a part of the six-day conference, Matthew Kam, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, gave a talk on Monday based on his paper “Designing Digital Games for Rural Children,” which won an honorable mention.
According to Kam, there is “no magic bullet for why the quality of schooling is poor in the developing world.” Kam was motivated to study the design of educational video games for rural Indian children by previous research, which has shown that math skills can be improved through video games. Kam’s group found that the children did not understand Western games very well. By observing the children at play, Kam was able to identify the principles and motivations behind their games, which he then used to design educational video games that children found both interesting and familiar.
In the same session, Danish researchers Olaf Frandsen-Thorlacius and Kasper Hornbæk, among others, presented “Non-Universal Usability?,” which also won an honorable mention. Usability is a battery of objective and subjective measures that quantify how suitable an interface or piece of software is for a user group. In studies of computer-human interaction, it is typically thought that users understand and think about usability in the same ways around the world. The questionnaire that the researchers distributed asked Danish and Chinese participants to rate the importance of various aspects of usability of word-processing software such as effectiveness, ease of use, visual appearance, and satisfaction.
The researchers found that the Chinese participants favored visual appearance and satisfaction more than the Danish participants, and that the Danes sought effectiveness and efficiency more than the Chinese. The presenters concluded that the field’s definition of usability “may capture the aspects of usability but not their importance” across cultures.
In the Metrics session on Tuesday, David Akers, a Ph.D. student in computer science at Stanford, gave a Best Paper presentation titled “Undo and Erase Events as Indicators of Usability Problems.” Using Google SketchUp, a free online 3-D modeling tool, his team evaluated the suitability of backtracking events as indicators of usability problems. One measure of usability problems is self-reporting, which is when the user reports a problem in words, overtly. 
Akers and his team found that backtracking actions in the user interface, such as “undo,” were equally indicative of usability problems. This is an important finding because it suggests that good usability metrics can be collected automatically, without any special effort from the user of the software. 
From Tuesday through Thursday, the Interactivity Exhibit showcased work by conference-goers in interface technologies. Members from the RWTH Aachen University in Germany demonstrated a multitouch table with interactive widgets, called Silicon illuminated Active Peripheral (SLAP) widgets. Multitouch tables are large, flat surfaces that display data like a computer monitor and use touch-sensing technology for input. “A problem with today’s multitouch tables,” said project leader Malte Weiss, “is that there is no feedback.” When using a keyboard-like input method on a flat, uniform surface, the user’s fingers tend to drift and cause errors, and so the user has to divide his or her visual attention between the virtual keyboard and whatever he or she is actually working on. The SLAP widgets, clear plastic devices that are placed on top of the table, provide helpful tactile feedback.
Alexander Hoffman from RWTH demoed TypeRight, a prototype keyboard interface with variable key resistance. By varying the resistance of the keys based on the possible spellings of a word, the prototype was able to decrease typing errors by a large margin.  A group from Hochschule Bremen in Germany presented an interface called SoundTorch for searching among many songs. SoundTorch simulates a flashlight, and the songs in your library are like coins on the floor. Whichever songs are in your beam are played simultaneously, and when you hear something promising, you can zoom in to narrow down on the song you are looking for. The interface takes advantage of the “cocktail party effect,” which describes a person’s ability to pick out what he wants to hear from a large number of sounds.

Arctic ice caps prone to melting this year
With the onset of spring, the melting of the ice caps in the Arctic Ocean has also begun. Data predict that the ice caps are more vulnerable than ever this time. Measurements made by satellites suggest that the ocean area covered by ice this year is one of the lowest ever.
Also, a high fraction of that area is capped by first-year, thin ice, which is more prone to melting than thick, old ice. 
Multi-year ice’s thickness is greater than three meters, but first-year ice is only two meters thick.
Walt Meier, a remote sensing analyst at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., stated that although the ice extent has recovered slightly in the past year, the average thickness is quite low.

Study finds galaxies to be young 
Contrary to the popular belief that galaxies started their evolution after the Big Bang around 13 billion years ago, a study conducted by a team led by an Indiana University astronomer has found that some massive galaxies, such as the Milky Way, actually formed only recently.
This prediction was made because it was found that these massive galaxies have chemical abundances that indicate very little evolution. 
The heavy metals that indicate the age of a galaxy were found in relatively low abundance in these galaxies. 
This means that the galaxies may have formed recently and are cosmologically young.
The study predicts that the galaxies may have formed only 3–4 billion years ago.

New craft harnesses wind power
A British man named Richard Jenkins claimed the world land sailing speed record when he drove his vehicle, Greenbird, to 126 m.p.h. on the dry Lake Ivanpah near the border of Nevada and California.
Greenbird is described as having elements of an airplane, a sailboat, and a Formula One car. It is a carbon fiber composite craft and harnesses wind power. 
The vehicle has a mass of 600 kilograms and can travel at a speed four to five times greater than wind speed. 
As a result of the high speed, the downward force of the wings can increase its weight to a ton. 
The wing bearings and the wheel are the only parts of the structure that are made out of metal.

2009-04-13,CMU,India,"New test helps fight cervical cancer
A recent study shows that a new DNA test for detecting the human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, is far more effective than the Pap smear test that is commonly used to detect the virus.
The results were based on a eight-year study conducted on 130,000 women in India. This is the first study to show that just one screening with the DNA test is better than all other methods at preventing cancer and death. Right now, the test is funded by the Gates Foundation and costs $5. Qiagen, the company that manufactured the tests, believes that the price could go down with increasing demand for the test. 
Scientists believe that women over 30 could stop having the Pap smear test every year and could just have the DNA test once in three, five, or 10 years.

Doctors carry out face transplant
Doctors at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston have performed the country’s second face transplant. This is also the seventh face transplant performed in the world.
The surgery took 17 hours, and the skin of the face, the nose, the muscles of the face, the upper lip, and the palate of the patient were replaced by transplants from a deceased donor. Unlike usual transplants, the patient had not undergone immunosuppressant therapy before the surgery. The immunosuppressants are necessary to prevent the patient’s body from rejecting the organ transplants. However, the use of these drugs weakens the body’s immune response and increases the risk for infections. The patient was put on immunosuppressant therapy after the surgery was performed and will have to take the medicines for the rest of his life.

Multivitamins show faulty composition
According to a study of multivitamins conducted by ConsumerLab.com, a New York-based company, more than 30 percent of tested products contained different proportions of components from those reported, and also contained traces of lead.
The vitamins tested included three that were used by children. These products contained more than the tolerable amounts, as issued by the Institute of Medicine, of components like vitamin A, folic acid, niacin, and zinc. One product for men contained excess amounts of folic acid, which in large quantities can lead to prostate cancer, while another product contained lead. Of the products tested for women, one provided less than the claimed amount of vitamin A.

Researchers find fat that burns calories
Brown adipose tissue (also known as brown fat) is found in young children, babies, and small mammals, and keeps them warm by burning calories when triggered by low temperatures. A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine claims that adults also have brown fat. The results showed that people who were thin had a higher proportion of brown fat than those who were obese. Scientists believe that brown fat can help determine how the body reacts to food and how fat is used in the body.

2009-04-13,CMU,India,"For undergraduate students, this weekend will bring with it childhood fun and wild times, and for some, hard labor and plenty of splinters. Starting Wednesday night, Carnegie Mellon undergraduates will forget coursework — for once — and rejoice in Carnival, with fun typically attributed to those under the age of 12.
For most first-years, that age represents two-thirds of their current age. Even for fifth-year students, 12 years is more than half the time they have been alive. Carnival manufactures nostalgia for a time within a decade ago for these undergraduate students.
Meanwhile, hiding deep within their computer clusters and research labs, doctoral students trudge on, oblivious to the raucous behavior occurring outside their Wean Hall homes — out in the terrifyingly bright sun, if the weather smiles on us. Even though Thursday and Friday classes are canceled for most of campus, graduate students continue to work on projects, bury their noses in books and studies, and go to meetings with advisers and research partners.
In one of my courses, the instructor was discussing the schedule for the rest of the semester. One student pointed out that she had planned a class on April 16 — the Thursday of Carnival.
“You graduate students aren’t going to be involved with that,” the professor exclaimed, frustrated she could not hold class on that day. “It’s an undergrad thing.”
Students in the class looked to me at this comment. My academic colleagues are aware that I am an atypical graduate student — I actively participate in campus organizations and remain on campus for things other than my research. I’ve eaten dinner at Schatz and paid for my greasy, late-night Underground repast with DineX. I spend nearly all of my free time in the University Center and a good deal of my social life with undergraduate students.
Still, my anomalies aside, graduate students have the same opportunities to dedicate time and energy to the campus that undergraduates do. While most graduate students will not be putting in 20+ hours this week constructing a booth like I will, they can venture away from their computer or out of the library for a few hours this weekend and experience the hard labor that scores of fellow students have devoted to bring a fun and memorable Carnival to the whole campus.
The scents of deep-fried Oreos and funnel cakes will permeate the Morewood parking lot, a space soon to be filled with carnival rides and games. Robots — referred to as “mobots” — will race along the chalk path outside Wean Halls. Pocket-sized students will be shoved up and down hills in tiny soap-box cars. There will be a comedy show on Thursday and a concert on Friday. Of course, for the undergrads, one of the most important aspects is Booth.
Student organizations — in which graduate students can take an active role, though most do not — construct shacks that contain unique and original games. This year’s theme, Epic Adventures, is sure to inspire creative designs following a variety of ideas, from Indiana Jones to Where the Wild Things Are. Even if they’re not putting in the labor hours of booth construction, graduate students can support this hard work by growing down a little and playing games.
Carnegie Mellon, as a whole, takes this event seriously: Several dining locations will have extended hours and prime parking spaces, and several roads within and around campus will be out of use for days. While some parts of the campus community — such as the Heinz College, which has not canceled Thursday and Friday classes — may not consider it a big deal, most of the campus will turn its attention to this weekend and its events.
Graduate students are a significant part of this school, bringing groundbreaking research and powerful awards to the university. Unfortunately, many of the undergrads never see them; graduate students rarely become part of the Carnegie Mellon social scene. The easiest first step is to take part in the major campus phenomenon known as Carnival..

2009-04-20,CMU,India,"Carnival at Carnegie Mellon is not just any other carnival — it’s the epitome of creativity, innovation, and excitement, made possible by the campus community. But one of the most important elements of Carnival that reflects the creativity of the campus is Booth. Every year, the members of fraternities, sororities, and a range of cultural, academic, and service organizations build and design booths according to a common theme.
Booth is not just a display of design and architectural expertise; it is also a competition. Organizations not participating in the main competition build blitz booths instead.
This year’s theme for Carnival was “Epic Adventures,” and Carnival-goers were overwhelmed by a sense of nostalgia when seeing the different booths, as many of them evoked recollections of some of everyone’s favorite childhood stories.
From the entrance, Delta Delta Delta’s “Jack and the Bean Stalk” booth was eye-catching and intriguing. The booth was complete with a little flower garden and sparkling green leaves that gave a welcoming feel. Although small, the castle at the top was glittery and fairytale-like, and the booth stayed to true to its purpose and was in the shape of a giant beanstalk. A walk through the inside really felt like an experience of the events of the tale, and the signs telling the story with their storybook-font cutouts on a life-size page really set this booth apart. The colorful decorations and designs were bound to be exciting for children.
In contrast, but still rather captivating, was Kappa Delta Rho’s booth titled “KDR Journeys to the Center of the Earth.” KDR’s booth took its visitors on an actual adventure down through the different layers of the earth’s surface. A passage through the booth was a mark of having survived a perilous feat. 
One of the features of the booth that was quite amusing was an electronic walkway depicting a stream with pebbles that sensed the impact of feet stepping on it, and as a result produced ripples on its smooth surface. The environment was truly epic and the inner Earth-like feel was very realistic. Also fascinating was a large moving drill hanging from the ceiling, and the overall rush of accomplishment felt before exiting the booth.
Moving along on Midway led go Stever House’s Finding Nemo blitz booth. The Stever House community is dedicated to biologically and environmentally friendly practices, and a look inside their booth revealed that they held true to their mission. Even the shells of the tiny sea turtles on display were made by cutting out the ends of green plastic bottles. Laura Filliger, a first-year biological sciences major, explained how working on the booth for Stever House gave her and the team a chance to really get hands-on and work on a major project as first-year students. “[With other booths], a lot of the upperclassmen are doing the really important jobs, while with Stever you are a freshman and you are doing all the important jobs,” she said. The team put together a fun booth and gave visitors a chance to take pictures of their faces in Nemo and Dory cutouts.
Next up was Fringe’s “Fringe: Where the Wild Things Are” booth. Mike Niedzwiecki, a senior chemical engineering major, highlighted their choice of a timeless tale. “We’ve had a lot of people, three generations deep, come in and say ‘Oh, this was my favorite book as a kid,’ and it’s nice to see people’s faces light up,” he said. The detailed paintings of mysterious creatures and lights on the ceiling intended to give the effect of a twinkling sky, making visitors feel as if they were working through a life-size storybook.
Of course, epic adventures can also be portrayed as treasure hunts, and the “Sig Ep presents The Goonies” booth by Sigma Phi Epsilon did just this. What’s more is that the Goonies story is a parallel to SigEp’s story of creating it. Billy Snow, a sophomore architecture major, explained the situation. “[In the movie The Goonies], there is a group of kids completely different from each other, same as our house, who came together to accomplish their mission. In the end, we all came together to this one final design, which is an amazing feat because our house is so diverse,” he said. A look both inside and outside the booth showed the hard work of the entire team that had produced the final product.
On the other side was the Taiwanese Student Association’s “2043 AD” booth — a terrifying look into the future coupled with a caution for environmental conservation. A step into the TSA booth certainly felt like a step into the future. The organization was very accurate in creating props like mailboxes and a fire hydrant. Upon descending on the escalator-like stairs, an announcer with a robotic voice cautioned against environmental hazards and informed listeners of the time the next train was departing. Posters, subway signs, a model of a train compartment, and the overall subway feel were rather eerie and gripping. Very much in line with the theme was the save-the-world game situated at the end of the booth. The concept was meant to stand out as a unique epic adventure.
Also meant to stand out with its bright hot air balloon and cheery clouds was the “Around the World in 80 Days” booth next door by MayurSASA and the International Student Union. Paintings of monuments such as Paris’s Eiffel Tower, London’s Big Ben, the Egyptian Sphinx, and the Indian Taj Mahal, coupled with a rocking boat, made this booth attractive and fun. Also notable were the intricate models of Paris and Egypt. The most interesting part, as Yasaswi Raparla, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, pointed out, was the making of the hot air balloon. “The hot air balloon is actually made from the fabric used in commercial hot air balloons,” he said. The hot air balloon also made for an enjoyable photo backdrop for many visitors.
From the corner of the eye, it was easy to spot the dome-like structure that was Kappa Kappa Gamma’s “James and the KKGiant Peach.” The choice of story drew people of all ages to the booth, and the three-dimensional pictures of the story were a nice touch and were easy to follow. To top it off, this booth even smelled like peach. The dome was a testament to the team aim of straying from the standard rectangular booth design and using the structure to fit the story. The dome was geodesic — a spherical structure made up of a pattern of self-bracing triangles, which gives a maximum structural advantage. And for those who are still wondering: Yes, the dome was supposed to be a peach.
Overall, all the booths at Carnival were amusing to see, and the hard work put into making them made this year’s Carnival a major success and a memorable event.

2009-04-20,CMU,India,"Few compilations of short stories pack a punch like AIDS Sutra does. Sutra — the Sanskrit word for “doctrine” or “narrative” — has been most popularly recognized as a part of the phrase Kama Sutra, an ancient Indian doctrine on sex, and while the usage of sutra in the title of this book is not intended to bring up this linkage, the association is fitting considering the discussions of sexual matters that the book elaborates on.  
Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, AIDS Sutra consists of real, raw, moving stories written by some of India’s finest writers, both those living in India and those of Indian descent living elsewhere in the world. Such authors as Man Booker prize-winning Salman Rushdie and Kiran Desai have contributed to this collection. The book also has an interesting foreword written by Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1998, that provides an insight into the economic impact that AIDS can have on a country, a perspective that is hardly ever written about. 
The book approaches all the repercussions AIDS can cause: issues of ethics and secrecy for the patient, spouses unknowingly contracting the disease from their infected partners, orphaned and HIV-positive children, the consequences for the gay population, and many more. The stories are set in Indian society, one that is bound by a multitude of social constraints and stigmata attached to the idea of AIDS. All the writers describe personal experiences that they have gone through in coming in contact with the disease and being inspired to write something moving about it.
Desai’s story, “Night Claims the Godavari,” explores the world of sex workers in India and describes intimate details of their lives. She succeeds in invoking pity in the reader, even making the sex worker’s profession seem justified. These women have difficult lives that are bound by poverty and desperation, and the risk of contracting AIDS makes their situation even harder. 
Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi relates the story of a gay actor and how he tries to run away from the disease when it begins to take over his life. His words describe many HIV-positive people’s situation: a life plagued by constant fear — fear of being discovered, fear of the disease, fear of death. In the midst of all this fear, people tend to lose themselves and their identities. 
Rushdie’s story, “The Half-woman God,” is one of the most moving stories of all. He describes how AIDS affects the hijra population in India. Hijras are castrated men that, due to their situation, are ostracized from the community and are forced to spend their lives as prostitutes and beggars. Due to prostitution, they are constantly at risk of contracting AIDS. Rushdie gives readers a view into the lives of these hijras and thus strings together the connection between AIDS and yet another community in the Indian society.
Prostitutes, the gay population, and hijras all encapsulate different facets of the impact that AIDS has. But perhaps the most pitiable impact is that on the children of AIDS patients. Most of these children are also HIV positive, having inherited the disease since birth, and will live short and brutal lives. Many of them are orphaned as well, making life all the more hard. In his story, “*Bhoot ki Kahaanian*” — meaning “ghost stories” — Jaspreet Singh retells his experience spending time with HIV-positive children in an orphanage, describing many heart-rending stories about the lives some of these children lead.
All 16 stories contained in the book are unique. They evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader — sorrow, pity, shock, and anger. It is appalling that the number of HIV-positive people in India is growing so rapidly, but the Indian government refuses to acknowledge it. It is pitiable that AIDS patients are not granted the same rights and given the same status in Indian society as other individuals. .

2009-04-27,CMU,India,"Crêpes Parisiennes is not a restaurant, nor it is a café or a bistro: It is a crêperie. 
With one crêperie in Shadyside and another one close to Carnegie Mellon on Craig Street, Crêpes Parisiennes serves up crêpes, paninis, espresso, French tea, and pastries to the local community, and Carnegie Mellon students are regular customers at both locations.
But what is not common knowledge is that the start of this crêperie is actually closer to Carnegie Mellon than its Craig Street location. 
David Handler, the co-owner of Crêpes Parisiennes, discovered his love for crêpes soon after he graduated from high school. In the late 1980s, he spent a semester in the American University at Paris, and while he was there, he noticed that crêpes were on menus everywhere, but there was no place that sold crêpes in Pittsburgh. 
Later, after working as a photographer around Europe, including five years in Paris’s fashion industry, Handler moved back to the United States and started Crêpes Parisiennes. In 1998, Handler, along with his wife Shannon Reilly, moved back to Pittsburgh and started to sell crêpes from a cart on Margaret Morrison Street, between Posner Hall and Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. 
Handler bought his first crêpe iron with the support of Reilly, who was his girlfriend then. It was right here at Carnegie Mellon that Handler first started making fresh crêpes from the cart and endured the outdoor Pittsburgh weather through its various moods.
Handler said that “through rain, sleet, snow, I was out there with my umbrella making crêpes. It was like camping every day.” Selling French crêpes seemed to be the right thing to do at that time, and the international community at Carnegie Mellon welcomed Handler’s crêpes. Later, in 2000, Handler was able to expand his business from a camping crêperie to a more permanent settlement. He bought a coffee shop that was going out of business on Filbert Street, right off Walnut Street, in Shadyside.
There, Handler worked hard to modify the coffee shop into a charming crêperie. He was even down on the ground fixing the floor. As the crêperie was being furnished, Handler guarded the crêpe iron in the Shadyside creperie while Reilly left her job as a cancer researcher to camp out at the crêperie cart on Margaret Morrison Street. Later, they closed down the cart and began to work full-time at the Shadyside location.
With the support of the Pittsburgh community, Crêpes Parisiennes opened a new location, the now-familiar haunt on Craig Street, in 2006. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without [Carnegie Mellon]. They recognized that I was doing something. [Carnegie Mellon] faculty, students, and staff supported me and turned my dream into my reality,” Handler said. So, when he was looking for a new location, Handler considered the building on Craig Street due to its proximity to the Carnegie Mellon campus. Crêpes Parisiennes was coming closer to Carnegie Mellon, the place where Handler first started selling his crêpes. At the Craig Street location, Crêpes Parisiennes added paninis and fresh baked goods to its menu, but the star of the show is still the crêpe. 
Crêpes Parisiennes serves a wide variety of crêpes, ranging from savory ones like smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème frâiche ($7.75), to dessert crêpes like the sweet maple syrup crêpe ($4.25). Every crêpe is made from the same batter, consisting of a mix of white and buckwheat flour. Handler uses the American ploy of mixing white and buckwheat flour, a method different from the one used in Paris, where white flour is normally used for savory crêpes and buckwheat flour for sweet ones. 
Because of his love for crêpes, Handler makes sure he uses quality ingredients, and respects the integrity of each ingredient. The white flour is from a Minnesotan family-owned farm that has been growing wheat and milling flour for over 150 years, and the buckwheat flour is from an organic farm in Pennsylvania. At Crêpes Parisiennes, the crêpe batter not only carries a delicious, clean flavor, but also comes with a history.
At the top of the best-seller list of sweet crêpes is the crêpe with Nutella, ($4.75, or  $1 more to add banana). Because of this, it is no surprise that there is an entire wall of Nutella stacked up along the bar at the Shadyside crêperie. Customers can also pick a crêpe with plain chocolate, but this brings up the hard decision of picking between dark French chocolate with 64 percent cacao or Belgian white chocolate. Handler uses chocolate coins directly from the package, as he wants to let the richness of his high-quality, and hard-to-find, ingredients show through. The low heat from the crêpe iron melts the delectable chocolate as the crêpe is made, and there is no added cream or butter to distract the customer’s taste buds from the goodness of the chocolate.
To cut the sweetness of the dessert crêpe, customers can add berries to any of the establishment’s sweet selections for just $1.25, and with summer around the corner, strawberry,the establishment’s blueberry, and apricot preserves ($4.25), are also available as add-ons. Handler imports these gem-colored preserves from Austria and proudly asserts that there is no added corn syrup in any of the fruit preserves, as corn syrup tends to disturb the natural taste and consistency that each fruit bears. 
On the savory side, smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème frâiche is among the top sellers. The smokiness of the blushed Icelandic salmon, as well as its ocean taste, is highlighted by the bark-colored crêpe. Savory crêpes can be paired up with a choice of savory sauce: soytang, béchamel (a white sauce made by adding milk to roux, a mixture of flour and butter), crème frâiche (a sour cream), or garlic olive oil. All the savory crêpes come with a small garden salad along with mandarin oranges and homemade champagne vinaigrette.
Handler personally prefers champagne vinegar to red wine or balsamic vinegar. 
“I like [the salad dressing] a little bit tart, a little bit acidic, and that is good for your digestion too,” he said. The champagne vinegar used at Crêpes Parisiennes, Handler said, is vinegar from the city of Reims, a city in the northeastern Champagne-Ardenne region of France. On the other hand, the term champagne normally refers to the sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France, locally within the Champagne-Ardenne region.
“The champagne vinaigrette came on the first day we opened up in Shadyside,” Handler said. The same vinaigrette is mixed every day, and the touch of sectioned oranges in the salad adds a fresh, sweet flavor to the bitter of the green leaves. This green salad is a little mid-summer garden to be enjoyed all year long.
Reilly adds her touch to the menu, too, with her homemade scones. Reilly, who normally flips crêpes at the Craig Street crêperie, bakes these scones that are meant to be eaten with tea, and as luck will have it, Crêpes Parisiennes imports a special type of tea, Mariage Frères, that is adored by tea lovers.
Mariage Frères is considered by many avid tea drinkers to be the best teahouse in the world, consistently producing high-quality French tea. As told by the Mariage Frères website, the history of Mariage Frères can be traced back to 1660 when King Louis XIV of France and the French India Company commissioned Nicolas Mariage to sign a trading agreement with the Shah of Persia. Since then, the family traded spice, tea, and other colonial goods from the East to Europe. Later, in 1845, the Mariage family set up the Mariage Frères Tea Company, trading as far as China and Sri Lanka. 
At first glance, what is the most noticeable is that the Mariage Frères tea bag is made out of muslin cloth and not paper. This is mainly because paper leaves a distinct papery taste. While other varieties of tea have sharper fragrances and tend to taste more acidic, Mariage Frères tea has a soft, velvety aroma and a true tea flavor. At Crêpes Parisiennes, a cup of French tea will set you back $2.00.
Apart from French tea, Crêpes Parisiennes also brews café au lait, a French espresso with steamed milk and light froth for $2.50. Chocolat chaud, a rich and dark form of hot chocolate, is available for coffee abstainers. Handler proudly announces that their hot chocolate was voted the best in the city. 
“There’s no syrup. We melt chocolate. We put cocoa and melted chocolate and milk and, you know, secret stuff,” he said. 
Because of the proximity of the Craig Street location to the Carnegie Mellon campus, Handler sees a very mixed crowd at his crêperie. “It’s like the UN in here sometimes....” he said. “I appreciate the nationalities.” Here at Crêpes Parisiennes, French food takes on an American twist, plays with Dutch chocolate, and is adorned with Austrian fruit preserves. 
Next time you step into Crêpes Parisiennes to savor a crêpe, take a moment to remember the journey that the meal has been through before it is set down in its final form; warm on your plate..

2009-08-15,CMU,India,"“Mai wan le! Mai wan le!” A Chinese woman hustled down the lengthy queue in front of a tiny but famous dumpling shop, known for serving up the best xiaolongbao — pork-filled dumplings that are Shanghai’s specialty — in the city. My friend Julia and I had been waiting with much anticipation but were filled with disappointment as we registered her words: The shop was sold out. The woman was handing out paper bowls to the people ahead of us, counting out the number of servings that could still be made, but as luck would have it, the last two bowls were handed to the man right in front of us.
Julia and I didn’t move. We had come a long way in an expensive taxi to Yu Yuan to taste these xiaolongbao — and now we just stared at each other, wondering what to do. Meanwhile, the man in front of us was motioning to a woman standing nearby — I assume she was his wife or girlfriend — waving his second bowl in the air and asking her if she wanted some. To our delight, she shook her head and the man then turned toward us and offered us the bowl, which we excitedly accepted and took several pictures to commemorate
the moment.
Since we were displaying quite openly that we were not native to Shanghai, our generous friend tried striking up a conversation and asked us where we were from. Now, although I have been learning Mandarin for the past two years, speaking it in a classroom and speaking it in China are two radically different situations. The Chinese don’t need to be patient with me, nor do they need to enunciate the four different tones in the language so that I don’t get
confused. They also don’t use the simple textbook sentences that I was used to. But, barring all these differences, my weeks spent in Shanghai had resulted in a drastic change in my understanding of the language. I was now familiar with making general conversation and since this entailed talking about where I was from, I was easily able to answer the question. The conversation tapered off and came to a definite end when it was finally our turn to receive a bowl of hot, steamed dumplings that Julia doused in vinegar. We grabbed
a spot on a bench by the lit-up courtyard and had our first taste of Shanghai’s xiaolongbao. It was excellent.
My trip to Shanghai was filled with many such firsts. It was the first time I was living in a country whose native language I was not fluent in, and the reality of this situation struck me the moment I stepped off the airplane at Shanghai’s Pudong airport. I was there for a four-week program to further my education in Mandarin thanks to a collaborated effort between Carnegie Mellon and Shanghai International Studies University. I had been warned by my professor at Carnegie Mellon that not many people spoke English in Shanghai, so I came completely prepared. I brushed up my Chinese and memorized the exact way to say Shanghai International Studies University Guesthouse to the taxi driver — I had been warned that if I said it wrong, he would take me to a completely different location. But as soon as the taxi driver asked me, “Nali?,” I was overcome by a fit of nervousness and mispronounced one of the words. I had to sheepishly hand him the written address to make sure he understood. 
Shanghai, which literally means “on the sea,” lies on the coast of China and is one of the most developed cities in the country. It has a fantastic skyline dotted with towering skyscrapers that light up in brilliant colors at night — not unlike New York City. Unfortunately, due to the large amount of pollution in Shanghai, the sky remains overcast with smog very often and seeing a blue sky is a rare occurrence. Not all of Shanghai is as well developed as the commercial areas, however. The city can be quite hot, dusty, and dirty.
While in the city, I often felt like I was an animal in a zoo. The Chinese stared at me like they had never seen an Indian before. Many of them chattered about me in Chinese while I smiled to myself, too afraid to call them out. Others tried to speak with me, and were quite delighted when I replied to them in Chinese. My American classmates drew crowds too. Their seemingly unnatural height and golden hair caused passersby to even bizarrely click photos of them.
While life in China took some getting adjusted to, one of the biggest adjustments I had to make was regarding food. I am a vegetarian, but that concept is pretty alien to the Chinese. The closest word I could find to describe my dietary restrictions conveyed that I could eat vegetables and fish, so most of the time I would just end up translating “No meat, no fish!” Even though I am a vegetarian, I decided to taste some Chinese delicacies and got a chance to try Shanghai’s xiaolongbao, Beijing’s Peking duck, and a famous pork dish in Suzhou. Sadly, not every experiment was very satisfactory. 
Towards the end of my trip, I actually started to think in Chinese. In one of my conversations with my mother, she asked me for a telephone number and for several seconds I couldn’t think of how to say the numbers in English. It is my dream to be fluent in Mandarin one day, and as I have experienced that the best way to learn a language is to surround yourself with it, I plan on making a trip back to China very soon..

2009-08-24,CMU,India,"Plastic releases chemicals in oceans
According to a new study by scientists in Japan, plastic can decompose easily in oceans and release certain chemicals that could severely harm animals and even humans.
The scientists stimulated the decomposition of plastic in oceans at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, and this resulted in the production of harmful chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) and PS oligomer.
Scientists expect this decomposition to be much faster in natural oceans, as temperatures in oceans often go above 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
The scientists also analyzed samples from oceans in the United States, Japan, India, and Europe and found traces of such byproducts of plastic decomposition.

Research gives new  insight on evolution
Recent research shows that endosymbiosis of two prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, could have been the beginning of life on Earth. Through endosymbiosis, one cell can live inside another cell.
Earlier, only eukaryotic cells, cells that contain a nucleus, were known to undergo endosymbiosis.
This research, published in the journal Nature, shows that endosymbiosis of two groups of prokaryotes — actinobacteria and clostridia — led to the development of the double-membraned cell.
Subgroups of these primitive cells then developed the ability to use oxygen and eventually gave rise to the modern-day organisms.

New screens stretch across surfaces
Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have developed LED display screens that can stretch over objects ranging from the sides of a car to the human body.
To create such screens, the scientists first fixed the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) onto a thin surface that was later dissolved using certain chemicals. The LEDs were held in place during the washing process and were later fixed onto a flexible plastic, glass, or rubber surface.
This novel technique combines the flexibility achieved by using organic materials with the durability and brightness of LEDs.
The panels thus made are also nearly transparent and could be used on windows of vehicles. 
The research was published in the journal Science.

NASA plans shuttle launch tomorrow
NASA has scheduled the launch of the space shuttle Discovery this Tuesday at 1:36 a.m.
NASA initially had to conduct tests to ensure that foam covering was staying on the tank of the shuttle.
These tests were done following the incident with the shuttle Endeavour last month in which the foam fell off of the tank.
Although Endeavour did not suffer any other damage, foam damage created a hole in the wing of the space shuttle Columbia that led to its disintegration in 2003.
Tests on Discovery, however, revealed that the foam was in place.
Discovery will be on a 13-day mission to continue the construction of the International Space Station.

2009-08-24,CMU,India,"If you have ever felt uninterested or unsatisfied with the food selection at Carnegie Mellon, get ready to have your interest revitalized and your taste buds tingling.
For the past year and a half, the Dining Services Advisory Council, composed of students, staff, faculty members, and the director of Housing and Dining Services, has worked to improve dining options at Carnegie Mellon by compiling feedback that they’ve received through e-mail, comment cards, and surveys. They used the information they gathered about food selection, quality, and customer service, and put a plan into action to ensure the campus community would be happy with the dining options this year.
A major part of this plan was hiring a new company, CulinArt, to create all-new dining venues and options. Downtown Deli, previously known as East Street Deli, now has an upgraded sandwich station offering wraps, paninis, melts, and a build-your-own sandwich option. Stir Crazy, formerly known as Bento Bowl, now offers new rice and noodle creations and dim sum meals. 
In addition to these upgraded venues, CulinArt has created some brand new locations. Spinning Salads offers fresh, tossed-to-order salads, where you pick your favorite veggies, proteins, and toppings. Totally Juiced is an all-new fresh fruit and juice bar that offers a variety of nutritious options. But the UC is not the only place that has undergone a dining transformation.
The Resnik Café, which used to have only Taste of India, now also has Sushi Too, a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant; Take Comfort, which offers some selections that will remind you of home, such as rotisserie chicken, meatloaf, and cornbread; and Spice It Up Grill, a premium grill station that offers a variety of burgers during the day and more hearty selections at night, such as baby back ribs and jumbo shrimp.
“I wasn’t planning on getting a meal plan until I got back to campus and saw the great changes that were being made,” said Ashley Reid, a senior psychology major and resident assistant who has gotten to eat from some of these venues over Orientation week.
In order to give you a taste of the many options available this year, CulinArt is hosting an event called “Taste of the Tartans” on Sept. 8 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Rangos Hall. It is a free event that will allow the campus community to sample something from every dining location on campus.
“Our hope is to introduce members of the community to all of the dining services that are available and encourage them to not only be a customer but also to give people a chance to learn about all the places that they can find dining locations,” said Kim Abel, director of Dining Services.
All of these changes in meal options might make you wonder what changes have been made to the meal plans. There are three major changes: First is that DineX that is tied to your meal plan will last you the entire semester, rather than disappearing and refilling every two weeks. “The goal of this [change] is to allow students more flexibility with how they use that money,” Abel said. Instead of students using all their DineX on cash-out weekends because they have to, they can wait to purchase things that they actually want.
Secondly, in addition to the traditional plans — the red, blue, and green plans — and the DineX only plans, there is now a community plan. These plans allow you a certain number of meals per semester. Again, instead of eating meals because you don’t want to waste them, this plan allows you to only eat meals when you really want them.
Lastly, each of the meal plans now allows you to have two guest meals per semester. This means that you can now use your meal plan twice to take someone else out. Abel admits that this is not a lot, “but we are piloting to see how well it is received.”
Remember that you don’t just have to use your DineX on campus. DineX can also be used at the Subway on Craig Street, the Eat ’n Park on Murray Avenue, and for Vocelli’s Pizza. Coming in September, all campus-owned residence halls will have vending machines that will accept DineX also.
Another exciting addition to our dining places is entertainment. With karaoke, open mic, trivia night, and movie marathons, “these locations will no longer be just places to eat. They will be places to experience life at Carnegie Mellon,” Abel said.
When asked if she was excited for the dining options this year, Tina Robinson, a senior directing major, said, “I can’t wait! It seems like Carnegie Mellon has really stepped it up and I’m excited for the changes that are coming. The food looks great.”
Dining at Carnegie Mellon has undergone a thorough transformation and the people at Housing and Dining Services understand that often with change comes discontent. 
It is important to understand that student input is critical in decisions about dining. Housing and Dining is launching a centralized customer feedback process so that anyone can give their feedback and it can be shared with the vendors. Students who would like to take a more active role can visit the Housing and Dining Services office and ask to be a part of the Dining Services Advisory Council..

2009-08-31,CMU,India,"Ever since it was announced that the 2009 G20 Summit would be held in Pittsburgh, it was trumpeted as a chance for the city to shine, to show what Pittsburgh was really made of. 
Other than those seemingly important words, however, there is not much reference to how the people of Pittsburgh were to do that. 
Of course, there were the usual complaints about the effect that the G20 would have on many of the city’s businesses due to security concerns—that many of them would have to close down and lose vital revenue for the duration of the summit. 
And also, of course, there were people who told the others to stop whining and complaining, and to think of the positive things that the summit would bring to the city.
Another group of people, however, has taken their own spin on what aspect of Pittsburgh they want visitors to see when they come for the G20. According to a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article, a coalition of multiple arts groups in Pittsburgh — aptly named ARTS and headed by the dean of the College of Fine Arts — has formed to show people what an important effect art has on the city of Pittsburgh and its people.
The article cites a four-part message that the coalition hopes to leave visitors with: Art transforms Pittsburgh. Art employs Pittsburgh. Art “greens” Pittsburgh. Art inspires Pittsburgh.
I really appreciate the different spin that the coalition is putting on what would normally be thought of as a business-oriented event. And it really is the perfect time to show off Pittsburgh’s art scene — the city keeps being told that this could be their chance to shine, and I think it’s great that ARTS is stepping up and taking the oft-heard warning to heart.
And what many people may not realize is that Pittsburgh does have a vibrant arts scene. There is, of course, the Cultural District, which showcases a number of musicals and plays on a rotating basis, as well as the always-constant staple of the symphony. While Pittsburgh might not be a performing mecca on the level of cities like New York or Los Angeles, I have been to a number of shows of all types and can personally attest to their quality. In addition, there are a number of museums for more visually based art. Not only are there the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, there are also lesser-known museums like the Mattress Factory or the Warhol Museum, all of which have interesting and varied displays.
In addition, Pittsburgh has so many small cultural neighborhoods that all have their unique architecture. Two summers ago, my internship took me on a field trip to the Mattress Factory, and I discovered that a block or two away from the museum were a few beautifully painted and decorated houses. 
I was so surprised to learn that something so unique and beautiful existed on a random block in a random neighborhood. Because Pittsburgh is inhabited by people of different cultures that originally tended to form neighborhoods to stick together, cultural landmarks can be found all throughout the city.
Carnegie Mellon also got a specific mention in the article, where it stated that our architecture program is ranked number one in terms of teaching sustainable design, in reference to the coalition’s message that art “greens” Pittsburgh.
What impresses me most about the coalition’s efforts, however, is their perseverance and dedication to their cause. Because of the still-undecided security measures that loom in the city’s future, many businesses in the area are planning on just closing completely to cut their losses (and, of course, complaining about it). ARTS, on the other hand, is taking the exact opposite approach. 
They are hoping to keep as much open as possible; they understand that in order for the city to be seen in the best way possible, it needs to seem alive, not like a ghost town with numerous closed businesses.
And the list of what ARTS hopes to have going on during the summit is actually quite extensive. 
The Post-Gazette article lists maintaining regular hours for the Liberty Avenue art galleries and the Wood Street galleries, as well as Space, another gallery; free performances at the plaza at Seventh St. and Penn Ave.; and performances by an Indian dance group, a flamenco dancer, and singers from the Pittsburgh opera.
So while most Pittsburgh residents and G20 delegates are focusing on economic issues during the summit, I hope that people are able to take a few minutes off and check out what the Pittsburgh arts scene has to offer — it may be more impressive than people think, and will certainly help to put the city in a better light at a time when all eyes will be on it.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is Forum editor and wonders if she has made her love for Pittsburgh clear yet — it goes way past the Steelers..

2009-09-14,CMU,India,"The Antonian Theatre at Carlow University attracted a large crowd last Saturday night. Fans of an incredible and electrifying genre of music, classical-rock fusion, were present to see a leading band that has made this fusion their trademark — Indian Ocean.
Indian Ocean is a unique band. With songs in over 30 different languages, their music is about the characteristics of a human being and the journey through life. The band members: Susmit Sen (lead guitar), Asheem Chakravarty (tabla, tarang, vocals), Rahul Ram (bass guitar, vocals), and Amit Kilam (drums, flute, gabgubi, vocals) are a group of very talented individuals who combine their skills to produce some of the most inspiring music out there today.
With five highly successful albums released so far and having performed in more countries than they can remember, including a show at Trafalgar Square in London, they truly are a band that is here to stay.
Sitting in the audience, watching them perform songs ranging from one about the journey of a bird titled “Bhor” to a Syrian prayer hymn titled “Kandisa,” I couldn’t help but notice the trance everyone around me was in. People were dancing in the aisles, clapping their hands in unison to the beat, and shouting out their requests — it was a sight worth watching. Fortunately for me, I also got a chance to interview one of the band members and co-founders of the band, Sen, and here are some excerpts from the interview:
The Tartan: How did you decide on the name “Indian Ocean?”
Sen: We went through quite a lot of options, but in the end it was my father that gave us the name “Indian Ocean” to reflect how we drift between different cultures and traditions.
The Tartan: How was the band formed?
Sen: I met Asheem at a concert in 1984 and we began doing duo sessions together. In 1990, Rahul joined us replacing Anirban [a previous member] on bass. In 1994, Amit joined us and the band has stayed the same ever since then. There was a lot of initial struggle as no music label wanted to invest in instrumental music, but slowly we found our place in the industry, and here we are today.
The Tartan: Your music is of a very different make. What are the major influences behind this form of music?
Sen: Well, there is no major influence as such. Since childhood, we have learned to keep our eyes and ears open to what’s happening around us, and it results in the way we think about our music. We usually don’t write our own lyrics. They are written by Sufi poets or other budding writers and we give those lyrics a sound that resonates its meaning. So essentially there is no major influence as such. If we like what we see, then we try and use our creative talents as artists to give it a form that can be heard by many others.
The Tartan: What do you do in your spare time?
Sen:  All of us quit our jobs way back and made the band our sole career. I have a lot of other interests besides music. I love painting; I am an ardent photographer; I also love cooking and experimenting with food. My biggest passion besides the guitar is probably wildlife, especially ornithology. I also enjoy watching and playing sports, especially cricket and soccer.
The Tartan: What are the future plans for the band?
Sen: Currently, we are on a 15-concert tour of the United States. You can visit www.indianoceanmusic.com to see our schedule. We have composed the soundtrack of one Bollywood movie so far, called Black Friday, and are in the process of composing music for a film called Shoonya.
At the end of the concert, Indian Ocean held a unique auction, asking audience members to bid for two songs that they wanted the band to play, and successfully raised around $1900 for Association for India’s Development (AID) Pittsburgh, the charity the concert benefited. Go to www.aidindia.org to learn more about their work..

2009-09-21,CMU,India,"The volleyball team performed commendably at their own Carnegie Mellon Crossover tournament this past weekend, with junior Caroline Size contributing consistently in the Tartans’ 3–1 record over the two days of play. As an outside hitter, Size is able to use her height and athleticism to provide another positive force for her team during matches. Size has been top-ranked on the team in kills and digs the past two years and is making her way toward that goal again this season. As far as team goals go, Size and the rest of the Tartan volleyball squad are aiming for more consistency this season and are hoping for an NCAA tournament appearance.
Size is a business major who is now picking up an additional major in psychology, a decision she credits to social psychology, her favorite course so far. The diverse nature of Carnegie Mellon has rubbed off on Size over the past few years as well, as she noted that Taste of India is her favorite place to eat on campus, per the suggestion of one of her alumni teammates while she was a first-year. Size upholds that her favorite part about being in school at Carnegie Mellon are the people surrounding her school and sports lives, as she has fostered strong friendships with her peers on the volleyball court and in the classroom.
Although she may miss her family while they are back in Lewes, Del., Size profits from their willingness to travel to matches to support her and her teammates. While her father advocated trying volleyball while she was in middle school, Size was also involved in basketball and softball growing up. 
Her experience with these sports holds true as she participates in both, as well as in soccer, hockey, and kickball throughout the intramural seasons here. Having an interest in drawing during her free time, Size has proven that her talents are not limited to just athletics, although her success with sports is easily recognizable..

Four companies — Sony, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, and JVC — have reported that they are currently working on making 3-D television available in the home, expected for release in 2010.
The system works by presenting different images to the right and left eye. The brain then combines these two together to produce a 3-D image. 
Although many are excited about this new technology, some are worried about the large cost accompanying the project and the viewers’ inability to enjoy the shows as they were before. Movie production industries, furthermore, must adapt new technologies to project the 3-D images.

Researchers use algae as oil source
A team of researchers from India are looking into using a type of single-celled algae, called diatoms, to produce biofuel. These genetically engineered diatoms contain droplets of oil inside them and consume them when food sources are scarce. Since the diatoms produce oil on exposure to sunlight, the researchers have proposed building a solar panel consisting of just diatoms that can be used to make this oil. 
The substance makes up nearly a quarter of the algae’s mass.
Some believe more fossil fuel resources must be directed toward the project, while others assert that sunlight and cheap materials make the project a big possibility.

Volkswagen unveils new hybrid car
The L1, a diesel hybrid car designed by Volkswagen, made its debut at a Frankfurt auto show last Wednesday. Weighing 900 pounds and getting 170 miles per gallon, the car is designed “to look and be built to consume as little energy as possible,” say the engineers behind the L1.
The fuel tank holds 1.7 gallons, and the sleek carbon fiber exterior body that is similar to Formula 1 and aerospace technologies only adds to the versatility.
When asked about the future of the L1, the company claimed that mass production of the car could start by 2013. However, a limited number of models are scheduled to be released next year.

Arctic melting slower than believed
Scientists at the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) have determined that the annual summer melting of the Arctic Sea ice has not been as dramatic as it has been in the past.
The most likely cause for the reduction was the dispersion of ice by arctic winds and globally cooler temperatures. NSIDC scientist Walt Meier states that the latter was due to “cloudier conditions and low pressure zones in late summer.”
Despite the new data, scientists maintain that the long-term trend has continued to indicate a rise in temperatures. Especially alarming is the presence of thin new ice lying on top of the older, thicker ice.

2009-09-21,CMU,India,"As G20 fervor spreads to campus, the Carnegie Mellon community will have the opportunity to hear Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd give a special keynote address, followed by a panel discussion of policy experts. The prime minister’s address is scheduled to take place on Thursday in Rangos Hall in the University Center at 5 p.m. Doors open at 4 p.m. to allow guests to be seated.
Rudd is the 26th prime minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and the occupant of the country’s most powerful office. He also heads the center-left Australian Labor Party on a federal level. After joining the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1981, Rudd pursued his career in foreign service at posts in the Australian embassies in Stockholm, Sweden and in Beijing, China. Throughout his political career, Rudd has been on the forefront of educational reforms, particularly those advocating the importance of teaching foreign languages in Australian schools.
Rudd is a strong proponent of policies related to climate change and aims for Australia to demonstrate international leadership in this field, according to the climate change plan he describes in a video clip on his personal website. As stated in The Australian, the prime minister has also established a commission for nuclear non-proliferation. He looks toward the G20 as a major international summit for “multilateral engagement,” as stated in the article.
Before flying into Pittsburgh for the G20 conference, Rudd will attend the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
The address is expected to strengthen Carnegie Mellon’s reputation as an international university, as the Carnegie Mellon satellite campus in Adelaide, Australia houses programs in the university’s Heinz College. An effort that began almost four years ago, the Australian campus serves as the university’s Asia Pacific education base. It currently offers two master’s degrees — the master of science in public policy and management and the master of science in information technology.
As with the speeches of President Barack Obama and former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam given at Carnegie Mellon in the past, Rudd’s speech is aimed at enriching the campus community’s experience of hearing a head of state talk about international affairs and policies.
The event is sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, the Pittsburgh Technology Council, and the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, along with the H.

2009-09-21,CMU,India,"Graduates excel in scholarship program
Carnegie Mellon graduates Ally Reeves, Gregory Newby, and Julia Stein were recently named recipients of the prestigious U.S. Student Fulbright Scholarship. The Fulbright Scholars Program originated in 1946 as a way to promote learning among the United States and other countries of the world.
Reeves graduated in 2008 from the masters of fine arts program and plans to work in Mumbai, India, with an international organization called Partners for Urban Knowledge, Action, and Research to create installation art and participate in research. Her primary work will concern how street vendors were portrayed in media from the 19th century to modern times.
Newby, who earned a bachelor’s degree in 2009 in biological sciences, will be researching in the lab of professor Andreas Plückthun at the biochemistry institute of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. The research will focus on creating a molecular, fluorescent sensor that will monitor protein modifications inside living cells, which could help identify new targets for cancer therapy.
A bachelor of humanities and arts 2008 graduate, Stein will travel to Helsinki, Finland to enter the master of arts degree program in live art and performance studies at the Theatre Academy Helsinki. She plans to participate in the production of a film with Finnish artist.

Flu season approaches with H1N1
Student Health Services held its seasonal flu clinics on Sept. 17 from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. in the Dowd Room and from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. in Student Health Services. There was another clinic scheduled, but the turnout to the first clinic was so large that Health Services expected to run out of the vaccine, and announced that the second clinic on Sept. 18 was canceled. 
In an e-mail sent to the campus community, Anita Barkin, director of Student Health Services, reassured the community that more flu vaccines are on order and there will be more clinics to come. She also reiterated that “the seasonal influenza vaccine is distinct from the H1N1 vaccine, which will not be available nationally until late October or November,” as well as encouraging that everyone exercise good hygiene habits.
There is no charge for the vaccine if one is covered under Carnegie Mellon University insurance or Highmark insurance plans; otherwise the cost is $15.
A new single-dose vaccine for the H1N1 virus was approved on Sept. 15, and the vaccines should become available next month, according to U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius..

2009-09-21,CMU,India,"My home is a mere three hours away from Mumbai, and I have many relatives living there. The terror attacks that happened in November of last year rattled me. When I went back home that year during winter break, I realized the general sentiments of people — they were upset, and mostly at the government. In fact, the people’s anger led to the chief minister of Maharashtra’s resignation. I felt then that the government would try its best to get back into the people’s good books. For some time, it did feel like the government was trying to speed up the investigation, and that the court case of the sole captured gunman, Ajmal Kasab, was progressing quickly. Investigations led to the mapping out of how the terrorists entered the country and also to the narrowing down on the group responsible for the attack.
However, things seemed to come to a halt. Kasab confessed in court to having been a part of the attack, but the court decided that it needed more evidence to sentence him. Last week, Pakistan agreed to charge the seven suspects in the case, but also said that it would need more evidence to charge the leader of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba group, which was held primarily responsible for the attacks.
Both these instances amaze me. In July, Kasab confessed to having opened fire on crowds in Mumbai and described details of the planning of the attack. He also described how he trained with the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Apparently, having thousands of people see someone carry a gun and shoot indiscriminately in broad daylight is not enough evidence. Having this gunman confess that he was involved in the attacks is not enough evidence against him. Having Kasab name the Lashkar-e-Taiba in his statements is not enough evidence against their leader. I understand that the courts want to be thorough and carry out a complete investigation of the matter, but I wonder how much more evidence they will ask for, and more importantly, how much more evidence they will get. I believe there really is not much more that can be learned.
Though it has been nearly a year since the terror attacks took place, the news never seems to change. I have grown tired of reading the same things again and again. People back home have grown accustomed to picking up the newspaper, shaking their heads, and putting it back down. The consensus seems to be that the case will remain frozen like this for a very long time. However, I wish that all those involved with making decisions in this aspect would realize that they are playing with the emotions of millions of people, many of whom have lost much at the hands of these terrorists.

2009-09-28,CMU,India,"Research deciphers images in brain
Scientists have come up with  a new method to model images based on neural activity from the subjects. In the future, this technique could possibly lead to the development of devices like dream readers or thought-controlled computers.
In the study, published in the journal Neuron, researchers collected fMRI data, which measures blood flow in the brain, from three subjects as they looked at pictures of ordinary objects and scenes. Later, after coming up with a model based on this data, the subjects looked at another set of pictures, and by analyzing the neural output, the researchers were able to pick the corresponding pictures from a set of around 6 million images.

Data shows water on moon
Data from three different spacecraft show that there may be water on the moon. The most recent space mission to show that the moon contains water was India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission. Chandrayaan-1 collected data of the sunlight reflected from the surface of the moon and found that light was absorbed at the wavelength at which water normally absorbs infrared light.
Data was also analyzed from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, which passed the moon nearly a decade ago, and from the Deep Impact spacecraft. Analysis of data from the Cassini spacecraft indicates the presence of hydroxyl molecules mostly at the poles on the moon. Data from the Deep Impact spacecraft also indicates that the absorption of light changes with differences in temperature.

MIT develops eye implant
Researchers working at the  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology have developed an eye implant that could help restore vision to the blind. As of now, the implant has been designed for patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration. 
The prosthetic device makes up for a damaged retina by electrically stimulating the nerve cells that normally carry the visual stimulus from the retina to the brain.
Although such a device cannot completely restore vision to the visually impaired, it can help them perform daily tasks, such as navigating through a room, far more easily.

New find strengthens dinosaur-bird link
Chinese scientists have found new evidence that agrees with the hypothesis that birds descended from dinosaurs. The researchers have found a very well-preserved fossil of a dinosaur species known as Anchiornis huxleyi. The fossil shows that the species had four wings and also had feathers.
This finding indicates that that the Anchiornis huxleyi could be the missing link between dinosaurs and birds. Anchiornis huxleyi was present even before the Archaeopteryx, which is considered to be the earliest bird. Since bird-like features were found in the Anchiornis huxleyi, it indicates that features resembling birds were present in the early dinosaurs as  well.

2009-09-28,CMU,India,"“Bem Vindo a Sao Paulo” read the nine-foot sign at the baggage claim. Twelve hours, two planes, a 30-minute train ride, and a three-hour long drive later, I had finally reached my destination: the immense city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
I rushed out of baggage claim only to find that the study abroad program coordinators had left the airport, as I had arrived after the scheduled pick up time. Immediately, Thiago, my new Brazilian friend from the plane, offered to take me to my final destination. 
There I was, on my way to the hotel with Thiago’s mother, father, sister, and niece. They greeted me as if they had known me their whole lives, took me to lunch, and dropped me off at my hotel, and Thiago’s mother went in with me to ensure that nothing was out of order with my reservation. 
They gave me all their contact information and insisted that I call them if I needed anything. That was my first glimpse of the welcoming, cheerful nature of Brazilian culture.
Generally, a person’s physical appearance can provide some insight into what their ethnic background may be. For Brazilians, this does not apply. Brazil is a melting pot of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. 
Brazilians are Brazilians, whether they are from Rio Grande do Sul with Germanic and Polish roots, from Salvador da Bahia with a distinct African heritage, or from an Indian tribal village in the central-west region of the country. 
Brazil also houses the largest Japanese population in the world — after Japan, of course. Each region has its own culture; music and colloquial language are very much influenced by their ethnic roots and many times differ drastically from one another. Brazilian music captures the nature of this diversity very clearly. 
The smooth, jazz-like sounds of bossa nova, the pop-like songs of Música Popular Brasileira (MBP), the very inappropriate lyrics of baile funky, the country-like songs of sertanejo, and, my personal favorite, the samba with its lively African beats, all contribute to the mosaic diversity that characterizes Brazilian music.
With regard to my educational experience, I would not change a thing — besides my morning class at 7 a.m., that is. I study at a university called Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV), and our classes are quite rigorous with the standard of education on par with that of Carnegie Mellon. Much of the work is group based — which can be a setback considering the very relaxed attitudes of many Brazilian students. 
Brazilians are great hosts; hence, a group meeting for a project easily turns into a few beers, great food, and a good selection of Brazilian music. Besides school, I also work as a research analyst for the Center of Finance and Private Equity at my university, which is an experience I value very much considering FGV is a highly regarded business school in Latin America. I enjoy my academic curriculum here and absolutely love my job; I feel like I am learning so much so quickly.
I have enjoyed Sao Paulo very much. It’s an immense city with so much to do — including an incredible night life — and I have made an amazing group of friends with whom I share it all. However, my heart belongs to the city of Rio de Janeiro. In all my life, I have never experienced something as incredible as the first weekend I spent in Rio. I’m almost hesitant to put my experience in writing because I don’t think my writing will do the city justice. 
We arrived at Rio on a Thursday night, and as we were driving into the city, the first visible sight was the image of the famous Cristo Rendedor, a 100-foot high statue of Jesus Christ (pictured below). The Christ stands almost mystically on the very tip of the mountain, and clouds surround its base, giving the appearance of its being suspended in the air.
The first thing that came to mind was disbelief that I was actually here. The lively, fiesta-like, very laid back culture of cariocas is uplifting — it makes me smile. The world-famous beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana are a sight to see. 
The views from different parts of the city are incredible. There’s samba in the streets of Lapa, where much of the nightlife happens, every night until 6 in the morning. 
My friends and I walked into a bar where a group of musicians were playing at a single table with hundreds of people surrounding them, dancing to their hearts’ content. We danced along with them, with absolutely no idea how to properly execute their signature dance moves, but I think we did a fairly good job — if I do say so myself. 
With my broken Portuguese and mediocre samba skills, I am immersing myself fully in the Brazilian culture and loving every minute of it. I would say to any student considering studying abroad that it’s important you do. It is part of your education, because what you learn about the world, the nature of people, and most importantly yourself is invaluable..

2009-09-28,CMU,India,"Eat, Pray, Love is the memoir of Elizabeth Gilbert, who travels across Italy, India, and Indonesia to pursue pleasure, devotion, and a balance of the two.
After her divorce, Gilbert decides to discover what she really wants in life and goes on a personal journey across nations to find her balance. She “tells the truth” through 108 tales, distributed equally among all three countries, and she has the same number of stories as the numbers of beads of the japa mala. Japa malas, literally meaning prayer necklaces, are strings of 108 beads used by Hindu and Buddhist monks to repeat a mantra on every bead.
Concentrating on her spiritual journey through this mala, Gilbert first takes us to Italy. There, she spends four months, learning Italian and eating gelato for breakfast in Rome and pizza in Naples. During her time in Italy, she rediscovers what pleasure means. Making new friends and learning the Italian way of living, she explores the meaning of the word pleasure and what it means to enjoy life. Truly in love with Rome, she tries to understand if Rome is where she belongs. Her friend Guilo tells her how “the secret to understanding a city and its people is to learn — what is the word on the street?” While for Rome the word may be “sex” and for the Vatican “power,” Gilbert tries to find out the word that describes her. At the end of her time in Italy, she decides to attaversare, meaning cross over, to her next country.
Trading worldly pleasures for an austere life, Gilbert then heads to an ashram in India. She tries to get used to a simple life of doing seva, or social service, and performing meditation. During her time in India, she describes her struggles with meditation and leading an austere life and how she manages to find her divine connection. At the ashram, Gilbert meets Richard from Texas, who nicknames her Groceries and guides her through her internal struggles. Any reader who has ever tried meditating on a regular basis may have encountered struggles like Gilbert did, and her having achieved a state of meditation gives hope to all the readers that they can achieve it too. 
To combine the lives of pleasure and devotion and find a life of balance between the two, Gilbert’s final destination is Bali in Indonesia. She meets the medicine man, Ketut Liyer, and lives in Bali for the next four months improving his English and learning more about his practices. She also meets Wayan, a Balinese healer and a single mother, and becomes good friends with her. Growing close to her, she raises funds to help build a permanent house for Wayan and learns how things work differently in Bali, especially when one is a foreigner. She also meets Felipe, a Brazilian jeweler living in Bali. She comes to terms with love in Bali, where she starts dating Felipe, whom she later marries. At the end of her year-long journey, Gilbert learns more about herself and decides to attaversare into her new found life.
Last Monday, Gilbert kicked off this year’s Drue Heinz lecture series at the Carnegie Music Hall. Gilbert was recently in Rome for the filming of the movie Eat, Pray, Love starring Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem. She read an introduction to her forthcoming book Committed, which is about how she came to terms with marriage, especially after her first unsuccessful one.
Answering questions from her admirers, she gave advice to budding writers and mentioned how she has no trouble “telling the truth” about her life. She mentioned that even though people think that she has achieved a perfect life, nobody’s life is perfect every day. Each day is a new struggle to make it the ideal day. Lastly, she closed her talk by telling us all how we should try to live our dreams, one step at a time. It may not happen overnight, but if we keep working toward our goals, we will achieve them.
Eat, Pray, Love is every person’s journey and what each of us decides to do with it. It truly is, as the cover says, “one woman’s search for everything across Italy, India, and Indonesia.” The book is about asking yourself the right questions for discovering your own life. It is a memoir and a travelogue — have an inward odyssey while traveling the world with Gilbert..

2009-09-28,CMU,India,"Leaders have been likened to many things. Most have been poetic: The Bible says leaders are like those who move boundary stones, and some music nerd on the Internet says leaders are like maestros — something about reaching beyond the notes to reach the magic in the players.
Then there are the less elegant metaphors. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been likened to a frumpy Hausfrau. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been likened to a sex symbol, the 68th best-dressed person in the world, and even James Bond. George W. Bush has been likened to, well, an ape.
But with 20 of the most powerful people in the world strolling into Phipps Conservatory last Thursday, it was only natural to liken leaders to plants. After all, it was 20 of the world’s most powerful people in a super-green building, with presumably 20 species of the world’s greenest plants. Everyone was most likely caught up in a big hubbub of power, prestige, personalities, and... plants.
I’m no plant expert, but apparently some garden aficionados have a quiz you can take online called “Find Which Plant Reveals the Real You,” which will tell you how your “personal style translates into your plant personality.” I’ve always wanted to know! But this article isn’t about me. It’s about leaders. So I took the quiz for what I know about individual leaders of G20 economies. Since I regretfully do not know them on a personal level, I went off on a lot of presumptions and generalizations.
When I took the quiz for Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, I picked answers like “Zen-like balance and minimalism” and “Japanese silver grass.” When I took the quiz for Mexican President Felipe Calderon, I picked answers like “Mexican-inspired crafts and a wreath of dried chili peppers.” Dream house question? Nicolas Sarkozy matches with “Versailles” while Gordon Brown matches with “English cottage.” The quiz lent itself to presumptions and generalizations a little too easily.
It was then time to buckle down and scour the Phipps website in my search for analogous truth. I found that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was most like a coneflower, which is a big, bold daisy that adds “oomph” to any garden. Medvedev isn’t bad looking himself, and quite the character, too. As a youth, he made copies of Deep Purple records, though they were on the state-issued blacklist. As a flower, the coneflower is purple. Tenuous connection? Well, ruminate on this: the coneflower attracts bees and butterflies, as does Medvedev, as evidenced by his lovely wife, Svetlana Medvedeva.
Our German Hausfrau Angela Merkel is quite like the bottlebrush buckeye. Consistently noted for her spot on Forbes’ Most Powerful Women, Merkel compares incredibly well to the exceptionally expansive suckering shrub. Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who as a boy studied by candlelight, can be compared to an azure sage, a perennial that can grow in poor soil conditions.
I got very excited when I came across an ugly carnivorous flytrap, immediately assigning it to Kim Jong Il. Then I realized that Kim Jong Il, his unfashionable gray pajamas, and his no-label sunglasses were nowhere near Pittsburgh. Kim Jong Il’s invitation wasn’t lost in the mail. It was never sent.
What about President Obama? No need to stretch our imaginations to find a plant for him. As of February, Dutch growers are developing a special chrysanthemum that is expected to sell 250 million in the next three years. Those Dutch flower growers like to capitalize off American Presidents. The Reagan flower also sold well. Bush? Not so much.
Time also recently did a number on the personalities of politicians. It likened Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to having the attractiveness rating of a church mouse and suggested Manmohan Singh’s speeches as a natural remedy for sleep disorders. My treatment of comparing leaders to plants is much kinder,  especially when all the aforementioned plants in this article are on the Phipps Conservatory Top 10 sustainable plant list for 2009.
Leadership? The ability of the plant to grow and encourage its fellow plants to thrive. Pittsburgh G20 Summit? All these sustainable plants coming together, minus the flytrap, to work toward sustainability, climate, and the environment.

2009-10-05,CMU,India,"After much debate and with some degree of disbelief, scientists have announced in Science that they have conclusive proof that there is water on the moon. While the current findings speak of minuscule amounts, the authors are cautiously optimistic that more will be found on succeeding missions.
The actual discovery was made by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, or M3, built and operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The M3 was fitted on the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe launched and operated by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Many of the scientists involved were suspicious of the results and sought corroboratory data, which they found in the information collected by NASA’s Deep Impact (2005) and Cassini (1997) missions. These two missions had previously directed sensors similar to the M3 toward the moon. However, their findings had not been fully analyzed due to the fact that their primary missions did not involve the moon. They had merely used the moon to configure their sensors. The data was further corroborated by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (2009 and still active). Indeed, rocks brought back to Earth by the Apollo missions had also shown evidence of water, but this was written off as contamination by the humid Houston air.
According to an interview with one of the co-authors of the paper, Lawrence Taylor, director of the Planetary Geosciences Institute at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, the most popular hypothesis for the formation of water is that it is “due to the reaction of solar wind protons with a highly reactive soil.” The moon is subjected to intense ultraviolet radiation and other influences, which cause the particles in its soil to become highly unstable and reactive. 
This is because the radiation breaks the bonds between atoms in the molecules. Many of these unstable particles are oxygen atoms. When an atom attached to another atom is knocked away by ultraviolet radiation, it leaves a sort of void which renders the remaining atom unstable. 
These voids are what Taylor calls “dangling bonds,” which need particles like protons to stabilize them. The sun ejects a constant stream of such protons (the solar wind), some of which are captured by the lunar soil, forming OH and H2O molecules. According to Taylor, “When sunlight hits a substance, it reflects certain wavelengths which are signatures of its composition.” The M3 was looking for the signature associated with OH and H2O with a device called a reflecting spectrometer, which measures wavelengths that are just a bit longer than those that are visible to us.
Comets, often called “dirty icebergs,” may also be a possible contributor to water resources. They occasionally strike the moon and may leave significant deposits of water when they do.
One important thing to note is that the distribution of water changes constantly as it evaporates — the moon has no atmosphere, and water can evaporate at the extremely low temperatures found there. This evaporation is much more pronounced closer to the equator, where there is more sunlight and higher temperatures. Less water was found in the equatorial regions than closer to the poles. 
The authors theorize that much of the water accumulates in regions that Taylor calls “cold traps,” permanently shadowed craters where evaporation is less likely to occur and where temperatures never rise above -380 degrees Fahrenheit. As Taylor explains, “Sit down with a glass of iced tea in front of you, wait about two minutes, and you’ll see it starts to perspire. It’s gathering moisture out of the air.” This is an example of a cold trap, a region that is colder than its surroundings, attracting and collecting moisture. These may provide usable sources of water for future lunar missions.
Serendipitously, NASA actually has a mission in progress to find water in such “cold traps.” Called LCROSS (Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite), it will — at around 7:30 a.m., Oct. 9 — launch its own spent rocket engine at a crater in order to generate a plume of debris. If there is indeed water ice present in the shadowed areas of the crater, the plume could be as high as 70 kilometers. The probe itself will then fly through the plume and see if it can find any evidence of water. Spectroscopes and telescopes on Earth will also be directed toward the plume.
While the authors of the paper are certain that there is water, they are not yet sure if it is actually usable and are being cautious as to the ways in which the water might be employed. It is easy to see, however, that if the water is usable, it would make a big difference for NASA’s plan to build a base on the moon (to be set up by 2024, according to National Geographic). With the presence of water, oxygen and fuel in the form of hydrogen would be available, simplifying the process and reducing the amount of both elements that will have to be carried there. 
The discovery of water on the moon is significant not just because of the technical skill involved or the direct results, but also because it implies greater possibilities and allows humanity to hope that the moon is not as harsh a mistress as she seems..

2009-10-05,CMU,India,"Scientists find old fossil of skeleton
A fossil of the skeleton of a human ancestor, nearly 4.4 million years old, was found in Africa recently. The skeleton belongs to the species Ardipithecus ramidus and has replaced the famous skeleton Lucy as the oldest known human ancestor.
The fossil was of an adult female weighing around 120 pounds and standing four feet tall. The feet of the specimen had not developed the curved arch found in humans, and the length of the arms and legs resembled that of primitive apes or even monkeys. Scientists believe that this new Ardipithecus genus has helped clarify many doubts regarding the evolution of humans.

Telescope uses infrared light 
The Herschel Space Telescope, launched by the European Space Agency, has captured images of the Milky Way galaxy using infrared light. The telescope was able to sense the small amount of heat radiating from some of the coldest objects in the galaxy, using infrared light.
The telescope was able to obtain images from a region of the galaxy that is usually obscured in normal light. The images revealed that a number of stars are being born in this region and that this region contains a large amount of cold and unstable material. The images have shown that gas is constantly condensing in this region and that young stars in all stages of development are interspersed throughout the region.

Scientists find dinosaur eggs 
Scientists have found fossils of dinosaur eggs in a village in Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India. The eggs have been estimated to be around 65 million years old. Many layers containing clusters of eggs and dinosaur body parts were found by the researchers. The eggs have a diameter of around five to eight inches and were found in a four-foot-wide nest. 
The nest was found in a sandy region along the banks of the river Cauvery.
Scientists believe that this finding reveals that the dinosaurs came back to the same nesting ground frequently to lay eggs. The study was conducted by researchers from Periyar University.

Fungus may have wiped out forests
Recent findings published in the journal Geology have shown that an ancient fungus that lived off of dead wood covered most of the planet nearly 250 million years ago. Scientists believe that the fungus, known as Reduviasporonites, thrived during this period because most of the world’s forests had been destroyed.
During this period, the Earth had only one continent, known as Pangaea, and the findings reveal that there was little or no vegetation across the continent during this period. Basalt lava flowed across the region in that period, causing up to 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land species to become extinct.

2009-10-05,CMU,India,"This past week, Carnegie Mellon witnessed a plethora of cultural holidays from all over the globe. Students were able to celebrate the start of a new, colder season in their own traditional ways.
Mid-Autumn Festival
Last weekend, students gathered together to celebrate the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, in the University Center. 
The Mid-Autumn Festival is usually held in late September or early October, on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean cultures all celebrate this popular harvest festival in their own ways. It is one of the most important holidays on the Chinese calendar and marks the end of the summer harvesting season. 
Apart from being a harvest festival, this celebration also has a history of legend and myth surrounding it. The Chinese relate this day to the one on which a young girl, Chang’e, was lifted from the Earth and placed onto the moon. This story of how her fate came to be has many different versions and is a favorite among Chinese poets. Another legend associated with the moon is that of the Jade Rabbit. The Jade Rabbit is supposed to reside on the moon with Chang’e, and this myth seems to have sprung from the fact that the dark spots on the moon resemble the form of a rabbit.
Some traditional practices are used when celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival. Festival-goers indulge in delicious mooncakes — called yuebing in Mandarin — and pomelos, citrus fruits native to Southeast Asia. Popular Chinese mooncakes are small, rectangular, or circular, mildly sweet pastries that are filled with a moist lotus seed paste and surrounded by a thin crust that is made from the yolks of salted duck eggs. Parties are decorated with floating sky lanterns, autumn flowers, and traditional Asian dragon displays. People come together to celebrate the spring equinox and witness the moon at its biggest and brightest. While there are many ways of celebrating, the Asian communities are unified in their recognition of the holiday. 
“In Korea,” Jeongyoon Yu, an undecided first-year in H&SS, said, “the concept of the Mid-Autumn Festival is much like the American Thanksgiving. Instead of the Chinese and Japanese mooncake, however, [Koreans] all gather together in our traditional clothes and make a large honey rice cake to be shared by the entire family.”
Last Friday, students at Carnegie Mellon University also celebrated the end of the summer harvest season in their own special way. Students gathered at the University Center for music, dancing, traditional Asian cuisine, and socializing. The party acted not only as a traditional Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, but also signified the start of a new academic season: fall.
“What I liked best about the festival,” Jing Jing Li, an undecided first year in H&SS, said, “was how inclusive it was. I didn’t feel as if any culture was excluded. It really was an all-Asian celebration.”
Oktoberfest
Students were also given a glimpse into the German Oktoberfest in the Schatz Dining Room on Sept. 24 when the kitchen staff served up some traditional German cuisine. 
Oktoberfest is a 16-day festival held in Munich, Germany every year. It is one of the largest world celebrations, attracting some six million people every year. 
It is safe to say that food and drink are huge components of Oktoberfest. During celebration, visitors dress up in traditional garb and eat vast amounts of traditional German food, including pork, sausage, chicken, pretzels, potatoes, pancakes, and dumplings.  
But more than food, this German festival is about the great German beer. Oktoberfest is known for its giant beer mugs — steins — and almost endless supply of beer, and people from all over the country and world flock to Munich to enjoy some of the alcohol during this time.
The original Oktoberfest began in 1810 when the Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen celebrated their marriage. In 1819, Munich took responsibility for the festival and agreed that it would be celebrated every year without exception. 
Reviews of the quality of food at the Schatz Oktoberfest varied, but overall students found the idea of a traditional German celebration on campus to be exciting and internationally interesting. 
“I love it when campus recognizes international holidays,” Li
said. “It allows students to experience the world right here on 
campus.”
Dussehra and Diwali
Celebrations during this time are not restricted to East Asia and Germany; they extend to the country of India, as well. Diwali, the biggest Hindu festival, and also celebrated by Sikhs and Jains, falls during this time of the year. The dates vary every year according to the Hindu lunar calendar, and this year Diwali will be celebrated with its usual pomp and show on Oct. 17. 
The reasoning behind celebrating Diwali, also called Deepavali, which literally means “festival of lights,” draws from an ancient Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The Ramayana tells the story of a young prince — Ram — who is exiled from his kingdom along with his beautiful wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshman, and is condemned to roam the forests for 14 years. 
During their exile, Ravana, a 10-headed demon and the ruler of an island called Lanka — analogous to present day Sri Lanka — hears about Sita’s wondrous beauty and decides to kidnap her for himself. Once he succeeds, he brings Sita back with him to Lanka and keeps her prisoner in his vast palace gardens. 
Overcome with grief, Ram summons all the help he can get, builds a bridge of stones to Lanka, and succeeds in defeating Ravana in a final battle. This day, on which good triumphed over evil, is a special one in Hindu mythology and is celebrated as Dussehra. This year, Dussehra was celebrated on Sept. 28, and roughly two weeks later, when Ram came home with his rescued wife, Diwali is celebrated to rejoice in his return. 
The night of Ram’s return to his kingdom was a new moon night, causing the entire city to be cloaked in darkness. In order to brighten up the city, all the citizens of the kingdom lit lamps in their homes and lined their courtyards and windows with lights, making the city bright and beautiful. To this day, on Diwali, Hindus light lamps and celebrate Ram’s homecoming. They also burst firecrackers and set off fireworks — the Indian sky on Diwali night is a sight to behold.
The Sri Venkateswara temple in Pittsburgh has an annual Diwali celebration that is open for everyone to attend. They have delicious Indian food, sweets, dance performances, and firework displays — all the components of an enjoyable Diwali. OM, the spiritual organization for Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs, usually organizes a bus to transport students to the temple. Check their website at www.cmu-om.org/ for more information.
The legend of Ram and his journey is of such great importance to Hindus because Ram is considered to be a reincarnation of one of the three most important Hindu gods: Vishnu. Hinduism mainly worships three gods: Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the sustainer; and Shiva, the destroyer. Vishnu is the people’s god and solves their problems and soothes their miseries. From time to time, he takes the form of a human or animal and comes to the Earth to directly influence the people. Ram is one of Vishnu’s most popular reincarnations. 
Due to the vast number of gods in Hindu mythology, the festival of Dussehra has more than story behind its celebration. Like most cultures, the change of seasons has a significant impact on the festivals in Hinduism, and Hindus celebrate Navaratri, literally meaning “nine-day festival,” at the beginning of autumn every year. This festival, which culminates on a 10th day — Dussehra — celebrates the female goddess Durga, because she finally slays a demon she has been battling for nine days. Thus, in both traditions, Dussehra represents the triumph of good over evil.
Apart from the usual forms of celebration like visiting temples and distributing sweets, Navaratri is characterized by a popular form of Indian dance called garba. Garba originated in the western state of Gujarat, and during this festival, people get together and dance to catchy music.
The colorful dance forms of garba are not just seen in India, but here on our campus as well. Last Friday, OM organized their annual Navaratri Garba, giving a chance for the student body to take part in Hindu traditions.
Carnegie Mellon has a truly diverse population, and it is great to see a facet of every culture being celebrated here on campus. If you want to learn more about other countries and their customs, try to attend the events happening around campus — people are more than welcoming and are happy you want to learn about their traditions..

2009-10-26,CMU,India,"Last Sunday, Oct. 11, students of Carnegie Mellon organized a bus to join the National Equality March in Washington, D.C. The march was performed to raise national awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and to demand full and equal protection in all 50 states. Specifically, the goal was to take action in repealing several pieces of national anti-gay legislation, including “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” (DADT), which limits the rights of homosexuals to serve their country in the military, and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which reserves marital rights to heterosexual couples.
There were also several events in the days leading up to the National Equality March on Sunday. Friday, there were several parties in and around Washington, D.C. in anticipation of the weekend’s events. On Saturday, there was an equality march and other activities for students, which were followed by the main march on Sunday at noon and the rally at about 2 p.m.
The bus from Carnegie Mellon was filled with students from several of Pittsburgh’s campuses, members of several of Pittsburgh’s LGBT organizations, and other advocates from around the city, making a total of about 50 people. Students from Carnegie Mellon held up a banner for the entire march that read “Carnegie Mellon ALLIES. Graduating queers for over 100 years.” The group took a day trip, leaving early in the morning and returning later that evening.
Carnegie Mellon ALLIES, along with student organizations from almost 40 other universities nationwide, helped sponsor and attended the march.
There were over 250,000 other people in Washington, D.C. during the weekend, most of whom were students from all over the world who joined forces to march the streets of Washington from McPherson Square to the Capitol Building. Some of the chants that were heard included: “Hey, Obama, let mama marry mama,” “Gay, straight, black, white. All we want is equal rights,” and “What do we want? Equal rights. When do we want them? Now.” The end of the march was followed by a massive rally in front of the Capitol with 30 different speakers from around the world. Among them were Cleve Jones, Lt. Dan Choi, Judy Shepard, and Lady Gaga.
Merri Ebel, the president of ALLIES, the Carnegie Mellon organization that planned the trip, mentioned that “the newspapers predicted there to be about 50,000 people” at the march and rally. She was very happy to see people from “all sorts of groups come together that were from different states and from different cities and from different backgrounds to rally for the same cause.” Among many other college groups which attended the national event, it was also very uplifting to see “religious groups, a mothers’ group, and a few labor unions,” Ebel said.
There have been several marches in the past; however, a National Equality March in Washington, D.C. of this magnitude has not happened since the term of President Clinton, who implemented DADT while he was in office. During his term as Indiana senator, Obama was supportive of gay rights and even scored high on a test issued by the Human Rights Campaign that measured sponsorship of key issues and rights pertaining to gay and lesbian citizens. More recently, the Matthew Shepard Act, which vows to protect the victims of hate crimes, was passed through Congress this past Thursday. Obama promises to sign the act into law by the end of this month..

2009-11-02,CMU,India,"To students, Homecoming Weekend means getting a free T-shirt or Tartan towel, socializing, getting a hot cup of chili, and watching the football game. To alumni, Homecoming Weekend signifies Alumni Weekend, reconnecting with old classmates over dinner, and seeing how much the school has progressed. But this year, Homecoming is much, much more.
Homecoming was given a complete makeover this year with the revamping of old events and the addition of new ones. Dana Weinstein, a junior business administration major and the leader of the Student Homecoming Committee, said, “The main purpose of all of these events is to get Carnegie Mellon students more excited about being here and give them a quick break. It also allows them to have a chance to interact with alumni in a non-networking environment, which is something that they might not get as often as they like.”
Some of the past events that were re-worked this year were the Student Homecoming Kick-Off BBQ on Wednesday and LMAO, An Evening of Comedy and Music, on Thursday. “The events this year were actually an initiative started by the committee last year. We began these events last year because we felt that Homecoming wasn’t really for students, and we wanted to make more events that were student-centric and would make students feel as though they were welcomed at Homecoming events, even though we do invite alumni to all of the student-oriented events,” said Weinstein.
Spirit Week and the Highland Games were two of the new additions to the Homecoming schedule. “We added a few events this year, such as Spirit Week and the Highland Games, to replace the ‘B There’ campaign that occurred last year during the Friday night of Homecoming, so that we could still have a larger Friday night event,” said Weinstein.
Spirit Week gave students the opportunity to show off their Carnegie Mellon spirit, pride, and creativity by dressing to the respective day’s theme. The themes were: Rep your Hometown, Nerd Day, College Spirit Day, Class Colors Day, and Tartan Pride. Students could receive a raffle ticket each day they participated for the chance to win an Acer Aspire One netbook and to accumulate points for the Highland Games.
On Thursday, students celebrated Diwali and Eid ul-Fitr in Wiegand Gym. The celebration of Diwali, also known as the “Festival of Lights,” is a major Indian festival signifying the victory of good over evil. Eid ul-Fitr is a joyous occasion celebrating the achievement of enhanced piety. The event included crafts, performances, and a buffet of traditional Indian cuisine.
The week concluded with the Highland Games, a class competition involving fair-style games. First-years, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and alumni had the opportunity to compete while enjoying performances, food, and other Scottish traditions.
With all the new additions, some old traditions still stand. The Alumni Awards Ceremony and the Tartans football game were two staples of the traditional Homecoming week.
Since 1950, the Alumni Awards have recognized alumni, faculty, and students for their service to the university and for their achievements in the arts, humanities, sciences, technology, and business. More than 750 individuals have been awarded through the program. The Alumni Association awarded its honorees at the Alumni Awards Ceremony Friday at 5:30 p.m. All alumni, students, faculty, staff, and friends were invited.
The Alumni Association is also extending the invitation to submit nominations for the 2010 Alumni Awards. The Service Award Nomination deadline is Monday, Nov. 30. Anyone may nominate as many candidates as one likes, but they should be people who have exemplified outstanding service to the university. For more information, contact Adrian Massey.
Following the Chili Cook-Off, hosted by the Carnegie Clan, the Tartan football team played the Washington University Bears on Saturday at 1 p.m. at Gesling Stadium. During the game, the Carnegie Clan also operated a canned food drive.

2009-11-09,CMU,India,"In October 2008, Jess Zimmerman, a junior political science major at Butler University in Indiana, started his True BU blog discussing Greek life and the student government, among other groups.
When Zimmerman began criticizing Jamie Comstock — provost and vice president for academic affairs at Butler — and Peter Alexander — the dean of the university’s Jordan College of Fine Arts (JCFA) — the administration took notice. 
In January, the university filed a lawsuit against “John Doe” — since Zimmerman was authoring the blog under the pen name Soodo Nym — for “harm[ing] the honesty, integrity, and professional reputation of Butler University and two of its high-level administrators,” according to the summons issued by the Marion Circuit Court.
According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), this is the first time that a university has sued a student over online speech. Zimmerman said the suit was dismissed in court on Oct. 27 of this year, but he still faces disciplinary charges from Butler University, which could affect his expected early graduation this May.
According to a statement issued by the Butler University administration, True BU “published communications that included defamation, threats, harassment, and intimidation.”
A Dec. 15 post on True BU reported that Alexander fired Andrea Gullickson as chair of the School of Music. Not only did it speak of Gullickson’s merits and accomplishments, it also suggested that Alexander was not an appropriate dean for the JCFA.
Zimmerman, as Soodo Nym, reported that a Google search he performed of Alexander’s name did not result in information on the individual serving as JFCA dean within the first 50 results. 
“While it’s not relevant to this article,” he wrote, “I do have to question the University for hiring someone as dean who, it appears, is not particularly accomplished.”
Gullickson is Zimmerman’s stepmother. According to Michael Zimmerman, Jess Zimmerman’s father and the former dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler, Alexander told Gullickson in December 2008 that she was doing a poor job — despite apparent disagreement from music department faculty — which led to Gullickson resigning the post.
According to Jess Zimmerman, Comstock then called a meeting with Gullickson and denied her resignation, and instead Comstock “threatened to fire her” from her tenured position at the university.
The details of this issue were on the blog, along with several letters reportedly from faculty criticizing the actions of the administration. The notes were posted anonymously, speaking highly in favor of Gullickson’s tenure as chair and negatively about Alexander’s and Comstock’s decisions.
On Jan. 4, Jess Zimmerman ended the blog. On Jan. 8, the university filed the lawsuit against Soodo Nym.
Michael Zimmerman said that after the lawsuit was filed, he was called in for a meeting with the provost. She told him that she did not want him to continue as dean, but that instead she would take him on as vice provost. He said she told him, “Either we would concoct a story showing we work well together or she would spread bad things about me.”
He decided to move back into a faculty position. Michael Zimmerman said the university’s board of visitors wanted to know why he had been removed and were reportedly told that she had told them a number of negative things he had done that he said were not true.
In response, he sought a lawyer, who sent a letter to the university requesting a retraction or clarification of her statements. The university agreed, if both Michael and Jess Zimmerman would sign a confidentiality agreement stating they would not discuss this issue nor that of Soodo Nym. They agreed, contingent that the university would not pursue a change in the suit to identify Jess Zimmerman as Soodo Nym.
No further information regarding the conclusion of the case was available at press time.
This story has been reported in a number of student newspapers, as well as Inside Higher Ed at insidehighered.com/news/2009/10/16/butler..

2009-11-16,CMU,India,"These days, people are starting to become more and more aware of the environment. They try to buy products that are more environmentally friendly in every aspect, and fashion is no exception. Every year, eco-friendly materials appear on the runway; however, many people are not used to eco-fashion and are not really sure what it is. Here is a brief introduction to eco-fashion and some tips on how to translate eco-friendliness to your own wardrobe.
Eco-friendly clothes are made of raw organic materials that do not use pesticides. In addition, they do not involve the use of harmful chemicals or bleaches to color the fabric. These materials are often made from recycled and reused textiles. High-quality garments can be made from second-hand clothes and even recycled plastic bottles. Finally, eco-friendly clothes are made in a fair trade environment. People involved in the process of making these materials are treated and paid fairly. 
Hemp
The textile with the highest potential for being eco-friendly is hemp. The ecological footprint of hemp is significantly smaller than any other fabric. Hemp plants grow quickly and densely, so it makes it difficult for weeds to interfere with the harvesting. The use of pesticides and other chemicals is also greatly reduced. In addition, hemp does not require much water, so no irrigation is needed. Hemp fibers are naturally long and require minimal spinning and processing work. Thus, hemp is very eco-friendly and long lasting. If you are interested in hemp clothing, try www.hempest.com. The site offers organic hemp clothing, accessories, gear, paper, food, and body care products. They have anything you can imagine in hemp.
Organic cotton
More farmers are getting involved with organic cotton — the process of growing cotton in which, during the growing cycles, farmers do not use pesticides, herbicides, or insecticides. Moreover, in the process of manufacturing clothes from organic cotton, producers use natural dyes to reduce the amount of artificial chemicals. In recent years, new cotton growing techniques have emerged that grow colored cotton. The process naturally grows cotton in shades of blue, green, and other colors. In fact, the color of the cotton gets more vibrant as the clothes are washed. Loomstate (Loomstate.org), a clothing brand based in New York City, uses 100 percent certified organic cotton from various regions of the world such as Turkey, Peru, Africa, India, and the United States in all their clothes. They were also featured at Barneys New York.
Soy silk
Soy silk is a byproduct from making tofu. The liquefied proteins are extruded into fibers that are then spun and used like any other fiber. It is easy to purchase this silk yarn and make your own scarves or sweaters. Try www.soysilk.com to order some. The high protein content makes it easier to dye colors, so you can even create your own color.
Bamboo
It may be surprising, but bamboo is actually highly renewable grass. Because it is highly renewable, it is classified as eco-friendly. Bamboo grass also has natural antibacterial properties so it is easily biodegradable. If you want to see what kind of clothing can be made out of bamboo grass, check out www.organicbambooclothing.com. They offer a variety of clothing made from bamboo.
Wool
Wool can be an eco-friendly material as long as conscious effort is made in processing. With high emphasis on productivity and speed, wool is produced from factory-farmed sheep. These sheep live miserable lives and their handlers do not care for the condition of these sheep. It is common to cut off a sheep’s nose in the shearing process. With a responsible, eco-friendly manufacturer, most of these issues can be alleviated and truly eco-friendly wool can be produced..

Since its beginnings back in 2004, Technology Consulting in the Global Community has sent abroad 49 students from all Carnegie Mellon colleges in order to provide assistance in computing, information systems, and advanced applications. Over a span of 10 weeks in the summer, the students travel to technologically underserved countries (such as Niue, Palau, Ghana, India, and the Philippines) and work with local governments, schools, or NGO leaders to more effectively use technology in their organizations. In his talk, Joseph Mertz — an associate teaching professor in the H. John Heinz III College and the School of Computer Science here at Carnegie Mellon — will outline the capacity-building consulting model the program is built on, describe the results the students have brought about, and explain the plans to dramatically expand the program..

2009-11-23,CMU,India,"Music is a language that predates words. It consists of simple sounds and beats put together to create a rhythm. Even banging on a trash can or shaking a salt shaker is music. Twentieth-century composer John Cage thought that any sound could be music: “There is no noise, only sound.” Regardless of the method, music has been around for a very long time and presents itself in various sizes, shapes, and forms as it has been transformed through cultures and traditions. The definition of music itself is one that cannot be simplified in one term, as many cultures’ interpretations differ.
Music was also an important part of culture in Greece. Greek philosophers and ancient Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. In ancient Greek theater, musicians and singers had a prominent role, and choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. One of the earliest musical traditions comes from India, as references to Indian classical music — or marga — can be found in the ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition, the Vedas.
Common elements of music include pitch, rhythm, and dynamics. There are many more branches, as well as ones that stem from these few. While these terms and what they do were not always important, each of these elements has become necessary to communicate the language.
The development of music has occurred with the influence of natural sounds. It is very likely that it was influenced by animals and how they communicated. National Geographic published an article suggesting “that not only are natural sounds such as whale and bird songs music, but that their songs may be part of a ‘universal music’ that provides an intuitive musical concept to many animals — including humans.” Macaque monkeys drum objects in a way that shows social dominance. Even the beating of one’s chest has a figurative meaning, but the sound it creates brings meaning to life.
Although no one can give a firsthand account of what music sounded like in ancient times, artifacts like bones have been found with lateral holes, resembling a flute. At the Indus valley civilization archaeological sites (currently parts of Pakistan and India), various stringed instruments have been recovered.
Though these discoveries may give us an idea of early music, the music we create today is all built upon what has already been done. In the 20th century, the way to hear music was by listening to the radio or a phonograph in the earlier years. The genres of music have also become more defined as jazz took its place and became a strong influence over the course of the century. It originated in the southern states with an influence of African and European sounds. Rock music has also become popularized. It has spread out to become rock and roll, rockabilly blues, and country music. The guitar has a great influence on the sound of rock. Various styles of music have incorporated many instruments, such as the guitar, the piano, and the drums. While the drums were once used to communicate among Africans because the drums spoke when they could not, it has become a staple in music today.
Other forms of music — such as hip hop, modern, opera, barbershop music, cante jondo, disco, funk, new jack swing, and thousands of others — have been created throughout generations and in different countries. Because of this, there are several hundreds of musical instruments, as just about anything can be considered an instrument since hitting, plucking, or striking anything makes a sound. Songs today involve so many pieces of music; it is incredible to see how it has evolved over the centuries. String instruments and wind instruments are two kinds, but with all of the technology made available and all of the sounds electronics and nature have to offer, the musical possibilities are endless.
Musicians use these instruments or no instruments at all to perform and express themselves. Sometimes, artists can better express themselves through sound than through words. Gustav Mahler, a Bohemian-born Austrian composer and conductor active in the late 1800s, once said, “If a composer could say what he had to say in words, he would not bother trying to say it in music.”.

2009-11-23,CMU,India,"Let’s face it, folks: We’ve been spoiled. In contrast to the last couple of years, we’ve been granted the blessing of fall this year. Not just autumn, but an autumn that’s felt more like summer. The leaves have been holding out for months and the grass is still green. Never before has my resplendent supply of T-shirts lasted me so long. But our time of Indian summer is winding down, and I have a feeling that it might make this winter’s transition even rougher.
Now, to put things in perspective, I will remind you that Pittsburgh actually has a temperate climate. Sure, our winter feels like the worst thing in the world — long and wet and lonely. My friend Ben, however, spent last year in Iceland, and you’d better believe things are a lot rougher there. In a country riddled with depression (that’s personal and economic depression), it’s hard to keep a level head during the eternal winter season.
So what do they do? Well, in addition to eating various kinds of animal meat you’ve never heard of (and probably don’t want to), residents sometimes get together for a good ol’-fashioned sing-along. Using simple acoustic instrumentation, these gatherings are informal and usually just a way of warming up the cold and windy winter nights — a little whiskey, a little song, what more could you need?
On Dec. 4, the sing-along returns to the winter season, but this time as an interactive trans-city experience. Ben will be hosting a group in Cleveland, Ohio that will be in live video/audio communication with a group in Pittsburgh to be hosted at the Waffle Shop. The cities will switch leading songs by the likes of R. Kelly, Beck, Dolly Parton, and more. It’s a modern twist on an old-fashioned winter remedy. We may not be in Iceland, nor yet in the heart of our worst months, but it can’t hurt to start a new routine in curing the winter blues..

Design Outside of Design
Tuesday, Nov. 24 at 5 p.m.
Breed Hall (MM103)
Design is now stepping outside of the studio and can now be seen in laboratories, accountants’ dens, writers’ studies, boardrooms of organizations, and the local meeting places of communities. Many see the future of design existing within its potential to enable trans-disciplinary solutions to the complex problems and challenges of the modern world. 
This lecture by Laurene Vaughan will critique and reflect on a body of projects currently being undertaken within the Design Research Institute at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, where the objective has been to take design outside of design, and through this discover new paradigms for design practice.
Lessons from Living Life on the Boundary
Thursday, Dec. 3 at 4:30 p.m. Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
In her lecture, Nadine Aubry, a Raymond J. Lane Distinguished Professor and the head of the department of mechanical engineering here at Carnegie Mellon University, will discuss mechanical engineering and how it lies at the crossroads of physics, mathematics, engineering, and the arts. She will also reference the field as being the backbone of numerous applications in aerospace, automotive energy, the environment, nanotechnology, bioengineering, materials, robotics, and information technology. 
Aubry will then describe some contributions her own research group has made to the field, which focus heavily on a connection between fluid mechanics and other academic disciplines.
Aubry describes her life as having “always been at some kind of boundary.” She’ll share experiences about growing up in metropolitan Paris and the rural French Loire Valley, about being a female in a mostly male-dominated profession, and about immigrating to the United States. 
She hopes that sharing her experiences regarding her feeling “a sense of not belonging” can be helpful to Carnegie Mellon students feeling like they’re in the same position..

2010-02-01,CMU,India,"Bhangra in the Burgh, Carnegie Mellon University’s annual bhangra competition, had the entire campus community tapping to its beats last Saturday.
Courtesy of cmuTV.org.
Bhangra. Over the past three years, this word has created a special place for itself in the Carnegie Mellon lingo. To an outsider, bhangra — one of the most popular Indian dances — would entail brilliant colors, energy-packed performances, and wholesome entertainment. To the average Carnegie Mellon student, bhangra has come to mean all this and much more. Bhangra in the Burgh, Carnegie Mellon University’s annual bhangra competition, is the largest student-run event on campus and has transformed from just being a celebration of dance to a gathering of vibrant student life, an event that has the entire campus community tapping to its beats.
Considering the fact that the show was sold out, it seems clear that Bhangra in the Burgh has retained its popularity over the years. Like the previous two years’ competitions, Bhangra in the Burgh 3, held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall last Saturday, was enjoyable until the very end. As always, the organizational skill involved was phenomenal. The co-chairs for the event this year were Gurmukh Singh Chhabra, a junior chemical engineering major; Vishal Agrawal, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major; and Suraj Baxi, a sophomore social and decision sciences major. The event was planned to be bigger and better than those of the previous years. Chhabra explained that the university’s Pittsburgh chapter alumni meeting was happening the same weekend, “so we have 75 alumni coming and watching the show.” Chhabra said that this would be a great platform to promote the show and “showcase [to the alumni] what CMU has to offer and what bhangra really is.”
According to Agrawal, handling the entire event was both “an honor and responsibility.” The event was all the more honorable as all the proceeds from the event were donated to the Children’s Home of Pittsburgh. The fact that it is a charitable event makes Bhangra in the Burgh stand out. “There are a lot of Bhangra competitions all over the nation that are done by professional companies, and all the profits are kept by them,” Chhabra said. “[We wanted to] give back to the community and carry forward the goal of the 2007 co-chairs and put Pittsburgh on the map.”
By drawing in teams from all over the nation, the competition has certainly made Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon well known names in the realm of bhangra. This year, the competition boasted eight competing bhangra teams: Rutgers Bhangra, Cornell Bhangra, Drexel University Bhangra, UVA di Shaan, George Mason University Bhangra, Michigan Bhangra team, DC Bhangra Crew, and VCU Bhangra.
To appeal to a wider portion of the campus population, a number of exhibition acts were included in the program. These acts consisted of performances by Carnegie Mellon groups including the dance troupes Tanah, Chak De, and SoulStylz, as well as a cappella groups Deewane and the Originals. Other exhibition acts included dance performances by the University of Pittsburgh’s Indian dance troupe, Pitt Raas, as well as Point Park University’s hip-hop group, Impulse.
To add to the entertainment quotient, stand-up comedians Rajiv Satyal and Monrok were invited as the MCs for the evening. From performing a hilarious rendition of one of Bollywood’s most famous dances to cracking witty jokes on the Indian community, the MCs ensured that the event was enjoyable for all.
The dances themselves were quite remarkable. Although each of the competing teams retained the basic flavors of the power-packed bhangra style, there was always at least one aspect of each performance that was unique to each team. Notable among these were the performances of DC Bhangra Crew, an all-women team that had a rather different, yet pleasing, style of choreography, and Cornell Bhangra, which spelled out the name of their university during the dance through the body postures of the dancers. George Mason University Bhangra and UVA di Shaan both made excellent use of dholaks, instruments similar to drums that add to the beats of the music. Their innovative techniques of experimenting with the music, and also their energetic performances, earned George Mason University Bhangra and UVA di Shaan the third and second prizes, respectively. The first prize went to returning champions VCU Bhangra, who, along with dancing flawlessly to the music, incorporated some Punjabi lines of speech into their act, adding to the rustic feeling of the performance.
The exhibition acts were also quite entertaining. One of the most enjoyable performances was by SoulStylz. The group integrated a number of different dance styles in their performance, including hip-hop and typical Bollywood dance. By choosing popular songs from Indian movies to dance to, SoulStylz had a large portion of the audience singing along. The University of Pittsburgh’s team performed traditional raas from the western part of India, as opposed to bhangra, which is a dance of the north. This different dance style helped showcase some of the variety that Indian culture has to offer. The event concluded with a performance by Carnegie Mellon’s very own bhangra team, Chak De. Chak De’s fast-paced dance and the overwhelming support and cheering they received from the audience created an excellent performance.
Although there were some minor technical problems with the sound system, the overall event was a great success. Compared to last year, there were very few issues with the seating in the hall. Agrawal said that this was a conscious effort, as the staff took extra care to ensure that it did not repeat the mistakes it had made before. However, the planning of the event was not without some major setbacks. One of the major issues the committee faced was that of sponsorship. “Most of our external sponsors backed out,” Chhabra said. However, despite this, the show managed to run smoothly.
For the co-chairs though, success would be determined by the satisfaction of the overwhelmingly large Bhangra in the Burgh staff. “I think the entire event would be a failure if the people who worked the event didn’t have a great time,” Baxi said.
In fact, as a tribute to the staff, the co-chairs put together a video of some of the special moments shared by the staff while preparing for the event and showcased it at the end of the program.
Baxi said spending time with the staff was one of the most enjoyable parts of coordinating the event. “[It was great] spending time with the committee and getting to know people who you would never know otherwise.” Agrawal agreed and said, “[The show is] a good way to network and to get to know the campus community.”
For a show that has used Indian culture to bring together a variety of people from all parts of the university, Bhangra in the Burgh has truly captured the spirit of a diverse community like Carnegie Mellon..

2010-02-01,CMU,India,"When one goes off campus for a meal, one expects a great evening out with good food. However, going out for a meal is not just about food, it is also about having a memorable experience. Shadyside is just a short walks away from campus and has plenty of delicious restaurants to try. La Feria is located right above Pamela’s Diner, and it provides a great opportunity for a new culinary journey.
La Feria is a Peruvian restaurant co-owned by Pamela Cohen, owner of Pittsburgh’s favorite American diner Pamela’s, and Luis Perras, a Peruvian native. Because of this, La Feria serves up an American take on the Peruvian kitchen. I have nothing against Americanized food, as long as it is done with an understanding of native food and American cuisine. After all, it is only natural that foreign cuisine is subject to a lack of the same resources. Such constraints provide a great stage for interpretation, as accomplished by well known Mario Batali’s Americanized Italian cuisine or the well-known David Handler’s Americanized Crépe Parisiennes.
Aside from the regular salad and sandwiches, La Feria serves Peruvian foods like empanadas, a dumpling made from pastry dough and various fillings. Not only is La Feria a restaurant, but it also doubles as a self-proclaimed Peruvian craft gallery. The ambience is quite unusual. One feels like a tourist dining in a souvenir shop.
The Piqueo meal for two is fairly proced. It includes a set of two specials, two empanadas, sweet potato chips, rice, French bread, and a salad. The Pepian De Choclo, described by a waiter as a rice soufflé with corn, sweet pepper and Pastel De Papas, reminds one of an English sheperd’s pie with minced beef.
The sweet potato chips were nicely done: very thinly and evenly sliced, fried just until crisp and not oily. They were served with a type of cottage cheese, an intelligent counterpart for the unusual chips. The mild tang to the crisp sweet potato chips was enjoyable. Many places would have over-fried and burned the extra sugar in the potatoes. Unlike most potato dishes, these chips were not filling, but instead added a hint of sweetness to the meal — as if fried in shallot oil.
The empanadas were stuffed with minced chorizo, traditionally referred to as dried sausage and commonly used in Spanish cuisine with minced beef and raisins. The warm chorizo that fills the empanadas reminds one of Indian influences, while the minced beef and raisins were something like a traditional English mincemeat pie.
The Pepian De Choclo was presented with a rice soufflé served next to white rice and a generous cold green salad with standard oil and vinegar dressing. This salad, topped with freshly grated cheese, walnuts, and black olives, was refreshing.
The rice soufflé was lukewarm and unsatisfying, draped over salted mashed rice with corn and pepper strings. Generally, soufflé is an airy, whipped, egg white-based French dish baked in an oven and is usually served as a dessert. I have no objection to creative dishes, but describing mashed rice as a soufflé was misleading. The Pastel De Papas was nothing memorable. If these dishes were really the specials, one would hope the daily menu could prove much stronger.
The history of La Feria can be traced back to 1993, but, despite its history and good reputation, the tables at La Feria last Friday night were surprisingly empty. It was also interesting to note that two drastically different meals, La Feria’s and Pamela’s, were coming out of the same kitchen.
Nonetheless, it can be imagined that a meal like this might be served in a little tourist trap in a popular tourist area somewhere in Peru; westernized native food for foreign travelers.
La Feria is located right on top of Pamela’s Diner. The restaurant is open from Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and the craft gallery is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m..

2010-02-08,CMU,India,"In yesterday’s Super Bowl, two teams from different backgrounds but with many similarities faced off in a thrilling championship game. The city of New Orleans, only five years removed from the devastating Hurricane Katrina, has seen the Saints as a beacon of hope. Meanwhile, the Colts are merely looking to solidify themselves as one of the most dominant teams of the decade. The final result sent the people of New Orleans into a Mardi Gras-like celebration, as the Saints came out victorious by a score of 31–17.
Throughout the season, the Colts players and coaches have been under the microscope for every game. After starting out the season with 14 straight victories, Indianapolis’ head coach Jim Caldwell made what could be the most debated call of the season. Leading 15–10 against the New York Jets, Caldwell pulled his starters in order to keep his players healthy for the playoffs. The Jets feasted on the Colts’ reserves, and the hopes for a perfect season faded away. Despite much scrutiny, this decision did not affect the Colts’ Super Bowl run, as they defeated the Baltimore Ravens and the Jets on their way to their third-ever Super Bowl appearance.
Seeking the Lombardi Trophy for the first time ever, the New Orleans Saints followed a similar path as the Colts. They began their season with 13 straight wins and were considered the best team in the NFL for a long period of time. However, they finished the season with three consecutive losses, which led to many questions about the Saints’ toughness and desire at the end of the season. The Saints squashed these doubts with convincing wins over the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals and the Brett Favre-led Minnesota Vikings.
With the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees looking on last night, the Saints won the coin toss and elected to receive. However, they were unable to capitalize and had to punt the ball to the potent Colts offense. With two impressive drives led by the impeccable Peyton Manning, the Colts staked themselves to an early 10–0 lead. Wide receiver Pierre Garcon, a native of Haiti, capped the longest drive in Super Bowl history with a receiving touchdown from 19 yards out.
Down 10 and reeling, the Saints needed a spark to keep this game from being a blowout. The second quarter seemed to wake them up, as they cut the lead to 10–3 and were threatening at the Colts’ 1-yard line. Looking to tie up the score, the Saints went for it on fourth down from the 1-yard line with a rush to the right by tailback Mike Bell. As quarterback Drew Brees handed the ball off, a wave of white jerseys smothered Bell for a loss, which kept the score at 10–3. The Saints, while dominating the second quarter, couldn’t take the lead and entered the locker room at halftime down 10–6.
After an exciting first half and a not-so-exciting halftime performance from The Who, the third quarter started off with a play that no one was expecting. Wily Saints coach Sean Payton decided to try and keep the ball out of Manning’s and the Colts’ hands by going for an unexpected onside kick. The kick was perfectly executed, and the Saints recovered. Soon, running back Pierre Thomas punched it into the end zone to give the Saints their first lead of the game, 13–10. A back-and-forth third quarter soon ended with the Colts ahead, 17–16.
Up by one going into the fourth quarter with the ball, the Colts seemed to be in a good position to win the game. Saints fans held their breath as the Colts advanced to the New Orleans 37-yard line. Colts head coach Jim Caldwell was faced with a decision: to punt the ball or to go for a long 54-yard field goal from 42-year-old Matt Stover. 
In what was a questionable decision, Caldwell went for the field goal and was disappointed. Stover missed wide left and the Saints were given great field position. A few Brees passes later and after a circus catch by fourth-string receiver Lance Moore, the Saints scored a touchdown and converted for an extra two points, extending their lead to 24–17.
Now down seven, it was time for Manning to prove that he is the best quarterback in the league. Things were looking good as the Colts marched down to the Saints’ 40-yard line. Manning dropped back to pass, and the Saints countered with an all-out blitz. Due to the pressure, Manning had to get rid of the ball and threw to one of his short routes. Unfortunately for him, Saints cornerback Tracy Porter read his eyes and jumped the route. Porter intercepted the wayward Manning pass and raced 70 yards to the end zone as the city of New Orleans erupted in pure ecstasy..

2010-02-08,CMU,India,"A blizzard dumping up to two feet of snow shut down much of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon this weekend and into the week — with classes canceled both Monday and Tuesday.
The storm caused many campus facilities to close, including most campus dining locations. The Carnegie Mellon Café, The Underground, Taste of India, and Sí Señor were open with limited menus and shorter hours. Campus restaurant closures caused difficulties for many students living on campus. “I’m half starving,” said Leslye Graham, a first-year in H&SS. “We’ve been eating pita bread and hummus all day. Everything was closed so we went to Entropy.”
Campus dining locations that did stay open found themselves short-staffed and facing a much bigger crowd than usual. 
Entropy and restaurants in Resnik House saw a much greater number of students than usual.
Students who do not reside on campus were also impacted by the storm. Treacherous road conditions made travel very difficult. Dangerous roads caused the Pittsburgh Port Authority to limit its bus service to one route beginning on Friday night and lasting through Saturday. Limited bus service was restored on Sunday morning, with nearly full service expected to be restored on Monday morning.
Some students avoided traveling back and forth from their homes, choosing instead to come to campus in the morning and stay for the entire day. 
Restaurant closures in Oakland and Squirrel Hill forced some students to travel to campus to get their meals. “Because of the snow, I ate at Schatz for the first time since my first year,” said fifth-year architecture major Jerome Williams.
Carnegie Mellon employees also found themselves impacted by storm conditions. Many were unable to report to work due to suspended bus services and icy roads. Those who were able to report to work were relocated from their normal work stations to cover for those who were not able to come in. 
Weather conditions also affected some employees’ ability to return to their homes. Six Housing and Dining Services employees were forced to stay overnight in Resnik House. “I slept on a couch with a tablecloth for a blanket,” said Maria Gonzalez, one of the six stranded employees. “It was terrible.”
While Pittsburgh is slow to respond to the effects of the storm, Carnegie Mellon Facilities Management Services have been working diligently to clear walkways and driveways of snow and ice. 
However, despite the hard work of campus employees, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday classes were canceled due to severe weather conditions.

2010-02-15,CMU,India,"Each year, Carnegie Mellon hosts a variety of panels and lectures with the goal of inspiring the campus and the surrounding community. In the spring, Carnegie Mellon will continue this tradition by hosting a series of lectures in a student-organized conference in April.
Carnegie Mellon’s TEDx will mirror the nationally recognized TEDTalks, created by Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED), an organization dedicated to what it calls “ideas that are worth spreading.” TED was founded in 1984 as an American nonprofit organization created to bringing attention to new ideas. TED’s first official conference took place in 1990, where featured guests were invited to share their ideas relating to the three themes of technology, entertainment, and design. Since then, the themes discussed in TEDTalks have become much broader — hosting many insightful discussions with a series of experts, world leaders, and artists. Some of the more prominent speakers have included former  Vice President Al Gore, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, and jazz musician Herbie Hancock. The annual conferences in Long Beach and Oxford bring together the world’s “thinkers and doers” who are challenged to give the lecture of their lives — in only 18 minutes.
Now, almost 20 years later, according to TED’s official website, TED is still going strong in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, with its speakers offering new ways to look at the world. On TED’s website www.ted.com, performances from TED events are available to the world, for free. More than 500 TEDTalks are now available.
The nonprofit has also created a program known as TEDx, which allows other organizations like schools and businesses to plan and host a conference of their own. Carnegie Mellon School of Art professor Golan Levin, a speaker at a previous TED conference, believes “it lends some profile to what is otherwise a local affair.”
A group of students at Carnegie Mellon expressed interest in setting up a conference, and after much planning, the event has finally gotten off the ground and is planned to take place on April 4, 2010. The event will appeal to all students regardless of interest or major. According to TED’s official website, “This immersive environment allows attendees and speakers from vastly different fields to cross-fertilize and draw inspiration from unlikely places.” Unlike the official conferences, which are by invitation only, TEDx tickets will be available to students, staff, and the greater community.
Carnegie Mellon has had plenty of interaction with TED in the past. The city of Pittsburgh hosted a TEDx Leadership Pittsburgh conference on Nov. 14, 2009, which was attended by six professors from Carnegie Mellon. One attendee, professor Charlee Brodsky from the School of Design, claimed that there was “never a dull moment.”
“It mixes the arts with humanities with the sciences,” said Brodsky, a professor of photography, who represented her vocation through a series of pictures set in India. The main focus of her talk was the combination of pictures and words that had been organized in a specific order to convey meaning. Within the other featured talks, spanning topics from computer science to poetry, she believed that “there always seemed to be something for everyone.”
A Facebook fan page has been created publicizing of Carnegie Mellon’s TEDx talks, currently sporting over 800 fans. Several speakers have been lined up. Tickets will soon be available via online reservation..

2010-02-22,CMU,India,"Oregon Trail and Lemonade Stand games on an Apple II computer probably raise a sense of nostalgia among many who played these games as children. Although obsolete in the United States now, eight-bit games are making a comeback for educational purposes in developing countries through the work of Ph.D. student Derek Lomas at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) and his organization, Playpower.
The original inspiration came from a 2007 internship with Qualcomm in India, where Lomas noticed inexpensive computers, about $12 in U.S. dollars, being sold in Indian markets. While experimenting to see how well the computers, based off only an eight-bit processor, worked, he discovered that they had the ability to play video games similar to Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). With most of the NES patents expired and a wealth of information left by hackers of the system, this seemed to be a perfect opportunity for Lomas to begin creating free educational video games for a new generation of learners.
“It is exciting to see games like these being made available at little or no cost to students around the world and re-creating the cycle of educational impact,” said Daniel Siewiorek, director of the HCII.
An idea that generated interest among volunteers was of incorporating Hindu mythology into the games, creating a cultural component to attract young users. “One of the goals of the project has to do with the fact that video games are a cultural expression that is only really expressed in countries that are rich enough to afford PS3. The idea that you could have games reflective of these cultures where it could be bought by a common person ... is pretty cool,” Lomas said.
For example, Hanuman, an ape-like god of immense power and a reincarnation of Shiva, is the hero in the first game. This game teaches typing not only as a skill, but also as a pathway to job opportunities. “Being comfortable typing on a computer might help not just to teach [users] to type quickly, but to give them a culture with computers. That is important,” Lomas said. 
With the success of the movie Slumdog Millionaire in 2008, the second game will appeal to families in India. It is hoped that this quiz show game will encourage families to discuss topics together as they play it on their television screen. A third video game addresses the public health issue of malaria in India, as children kill mosquitoes and buy nets and kerosene for protection.
Awarded $180,000 in grants last year from the MacArthur Foundation, Playpower hopes to have the video games prepared for June to present to the foundation. After that, the games would be introduced into manufacturing and everyday households, rewarding the work of over 100 global volunteers. The collaborative effort also held a two-week workshop in India in December in which three Carnegie Mellon professors participated.
“I see Playpower as an initiative to develop a broader community who will work on e-learning games for underprivileged children in developing countries,” said Matthew Kam, Lomas’s adviser. “As such, Playpower is one mechanism for us to get our research results into the hands of real-world designers.”
Although Playpower has numerous volunteers, there are few in Pittsburgh. Lomas sees students as potential volunteers, as he suggests that volunteer work for Playpower could be incorporated into the classroom — especially with computer science and electrical and computer engineering students at Carnegie Mellon.
“Hardware hacking, assembly programming, music ... there are many ways students can help, even helping finish the designs of the games if they don’t program,” Lomas said. Lomas encouraged interested persons to visit volunteers.playpower.org.
Lomas explained that he feels his project has found a home at Carnegie Mellon. “Maybe the best thing is that I was able to come to Carnegie Mellon with this project because there is an acceptance here for doing research that has an impact,” he said..

2010-03-01,CMU,India,"In high school, when trying to decide which college to attend, I looked at a lot of information about each school I was applying to — the size of the classes, the student-to-faculty ratio, the area around the school, and the majors that the school offered. For me, a school needed to offer a wide variety of majors because I wasn’t altogether sure what I wanted to study, and I wanted to keep my options open.
Colleges and universities that offer a diverse array of majors usually seem more appealing to students, regardless of how large or small each department might be. The state of Pennsylvania, though, seems to think that only some majors are worth having.
A recent Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article states that the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education is considering eliminating many majors at state-owned universities such as Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Lock Haven University. Majors with fewer than 30 graduates over five years will be reviewed.
This means that over 200 majors are currently being examined for potential elimination. The majors being examined at each of the state’s 14 universities vary, but they include majors in departments like chemistry, French, math, German, economics, philosophy, and mass communications, just to name a few.
This change is being proposed in order to save money and cut costs in anticipation of reduced federal and state funding for the universities. Cutting costs may be necessary, but cutting majors is not.
For students who can only afford to attend state-owned schools, this decision will likely provide huge disadvantages. Students may be forced to study things that don’t interest them; they might be forced to attend a school with fewer advantages for them, or one that isn’t such a good fit.
Universities are centers for education. Students should graduate having had a well-rounded education with courses in both the sciences and the humanities. This will provide a better perspective for them — but only if the courses they take are of high quality.
If universities are forced to eliminate certain majors, faculty members from those departments are likely to leave the university. Students will be left without qualified teachers or will be unable to take classes in certain fields, possibly blocking them from finding out what really interests them.
In addition, public universities will lose their competitive advantage over private ones. While state-owned schools are less expensive than private schools, part of their appeal depends upon the diversity they offer, and not just in terms of students.
By taking classes in areas that may be less popular, students broaden their horizons and gain the opportunity to share views with more diverse groups of people. A diversity of classes and ideas is just as important as a diversity of students, and cutting majors that don’t have huge numbers of people in them jeopardizes this diversity.
In the Post-Gazette article, Kenn Marshall, the State System spokesman, said that they were trying to help students where they needed help most, meaning financially. By cutting majors, the universities could avoid raising tuition.
Marshall assumes incorrectly that the state’s priority should be to help students financially at the expense of their educational opportunities. While it is important to keep costs for students as low as possible, sacrificing the quality of the students’ education is not the best way to do this.
Moreover, the state should not be making decisions that are better left to university officials. The state is responsible for the financial aspects of these universities, but the educational side of the university — including decisions about which majors to offer to draw more students to the institution — should be made by school administrators.
With the elimination of so many majors across the board at Pennsylvania-owned universities, it will become more difficult to attract students from out of state or from other countries, decreasing diversity at the schools.
Putting finances ahead of educational quality and diversity may also affect universities’ rankings, which are often important for students and employers, not to mention the universities themselves.
Students who would have otherwise chosen to attend a university in Pennsylvania might decide to attend a school in another state or a private institution, decreasing the amount of money schools get from tuition and fees. 
While there may be fewer students to educate, many of the costs at universities are fixed. For example, the salaries of professors and staff members are unlikely to decrease with a decrease in the number of students, and campus maintenance costs will remain roughly the same as well. This puts the universities in an even worse position financially.
Even putting this aside, though, it is unclear why the state is willing to make sacrifices in higher education even as the federal government is trying to improve primary and secondary education to better prepare students for college.
The federal government has made education a priority, and the state of Pennsylvania should, too. The State System of Higher Education should look elsewhere for places to cut budgets without sacrificing the quality and diversity of education in state-owned universities.

2010-03-22,CMU,India,"It’s in the headlines all the time. We see it, we read it, and we move on. It’s just another piece of news. Why should we spend more time reading about a bombing in some foreign country than reading about the next football game? I guess not everyone does this, but a majority of us do. I have been skimming and ignoring such terrorism-related news for a while now. In fact, I tend to look at the headline and first figure out how many fatalities there were. Four dead? Well, that’s not too bad, right? I mean, we’ve had terrorist attacks in which many more were killed. What difference do four more make to the ever-growing list of innocent people who lost their lives in such attacks?
It was with this attitude that I read the news of nine deaths due to a bomb blast in a small café in India. Nine, I thought, that’s not such a big deal. India’s seen worse. And then I read the name of the city where it happened. Pune. My hometown. I read the name of the café. The German bakery — a place I’ve passed a number of times and heard friends telling me I had to go to because of the great food. I never went inside, and I never will be able to now. I sat staring at the news piece incredulously for a while. This was the first time that something like this had happened in Pune.
Here’s some background info that will help you understand my disbelief. Pune is a sleepy city. Especially when compared to its neighbor, Mumbai, Pune is more of a town than a city. Most shops in Pune close from noon to 4 p.m. People need to eat lunch and then take a nice nap. The streets are either filled with a number of small colleges or are taken up by cafés and restaurants. For a typical “Punekar,” life is all about eating, sleeping, eating, studying a little (if you’re a student), and sleeping and eating some more. It’s a great city and a great life, and you can probably tell why. Now imagine a bomb blast ripping through one of the city’s prized cafés and breaking the serenity of this perfect little picture. Disbelief? My reaction exactly.
After the disbelief had faded, panic started creeping in. My parents usually never go to that part of town — would they have gone there today? Were my friends safe? Once the panic had completely settled in, there was the frantic search for the list of the dead — I wanted to make sure I knew none of them.
It was a small bomb blast. Nine deaths (although the number rose to 17), and I cared. I cared a lot. I went on campus after I read the news article, wondering why everyone wasn’t as upset about the situation as I was. I realize now that I cared because it happened in the city I grew up in and love — why would anyone else care as much? But at that moment, I wished they would. I wished others would understand that bombs in cafés aren’t everyday things.
It’s been a month since the blast happened and it has made me understand that for every such situation, there is somebody out there who does care; that somebody probably also wishes that you would care about it. It’s not possible to be as moved by the situation as someone who has personal links with it, but it is possible to give such happenings a little more thought than we do now. It is possible to at least try to care, to at least read through the entire news article on the subject, to at least realize that this is a serious matter. Bombings aren’t normal, and we should stop treating them as if they were.

2010-03-29,CMU,India,"One of the strongest sports teams on campus doesn’t even compete in Division III. The number-62 Ultimate Frisbee team (of 400 teams), boasting a 9–1 season record, is the only team to compete in Division I at Carnegie Mellon.
Most notable of their successes was the IUP Nut Buster, a 10-team tournament held in Indiana, Pa. on March 14–15. The Tartans threw better and ran faster than all seven of their opponents, including John Carroll University, Catholic University, Clarion University, Kent State University, and Bloomsburg University, to finish the weekend 7–0, which included an exciting final win against the Rochester Institute of Technology, 15–9.
Captain Jeremy Kanter is hopeful about his team’s results to come. 
“The only teams in our section that have proven they can be better than us this season are Pitt and Penn State. Penn State is a lot like us: a really hard-working group that makes up for a lack of star players by playing a fundamentally sound game top to bottom,” he said. 
“They’ve had the edge on us this year, winning all three games we’ve faced them in, but they’re a team we know we can beat if we put all the pieces together for a full game.”
Just last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon Ultimate team tore up the field in a one-day tournament held in Shippensburg, Pa, a few hours away from Pittsburgh.
The Tartans kicked off their successful day at 9 a.m. with a match against Penn State’s B team, whom the Tartans steamrolled 13–1. In their next match, the Tartans faced the A team from the same school in an exciting battle. Despite an 8–7 lead, the Tartans let their defenses down at the last minute and fell 10–8. This loss didn’t stop Carnegie Mellon from destroying their next opponents, Dickinson College, 13–5.
Last weekend concluded the regular season for the Ultimate team. They have a break before their sectionals in two weeks, hosted by Penn State University on April 10–11..

2010-04-05,CMU,India,"Ah, baseball season. Hope springs eternal. The crack of the bat, the pop of the mitt, the uninhibited stream of profanity coming from everyone in my family’s mouth toward the TV...
I believe baseball was the main reason we stopped trying to “keep it clean” in front of my baby brother.
Today marks the true beginning of the 2010 baseball season. Twenty-eight of 30 Major League teams play their season openers, many while we’re still in class, but with technology these days it’s impossible not to follow the game even without a TV or a ticket. If you like baseball, you’ll find a way.
True, the “official” beginning of the season was Sunday night, when major league baseball’s overzealous schedulers pitted the New York Yankees against the Boston Red Sox in the first game of 2010. Putting such a fierce rivalry front and center may be great for ESPN’s ratings, but season-opening series aren’t meant for that kind of intense history. Save those matchups and pile them on as much as possible later in the season, when both teams are playing must-win games, and there’s your rivalry.
That’s what it came down to last year, as the Red Sox won all eight of their meetings against the Yankees from April to June before the Yanks won nine of the 10 remaining games in August and September en route to clinching the American League East title and, eventually, winning the World Series.
When my team, the New York Mets, open their season at 1:10 p.m. against the Florida Marlins, it’ll begin their 162-game chance to prove that their dismal 2009 season was a fluke, that they can stay healthy (they had 17 players on the disabled list last year), and that they can go back to being a serious contender. The Marlins will not be out to prove much; rather, like every year, they’ll hope to surprise. The Marlins, much like the Pittsburgh Pirates, Kansas City Royals, Washington Nationals, and Baltimore Orioles, tend not to have much in the expectation department each year; however, unlike the others, the Marlins have winning seasons every now and again. That’s where the surprise comes in.
Some Pirates were quoted in the off-season as considering the playoffs a pretty reasonable goal for the club. Others claim finally having any winning percentage at or over .500 is reasonable. After a professional sports record of 17 straight losing seasons and a relatively quiet off-season — acquiring infielder Akinori Iwamura was their one really big move — it’s hard to believe anything good at all will come from this season. But the season has yet to begin, and optimism is always the best option.
After all, stranger things have happened; the aforementioned low-to-no-expectations group of teams used to be larger. The 2003 Detroit Tigers lost an American League record of 119 games and were the laughingstock of the league until they came out of nowhere in 2006 to make it all the way to the World Series. The Tampa Bay Rays played losing baseball from their inception into the majors in 1998 through 2007 before similarly making the World Series in 2008. 
Even the Nationals, when they moved to Washington in 2005, were in first place for the first half of the season before they remembered that they were the former Montreal Expos and fell completely off the map in the second half.
Then there are teams like the Cincinnati Reds, who played shoddy baseball last year but made significant enough improvements in the off-season to put them on most people’s comeback list. The Seattle Mariners, who played laughably in 2008, went back into the win column last year and made a plethora of significant acquisitions over the winter. They are now the favorites to unseat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as the AL West champions.
Unfortunately, the ball can roll the other way, as perhaps the new favorite to have the worst season in baseball is the Toronto Blue Jays. Formerly a sure choice for third place in the AL East behind Boston and New York, they fell behind the Rays in 2008 and 2009. Over the off-season, though, they traded their ace Roy Halladay and, combined with the Orioles’ minor 
improvements, enter this season with the unofficial motto of “The Rebuilding Has Begun.” Joining them as newer members in the written-off club are the Oakland A’s, the Cleveland Indians, and the San Diego Padres; the only bets people are placing on the Padres involve if and when they trade star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to the Red Sox.
But again, hope springs eternal. No club, not even Toronto, goes into the season thinking they’ve made their team worse. Who will be this year’s Tampa Bay? Who will be this year’s A’s? Who will be this year’s Pirates? At least that one’s easy. Here are my predictions for this year’s division champs and chumps:
AL East: Champs — Yankees, Chumps — Blue Jays; 
AL Central: Champs — Twins, Chumps — Indians; 
AL West: Champs — Mariners, Chumps — A’s; 
NL East: Champs — Phillies, Chumps — Marlins; 
NL Central: Champs — Cubs, Chumps — Pirates; 
NL West: Champs — Giants, Chumps — Padres.
Happy baseball, everybody!.

2010-04-05,CMU,India,"Kohli’s is an Indian grocery on South Craig Street, hidden between Union Grill and Lucca’s. Initially, my trip to Kohli’s was focused on getting a gallon of milk. Then, with milk off my list, I began to collect more groceries that I would usually get from Giant Eagle.
As I wasn’t familiar with Indian cuisine, wandering around Kohli’s was an entirely new experience for me. Rather than going to Kohli’s for just a gallon of milk or some onions and shallots, I went through Kohli’s for a vacation.
Opened in 1989 as a strictly Indian grocery, Sanjeev Kohli’s South Craig Street store later expanded into a general store; however, Indian and Middle Eastern ingredients are still the primary sale items.
To most students, Kohli’s is probably well known for their samosas. You can get a samosa — a fried dough snack stuffed with spiced potato — for only 90 cents. Even when it’s a little colder than you might prefer, this over-stuffed, spice-filled pocket is an affordable between-meal snack and is very filling.
Besides samosas, Kohli’s carries other ready-to-eat foods. Another big draw is their popular chicken lunch: About 150 chicken lunches are sold each day. Many of their top-selling foods are shipped from various Indian restaurants in New York or Washington D.C.
Imported goods are also shipped to Kohli’s from major Indian importers in Detroit and other cities. The spice packs they sell are the same as those used in traditional kitchens throughout India.
A well-known Indian dish is chicken tikka masala, a dish which writer Shoba Narayan called “Britain’s national dish” because it is so popular in England. With tikka masala mix purchased from Kohli’s and a cut of chicken, you are ready to create a delicious meal.
For those who pass Kohli’s on their way home, it can be a great last-minute grocery stop before making dinner. At Kohli’s you can get basics like ginger, onion, eggplant, or exotic long squashes. Kohli, the store’s owner, said that all of the store’s fresh produce is shipped from Florida.
Kohli also has a regular American grocery selection — providing customers with jars of pickles, trash bags, dish detergent, and even lasagna. Kohli’s is definitely more accessible than you’d think. In terms of business, Kohli said that the store expands and grows with the needs of customers.
Kohli’s is not just an Indian grocery store; it is a grocery store with a strong focus on Indian and other Asian cuisine, since Indians share a culinary background with some other Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern regions. Indian students may find comfort in familiar surroundings, but to me, walking into the unfamiliar setting with different aromas was like a micro-vacation. The charm of traveling is getting away from the usual routine. In this case, I found it by working my way through an unfamiliar aisle..

2010-04-05,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon’s cricket team hosted a benefit match last Saturday at noon for three Pittsburgh police officers who lost their lives last year.
The three officers, Eric G. Kelly, Stephen J. Mayhle, and Paul J. Sciullo II, lost their lives in April 2009 while answering a domestic call in the Stanton Heights neighborhood. It was the first on-duty death of Pittsburgh officers in 18 years. 
All three of the officers loved baseball and had been interested in cricket due to the similarities between the two sports. With this in mind, the police department approached Carnegie Mellon’s cricket team to play the memorial match. The team members were deeply affected and determined to do something to help honor the sacrifices of those individuals. With the help of CIT Public Relations Director Chriss Swaney, who organized the ceremony, they put on an exhibition cricket match honoring the fallen officers.
“[The Pittsburgh police] keep our city safe,” said Sagar Shah, a junior electrical and computer engineering major and the president of the Cricket Club. “We feel really safe when we see a policeman standing in the corner, patrolling the area, and it is because of their efforts that the campus community is a much more safe and fun place to be.” 
Shah has been impressed by the service of the officers, especially in comparison to college campuses in India, where many of the team’s members are originally from.
Last Saturday’s  match began with a bagpipe gala by sponsored performer Patrick Regan, followed by a presentation of awards to both Pittsburgh deputy George Sugar and University Police officer Paul Helffrich to thank them for their service.
“We had never anticipated the amount of support,” said Sugar as he accepted his plaque. He spoke briefly on the police force’s dedication to community and family that remains unwavering despite the risks. “Every time they put on that badge and walk out that door, it may be the last time.”
As further tribute to the officers, eight of the cricket team members released eight doves symbolizing peace. Regan followed the release with a bagpipe rendition of “Amazing Grace.”
After this, the game began. The team split into two groups and played a modified version of a typical cricket match, without padding and with the standard leather ball replaced with a duct-taped tennis ball.
Cricket has similar mechanics to baseball, but with notable differences. Most of the action takes place on a strip of field called the pitch. There are two batsmen at opposite sides of the pitch, and the pitcher (known as the bowler) throws the ball toward one of the batsmen from the opposite side of the pitch. The bowler’s goal is to knock over the wickets, in this game represented by a stack of plastic crates, to get the batsman out. When the ball is hit, the fieldsmen — everyone else on the bowler’s team — try to catch the ball to knock over the opponent’s wickets, while the two batsmen switch sides, called a run, and score the batting team points.
At the match’s conclusion, Police Chief Nathan E. Harper arrived to accept three plaques officially honoring the fallen officers. “It’s been a struggling year,” Harper said. “At every [police] event, we have to deal with challenges. It’s been a humbling experience when you see groups pull together.”
After the exhibition, the Carnegie Mellon team departed to Wooster College, where they competed in a four-day tournament. The tournament consisted of three competing teams from colleges and universities. The Carnegie Mellon team returned victorious, winning all of their matches..

Indiana University of Pennsylvania was the next team to fall victim to Mr. Yuk's throwing, managing to score only six goals against Mr. Yuk's 13. Mr. Yuk's run was ended later that afternoon by rival Pennsylvania State with a final score of 14–8.
The top four teams at sectionals earned the chance to travel to New Jersey for the regional tournament during the first week of May. Despite the loss, the Carnegie Mellon team was still in the running for a bid to regionals, a goal the Ultimate Frisbee team has not achieved since 2006. To make the tournament, the team needed to bypass rival Shippensburg. Despite a close match, Mr. Yuk fell 13–9. Later in the day, Mr. Yuk faced Penn State B and Indiana University of Pennsylvania in the consolation rounds and pulled off two more victories, 13–4 and 12–7, respectively. With only one match left to determine the final team that would qualify for the regional tournament, Mr. Yuk once again faced Shippensburg, only to be stopped 15–8 to earn fifth place. 
Mr. Yuk has been able to land its name high in the national rankings, most recently coming in at 52nd in the country in a pool of more than 300 eligible teams in the College Ultimate Championship Series.
The sectional tournament concludes the Ultimate Frisbee season. Look for Mr. Yuk next year when they start up their 2010–11 season..

2010-04-12,CMU,India,"Our universe may be inside a wormhole
Scientists have long been baffled by the creation of our universe, but an idea has been proposed that may give insight into many unanswered questions, including the elusive theory unifying the four fundamental forces of nature. Nikodem Poplawski, a theoretical physicist at Indiana University in Bloomington, has suggested that our universe may have been born from a larger universe. His theory makes use of white holes, which can be seen as the reverse of black holes. Matter cannot enter white holes, but it can escape. White holes are connected to black holes by wormholes.
According to Poplawski, an implosion may have occurred in the larger universe, creating a wormhole that connects a white and black hole. Our universe is inside this wormhole, and since matter can only move in one direction, this accounts for the observed expanding universe.
 Every time a black hole is created, he says, another universe may be forming inside a wormhole.

New species live without oxygen
Three species of Loricifera, tiny animals that live in marine sediment, have been discovered in the Mediterranean Sea at the bottom of L’Atelante Basin, whose extreme salinity prevents oxygen from mixing with the water. These are the first organisms discovered that spend their entire lives in an oxygen-free environment.
The new species, which have not yet been named, do not use mitochondria for energy. Mitochondria are organelles, or structures in a cell, that are present in every organism that needs oxygen. Instead, they use a different organelle that produces energy without oxygen. This discovery confirms the possibility of animals living in the most hazardous environments.

Memristors may replace transistors
Hewlett-Packard has announced that memristors, a shortened form for “memory transistors,” may replace traditional transistors in computers as the size of computer chips becomes atomic. Transistors are an important component in most, if not all, electronics, and amplify or switch electrical signals to direct them correctly. Today’s transistors are semiconductor transistors, but memristors can also store information without the need of an electrical current. Scientists say they resemble biological brains more than computing devices.
Memristor technology uses a thin film of titanium dioxide, which changes atomic structure slightly when current is passed through. This small alteration causes the resistivity of the film to change, which can be measured. Memristors will be 10 times smaller than the most advanced transistors today at a size of only three nanometers, and they will be able to work at speeds measured in nanoseconds.

2010-04-19,CMU,India,"Last Thursday, entrepreneur and budding writer Stephen Greer spoke to Carnegie Mellon’s Entrepreneurship Club, sharing his business experience and his new book, Starting From Scrap: An Entrepreneurial Success Story.
In Starting From Scrap, Greer recounts his story of almost 20 years in the scrap metal recycling business in Asia. A Pennsylvania native, he graduated from Penn State in the early 1990s, but found that jobs and internships were scarce due to the recession. So in 1993, after hearing from a friend that the Asian market was booming, Greer set out on a mission to succeed abroad.
“I couldn’t find the jobs I wanted in the United States,” said Greer in Thursday’s lecture. “A friend told me that he had a friend in Hong Kong and that there were so many business opportunities in Asia’s booming economy. I knew my dad had a lot of free airline miles he’d been saving up, so I asked him for a free ticket to Hong Kong.”
Greer got the ticket, headed to Hong Kong, and was soon immersed in a business market that was strikingly different from what he had experienced in the United States.
“Hong Kong is a very entrepreneurial town — everyone in one way or another is their own boss,” Greer said. “I became completely caught up in that and fell in love with the city.”
However, Greer’s entrance into the Asian market wasn’t without its flaws. He started his own business, registering it as “Hartwell Pacific,” because, as he said, “Hartwell was my middle name, and I decided to use it because I didn’t want everyone to know that I was the only one involved in my business.” From there, he began to search for his place within Hong Kong’s booming economy.
“I looked at anything and everything: Christmas ornaments, wood, hairnets, work gloves. There was a world full of opportunity; I just had to choose something and go for it,” Greer said.
Greer eventually landed a deal with scrap-metal suppliers in Asia, initiating his entrance into the scrap metal and recycled metal business. There he found success, first in the sales of scrap metal and, eventually, in adapting his company to also recycle used metal, melting it down and reforming it into new stainless steel.
With this adjustment, Greer’s business soared, opening eight operations in seven countries in one and a half years. As he put it, “By 28 I was a multi-millionaire, which was of course a good thing.” 
In 2008, after achieving a turnover of $250 million, as well as selling Hartwell Pacific to Australia’s Smorgon Steel Group and Smorgon Steel, he resigned from his position with Hartwell Pacific and became a senior adviser to Oaktree Capital, a global investment management corporation.
However, financial gain, Greer stresses, is not his ultimate concern. “Success is living the life you want to live on your terms — and I’m not talking about money. The reality is that there is a limit to how much money can improve your happiness. But, if you find something that you like and that you’re passionate about — that will take you a long way,” Greer said.
Entrepreneurship Club member and Tepper graduate student Justin G. Shaka introduced Greer as having an “important outlook on entrepreneurship across the globe.”
This holds true for many of the students in Entrepreneurship Club, as Greer’s lessons are especially applicable in today’s global market. The current economic recession bears some similarities to the recession in the early 1990s, when Greer first arrived in Hong Kong. 
According to Greer, periods of recession can drive further exploration and valuable risks. “It’s a hard time to find a job in today’s poor economy,” Greer said. “But it’s also a great time to start your own business. Bad economies can be great times to be entrepreneurs.”
Greer also expressed the valuable business lessons he learned due to his experiences across the globe. “It’s a big world — a global economy — and people need to be thinking about how they, and how their country, fit into that.”
These thoughts are echoed by Marc Faber, world-renowned economist and author of the Gloom, Doom and Boom Report. In his review of Greer’s book, he wrote that Greer “proves with a fascinating account of his business life that there are even more opportunities in Asia as countries such as China, India, and Vietnam open up and liberalize.”
Greer’s book is available now and has been listed on the South China Morning Post Bestsellers List..

2010-04-26,CMU,India,"Baseball has managed to make it through three weeks of the season with only one rainout, and it came on Friday. That’s a pretty impressive feat — not that anyone but Mother Nature really had a say in the matter — when you consider that April weather tends to wreak havoc on baseball. In 2007, Cleveland’s entire opening series with the Seattle Mariners was snowed out, and the Indians ended up having to host their “home opener” in Milwaukee.
So April has been relatively cooperative, at least weather-wise. But baseball is baseball, and nothing ever works out quite the way it’s supposed to; for every team that makes a remarkable comeback to win a game in the bottom of the ninth with clutch hitting, there’s its opponent losing a game on bad pitching. Only rarely does a team blow a game only to say, “They beat us despite our best efforts. We made our pitches and they hit them; we made our plays and they just beat us.”
The Pirates played their first two weeks like they were a real team, giving us that small glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, they’d finally put the right group of guys out on the field to mix the winning formula. After they swept the Reds on April 15–17, the Pirates sat in second place with a 7–5 record.
Then all hell broke loose. The Pirates played a gracious host to the Brewers last Tuesday through Thursday, throwing meatballs across the plate and not scoring any runs, as they fell rather disgracefully 8–1, 8–0 and 20–0. They then butchered any chance of climbing back over .500 for a third week in a row by dropping their first two games against Houston, 4–3 and 5–2.
On the bright side, those losses were the first time this season that the Pirates had lost by less than six runs.
There’s still hope, though — there’s always hope. Yogi Berra and the 1973 Mets were in last place as late as mid-August before rallying back to make it all the way to the World Series. “Ya Gotta Believe” was the slogan Tug McGraw coined that year, and you have to if you’re a real fan.
But believe it or not, there’s been more baseball this month outside of Pittsburgh. The Tampa Bay Rays and the New York Yankees are battling it out for first place in their division and quickly leaving the other teams behind, most notably the Boston Red Sox, who need to make a decision quickly on their former star of all stars, David “Big Papi” Ortiz. Now I’m not a Spanish major, nor do I play one on TV, but after watching the sadness and frustration in Ortiz’s eyes after he struck out for the umpteenth time and was eventually pinch-hit for, I’m certain that “Big Papi” is Spanish for “Bruce Banner.”
There’s also been a lot of outrage among fans and, more inappropriately, commenters on MLB.com about some controversial baseball over the past week. On Saturday, a 12-inning affair between the Minnesota Twins and the Kansas City Royals ended when Twins shortstop J.J. Hardy bobbled a grounder but recovered in time to throw to second base. Royals speedster Scott Podsednik was called out to end the game, which would have been fine — if he had actually been out. The naked eye, replays, radio and television announcers from both teams, and pretty much everyone but umpire Greg Gibson saw Podsednik slide in safely. Alas, Royals’ manager Trey Hillman’s argument was to no avail, and the game was over.
Earlier this week I wrote in my blog, “Jonas On Baseball,” about how it’s better when an umpire admits he’s wrong. It shows professionalism and it shows dedication to the game and its values. No game is ever considered a good one, no matter how close, if it hinges on a blown call. Anyone who watched A.J. Pierzynski run down to first base after he struck out in the 2005 ALCS knows that; anyone who watched Gibson call Podsednik out on Saturday knows it.
However, contrary to the belief of some “fans,” Gibson’s bad call was not because he is biased against the Royals. No umpire could ever do that and get away with it. No matter how unprofessional an umpire is or how bad of a call he makes, it will never have to do with bias or other such preference. He just made a bad call, or at the very most, he’s just a bad ump. 
Let it be known, though, that with the exception of some I cannot name (one rhymes with “Bad Bairchild”), most umps are good, professional umps.
The other controversy is over the Yankees’ Mark Teixeira, who barreled hard into Angels catcher Bobby Wilson on a play at the plate on Friday night. Wilson, who was in position to tag Teixeira out before the ball got away from him, suffered a concussion and a possible ankle injury when Teixeira slammed into him full-force, Teixiera’s shoulder appearing to make contact with Wilson’s face mask. While Wilson had to be helped off the field and taken to the hospital, Teixeira didn’t look back after touching home plate and getting into the Yankee’s dugout.
Was it unprofessional of him not to check on Wilson? No. It would have been very professional of him to go out there, but not doing so was probably a better choice given everyone’s sensitivity to intentional collisions nowadays. Teixeira’s best option to try to score was to barrel over Wilson, and he did it well. Nationwide, Teixiera is being ripped apart for knocking over Wilson, but people need to realize that although baseball is a gentleman’s game, hard-nosed baseball is good baseball. It’s not about courtesy and sunshine and flowers. It’s about winning and playing the game right.

2010-04-26,CMU,India,"When faculty members leave Carnegie Mellon, it is often instructive to reflect on what they’ve achieved throughout their tenure at the university. Indira Nair, who will be retiring from her position as vice provost for education after 32 years of service at Carnegie Mellon, is no exception.
Nair was born in Trivandrum, Kerala in southern India. Since her father was a member of the army, she moved a total of 10 times before completing 12 years of education. She attended the Institute of Science in Bombay, completing her bachelor’s degree in physics. She then moved to the United States and received her master’s degree from Kansas State University and, later, her Ph.D. at Northwestern University.
Nair first arrived in Pittsburgh with the intention of pursuing a career as a high school physics teacher. After spending several years teaching not only physics but also other sciences, including chemistry and geology, she took a small job in the engineering and public policy department here at Carnegie Mellon. Eventually, she joined the Office of the Provost and accepted her current role as the vice provost for education.
At Carnegie Mellon, the provost is the chief academic adviser at the university and is one of the most powerful positions outside the university’s president. The provost oversees all of the faculty and deans in the various schools. One of the major offices underneath the provost is that of the vice provost for education, which has several organizations of its own working beneath it.
“The curriculum itself is divided on a department level, but I look at common needs,” Nair said from her office in Warner Hall. “[I ask my department] what can we do to enhance that experience.”
Beneath Nair is a host of different organizations aimed at making education an integral part of the school and community. The Leonard Gelfand Center, for example, is part of the vice provost’s responsibility and focuses on educational outreach. “Carnegie Mellon reaches 10,000 students every semester,” Nair said. One program within the center is C-MITES, helping to foster math and science skills in gifted students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Classes are taught during the summer for these students, and in the years to come, students from Qatar will also begin attending these classes.
Other important offices under Nair are the assistant provost for graduate education and the director of Undergraduate Research and Fellowship Resources.
Nair has helped organize several large projects aimed at enriching the undergraduate experience. 
One of these programs, Odyssey, is aimed at college sophomores and what they will do with their scholarship to fulfill their citizenship duties. The faculty nominates students that they find to be intellectual seekers and host a three-day workshop right before spring semester.
Another project is the acclaimed University Lecture Series, which runs year-round. Every Monday and Thursday, the faculty invites accomplished individuals — sometimes faculty, sometimes guests — to give a lecture about whatever topic they are currently working on. A recent speaker, Allan Meltzer of the Tepper School of Business, discussed the Federal Reserve and money supply in the United States.
Nair has also made revolutions in courses offered at Carnegie Mellon, beginning with a course titled India Today, a weekend course worth only three units but requiring over 40 hours of class time and writing papers. Iit was first created in fall 2008 in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, and the class studies different countries every year, including China, Brazil, and Russia. “These countries are considered the most emerging countries today,” Nair said.
Qatar has also been a target of interest for Nair since she arrived. Her course Global Issues, Local Solutions, created in the spring of 2009, addressed the question of how to solve global problems depending on a country’s current economic, political, or geographic situation. Recently, Carnegie Mellon hosted the Global Issues, Global Solutions conference, which further addressed these issues.
Nair’s role as chair of the University Education Council has also been influential. The council’s role to approve university-wide courses has been an important one; thanks to Nair and the council, interdisciplinary classes on urban farming and materials science, energy, and the environment are now available.
Nair has a great respect for interdisciplinary action. “Different disciplines are different lenses,” Nair said. “The same thing you’re thinking, someone else is thinking from a different perspective.” To help with interdisciplinary relations, Nair helped to organize 1905 = mc2: Photons and Relativity, a course focused on studying how different ideas in science developed.
Other faculty members have praised Nair’s influence across all areas of the university. “Indira’s service to the Pittsburgh and global community, to science education, and to Carnegie Mellon’s history and its future are immeasurable,” said Provost Mark Kamlet, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release.
“Her passion is  contagious,” said history professor Nico Slate. Slate, who first met Nair in August 2009 through other faculty members of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, found a mutual interest in India and undergraduate education. Several of the students in one of Slate’s history courses raised funds for an environmental project in India, and the money was donated in Nair’s name. “It’s been a real honor working with her,” Slate concluded.
For the students she is leaving behind, Nair offers these words of advice: “Look around and find opportunities.” She points to the rising number of Carnegie Mellon students taking a foreign language as a positive sign of inter-school participation. She also advises acting on these opportunities. “If you have an idea,” she asserted, “you can find a way to carry it out.”
After retiring, Nair plans to move to New Mexico to be closer to her two daughters. She said she plans to do much “thinking, writing, and reading.”.

2010-04-26,CMU,India,"Over the years, the nuclear disarmament process has gained great momentum, with the two Cold War powers — the United States and Russia — showing strong resolve to reduce their vast nuclear stockpiles. On April 14, world leaders concluded a two-day summit on international nuclear security. While President Obama was quick to deem it a step forward, his argument is anything but convincing.
Though Russia and the United States renewed their vows at the summit, Obama has had great difficulty in bringing nations such as China, India, and Pakistan to the negotiating table. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was afraid that there would be demands for Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so he just stayed home. Iran was not invited and held its own International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in protest.
While it is important that Russia, the country with the world’s largest stockpile, is continuing the disarmament process, without support from every nation it will be impossible to achieve the lofty goal of complete disarmament. And the problem that we face today is not of legality but of mixed messages and poor diplomacy. The Iran issue serves as a great example of the hypocrisy of America’s approach to the problem.
Israel has maintained a (not-so-)secret nuclear program for about 30 years now and, while there have been whimpers of complaint, America has generally accepted it and moved on. Never do we hear of American politicians berating Israel for flouting international regulations or breaking IAEA rules. 
Another country with nuclear ambitions is India. After years of mistrust and burdensome sanctions, George W. Bush finally accepted that India was not going to abandon its nascent nuclear program. Amid much controversy, a civilian nuclear deal was finally signed in 2008, despite India’s being a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. International rules were bent to make way for common sense.
And now it looks like Obama is getting drawn into another pointless legal battle, using sanctions when they make no logical sense. Just because Iran is a theocratic and unstable country does not mean they do not have the right to possess nuclear weapons. No amount of legal maneuvering and international condemnation will change Iran’s mind. Nuclear development has become a matter of national pride, and all the taunting is only serving to strengthen their resolve, allowing leaders like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to keep their public emotionally charged.
While the summit was a good way for Obama to display his commitment to world peace, until the focus of nuclear disarmament policy is shifted from enforcing legal requirements to understanding international motivations, we will remain years away from a nuclear-arms-free world.

2010-08-23,CMU,India,"College students spend a considerable amount of money on tuition, so when it comes time to eat, many opt for meals that consist of ramen noodles and overly caffeinated drinks. Luckily, there is an alternative in Oakland. If you are willing to stay up a little later than usual — and let’s face it, you’re probably going to be up anyway — you can get a full meal at half the price! Whether you’re in the mood for Mexican or Indian food, Oakland’s half-price probably has something for you and your budget.  At other times of the day, the neighborhood also has plentiful offerings of breakfasts and desserts.
Thinking you want Italian? Then head over to Joe Mama’s for a diner-style Italian meal. This large eating establishment features an upstairs dining room that looks like something out of Grandma’s Sicilian kitchen, complete with red checkerboard tablecloths. The menu has pizza, pasta, and everything in between. During the months of September through April, select menu items are half price as long as you show up between 11 p.m. and midnight. Craving a pizza? They are half the price from 4 to 5 p.m. daily!
If you are looking for a more red, white, and blue menu, then Fuel & Fuddle is the place for you. The menu features items such as chicken wings and burgers alongside sandwiches and wraps. For those of you that are of age, Fuel & Fuddle also offers a selection of beers that changes daily. Remember that the half-price menu after 11 p.m. excludes steak and seafood dishes.
Want to be more diverse? India Garden will fulfill any desire that you have to be adventurous. The menu is as large as your “Welcome to Carnegie Mellon” packet, guaranteeing that there will be at least one thing you’re willing to eat. You can pick the desired spice level for your meal on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being as spicy as they can make it. (The restaurant’s slogan is “Only as spicy as you are.”) While you wait for your food, you can enjoy Indian music videos playing on the large TVs in the restaurant. As always, it wouldn’t be a complete Indian meal without the naan, and India Garden’s is delicious and fresh. Dinner is half price from 5 to 6 p.m. and 9 to 11 p.m.
Craving a Mexican meal but tired of the tiny menu offered at Chipotle? Then Mad Mex is your place. The menu has all of the Mexican classics: Fajitas, burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, chimichangas, tacos... if you can name it, they probably have it. If you have your student ID with you, enjoy your meal at half the price between the hours of 2 and 4 p.m. After 11 p.m., most of the menu is half price, regardless of your educational status. Discounts don’t include the chimichangas, fajitas, and tacos, so keep that in mind when ordering.
Pamela’s Diner, featuring six locations in Pittsburgh, is home to some of the most delicious breakfast foods available. Each diner is different from the others. Venture over to the Oakland location and you will find the walls covered in board games from your childhood. The one in Shadyside chose to cover its walls with pictures of customers and neighborhood artwork. Every Pamela’s menu has classics like eggs and bacon, but the crowning glories are the specialty hotcakes. The crepe-like hotcakes can either be served alone or with fresh fruit, chocolate chips, and whipped cream. One can easily spend under $10 and still leave satisfied.
After all of the wonderful meals offered at low prices in Oakland, all that is missing is dessert. While most of the establishments mentioned above feature a dessert menu, you should consider visiting the other popular dessert destinations in the area. Dave and Andy’s, in the heart of Oakland, is home to fresh waffle cones and homemade ice cream. During the early fall and late spring, the lines are often out the door; the walls inside, covered in newspaper clippings, attest to the shop’s popularity. Flavors are made fresh and vary daily. If you don’t like waffle cones, don’t worry; there is always the option of getting your ice cream in a cup or as a shake. 
Finally, you can stop by the newly relocated Dozen Bake Shop on Craig Street when in need of some light and delicious baked goods. Cupcakes make a great on-the-go dessert. .

2010-08-23,CMU,India,"After encountering maintenance issues and difficulty hiring staff members in the Squirrel Hill area, a branch of the Dozen Bake Shop has opened on South Craig Street in Oakland.
“Most of our customers were from Carnegie Mellon University or the University of Pittsburgh, so moving to Oakland allowed us to centralize and better serve our customers,” said Kelly Marie McKenna, manager of the new Oakland store.
Dozen caters and delivers to a wide customer base in Squirrel Hill and Oakland, and with the new location, the bakery shop can deliver all of its goodies to students in their dorms.
The old location prevented the store from offering the same variety of goods that are sold at its other three branches. The Oakland store is now able to offer sandwiches, a larger variety of cookies, granola, a greater vegan selection, pot pies, macaroni salad, quiche, and more.
The wood paneling, clean interior design, and large display area of the new branch are reminiscent of an old-fashioned candy store. Big-bulb Christmas lights surround shelves of jars filled with sprinkles, cookies, and granola, as well as birthday boxes for individual or even a dozen Dozen cupcakes.
The refrigerated display showcases the macaroni salad, sandwich, and pot pie choices.
Dozen Bake Shop also offers coffee, tea, and other beverages — providing both 2 percent and soy milk upon request.
This new location has been so popular, “we actually ran out of cupcakes yesterday,” John Karlovic, a Dozen staff member, said. “All of our cupcakes are baked at the Lawrenceville location, then shipped to the branch stores.”
The Lawrenceville Dozen Bake Shop offers seating, free Wi-Fi, Sunday brunch, and a kitchen where customers can watch the bakers make and frost each cupcake.
“All of our goods are made without chemical preservatives, so we encourage our customers to enjoy them the same day they are purchased,” McKenna said. “We also use the freshest and finest local ingredients available to us.”
The fair trade coffee served is Commonplace Coffee from Indiana, Pa., and most of the milk, eggs, and other dairy products come from Turner Dairy Farms in Penn Hills.
While some customers may appreciate the effort to support local farms and businesses as well as the natural quality of the food, others are simply concerned with the taste.
“As long as it doesn’t cause any harm to my health and it tastes good, I think it’s all good.” Bahati Mutisya, a senior business management major in the Tepper School of Business said. “I feel that the move was very smart. I think Dozen addicts will be very excited.”
The store has recently been giving out free samples to attract customers to more than just the cupcakes. “I’ve only eaten the free cookies; they were amazing,” said Brandon Tyson, a senior information systems major.
The cupcakes are sold for $2.50 each, and the store offers a menu detailing what varieties of cupcakes are available on certain days.
“I’ve never been there, but I hear lots of good things about it. So I’m going to try it sometime in the future.” sophomore economics major Elise Lim said..

September baseball is when every game is significant in the standings for teams with playoff hopes. September baseball means not walking the leadoff man; it means hitting the cutoff man. It means taking advantage of your opponents’ mistakes and not missing any chances. Good September baseball is what teams want to play when the calendar flips past August. Good September baseball is what the Colorado Rockies played in 2007, when they won 11 straight as part of a 20–8 month to force an extra win in October that sent them to the playoffs. Good September baseball is what the Philadelphia Phillies played and what the New York Mets infamously did not play in 2007. Or 2008, for that matter.
In short, playing meaningful baseball in September means getting it done.
There is a long list of teams this year that will be looking to play good baseball in the regular season’s final month. While most signs point to the most meaningful baseball being played in the American League (AL) East, where the Yankees and the Rays are battling it out for first place, the truth of the matter is that barring a giant collapse, both teams will make it to the playoffs as they own the two best records in baseball. The Red Sox, on the other hand, are the ones hoping that they can somehow get on enough of a tear that once Wednesday comes, playing good September baseball will not even matter.
A tight AL Central race began in early August with the White Sox leading at 58–45, a half-game up on the 58–46 Twins. But August has not treated the White Sox well; not nearly as well as it has the Twins, who went on a tear and by Aug. 18 had already taken a commanding five-game lead over their rivals from the South Side of Chicago. Minnesota has begun to level out, though, and as Wednesday approaches, both teams will be looking to take their game to the next level knowing that a spot in October hangs in the balance. The Tigers, though, have completely fallen off the map. After leading the division at one point in July, Detroit entered Saturday’s action 11 games behind the Twins.
Well, at least they’re not the Indians.
In the AL West... Well, it really doesn’t matter how the Texas Rangers do in September. Texas entered Saturday as the only team in the division with a record above .500, 9.5 games up on the Athletics, and with MVP candidate Josh Hamilton leading the charge, it’d take a Mets-umental failure for the Rangers not to reach the playoffs.
The National League features many more teams putting the pedal to the metal come September, especially with the existence of an actual wild card race. (The Yanks and Rays pretty much ruin the term “race” in the AL.) While the Phillies lead the wild card by a half-game over the Giants entering Saturday’s action, Philadelphia finds itself a mere two games behind Atlanta for the NL East lead. The Florida Marlins will be looking, as usual, to reprise their role as spoiler as the Phils enter September looking for a four-peat as division champs, and the Braves head toward the finish line hoping to send manager Bobby Cox out with a bang.
The Reds, coming off of a bad 2009 season and a less-than-enviable start to 2010, have stormed back to take charge of the NL Central. While the Cardinals continue to put up a fight, Joey Votto and the Reds have overall played much better and more consistent baseball over the past few months, and I don’t see them fading enough to lose their division lead when the heat gets turned up. Look for the Brewers and Astros to play spoilers this month, as the Cubs have disappointed everyone this year and the Pirates are too focused on making sure the Orioles don’t try to steal back the worst record in baseball.
I’m glad I didn’t put money down on my prediction that the Padres would be the chumps of the NL West, as their stellar pitching, timely hitting, and defense have catapulted this team into a perch high atop the division. The Giants, while still close enough to make it a battle for the top spot, should focus more on their standing in the wild card race, where they sit in second, right on the heels of Philadelphia. The Dodgers can also make a push for the wild card if they string together enough consistently good September baseball; otherwise, their chances will be just as low as their division hopes already are.
Good September baseball or Mets September baseball aside, I expect to see a very West-ful World Series that will feature division champs Texas and San Diego. There’s no way to slow down the Rangers’ hitting or the Padres’ pitching, which is why I say mark my words now: Texas in six..

2010-09-27,CMU,India,"In early April, Texas
catcher Taylor Teagarden
and Cleveland truck Travis
“Pronk” Hafner collided
at home plate in a beautiful
explosion of old-school
baseball. In the bottom of
the sixth inning with the
score tied 2–2, Matt LaPorta
singled up the middle with
Hafner on second. Julio Borbon,
the Rangers’ relatively
rookie center fielder, came
up throwing with a terrific
strike to the plate as Pronk
lumbered towards home.
Teagarden had the ball firmly
in his glove a good second
before the Indians’ self-appointed
hulk got there, and,
doing exactly what he should
have done, Hafner smashed
into Teagarden with a blow
that only Mo Vaughn could
withstand.
Teagarden held onto the
ball, Hafner was out, and it
was glorious.
That’s not something you
tend to see anymore. Nowadays,
the collision at home
plate is not done nearly as
much as it should be. More
often than not, a guy will try
some ridiculous hook slide to
try to avoid the tag, or just
straight up give in and slide
right into the catcher’s shin
guard. If a guy does collide
with a catcher and knock him
fl at, it starts a bench-clearing
incident and sometimes ends
in retaliation. And yeah,
sure, the Cubs’ Michael Barrett
didn’t have the ball when
A.J. Pierzynski famously
bulldozed him, but it’s still
better to be safe and look like
a jerk than sorry and look
like a fool.
In recent years, there has
been an unnecessary amount
of preaching from players,
coaches, reporters, or other
such folks with access to
the Internet about baseball’s
“unwritten rules.” These
rules, though, seem different
from the ones I learned back
when I watched ’90s baseball
and videos of years past.
Back then, it seemed like the
unwritten rules of baseball
were as follows:
1. Do what you have to do.
Nice guys fi nish last.
2. Win games any way you
can. Refer to rule No. 1.
3. Do the honorable thing;
don’t try to stretch a
double to a triple when
you’re up 10 runs.
4. Retaliate for a teammate
however you must. Refer
to rule No. 1.
Umpires nowadays have
seemingly been issuing warnings
and ejections with every
close pitch. Umpires have
far shorter leashes when the
question of intent comes into
play, so even if a slow curveball
slips away from a pitcher
and ends up hitting the batter
or barely missing him, there
is a chance for a warning to
be issued. One especially pathetic
instance of an umpire
jumping the gun occurred on
July 26, 2007, when Washington
then-rookie pitcher
John Lannan was making his
Major League debut against
Philadelphia. Lannan’s first
four innings went without incident
before he accidentally
hit Chase Utley with a pitch.
Lannan then hit the next
batter, Ryan Howard, and
though both hits were clearly
accidental, home plate umpire
Hunter Wendelstadt decided
to eject both Lannan
and Nationals manager Manny
Acta, without issuing a
warning, because he decided
that Lannan had thrown at
the batters intentionally.
“His explanation was that
Howard hit a home run in
his previous at-bat and then
he got hit in his next at-bat,”
Acta said in an article on
ESPN.com. “I was very surprised.
I don’t think the kid
is going to come up here and
start throwing at people.”
Among others bewildered
by the cowardly call was opposing manager Charlie Manuel.
The umpires aren’t the
only ones who have gone soft.
On Friday, the Phillies’ Utley
was chastised for sliding
hard into second base to trying
to break up a double play
against the Mets. Mets players
complained that Utley’s
hard slide had been after the
second baseman had thrown
the ball, and was therefore
unnecessary.
“There’s a thin line between
going out there and
playing the game hard and
going out there and trying
to get somebody hurt,” Mets
third baseman David Wright
commented in an article
on www.mets.com. However,
what Utley was doing
was playing baseball like it
should be played. Players are
supposed to try to break up
double plays — see unwritten
rules No. 1 and No. 2. Utley
had the intent of breaking up
the double play from the getgo,
and it is really hard for a
player to change momentum
when he is running at full
speed if he realizes only a
split second beforehand that
he doesn’t have to go in hard.
Even Wright’s own manager,
Jerry Manuel, was okay
with the slide. “There is nothing
wrong with a good, hard
slide to break up a double
play,” Manuel said on www.
mets.com. “We preach that.”
Baseball needs to get back
to how it used to be. “Make
sure no one gets hurt” was
never an unwritten rule in any
competitive sport. Neither is
“No fi ghting allowed.” Just
ask Tom Hanks in A League of
Their Own — there’s no crying
in baseball..

2010-10-04,CMU,India,"In the first installment of this column on April 5, “Hail Mary, full of grace; four balls, take your base,” I made the following predictions on who would finish first and last in each division come the end of the season:
“Here are my predictions for this year’s division champs and chumps:
AL East: Champs — Yankees, Chumps — Blue Jays; AL Central: Champs — Twins, Chumps — Indians; AL West: Champs — Mariners, Chumps — A’s; NL East: Champs — Phillies, Chumps — Marlins; NL Central: Champs — Cubs, Chumps — Pirates; NL West: Champs — Giants, Chumps — Padres.”
Well, when a batter is having a 5-for-12 stretch, it’s considered pretty fantastic. When a team only wins five of 12, it is not quite as great. This was more like a team’s performance.
Entering Sunday, possibly the last day of the season, I was at least right about the Twins, Phillies, and Pirates. On Sept. 21, the Twins did indeed clinch first place in the American League (AL) Central, and the Phillies followed suit shortly thereafter in the National League East. The Pirates truly outdid themselves this season, coming all the way back to overtake a rejuvenated Orioles team for the worst record in baseball, easily clinching at least one prediction for me, finishing 18 games back into sixth place and entering Sunday with a chance to tie for the worst road record in baseball history.
The Giants and Yankees entered Sunday on the brink of clinching their respective divisions, which would confirm two more of my predictions. The Yankees were tied with Tampa Bay for the division lead after Saturday’s action; a Yankees win and a Rays loss would clinch the AL East for New York, but if both teams win or both teams lose to finish in a tie, the division would technically go to the Rays, as they won the season series with the Yankees. Meanwhile, San Francisco entered Sunday one game up on the Padres, but the Padres took two from them last week, and a sweep of the Giants would put them in a tie for the division—and possibly for the wild card as well if the Braves won Sunday.
Speaking of the Padres, they combined with the Mariners to cement that I am horrendous at predicting the outcomes of the Western divisions. I picked Seattle to easily win the AL West after their acquisitions of Chone Figgins and Milton Bradley; they entered Sunday’s action 18 games behind third-place Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim with a very disappointing 61–100 record.
I wrote in my preseason article that “the only bets people are placing on the Padres involve if and when they trade star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to the Red Sox.” On the contrary, the Padres started off the season surprisingly strong and didn’t fade until the last three weeks of the season, when their once-insurmountable division lead dropped significantly with a 10-game losing streak.
Honorable mention has to go to the Cubs and Blue Jays. The Cubs are finishing strong after what has been a very disappointing and sometimes controversial 2010 campaign, and are poised to finish nowhere near the first place that I’d foreseen. Toronto, on the other hand, traded Roy Halladay in the off-season and looked to be entering a long-term rebuilding mode. Picked by many to be the laughingstock of the AL in 2010, they instead had a record season in home runs, including Jose Bautista’s unpredictable 54 home runs entering Sunday. I guarantee you: Anybody who says they are not surprised by Bautista’s mammoth season is being just as truthful as Rafael Palmeiro was when he told a grand jury in 2007 that he did not use steroids. Way to fail a drug test a few weeks later, big guy.
Check back online on Tuesday at www.thetartan.org/sports for a bonus follow-up column, in which I will sum up the official end of baseball’s regular season. Buckle up, folks; playoff time is just around the bend and with the way this season is wrapping up, you know it’ll be a good one..

2010-10-11,CMU,India,"Eavesdrop on enough conversations in the University Center, and chances are you’ll eventually come across one in a language other than English. With 20 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s student body coming from countries outside the United States and with a sister campus in Qatar, Carnegie Mellon is truly a global community. Last week, the campus celebrated this diversity with the International Festival, held Thursday through Saturday. Throughout the latter half of the week, flags from countries all around the world were displayed in the University Center in honor of the festival. The theme for this year’s International Festival was “Borders: Crossings, Conflicts, Connections,” and the events throughout the three-day festival all exemplified this theme.
The Study Abroad Fair is a hub for international information. With over 20 different independent study abroad programs present, one could find a program for almost anywhere in the world, from Japan or South America to a voyage around the Atlantic Ocean. External companies were not the only ones represented at the fair, though; representatives from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the Tepper School of Business, and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences each had their own table and spoke to students about study abroad options that best fit the majors of Carnegie Mellon students.
Studying abroad, whether for a summer, a semester, or a year, can be an enriching experience that allows you to immerse yourself in another culture. The Study Abroad Fair had several vendors whose programs boasted multi-country excursions, including Semester at Sea, a 104-day academic sailing voyage that stops in 11 countries, and the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, whose program features week-long field trips to countries across Europe.
Most study abroad programs represented at the fair on Thursday boasted price tags of less than $15,000 a semester, with several programs that were less than $10,000 a semester. Through the study abroad company CIS, for example, you could spend a semester in Prague in the Czech Republic for about $8,500 a semester. With such low tuition, many parents are willing to send their students across the world for a semester. There are also plenty of options to apply for financial aid toward programs abroad.
The Study Abroad Fair also provided testimonies as to what a positive experience studying abroad can be, displayed in the hallways of the University Center. Winners of the Tartans Abroad Scholarship had poster displays recounting tales of their trips abroad, with experiences ranging from the highest governmental agencies of South Korea to the poorer neighborhoods of South Africa, and everywhere in between.
After the Study Abroad Fair, the International Festival hosted a screening of the award-winning documentary Crossing Borders. According to the documentary’s website, crossingbordersfilm.org, Crossing Borders follows four Moroccan and four American university students as they travel together through Morocco and, in the process of discovering “the other,” discover themselves. With group travels and frank discussions, the students confront the complex implications of the supposed clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. A panel discussion, featuring Carnegie Mellon students from both the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses, followed the screening to discuss the major questions and themes brought up in the documentary.
The keynote lecture and lunch took place last Friday, featuring human rights activist Enrique Morones. Morones is the founder of the humanitarian group Border Angels, which provides water and other essential supplies to people traveling through the treacherous desert areas of Mexicowhile attempting to reach the United States border. Migrants travel through these harsh environments because of Operation Gatekeeper, an American high-budget project that makes it nearly impossible for migrants to travel across safer areas of the border. According to Morones, “10,000 human beings have died as a result of Operation Gatekeeper.”
During his lecture, Morones explained how he had first gotten involved with aiding migrant workers, and recounted some of the events and campaigns he had planned to fight against racism and to encourage humane immigration reform. According to Morones, one of his earliest projects had been a convention in Los Angeles, after the Rodney King riots, that worked to promote diversity and to emphasize that “we are all members of the human race, not different races.” He also talked about his success organizing nationwide marches and protests that blocked the passing of House Resolution 4437, which would have built a wall along the entire border between the United States and Mexico. More recently, Morones delivered 40,000 letters to President Barack Obama, explaining why humane immigration reform is necessary in the United States. “This is an issue about civil rights and human rights, what’s happening with immigration,” Morones said. He also emphasized the importance of getting involved and told the audience, “It’s important that we do the right thing and speak out [against injustice].”
For those interested less in politics and more in partying, there was “Cultural Fusion: A Multicultural Late Night Event” last Friday evening in the University Center. The show-cased international food, music, and dancing, starting off with the Pittsburgh-based band Global Beats, whose music featured sounds from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Caribbean. After performing for about an hour, Global Beats was followed by a DJ and dancers who performed dance sets from Brazil, India, the Middle East, and Latin America. Carnegie Mellon’s International Student Union also contributed to the evening with artifacts from different nations and dessert and drinks from around the world.
After an evening of multicultural dancing, Saturday morning featured the “Traveling Tartans Showcase — Highlights from Student Groups’ Short-Term Trips Abroad” at the University Center. The showcase featured presentations from groups of Carnegie Mellon students who had received funding from the Tartans Abroad Scholarship to study abroad during academic break periods. If spending your summer, spring, or winter break abroad sounds appealing, then go to Carnegie Mellon’s study abroad website at 
www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/sab/gettingstarted/index.html and click on “Funding” to check out the requirements for the Tartans Abroad Scholarship.
The International Festival’s final program of the weekend was “Traveling Tartans — Study Abroad Options at Carnegie Mellon,” an information session about studying abroad that was presented in conjunction with Family Weekend. Parents and students learned about all the benefits of studying abroad, including the academic, cultural, and economic benefits. 
Even if you missed the events of the International Festival, that doesn’t mean you can’t continue to investigate and celebrate Carnegie Mellon’s international community. Ask an international friend to tell you about his or her home country’s culture. Eat dinner at Resnik Café on Tuesday for some French cuisine. Attend the “Seeking Employment Opportunities Abroad” information session on Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. in the McKenna/Peter/Wright Rooms of the University Center. And, if all else fails, you can always wait for next year’s International Festival..

2010-10-11,CMU,India,"With the first music blogs came the exponential growth of options for discovering artists and learning about new music. It can easily become overwhelming to sort through all the different Tumblr, Wordpress, and Blogspot music sites. Here are a few essential blogs to start off with. This is not a comprehensive list, but rather a beginning foray into the ever-expanding world of music blogging:
Pitchfork Media (pitchfork.com)
It is difficult to talk about music blogs without mentioning the behemoth that is Pitchfork Media.  The site focuses on music news, reviews, and interviews rather than music downloads. Few sites are respected (and criticized) as much as Pitchfork. Established in 1995, this blog has become highly influential in the music world, with reviews that can often make or break an aspiring artist’s career. Pitchfork focuses on independent music, but is often criticized for its limited view and skewed album ratings.
Hype Machine (hypem.com)
The Hype Machine is an MP3 blog aggregator, and it keeps track of what music bloggers write about. It conveniently compiles the music of the blogosphere for easy discovery and consumption. Hype Machine shows the latest music that other blogs are posting, popular songs, and trending artists. This site is great for stumbling upon great new music and music blogs.  
Gorilla vs. Bear (gorillavsbear.net)
Gorilla vs. Bear is an influential music blog that features both established and up-and-coming artists.  Showcasing an eclectic taste, Gorilla vs. Bear only posts about music it absolutely loves. It has been called the New Yorker of hipster blogs and was named one of the best music blogs by Rolling Stone and URB Magazine. Often at the forefront of new music, Gorilla vs. Bear is usually the first media outlet to mention rising bands. In the past, these have included El Guincho, Girls, Neon Indian, and Wavves.
Said the Gramophone (saidthegramophone.com)
Launched in 2003, Said the Gramophone is one of the first MP3 blogs. The site, named one of the 25 best blogs of 2009 by Time magazine, is written by three Canadian music fans who provide a daily sampler of music. The rise to fame of such bands as Beirut, Arcade Fire, Yeasayer, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is often attributed to this blog. Music is free to download, but all songs are removed from the blog within a week or two of posting.
Daytrotter (daytrotter.com)
Rather than posting or reposting songs being circulated among music blogs, Daytrotter contributes re-worked, alternate versions of songs by well-known, obscure, or rising artists. Artists on tour stop by The Horseshack, the website’s recording studio in Rock Island, Ill., to record old songs and unreleased tracks live. Artists and groups who have recorded for the site include Phantom Planet, Carly Simon, Daniel Johnston, Of Montreal, Fleet Foxes, and Toro Y Moi.
La Blogothèque (blogotheque.net)
Each week Vincent Moon films sessions with artists or groups as part of Les Concerts à Emporter, or The Take-Away Shows. The sessions follow musicians around city streets, parks, apartments, public transit, and bars. With little preparation, the artists can showcase their talents without studio production. Sessions have featured bands including Bon Iver, R.E.M., Stephen Malkmus, The Shins, and Phoenix.

Film Screening: Dabbawallas
Monday at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Paul Goodman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business, will present the documentary Dabbawallas. 
In India, a unique food delivery business functions and thrives without the aid of technology that is taken for granted in America. The “dabbawallas,” named from the word dabba, for “box,” and walla, for “person,” transfer lunches from people’s homes to their workplaces between 8:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. every day. 
For example, in the city of Mumbai, India, there are 1 million deliveries a week with a 98 percent success rate. The workforce consists of 4,000 dabbawallas that transport more than 100,000 lunches a day. This documentary will investigate this intriguing workforce that relies on human perseverance and creativity, in conjunction with the seminar India Today: Economics, Technology, and People..

2010-10-25,CMU,India,"For those of you that have been following the NFL this season, I’m sure that you have heard of the debate on the recent penalties for illegal helmet-to-helmet tackles. Just this past weekend, hits by Steelers linebacker James Harrison, Falcons cornerback Dunta Robinson, and Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather were highly scrutinized and the players were eventually fined thousands of dollars. Apparently, this was the final straw for NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, as he stated that helmet-to-helmet hits would now be reviewed for larger fines and possible suspensions. Although there has been much scrutiny from the players, the NFL is 100 percent correct on this situation.
Die-hard NFL fans and defensive players have been harping on one thing since the new policy: The NFL is making football a “soft” sport. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. Concussions have been on the upswing even with helmets, pads, and other protection becoming more available. This is mainly because the ability of the players has steadily increased with this added protection. Guys like Ray Lewis, Harrison, and others have brought in an era of huge hits, much to the dismay of highly priced players like quarterbacks and wide receivers. The game has become more violent since the days of leather helmets and no pads. Add this to the fact that Harrison said, in a Pittsburgh Tribune Review article last week, that “I want to hurt somebody. If you hurt somebody, they’ll be back the next play. I don’t want to see anybody injured. But I’m not opposed to hurting anybody,” and you realize that this is why measures need to be taken to protect the players that provide us with the most exciting sport in the world.
Where would the NFL be today without teams with dynamic passing offenses like the Indianapolis Colts? The game has evolved into a high-scoring, fast-paced, game. Oftentimes, I hear people complaining that low-scoring games are “boring” games. Protecting wide receivers and quarterbacks is much more important for the NFL, especially financially. Just like “roughing the passer” calls have become more common and enforced with a somewhat smooth transition, the NFL can transition with less helmet-to-helmet hits.
Defensive players like Harrison have come out swinging against this new policy, with Harrison even contending that he was “contemplating retirement” because he no longer knows how to play football. This is a joke. There have been countless times where a defensive player has made a huge hit on an offensive player without it being helmet-to-helmet. Take then-Eagles cornerback Sheldon Brown’s hit on Saints running back Reggie Bush in the 2006–07 NFC playoffs, and you’ll remember possibly one of the biggest hits in NFL history. However, it was a clean play, as Brown drove his shoulder into Bush’s chest as he caught the ball, resulting in an incompletion. Big hits can be legal, as long as the defensive player is careful about what he’s doing. As Robinson found out this past weekend, leading with your helmet puts you at a high risk for a concussion as well. Risking your health along with a fellow player’s health is never a smart play.
The recent policy change has brought focus on how the offensive side of the ball always gets the benefit with the NFL office. In an article from espn.com, Green Bay Packers linebacker Nick Barnett said it best: “I think they are headed in the right way of protecting players, but at the same time, where's the protection for the defensive players?” One of the main problems with the NFL is its reluctance to punish offensive players as severely as the defensive players. Oftentimes, offensive linemen and other blockers use “chop-blocks,” which is when blockers intentionally undercut potential tacklers in an effort to take their feet out from under them. This has caused plenty of season- and even careerending knee injuries, which is something the NFL has to address as well.
Along with this, the NFL has to realize that there are times when helmet hits by the defense are not actually the defensive player’s fault. Wide receivers have a tendency to lower their helmets for impact when they run dangerous crossing routes, which leads to incidental helmet contact, even if the defensive player is aiming for the chest. The NFL has to make sure that it can differentiate between hits that are out to injure players and hits that are just meant to break up the pass in a decisive fashion.
Overall, the NFL has it right with this new policy. There is clearly a need to put restrictions on players who seek to “hurt,” and to help protect players from having terrible post-career lives while they suffer from the after-effects of too many concussions. Now, if only the NFL changed the policy on not allowing good touchdown celebrations, then everything would be perfect..

2010-11-01,CMU,India,"Homecoming has always been about instilling Carnegie Mellon pride in current students and alumni. With this objective in mind, famous alumni will kick-start this year’s Homecoming weekend by sharing their journeys to success with the campus community.
The Alumni Awards are presented for excellence in a variety of disciplines, including arts, humanities, sciences, technology, and business. 
On Thursday, the recipients of the 2010 Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award will share their stories. One of the two recipients is Naoko Matsubara (A ’62), an accomplished woodcut artist.
Matsubara received her bachelor’s degree in arts at the Kyoto Academy of Fine Art in Japan. She received a Fulbright Scholarship after her bachelor’s degree and came to Carnegie Mellon (called Carnegie Tech at the time) to complete her master’s in fine arts. She also has an honorary doctorate degree from Chatham University.
Matsubara last visited Pittsburgh in 2009 for an exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art and Chatham University’s art gallery. In an interview with The Tartan, Matsubara explained that Pittsburgh is special for her, as it was the first place she came to from her home in Japan.
Coming to the United States in 1960 was a life-changing experience, Matsubara said. It was the first time she had left Japan, and she felt a “wonderful sense of freedom.” At Carnegie Mellon, she had the freedom to take whatever classes she wanted and was not required to take any she did not want to — an idea that was new to her. The general environment at Carnegie Mellon was also conducive to making art; Matsubara described her studio at that time, which overlooked Schenley Park, as “beautiful.”
Along with this inspiring atmosphere and greater freedom, Matsubara was given a responsibility: She had to focus her thoughts and find out exactly what she wanted to do. “[There are] so many things you can do in fine arts,” Matsubara said. For her, the most difficult task in those early days was to focus on one aspect of the broad spectrum of things she could do. Matsubara explained that, for a long time, she “tried to find what [she] really wanted to do.” It was not until one evening in 1961 that she realized what this was. Her friends asked her to accompany them to a concert by the Indian musician Ravi Shankar at Chatham University. Matsubara had never heard Shankar’s music and did not know what to expect before she went to the concert.
As Matsubara put it, after the concert, she was “breathless.” She explained that experiencing such wonderful music helped clear her mind, and that after the concert, she understood what she was supposed to do. The next day, she went to her studio and started working on a woodcut based on the feelings she had about the concert. 
Ever since that day, Matsubara realized that making woodcuts and using them to make prints was what she wanted to pursue for life.
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon in 1962, Matsubara traveled extensively all over the world. According to the University Lecture Series website, Matsubara has had solo exhibits in the U.S., Canada, Japan, England, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Holland, and Mexico. Matsubara also gained inspiration for projects from her trips across the world. She said that one of the most memorable traveling experiences was visiting Tibet. According to an article published in the Pittsburgh City Paper, Tibet changed “Matsubara’s perception of space and color.” Her travels in Tibet led to the publication of a book of her artwork titled Tibetan Sky that has a forward by the Dalai Lama. Apart from her travels, Matsubara’s art has significant connections to her home country, Japan.
A lot of her work is based on nature, an aspect she explained is related to her father and his teachings. Her father was a priest and instilled in her an admiration for the divine and for nature. Currently, Matsubara is working on murals and a series of abstract artwork.
Matsubara believes that the most important thing for budding artists to keep in mind is that they need to find their own direction. She believes that this is especially hard since there is a variety of types of art into which an artist can delve deeper. 
“You can study from other artists,” Matsubara said, “[but] only you can do your own thing. Art has to be a reflection of your own life.”
Matsubara’s lecture will be on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in the Rashid Auditorium in the Hillman Center. 
Along with Matsubara, Stuart Card, the second recipient of the 2010 Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award, will talk about his life experiences. Card is a senior research fellow at the Palo Alto Research Center, where he is currently the manager of the User Interface Research Group..

2010-11-01,CMU,India,"Artist spotlight: An interview and acoustic session with Tim Ruff
Ted Danson, Zachary Quinto, Andy Warhol — with so many established graduates from every department, Carnegie Mellon is no stranger to reputable alumni. Odds are that the sophomore from calculus class or that senior from the Activities Fair will go on to do tremendous things after graduation, and with a student body that works so intensely, it’s always encouraging to see the work and effort of our peers pay off.
One young alumnus whose talent and efforts are leading the way to success is 2010 graduate Tim Ruff. Chances are that you have seen this Indiana native around campus, whether he was your Orientation counselor, a brother in your fraternity, or merely a smiling face that helped complete your maintenance request for a lofted bed.
Ruff, a vocal performance major before graduating from the College of Fine Arts last year, has always had a prominent voice around campus. He has performed acoustic shows at Skibo Café, played the Emperor of Japan in the School of Music’s rendition of The Mikado, and made a guest performance at Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Battle of the Bands.
Ruff, who once dreamed of becoming an inventor, has become just that through music. Having picked up guitar in seventh grade, Ruff wrote his first original song during his junior year of high school and since then has grown into a strong singer and songwriter. In an interview with the performer, The Tartan got a peek into the release of his new CD Winter’s Coming, his battle to make it in the professional music world, and how Carnegie Mellon has helped him along the way.
How did you first start writing music?
My first experience writing music was in fourth grade when my music class started playing recorder, and I transcribed a couple songs and melodies from Titanic into recorder and played them for the student body.
You came to Carnegie Mellon to study classical music, but did you always know that you wanted to be a songwriter?
Professionally, no, I did not know that I wanted to be a songwriter. I thought that I enjoyed kind of dabbling in songwriting, but I didn’t actually think I’d make a career out of it.
Do you plan on applying your classical training in any way?
With my classical voice and music training, my musicianship training has taken me leaps and bounds from where I was before attending Carnegie Mellon. The classical technique helps so much with pop singing and any other singing I might want to do.
Do you have any advice for current voice majors about Carnegie Mellon and what to expect when you graduate?
Bust your butt while you’re in school and get as much as you can from the professors and from the facilities that they offer here. After graduation, continue to bust your butt and find your path.
What have you been doing since graduation, and how have things changed?
Right now I’ve been basically getting my music career off the ground; getting a website up; getting more media, photos, videos; writing more music; meeting a lot of the Pittsburgh musicians; and playing the area. What has changed since I left school — no class; my day is completely self-driven. There is nobody who tells me what to do, suggests songs that I should or should not perform. It’s my own life.
You just released your first album. What does it feel like to see your work get finalized?
It feels like a lot of stress has been lifted off of your shoulders to know that you can have something hard and final to show to people. It’s very fulfilling.
What was the process to record like?
First of all, we spent a number of hours in the studio recording for the acoustic EP specifically. I actually spent around three or four hours recording the whole thing, just me and the guitar, and then I worked in the Carnegie Mellon recording suites with [junior electrical and computer engineering major and audio engineering minor] Adam Kriegel to mix and master the music to our liking.
Are you going to use this album to possibly get signed by a record label?
Who knows. I mean, I’m going to be submitting this disc to many people, and I am still debating the idea of getting signed and how much I want to be affiliated with major labels or a label.
Are you intimidated by the business? You obviously knew coming into this major that it would be hard to truly make it; how did you deal with that?
It’s been the same as it has been for maybe the past two or three years. I feel like, yeah, it’s pretty tough to break into the music industry per se, to be successful in a music career — success being making a living off of my music. I know that I work really hard to get things done, and I have good faith in my music.
What is your favorite song off the new album and why?
My favorite song off the album is “Busy Bee,” specifically because I have no idea how I came up with the musical composition of the song, while the lyrical side of the song was very planned out. I had no idea it was going to be such a nice little tune. I don’t usually like to listen to my own music a lot because it’s annoying to hear yourself over and over again after the recording process, but I like listening to that song. I would have to say that the runner-up favorite on the CD would be “Lady,” and this one I can’t explain very much. Overall, I think it’s one of the most solid songs I have.
What do you typically write about in your songs?
If anybody were to listen to my whole music repertoire, they would say that I like to write love songs. Most of my songs are love songs, but I’ve recently branched out a bit to zero in on certain ideas and people in my life.
How do you turn an idea or emotion into a song? What is the creative process?
The creative process for my songs differs with every song. It can start from just a simple melody that I like and fiddle around with, turn some chords over, and lyrics kind of manifest themselves from that. Or it can start from a poem that I write, and then the music just kind of comes out.
How do you feel about performing?
I love to perform; it’s quite natural to me. On stage with a big crowd, it’s terrifying at times. It depends on how big of a crowd we’re talking. Actually, being able to communicate with a larger audience is one of the things that I’ve really been working on over this past summer: not only being able to play for a couple college students, but being able to walk onto a stage at a major venue and being able to play for hundreds of people. At this point, it’s a work in progress to be able to handle that kind of communication, but it’s exciting and enjoyable every time I do it.
What has Carnegie Mellon given you? What are you most thankful for?
Carnegie Mellon has given me a good work ethic, a good perspective on life, and a large amount of professionalism, which I find is very helpful to start your own business.
And what do you want to give back to Carnegie Mellon?
I would like to give back to Carnegie Mellon some innovative ideas on how my story and stories like mine can be perpetuated. I would also like to give back financially, of course, to be in a place where I can do that. I also want to show people that Carnegie Mellon is an incredible school where people truly can do anything they put their mind to.
What’s next for Tim Ruff?
“The next step,” said Ruff, “is to figure out what life is where I want to go with mine.” Tim will be staying in Pittsburgh, a place he calls his launch pad for bigger and better things, from the next six months to a year. “The eventual goal,” said Ruff, “is to be able to make a living off of my music.”
Until then, you can see Ruff at the Tim Ruff: Winter’s Coming Release Party and Show at the Underground at 8 p.m. on Monday, November 22nd. There will be live music, a surprise opening act, and if you haven’t picked up a copy of Ruff’s CD, he will be selling them at the show..

2010-11-08,CMU,India,"The fourth annual Bhangra in the Burgh competition was one of the most exciting shows since the creation of the competition. Master of ceremonies and social and decision sciences junior Suraj Baxi kept the audience entertained, and Carnegie Mellon’s own bhangra team performed at the end of the show.
As usual, the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall was packed for the show, with tickets having sold out that morning. The Bhangra in the Burgh staff members wanted to make this show an experience, and they certainly pulled it off. There was a VIP section where guests received a small blue gift bag that included a Ferrero Rocher chocolate, a thank-you card, a Bhangra in the Burgh pen, and even a coupon for a free water bottle and samosa during the intermission.
As the crowd filled in the seats before the show began, The Originals, Carnegie Mellon’s oldest all-male a cappella singing group, founded in 1996, performed. Then the MC came out — or to be more accurate, the MC’s evil twin (Baxi with glasses and an Indian accent). Apparently Baxi was taped to his chair back in his dorm room — a video explained — and the audience laughed as the evil twin ran off stage to avoid Baxi’s threats.
Then came the seriously epic opening credits. A video of past performances paired with a loud hip hop/bhangra fusion beat left the audience roaring for the show to begin.
Baxi, freed from captivity, came on stage with a crew in tow, throwing Bhangra in the Burgh T-shirts out to the audience. After a welcome and a few jokes, Drexel University’s team took the stage. Along with the dance members, the team also came equipped with a dhol — a traditional drum used while dancing bhangra. Dressed in red, green, blue, and yellow, Drexel started off the show with a lot of energy.
After two performances, Carnegie Mellon was able to exhibit some of its own talent. The Dancers’ Symposium Company took the stage to give the audience a contemporary dance performance with an intriguing storyline.
Next up was the First Class Bhangra team “Pittsburgh born, Pittsburgh bred” and the self-proclaimed “hometown Bhangra team.” This troupe of all males danced around the stage in black, brown, and orange. It was the first team to incorporate tricks with its props, but the performers also looked exhausted by the end of their routine, holding up letters that spelled out “Pittsburgh” and spinning Terrible Towels above their heads.
The Rutgers University team had a Jersey Shore-inspired team video before its performance and started off strong, parading across the entire stage in white, purple, orange, and blue. There was no dhol player, but the team did have a chimta — another traditional instrument that looks like a long, flat folded piece of metal strip with pairs of small metal jingles. In the middle of the routine, a dancer came on stage dressed very oddly for the competition, wearing a black T-shirt, black Adidas sweats, and a huge blue mask — complete with huge orb eyes that lit up—and huge screen ears. This team even managed to include props with blankets and a table while some of the women played tambourines or danced with little vases. The dancers ended their routine with a waving Rutgers flag.
The University of Pittsburgh was up for an exhibition performance as well, presenting its PantheRaas team. This type of dance style was originally performed by men, using a pair of wooden sticks called dandia. The Pitt team had men and women on stage, although some women were made up to be men, all dressed in orange and blue with silver and red accents. The performance was beautiful and a nice change of pace from the competition.
Up next was the DC Bhangra Crew. This all-female team was a crowd pleaser with its performance and choice of songs. As “Whip My Hair” and other recognizable contemporary singles played under the Bhangra beat, the women brought props as well: Blankets, fans, and jars appeared along with the song “How Low Can You Go.”
After such a riveting performance, the intermission commenced as samosas and water awaited audience members in the hallway.
The show resumed with an exhibition performance from Deewane, Carnegie Mellon’s South Asian all-male a cappella group. After a rendition of “Airplanes,” the group broke out into a crowd favorite: “Mundian To Bach Ke,” the song that Jay-Z rapped over in 2003. With  beatboxing and harmonies, Deewane came with its own rap, “This ain’t no Roc-A-Fella, we’re singing a cappella.”
Virginia Commonwealth University performed next, bringing out two MCs with microphones. VCU was the first team to use the strobe lights in the middle of the routine as opposed to just the beginning.
After Carnegie Mellon’s Tanah dance team performed, the winner of the competition was announced.
VCU managed to win over the judges and took home the title of first place, as well as bragging rights until the next Bhangra in the Burgh..

2010-11-08,CMU,India,"IndiaEdu is a new Carnegie Mellon student organization that was formed this semester to take innovative steps toward ending educational inequity in India. Its founders aim to supplement the curriculum of underprivileged grade schools in Indian slums with videos of age-appropriate lessons taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty. IndiaEdu’s other main goal is to provide Indian schools with the technology that is necessary for presenting the learning modules. 
According to the website of Teach for India — the Indian equivalent of Teach for America — currently 40 percent of India's population is illiterate, and “more than one in three children who begin primary school will drop out before reaching fifth grade.” 
“Education is how you bring up a generation that shapes the future of a country,” said Abeer Agrawal, a junior electrical and computer engineering major and vice president of IndiaEdu. “Schools in India don’t have enough teachers and don’t have enough money to teach people properly, so we hope to just make some small contribution and help a few people.”
The Carnegie Mellon students in IndiaEdu have chosen to help two particular grade schools in Malad, Mumbai: Umedbhai Patel English School and Divine Child High School. According to [SLANT12]www.indiaedu.tk[SLANT12], the Umedbhai Patel English School hosts approximately 500 students in kindergarten through 10th grade in four classrooms. While the schools cannot currently afford computers with Internet access, IndiaEdu is taking steps to provide them with such amenities. “We want to take care of their IT requirements. They don’t have enough computers. They have no Internet,” said IndiaEdu President Dhruv Swaroop, a junior in mechanical engineering. 
Physics professor Kunal Ghosh advises the budding student organization. Ghosh is the faculty advisor to many organizations, but he said he has had a lot of involvement with IndiaEdu because it is so new. “I’m their cheerleader,” Ghosh said. “Ten years down the road they will know that they tried to improve the lives of others. This will be remembered as a worthwhile experience at CMU.”
To date, the IndiaEdu students have recorded one presentation on the characteristics of light, intended for middle school-aged students and given by Carnegie Mellon professor of physics Leonard Kisslinger. The organization hopes to spur increased participation so that faculty from across campus can share their passions with the students in India and throughout the world.  
“Some kids in remote India will remember this. These strangers wanted to help them. That will be transformative for them, also,” Ghosh said.
Before learning modules recorded on campus can reach students in India and elsewhere, however, Swaroop explained there are several intermediate steps that must be taken. In addition to the basic video editing process, subtitles and captions must be added to each of the videos. “Once we get the content up, anyone can view it because it’s all electronic. I hope that by the time I graduate, enough people would have heard about it, in India and elsewhere, that we would have a system working where professors can record videos for us and they go online instantaneously,” Swaroop said. 
Despite challenges with technology that they will undoubtedly face, Ghosh believes that the IndiaEdu students’ efforts will be worthwhile. “No matter how busy we are, student or faculty, we must find a little niche in life to serve unselfishly, even complete strangers.... We have been blessed to have been given an opportunity to serve our world.” 
Abeer Agrawal is a junior staffwriter for The Tartan..

2010-11-15,CMU,India,"I’d like to think that this headline’s pun is one of the more original ones out there regarding free agent pitcher Cliff Lee. Or at least more original than the corny “Cliffhanger.”
Lee, the centerpiece in a trade deadline deal for the second July in a row before helping the Rangers to the World Series this year, can start buying new Rolls Royces by the dozen as he headlines this offseason’s free agent class. Lee is not only the best pitcher available on the 2010–2011 market, but he is a guy who has done one very important thing: He has dominated the Yankees on many occasions. That pretty much sealed his fate on getting quite the handsome paycheck for the foreseeable — and even the unforeseeable — future.
It’s not that Lee is guaranteed to sign with the Yankees. That the Yankees have entered the Lee sweepstakes — and they certainly have, with GM Brian Cashman already having flown down to see Lee at his Arkansas home — means that the bidding for his services will start high and end higher. The Yankees have the obvious advantage here in that they can essentially offer Lee anything he asks and more without truly compromising their ability to sign or trade for other lineup studs; any other team entering the Cliff contest will at some point have to consider the impact of Lee’s salary on its financial flexibility for the many years on his eventual contract. The Yankees also have the ability to offer Lee a chance to pitch alongside former Indians teammate C.C. Sabathia, who had also previously dominated the Yankees in the playoffs before they blew other suitors out of the water by offering Sabathia a seven-year, $161 million contract in the ’08 offseason. To further illustrate my previous point, though, the Yankees also added two other huge contracts to their payroll that offseason, signing pitcher A.J. Burnett to a five-year, $82 million contract and first baseman Mark Teixeira to an eight-year, $180 million contract. Not that their payroll wasn’t already huge to begin with — the previous offseason, they’d inked third baseman Alex Rodriguez to a 10-year, $275 million contract extension.
The Yankees may end up not having much competition for Lee’s services to begin with. Most baseball analysts have predicted that the Rangers will be the only team competing with the Bronx Buyers to land Lee. The Rangers, Lee’s current team, would be wise to lock up Lee for many years as a pillar to build their young rotation on; at 32 years of age, Lee still has enough good years ahead of him, barring injuries, to ensure a high reward for at least the next five years. The problem, though, is that any deal beyond five years for a pitcher is unwise and unnecessary, as most pitchers tend to fall victim to shoulder ailments and even shoulder surgeries at some point in their career, especially by their late 30s. The Rangers may be hesitant to sign Lee to an absurdly long-term deal for that very reason; however, they may be forced to, as the Yankees have proven that short-term success is the only thing they care about, and money and years are just formalities in the process of signing a big-ticket guy like Lee, regardless of the potential long-term consequences.
That said, as problematic as it may prove in the future, the Rangers would be unwise not to go all out for Lee. As it stands, they have plenty of young talent that will not enter the free agent class for a few more years. Lee would provide enough short-term reward that it would be a historically good move to keep him on the staff, and it would be good for baseball if a team not owned by the Steinbrenners signed the biggest free agent on the market. While baseball fans worldwide may ponder the possible success of a rotation that includes Lee, Sabathia, and Phil Hughes, the offseason would be boring and frustrating if the Yanks walked away again with the kind of purchase that the 29 other Major League franchises would deem irresponsible.
That said, I expect to cringe when I see Lee in a pinstriped uniform come spring training. Happy offseason!.

2010-11-15,CMU,India,"Undergraduate programs now open to Indian scholars
Although Carnegie Mellon has an existing partnership with India’s Shiv Nadar Foundation to provide graduate-level education through a program in advanced software engineering, the university will soon use this partnership to make undergraduate programs in mechanical engineering and electrical and computer engineering available to Indian students.
Under the intended program, the first class of undergraduates will begin studies in June 2011. Accepted students will study in India at Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar (SSN) institutions sponsored by the Shiv Nadar Foundation. The students will follow a curriculum designed by Carnegie Mellon and taught by SSN faculty trained at Carnegie Mellon. In addition to their studies in India, students will also study at Carnegie Mellon’s main Pittsburgh campus. According to the university, admission and academic processes will have the same rigorous standards that are in effect on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses.
“India’s engineers constitute a large proportion of key scientific and research establishments worldwide,” Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon said according to a university press release. “This new alliance enables Carnegie Mellon University and the Shiv Nadar Foundation a chance to offer India’s students a distinctive edge and international recognition.”
Video aims to encourage better choices towards sex
Julie Downs, an assistant research professor in the department of social and decision sciences, has recently received a $7.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The grant funding will be distributed across five years, as Downs produces a sequel to a previous DVD she created to discourage sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy among young females. Downs’ first video was titled “What Could You Do?” and was proven to increase abstinence for teenage girls.
“Our goal is to create a tool that will help teenagers make better decisions for themselves,” Downs said. “For the most part they don’t want to get pregnant. They definitely don’t want to contract a disease. By building on our research about what goes into their decisions, we can craft something that will be exactly what they need to avoid these negative outcomes.”
“I’m delighted to see such a strong funding endorsement of the application of quality behavioral decision research to the design and testing of key interventions,” said John Miller, the head of Carnegie Mellon’s department of social and decision sciences.
The new video is intended to help teenage girls make better decisions regarding sexual activity, as well as lower the costs of teenage pregnancies and disease treatment for health care agencies.

2010-11-15,CMU,India,"A couple that had been in pirate captivity for more than a year was released last Sunday, reportedly after paying $750,000 in ransom. Piracy has been increasingly problematic in recent years, particularly in the area around the Horn of Africa. Navies from countries around the world have been dispatched to fight piracy and protect shipping. 
However, most of these efforts have been and will continue to be ineffective. Piracy is no longer the domain of deserters and renegades, which were largely eliminated in the Atlantic and Caribbean centuries ago. Instead, it has become an advanced and developed business plan. Old methods of fighting piracy will not work against these high-tech criminals.
Most pirates in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden are of Somali origin. Somalia is a failed state with a virtually nonexistent government. The average Somali family lives on about $500 per year. In such an environment, piracy is an occupation with high payout and not unreasonable risk. An attack leader makes about $15,000, according to an NPR investigative report. The operations are normally funded by Somalis living outside the country, who reap the majority of the payout.
In this business environment, stopping individual attacks is completely ineffective. The only true way to discourage piracy is to punish the outside investors and stabilize Somalia and neighboring countries. These are enormous tasks, and they will require much more planning than simply sending a fleet to intercept hostile vessels. 
The small risk of capture for a Somali pirate pales in comparison to the ability to feed his family. The few times a hijacking makes the news, it is typically due to a rescue attempt, such as when the U.S. Navy took back the Maersk Alabama in 2009. But the majority of hijackings go unnoticed. The ransom is paid, the hostages are returned safely, and nobody gets hurt.
Modern piracy is not the cruel world of Blackbeard or the inventive one of Jack Sparrow. It has order and planning, and stopping it requires a reasoned response. Instead of sending ships to Somalia, we should be working with the nations of the world to lift that country out of poverty and give its citizens a better choice.

2010-11-15,CMU,India,"India has become Carnegie Mellon’s latest target for global expansion. Last week, the university entered into a partnership with the Shiv Nadar Foundation in India that allows undergraduate students to study in India based on a curriculum developed at Carnegie Mellon. Currently, the program is open to students studying mechanical engineering or electrical and computer engineering. The classes will be taught at the SSN College of Engineering in India by faculty trained at Carnegie Mellon.
As with all of Carnegie Mellon’s previous moves at creating a more global campus, this expansion has a number of benefits, and we applaud the university for taking this step. Indian students who normally would not be able to afford a foreign education will be able to receive high-quality education at a more affordable price. On the other hand, students in Pittsburgh who wish to later on work for companies in India or venture into a more global market after graduation will also benefit from interacting with faculty and students in India.
Although the vision that the creators of this program have in mind is great, we fear that it may not be as successful as hoped. The program has ambitious goals — it will start next June with around 10 to 15 students and, by the end of five years, the university wishes to have up to 100 students enrolled in India. According to President Cohon's Aug. 24 campus-wide e-mail, Carnegie Mellon is having trouble finding enough students for its programs in Australia. The same e-mail announced that the CIT degree in Greece will be suspended due to low enrollment. Similar problems could crop up in India, and this would severely limit the usefulness of the program.
A Carnegie Mellon location in India would be extremely useful for students in Pittsburgh as well as those in India, and we hope that the university takes sufficient efforts to attract enough students to the program. The university should learn from its experiences in Australia and Greece, and make sure that enough students want to enroll in the program for it to be sustainable for many years.
Editor's Note: This article was updated Nov. 16, 2010 to correct a factual error. The Heinz College program in Australia is not being suspended..

2010-11-22,CMU,India,"Very few individuals who choose a career in the film industry ever truly make it. That said, when someone does see success in the industry and becomes famous because of it, it is often customary for a hometown to show a little pride. In Indiana, Pa., a small town located one hour outside of the Pittsburgh city limits, residents have paid homage to the iconic film and stage actor Jimmy Stewart by establishing the Jimmy Stewart Museum. 
Stewart, who was born in Indiana in 1908, had one of the most versatile careers in Hollywood. After graduating from Princeton University in 1931, Stewart began his acting career by dabbling in various student performance troupes. After moving to New York City, Stewart made his Broadway debut in a show called Goodbye Again in which the actor had two lines. In 1934, on the opening night of Divided By Three, in which Stewart starred, the actor attracted the attention of MGM talent scout Bill Grady. Years later, after signing on as an MGM contract star and starring in various westerns, comedies, and thrillers, Stewart had become one of the most established names in Hollywood, earning himself five Academy Awards as well as one Lifetime Achievement award for his six decades in Hollywood. 
For the people of Indiana, Pa., Stewart has been the ultimate “hometown hero.” Thus, the Jimmy Stewart Museum was established to celebrate the remarkable career of this Hollywood icon. The museum itself features several relics from Stewart’s childhood and adult life. The array of display items is vast: From baby photos to his grandfather’s Civil War uniform, the museum has gathered together artifacts from every stage of the actor’s life. The museum also boasts an impressive vintage movie theater where visitors can view various film clips from Stewart’s career. 
However, museums don’t last forever, and as the generational gap widens, there seem to be fewer and fewer Stewart enthusiasts willing to visit the museum. With the current numbers of attendees and donations, it doesn’t look as if this town’s salute to a hometown hero will be able to stand much longer. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, with a drop in attendance from around 6,500 in 2009 to just 5,000 this year, and a budget cut from $5,500 to $1,400 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, curators at the museum worry that the attraction won’t be able to maintain itself.
Because the museum is one that depends mainly on annual gifts and operational volunteers, the town of Indiana has been promoting the attraction at every possible opportunity. However, donations are currently down 11 percent, and the museum’s endowment might not be enough to save it. 
Despite the fact that this museum is an hour outside  Pittsburgh, the possibility of closure is especially relevant to city residents concerned with preserving art and culture. One museum closure often leads to another, and being a city that prides itself on its extensive museums and art galleries, nearby closures could mean dangerous things for nonprofit organizations in Pittsburgh.
If you’re lacking something to do on a given weekend, gather some friends together and drive on over to the Jimmy Stewart Museum. You can also help keep this monumental museum alive by going to www.jimmy.org/donate and donating. It’s up to today’s generation to help preserve the generations of the past..

2011-01-17,CMU,India,"With the arrival of the new year come the most exciting weeks in all of sports: the NFL playoffs. Twelve teams enter the tournament, and only one comes out alive. This is where a handful of games can separate you from being a first-round loser and being the Super Bowl champion. What makes the NFL playoffs better than any others is, first and foremost, the format. Any team, no matter how good it is, can come out flat in one game and be demoted to watching the Super Bowl on the couch with a bucket of popcorn.
The 2011 playoffs have already gotten off to a great start with last week's wildcard weekend. In the first NFC wildcard game, the 7–9 Seattle Seahawks hosted the defending champion New Orleans Saints, who were heavily favored to dominate the game. Despite being the first losing team to ever make the playoffs, Seattle was able to win its division and secure home field advantage, and that's exactly what it was. Earlier in the season, Seattle went to New Orleans and got demolished by a score of 34–19. However, the Seahawks play their home games at Qwest Field, known for its unsurpassed crowd noise and for the fans’ ability to cause unnecessary false starts for the visiting team. Of course, no one gave the Seahawks much of a chance anyway, considering they could only muster seven wins throughout the regular season, and those who wrote them off were definitely shocked. In a game where they were the underdogs by over nine points, the Seahawks won by a score of 41–36, highlighted by Marshawn Lynch’s inhuman run of over 50 yards that featured an extraordinary seven broken tackles. Many consider it to be the greatest run in postseason history.
Later that Saturday, the underdog New York Jets went on to defeat the perennial Super Bowl contender Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning on the road in a thrilling 17–16 victory. This game was only the second time a playoff game was ever decided on a “do-or-die” field goal in the final seconds. New York Jets kicker Nick Folk, who had a shaky season this year, pounded in a 32-yard field goal as time expired to vault the Jets into a rematch with their hated rival, the New England Patriots.
The second day of wildcard weekend was a bit less exciting, as the Baltimore Ravens showcased their trademark defense as they manhandled the Kansas City Chiefs on the road. In the second NFC game, the upstart Green Bay Packers headed into Philadelphia to try and end Michael Vick’s magical comeback season. In a game mostly dominated by the Packers, cornerback Tramon Williams of the Packers intercepted a last-minute pass by Vick in the end zone to win it for Green Bay. However, with Baltimore and Green Bay joining New York and Seattle in the divisional rounds, fans got what they wanted, with all four playoff matchups featuring rematches between the two teams.
So, what else makes the NFL playoffs so great? First off, the intensity of the players seems to rise as postseason football hits. One fact many casual fans do not know is that NFL players get a $21,000 game check for each playoff game, which is almost 10 times less than what the average player makes each week of the regular season. Also, stars like Tom Brady end up making the same amount as the last guy on the bench, making the NFL playoffs the ultimate team sport. Everyone is in it to win it all, and money is not a factor. Secondly, with this added intensity, rivalries appear and bad blood fuels a whole week of anticipation. Take the two AFC matchups this week, for example. The Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, both members of the AFC North, have one of the greatest rivalries in the NFL. These two teams hate each other to the core, as seen by one of Baltimore linebacker Terrell Suggs’ wardrobe choices this week. Suggs sported a “Hey Pittsburgh, F*** You!” shirt, further increasing the tension of this battle that ended with a Pittsburgh comeback victory that had all the excitement it was supposed to. In the other AFC matchup, the Jets faced the New England Patriots, and I’m not sure there has ever been that much trash talk for a game in the history of sports.
Lastly, the NFL playoffs can almost never be predicted correctly. The Seahawks' victory over the Saints was a great example of how much variance there is in the NFL. The underdog is never a given loss, as shown by the 2007 New York Giants winning the Super Bowl over the then-18–0 Patriots in one of the greatest upsets in football history. No matter what, the playoffs will give you great games, and no team is ever going to give up.
So sit back and enjoy the NFL playoff ride, as you may not even get a season next year considering the potential lockout. I expect these next few games to live up to the hype and create one of the best NFL postseasons in recent memory..

2011-01-17,CMU,India,"It began with JuicyCampus. Suddenly, the idea of an anonymous Internet forum didn’t seem so strange, with a simple modus operandi: Give college students a place to talk about anything (or anyone) without fear of repercussions. Then in 2009 JuicyCampus closed, and College ACB moved into the void left behind. It’s been steadily growing in use ever since, with an explosion of activity on Carnegie Mellon’s board over the past three months.
The concept, on the surface, is surprisingly liberating. Students can post topics complaining about a fellow student, an organization, a class, or an RA — all without fear of being held accountable for their comments. Fraternities and sororities are also at the center of many discussions. However, College ACB’s problems are immediately visible with only a brief glance. An average post from the Carnegie Mellon board is slightly ridiculous, sometimes amusing — and sometimes outright defamatory. Topics such as “Frats that haze vs frats that dont [sic]” and “are there any hot Indians at Carnegie” are the trending fodder, to name a few. It’s a site that runs somewhere in between the humble pensiveness of Montaigne and the collective trash of a service like 4chan.
The problem for users of College ACB lies in one word: libel. Comments printed about an individual that are untrue and are defamatory can be pursued by that person in a court of law — and the site can be served a subpoena for a poster’s personal information. 
College ACB does offer an internal moderation service, but its effectiveness is questionable. “Any post that might be threatening, libelous, or otherwise illegal is immediately brought to the webmaster’s attention,” wrote Peter Frank, the site’s operator, in the site’s first press release. However, the notification function often takes days to carry through, and it can often only nominate several posts for deletion at a time. The person reporting the posts must also be the one defamed by them; simply reporting libelous posts won’t work. Despite this system, there is a very real possibility that legal action may be taken. The Communications Decency Act protects the owners of the site themselves from directly being sued; however, if they wish to avoid being complicit in a John Doe lawsuit, they’ll be asked to provide the offending poster’s personal information (including the poster’s IP address). 
Posting from the comparative anonymity of a public station such as a cluster is no safe haven, either. If asked to produce personal information for legal purposes, “Computing Services would be able to identify the account or accounts being used on the machine at a given time,” said John Lerchey, a representative of Carnegie Mellon’s Information Security Office. “On machines like the UNIX servers where multiple users access the machine remotely simultaneously, we would likely be able to provide a list of users that were on the system at the time.” The moral of the story? No place on campus — or on a personal computer, for that matter — is entirely anonymous. The price of an insult to a member of the campus community could be thousands of dollars in attorney fees at the very least, and fines at the very worst. In the interests of self-preservation, if nothing else, the potential cost seems intimidatingly large.
The important question here is simple. Despite all the negative press, is this service worth keeping? Is free speech meant to harm another a tool worth protecting or something worth inhibiting? That’s the debate that this campus’s participating community ultimately needs to have with itself. If there is one thing we must rejoice in, it is that the Internet is such a venue of freedom that sites such as this one are available unhindered. Some college campuses have called for bans of College ACB on their networks; others such as Cornell University have seen students moving to boycott the site. Even if the site were to be censored or banned at Carnegie Mellon, would that be enough, and would anything really change? 
It may simply be that, given the availability — or at least the appearance — of anonymity, human nature calls for us to exploit it to the fullest. Yet it is in each individual’s best self-interest to determine whether the price his or her words might carry are worth more than the alternative: a more powerful statement of silence.

2011-01-31,CMU,India,"Perhaps your New Year’s resolution — to go to the gym every day, or to spend less time on Facebook — hasn’t been going as well as you hoped. Well, luckily, there is another new year approaching to give you the chance to renew your resolutions. This year, the Chinese New Year takes place on Thursday, Feb. 3.
The date for the Chinese New Year varies each year, as it is determined by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, rather than the Western world’s Gregorian calendar. The Chinese New Year, sometimes referred to as the Lunar New Year, usually occurs on the second new moon after the winter solstice. This upcoming year will be the Year of the Rabbit, which occurs every 12 years. People born in the Year of the Rabbit are said to be artistic, gracious, lucky, and soft-spoken.
The Chinese New Year is not exclusively a Chinese celebration; it is also celebrated in many other Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In Vietnam, the Year of the Rabbit is translated as the Year of the Cat, due to the similarity between the Chinese symbol for rabbit and the Vietnamese word for cat.
According to Chinese legend, the first Chinese New Year celebration came about as a result of a small village’s attempt to rid itself of a mythical beast called Nien. Nien would come to the village the first day of every year and terrorize the village by devouring their livestock, crops, and children. One year, the villagers noticed that a little child wearing red had scared Nien away; they realized that the beast was afraid of the color red. Therefore, the following New Year, they hung red paper lanterns all around the village and put red spring scrolls on the doors and windows. They also lit firecrackers, with hopes that the noise would further scare the beast. From that year on, the villagers never saw Nien again.
The Chinese New Year has a host of traditional practices, such as giving the younger generation red envelopes containing money. Wearing red is a common practice, as is setting off fireworks. Dragon and lion dances are also common; the aggressive faces of either animal, performed to the deafening sounds of symbols, are intended to ward off evil spirits.
There is a large Chinese community present on Carnegie Mellon’s campus; last school year, 600 graduate and undergraduate students were citizens of China, according to Carnegie Mellon’s 2009–10 Factbook. Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) is one organization designed to help to these international students. “[The organization] helps new students start their lives in Pittsburgh, build a better community for Chinese students and scholars and contribute as a multicultural student organization at Carnegie Mellon,” according to the association’s website.
Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) is another student organization geared toward students of Chinese heritage; it hosts events throughout the school year designed to promote Chinese culture in the larger university community. One of its upcoming events is “One Night in Beijing,” an evening filled with Chinese cultural performances and Asian food. For those interested in emceeing the event, ARCC will hold auditions this Saturday at noon. In addition, groups interested in performing at the event should email  Allison Ko (asko@) by Feb. 7.
Chinese New Year at Carnegie Mellon
Given the size of Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese community, it should not come as a surprise that there are multiple events happening on campus in order to celebrate the Chinese New Year. This past Saturday, ARCC hosted a dinner with authentic Chinese dishes in honor of the holiday. “50 or 60 people were there.... They had a lot of good food and served us a lot of authentic dishes. Last year they had a lot of different performances before the dinner,” Cindy Wang, a junior in the Tepper School of Business, said.
The Chinese Studies program is also hosting a celebration of the new year this Friday at 5 p.m. in Porter Hall. The event will include Chinese food, a talent show, calligraphy demonstration and practice, Chinese games, and karaoke.
In addition, the Lunar Gala, named in honor of the Chinese Lunar New Year, traditionally takes place on the weekend of the Chinese New Year and begins with a celebration of Chinese culture. Last year, the gala began with three dances performed by members of the Oriental Star Dance School and displayed paper lanterns and served Chinese dumplings as a nod to Chinese culture.
Chinese New Year in Pittsburgh
Although Pittsburgh might not be the first city that comes to mind when one thinks of globalization and diversity, Pittsburgh in fact has a vibrant Chinese community. According to GlobalPittsburgh.org, waves of Chinese immigrants have been coming to Pittsburgh since the 1960s to settle down and study. The Pittsburgh Chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA-Pittsburgh) promotes Chinese culture throughout Pittsburgh and organizes groups such as the OCA Youth Performance Ensemble, which is a teenaged ensemble that performs Chinese dances and other Chinese folk arts.
OCA-Pittsburgh is hosting a banquet in honor of the new year on Feb. 17 at the Syria Shriners Center in Cheswick. The banquet, which has been an annual event since the 1980s, will include a lion dance from the OCA Youth Performance Ensemble, an Indian Bollywood Dance, and a Japanese Taiko drum performance.
Closer to Carnegie Mellon’s campus, the University of Pittsburgh’s Chinese American Student Association and the Vietnamese Student Association are hosting a new year’s celebration featuring games, a fashion show, and Chinese and Vietnamese food.
If you would rather celebrate the new year on your own time, there are plenty of Asian restaurants scattered about Pittsburgh. On Craig Street alone, there are multiple Chinese restaurants. Orient Express is right next to Starbucks on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street. Lulu’s Noodles is beloved for its bubble tea, but further up the street there is also Little Asia, where the food is inexpensive and more authentic than the other two restaurants.
In Shadyside there is China Palace, where one can get a large variety of high-quality food at a reasonable price. If you can afford a slightly higher price range, try going to Soba, a more modern restaurant in Shadyside. Through Feb. 3, the restaurant is offering a special Chinese New Year menu that includes a four-course meal for $35.
For Asian food that isn’t necessarily Chinese, the Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill serves authentic Taiwanese and Thai food, in addition to bubble tea, all at a reasonable price.
Whether you are of Chinese heritage, have an interest in Chinese culture, or are merely looking for an excuse to indulge in some delicious Chinese food, the upcoming Chinese New Year is a holiday rich with heritage that provides an opportunity to celebrate the new year once more..

2011-01-31,CMU,India,"The last week has seen tens of thousands of protesters take to the streets of Egypt. “Freedom!” they cry in Arabic. “No, no, Mubarak,” read the signs, referring to the nation’s president for the last 30 years. It is an awakening of a popular movement that has long been suppressed. Across the Arab world, authoritarian governments fear a wave of unrest that could topple long-standing regimes. Tunisia’s dictator fled just a few weeks ago and was replaced with a representative government. The fate of Egypt’s leaders remains uncertain. And while its people are not Arab, Iran’s citizens have shown themselves willing to demand reforms in the past elections. The status quo, always fragile, seems to be on the verge of collapse. The future is unclear.
Those of us who have no direct stake in the popular movements in the Muslim world have our own dilemma. How do we feel about those uprisings? Do we support the will of the protesters or the strength of the authorities? In such a volatile region, every result carries its own dangers.
At first glance, we immediately sympathize with the protesters in Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak has done little to help his people in his last three decades of rule. He has used the police and other official agencies to suppress dissent, such as that expressed by the Muslim Brotherhood, a minority (and illegal) political party with an Islamist agenda. Egyptians want better economic conditions and more political freedoms. They want freedom from the oppressive regime that controls their country. As Americans, and as free-thinking human beings, we cannot help but want them to succeed.
Despite the moral simplicity that supporting the protesters offers, there are more subtle consequences of a collapse of the existing order in Egypt. East of the Nile Delta lies the Suez Canal, an essential transport route from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. Uncertainty over the security of the canal has led to international conflict before, and political turmoil in Egypt might threaten international trade.
To the northeast of the Suez Canal lie Israel and the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, both of which would feel profound effects from a major change in Egyptian government. Egypt and Israel have a peace agreement gained from several wars since 1948. The two counties have limited military cooperation, and Israel relies on maintaining a peaceful southern border. A new government in Cairo could destroy that tenuous relationship, leading to resumed conflict between the two most technologically advanced armies in the immediate region. A new, sensible Egyptian authority would realize that such a setback would be disastrous for both countries, but it is impossible to predict the outcome of a popular revolution. Skeptics are already looking to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to see the potential catastrophe that might result. An Israeli-Egyptian relationship that is at the very least not hostile is essential to retaining any semblance of peace in the Middle East.
Along with the possibility of decaying relations with Israel, a new Egyptian government might not see the United States as an ally, as Mubarak does. Political changes in the Middle East have rarely helped America’s foreign policy. President Barack Obama’s halfhearted support for the current Egyptian protests, coupled with the United States’ long support for the Mubarak government, mean that a new popular regime would have little reason to love Obama or his country. And while many reports have identified the protesters as largely secular, there are also Islamist, anti-American elements which might exercise power in a post-Mubarak government.
As fast as the uprising in Tunisia was, and as fast as the protests in Egypt are moving now, it is impossible to predict what will happen this evening, much less a month from now. Nobody can say whether Mubarak will hold on to power or if his regime will fall. What is clear, though, is that this complex situation requires caution. As much as we might wish to unreservedly support the protesters, we must also recognize that their victory might ultimately create more problems than it solves. Egypt has a democratic constitution, and a solution through the legally established political process has a better chance of success than an overthrow of the government. Mubarak should realize his rule has come to an end and resign in favor of an interim leader who will guarantee free, open, and fair elections.

2011-02-14,CMU,India,"For those tired of dorm life, moving off campus is an extremely enticing option. While there are a few downsides to the decision, there are a number of benefits as well. Listed below are some pros and cons of living off-campus. You can use this as a guide to decide whether moving off campus is the right decision for you.
To begin with the positives, it’s cheaper than on-campus housing. Although this is not true in all cases (if you choose to live alone in a beautiful studio apartment on the middle of upscale Walnut Street, it’s going to be way more expensive), in most cases, especially if you are sharing an apartment with a roommate, the cost will be quite affordable. Rent for two-bedroom apartments usually ranges from $600 to $800 per month. Adding to that an electricity bill of around a $100 per month during the winter, and an Internet bill of around $50 per month, the total expenditure per month is usually around $750 to $950. Split that between two people and you have to pay $375 to $475 per month. If you do the math, you will realize that for four months you have to pay a maximum of $1,900. A prime double in Morewood costs $3,170 per semester. If you choose apartment-style living offered by the university, it will be even more expensive. In terms of cost, we have a clear winner.
You have your own kitchen. If you were one of those people who hated it when you had to walk all the way across the dorm carrying utensils and food to cook, only to realize that the kitchen was occupied, off-campus living is for you. With your own kitchen you can spend hours cooking, clean up at your leisure, and not have to worry about what that suspicious-looking spill on the stove was.
There’s more space. This is an obvious one. You can have your own bedroom. There’s a living room that you don’t have to share with the 20 people living on your floor. You have more closet space. It is also great for parties — when you invite 10 people over, they actually have space to move around.
It’s closer to good food. If you are bored of cooking and are looking for options to eat out, you have a wide range of choices available once you live off campus. Apartments in Oakland and around Craig Street are near some excellent restaurants, ranging from Indian to Italian to Mexican cuisines — you have it all. Shadyside and Squirrel Hill also have a number of options for eating out.
You don’t need to worry about noise levels. You don’t have to worry about loud music playing at 2 a.m. when you have an exam the next day. Conversely, you don’t have 
to worry about disturbing others when you want to play loud music at night. Apartments aren’t soundproof, but they are reasonably well spaced apart so that you are not disturbed by what is going on in your neighbor’s apartment and vice-versa.
Unfortunately, off-campus living also brings complaints. It’s far from campus. This is perhaps the most widely expressed argument against living off campus. Although this is a problem, it depends on where you live. Oakland and Craig Street really are not too bad a walk from campus, and once you start living there, you will find a number of shortcuts that take you to campus quickly. Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, on the other hand, do pose a problem and are quite a distance from campus, though buses do run through these neighborhoods.
You are away from friends. Unless all of your close friends decide to move off campus, you will be away from them, unable to knock on their doors at crazy hours of the day.
You have a much heavier backpack. There is no way you can run back and forth between your apartment and campus multiple times throughout the day. You end up having to carry your laptop and all the books you want to study out of. This may result in backaches throughout the semester.
Ultimately, though, if you really want to move off campus, there are ways to work around the disadvantages. The university Escort and shuttle are quite reliable and can take you home if you live far away and like studying late on campus. If you are someone who will miss friends, study with them during the day or have them come and stay over with you sometimes. As for the heavier bags, consider using library resources sometimes instead of carrying everything with you. Living off campus can be a great experience and while it does come with a few disadvantages, there are many benefits which can make the experience worthwhile..

2011-02-14,CMU,India,"FAST FACTS:
Location: Adjacent to Gesling Stadium, next to the University Center
Style(s) of housing: Suite — typically five students share a common living space and bathroom. Dorm — prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 296 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: Four (West Wing floors 2 and 4, Resnik floors 2 and 3)
Lounges: Four (West Wing floors 3 and 5, Resnik floors 4 and 5)
Resnik and West Wing are the ideal dormitory choices for students who aren’t ready — or aren’t willing — to move off campus but want a bit more of a grown-up place to live than a typical dorm. While students in these dorms have the chance to be more independent, they also boast a quick walk to any of the academic buildings on campus, a definite benefit for those mornings when you just can’t seem to stop hitting the snooze button.
Both dorms consist primarily of suites, which are made up of two doubles and a single with a common bathroom and lounge for the suite. A limited number of prime singles and doubles do exist in the buildings as well, though they are not as well known.
Resnik and West Wing are optimal for a group of friends who wish to live together but want to maintain their proximity to campus and the other advantages — like free toilet paper and a once-a-week bathroom cleaning — that living on campus offers. Students mostly stay inside their suites, leaving the hallways relatively quiet. The lounges do fill up, however — usually with groups of students either working on homework or hooking up their video game systems to the television.
Both buildings do offer kitchens on certain floors, which is nice when you’ve had your fill of The Exchange and Sí Señor, but if you don’t feel like cooking, Resnik is home to a number of dining options. There is the Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and Resnik Café. In particular, Resnik Café offers a variety of choices, including sushi, Indian cuisine, and comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous amenities that Resnik and West Wing offer, it is not surprising that both of these dorms fill up early in the room selection process. Hopeful residents are advised to find a friend who can pull them in..

As one of the more recently renovated student dorms on campus, Henderson House is a clean and quiet place to live. This dorm offers students air conditioning and heating, connected bathrooms — which are cleaned once a week — shared with one other room, and the intimacy of a small building, with 20 rooms per floor. The first floor is generally reserved for first-years only. 
Henderson House and Welch House are also labeled “Wellness Houses,” in that they promote green practices, maintain a substance-free lifestyle, and generally encourage healthy living. Each student who lives here is expected to sign an agreement promising to adhere to these standards during the school year. Students can also take advantage of playing for the house’s IM teams or participating in weekly optional community activities set up by the resident assistants. Tickets to special events like plays or shows are subsidized by the dorm, which is a nice perk. Henderson, although placed on the outskirts of Carnegie Mellon, is sheltered from any traffic or noise from campus. The dorm’s residents also respect an unwritten policy of peace and quiet, which makes this dorm ideal for studying. Despite being on a hill, Henderson is very close to the Tepper School of Business, the tennis courts, Gesling Stadium, and the eateries at Resnik House, such as the Carnegie Mellon Café and Taste of India.
Despite all Henderson has to offer students, there are drawbacks. Dorm rooms are not the largest, and on occasion the heating will malfunction, turning each room into a furnace. 
Welch is one of the Hill houses, but it distinguishes itself by having a 24-hour quiet rule. This often means that Welch attracts students who prefer to keep to themselves and are less interested in creating a community atmosphere. However, the atmosphere seems to suit students who want a comfortable home and don’t want to be distracted by noise. The rooms are large and bathrooms are spacious. Welch was renovated in 2001..

2011-02-14,CMU,India,"This is one entry from the author's upcoming blog, which will be written in the form of lists and letters about her time while studying abroad in India.
Dear Francesca,
You have been saying that you honestly don’t know what to picture when you think of India. In your last letter, you mentioned Slumdog Millionaire and Eat, Pray, Love as what this place might look like. I had similar images in my head, but now that I am here, in this tiny part of the South, I can try to help you picture India with words. 
When our group of 16 American and Canadian students traveled together throughout Kerala, I put my camera away after a few days. Sure, we visited beautiful historical and cultural points, sailed along the backwaters, toured a spice plantation, and trekked through some of the highlands. But instead of photographing, I had my notebook in hand, making lists, writing letters that may never be sent, and blind-contour sketching the faces of our group. I didn’t think a lens could even capture everything we were seeing. 
But now that we’ve settled into the groove of being university students in India, there is a completely different world that I want to describe to you. It’s small and becomes easier to navigate each day. We have the weekends to explore, but really, the campus and the nearby town of Pondicherry — affectionately known as “Pondy” — are what I want you to be able to picture.
I’m writing this at my desk in my room of the Foreign Students Hostel (what we may call a dorm), and I’m staring out the large window for inspiration. It comes easily — there are palm trees and greenery scattered around a large, easy-to-walk path. 
We walk about 15 minutes to class through the campus, which is 800 acres. Envision similar palm trees and leafiness scattered throughout, with students and professors zipping around on bicycles and motorbikes. I am sweating by the time I get to class, and sometimes the professor doesn’t even show up — just a note on the chalkboard saying that class is canceled, if that. Then there’s an equally sweaty walk or bike ride back to the hostel. 
I’m taking a 19th-century British fiction class with about 60 Indian students. We just read Pride and Prejudice, and talking about marriages formed out of love and compatibility with these students is interesting, as many of their marriages will be arranged. Other classes, like Christianity in India, I just take with people in my program.
Now, try to forget the cold and think of the beach — it is a stone’s throw away from where we live. In the afternoons, I cross the glorified highway that runs alongside campus, called the ECR (East Coast Road) to walk through a small village. 
When you picture crossing a street, don’t picture any street you’ve ever crossed before. It’s British-style, so look to the right first. Check for cattle, stray dogs, large buses with men hanging off the sides, horn-tooting autorickshaws, motorcycles, bicycles, and other pedestrians trying to do the same thing you’re doing. 
When you finally reach the village, I think you’ll get some of the imagery you mentioned, like the barefoot children. Next to the straw huts directly are modern, three-story houses. Closer to the water, women wash their clothes on rocks, chickens squawk, and dark-eyed crows are always pecking at food. 
The beach is small and the waves are rough — but here, it is easiest to forget where you are. It could be a deserted American East Coast beach. The noise fades away, and if you look straight ahead, you can avoid seeing the fishermen squatting in the sand to relieve themselves. 
Do you remember when you were in Chile, with the obvious feeling that you didn’t fit in? That is every day here, walking to class or to the beach or taking the bus into town. We cannot change the color of our skin, no matter how traditionally we dress. The women wear salwar kameez or churidas, as they are known in the South, which is a long tunic top, a scarf, and long pants — light, made of cotton, and in the most fantastic colors.  I have a few of these clothes, but after being here for more than a month, I realize how marked I am by my skin and their assumptions. It is less about being from America than being foreign, Western, and presumably wealthy. 
I’ve mentioned going into “Pondy” before, and that is a series of photographs in itself. Picture this: Wait in the hot sun for a bus that comes chugging up, blaring music. You hop on the back entrance because the front entrance is for men, and then try to find a seat. If it’s around five or six o’clock, every woman is trying to get home, so you will be crushed among a sea of saris and churidas, sweating as usual. 
You press a few coins (4 rupees, about 10 cents) into the conductor’s hand, saying “Pondy,” or wherever you are going. He will inevitably repeat it in a way that sounds the same to you but is different to him. Bobble your head yes, because a nod doesn’t really mean anything here, and he will hand you a waxy piece of paper that counts as a ticket, but is never collected or inspected. 
In town, you can push your way through what now feels like a typical Indian street — no sidewalks, a collection of animals and vehicles moving at random, without the aid of traffic lights or yield signs. Because Pondicherry was colonized by the French, there is the French quarter, with wide, quiet streets, leafy oaks, tiny bakeries and rooftop cafés, and numerous French people speaking actual French. That is the only other place I have found where I can forget, for a moment, that I’m in India. 
But I don’t want to forget that I’m here, really. The time is already careening by, each day a whirlwind of attempting to go to class, sweating, reading about things I’m not taking classes on, and talking — always talking — to figure out what is going on here.  
Miss you always,
Caroline.

Identity Equipment: Technology, Memory, Narrative
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing, Baker Hall 136A
Paul John Eakin, the Ruth N. Halls professor emeritus of English at Indiana University, will be presenting his lecture on identities in conflict. 
He will use the latest research in neurology, cognitive science, memory studies, developmental psychology, and related fields in order to make his audience reevaluate their ideas of self-representation. 
The experience of living in one’s body shapes one’s identity, while exploring relational and narrative modes of being, emphasizing social sources of identity, and demonstrating that humans are constantly evolving in relation to others. 
Eakin plans to conclude by discussing the ethical issues raised by the conflict between the authorial impulse to life writing and a traditional, privacy-based ethics that those writings often violate.

2011-02-14,CMU,India,"President Obama recently announced that his budget proposal would provide relief for states burdened by debt from unemployment benefits. Although this proposal had not officially been released by the White House until today, representatives and employers alike have already made their feelings known. At a time when unity is most needed, partisan differences are keeping government fragmented.
It is obvious that our economy is still in the midst of a recession. Families are still forced to cut back, unemployment levels are still uncomfortably high, and people everywhere are still nervous about putting their faith in the government’s plans. As a result, the Obama administration has been forced to think of creative and resourceful strategies to help businesses and workers survive. This is becoming increasingly difficult with the federal government loaning billions of dollars to state governments to pay for unemployment benefits. According to The Wall Street Journal, “More than 40 states raised their unemployment-insurance payroll taxes last year to boost revenues.”
Obama’s plan is aimed at replenishing the drained state unemployment-insurance trust funds. It stipulates that companies will have to pay $15,000 in unemployment taxes, more than double the amount they are currently paying. However, in a good-hearted attempt to aid businesses as much as possible, the proposal would ideally delay these new tax regulations until 2014, the estimated year of full economic recovery.
I believe it is essential that the federal government and companies work together and form a symbiotic relationship. Without cooperation between the two, our economy will only continue to stagnate.
“The president’s proposal does two things that are most important,” White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a Washington Post article. “It prevents increases in the federal tax that goes to the unemployment insurance fund, and that’s tremendously important given where we are economically. But it prevents future state bailouts, because in the future, states are going to have to rationalize what they offer and how they pay for it.”
Not all feedback on the proposal is so positive and optimistic, however. A majority of Republican representatives have taken a decidedly strong opposition to the plan’s provisions. They are most incensed with the prospect of raising taxes and government intervention on business, as per usual.
“I strongly urge the White House to reconsider this job-destroying proposal,” said Orrin Hatch (R–Utah) in a press release. “Either employers will have less money to hire, or workers will face reduced wages. Neither makes any sense and both run counter to our shared goal of getting the American people back to work.”
Hatch, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has a clear personal stake in the outcome of this budget plan. He, like many Republicans, believes that raising taxes of any sort is a counter-intuitive method of restoring and revitalizing the economy. However, in instances like these, federal and state governments must agree to compromises in order for any sort of progress to be made.
Realistically speaking, what other choice does the federal government have besides raising revenue, especially considering the already-fragile state of our economy?
Although the plan is geared toward helping companies, employers remain skeptical of the possible benefits and pitfalls.
“What’s being proposed by the White House would be very helpful and a big boost in the short term,” said Kevin Brinegar, president of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, whose members start paying higher taxes in April in order to repay the state’s $2 billion loan. However, he commented that the proposal’s additional tax increases in 2014 “would be pretty devastating.”
The budget proposal is being debated during a time when tensions between White House officials and employers are still apparent. Although the federal government is trying to improve its relations with business groups by cutting costs, it is simultaneously pushing for financial help to restore the unemployment insurance fund, which has been severely drained by the prolonged recession.
Obama promised businesses government efforts to simplify the corporate tax code and to lower the corporate tax rate. By demanding even higher unemployment taxes, Obama’s plan could exacerbate that already strained relationship.
It is very easy to be a skeptic and a cynic. It is very easy to criticize and complain. But now is not the time for involved parties, such as Congress, businesses, and the public, to take the easy route; cooperation, although difficult, is necessary for our country to restore itself.
It seems that both members of Congress and the public expect Obama to magically restore the economy without any additional cost to them. They both need to realize that this is a ridiculous stance. Their unrealistic belief that recovery and sacrifice don’t go hand in hand will leave President Obama with some very tough decisions to make.
No one can say with certainty if this proposal will help the economy and businesses. Both sides of support and opposition have valid points, making it difficult to take a definite stance. One thing, however, is certain: The best approach we can take to fixing our economy is to put aside teamwork and partisan biases. We will only dig ourselves into a deeper financial crisis by nit-picking and splitting hairs with one another. There is a famous stereotype associated with split Congressional houses: Partisan gridlock means laws are never passed and nothing gets done. I strongly disagree; if the two houses can keep the goal of restoring the economy a priority and avoid being bogged down by minor details, Congress could produce innovative pieces of legislature.
That being said, it will be interesting to see how far this proposal gets in Congress and if Obama can generate enough support to get it passed.

2011-02-21,CMU,India,"The Mayur South Asian Student Alliance, or MayurSASA for short, presented its 2011 show “History Hungama” on Saturday, giving its viewers a true taste of Bollywood. Just like any Bollywood movie, it had fashion, a catching story line, and dances, resulting in a two-hour dose of good entertainment. The Mayur show also had an intermission for refreshments that offered a true taste of India. For those who do not know a lot about Bollywood, it’s extremely glamorous. It isn’t just about the story or the actors — rather, it’s about the whole production.
The storyline of “History Hungama” was a spinoff of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Like many Bollywood movies, the plot followed the hero — or several heroes, in this case — who struggled and finally triumphed over the villain. The “History Hungama” story, while humorous and entertaining, still taught its audience about India, its culture, and important figures of Indian history. The plot revolved around two boys named Ram and Sham who go to a museum in India. While there, they see the statues of acclaimed movie director Meera Nair, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, famous scientist and astronaut Kalpana Chawla, famed freedom struggler Mahatma Gandhi, and Akbar, a Mughal ruler of India in the past. Also in this museum is a golden conch of historic value.
The two boys run into Carmen Sandiego at the museum and, swayed by her charm, help her steal the golden conch. This angers the statues at the museum and they come to life, forming an Indian “I-Team.” Carmen wants to go back to the past and alter it so as to eradicate the I-Team. This provided an opening to show off great historic moments — for example, it depicted the 1930 Salt March in India, when the Indian people marched to prepare their own salt in protest of the British Salt Tax that made it illegal to sell or produce salt. The show depicted each historic event with a twist. The play also explained the famous lagaan, or land tax, and presented the kingdom of the ancient Indian ruler Akbar.
In addition to the play, there was also glamor, dance, fashion, and music. Deewane, the South Asian a cappella group at Carnegie Mellon, also performed. These young men charmed the audience with their smooth voices. Their performance included both Bollywood songs and American ones. Deewane’s members also showed their Pittsburgh pride and sang “Black and Yellow.”
There was a multitude of dance performances at the Mayur show. The dance steps were innovative, and the dance groups, whose selections included both Bollywood and American songs, gave the original performers a run for their money. These dances provided a glimpse of the joy that is inherent within most Bollywood movies. The dances brought vibrancy and happiness to the song selections, expressing feelings that lyrics would not be able to do on their own.
Tanah, the all-female South Asian dance troupe at Carnegie Mellon, seems to out-do itself each year. The theme of the troupe’s performance this year was robots. Tanah’s performance was outstanding, and the dancers’ costumes were glamorous. Carnegie Mellon’s bhangra troupe, Chak De, was also full of life. Its performance was bright, big, and loud, leaving the audience with dropped jaws and constant cheering.
Bollywood is also about trends and style. Many people in India learn a lot about dress from these movies, and over time the demand for fashion in Bollywood has increased. This principle — the importance of fashion in Bollywood — was evident in the Mayur show’s fashion segment. The fashion show focused not only on Indian wear, but also on fusion wear. The costume collection was variable and high-quality, with professional-looking outfits, makeup, and poses.
From fashion to dancing, singing, and acting, there was something for everyone at “History Hungama.” Show chairs Naina Saxena, a business administration senior, and Gurmukh Singh Chhabra, a chemical engineering senior, did a phenomenal job of organizing a successful show..

2011-02-21,CMU,India,"The famous fast food chain Chick-fil-A recently donated food to an anti-gay marriage group. The corporate owner, Truett Cathy, was apparently aiming to preserve the restaurant’s “Christian DNA.” Last time I checked, restaurants were not subdivisions of religious entities. Not only is this a horrendously poor business model by ostracizing a significant percentage of Americans, it is also incredibly offensive.
Chick-fil-A’s decision to promote Christian values has created a lot of controversy with human rights activists, who are unsurprisingly fighting back. According to a CNN news blog, the Human Rights Campaign, a major gay-rights group, began a letter-writing campaign, and Indiana University South Bend temporarily closed down a Chick-fil-A service in its campus dining facilities.
The public’s reaction resulted in Cathy making a written statement of apology. “In recent weeks, we have been accused of being anti-gay,” Cathy said last Saturday. “We have no agenda against anyone.... While my family and I believe in the Biblical definition of marriage, we love and respect anyone who disagrees.” Cathy also posted a video on the chain’s Facebook page in an attempt to mitigate the spur of resentment the donation caused. Neither apology changed the public’s general sentiment.
Even beyond donating to an anti-gay organization, Chick-fil-A’s incorporation of its “Christian DNA” business model hinders success to a significant degree. Not only does its corporate purpose aim “to glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us,” but all of its locations are closed on Sundays. Sunday is a vital day for generating business and making profit. If the restaurant wishes to grow and expand, as a normal business would, it is ridiculous to cut off such a large group of potential clientele. By de-secularizing, the business can only cater to a small portion of Americans, an utterly backward economical plan. 
According to Lake Lambert, author of the book Spirituality Inc., “If you have a faith-based corporate identity and you want to function in the national marketplace, you’re going to continue to encounter resistance to those values because not everybody is going to share them....The only other option is some sort of secular identity, and that’s not where Chick-fil-A is going.” Owners can’t possibly expect to increase their revenue with such a strategy; catering to the few will not result in success.
It is understandable to want to inspire good values throughout a corporation, especially in a family-based restaurant. However, mixing personal beliefs with business etiquette is never a good idea. Building a successful business requires owners to take a neutral stance on controversial topics; otherwise severe backlash from the public will be the norm and will eventually result in an economic downfall. It would be wisest for Chick-fil-A to separate its beliefs from its business.

2011-03-28,CMU,India,"Indira Nair speaks about her life journey. 
Indira Nair, Carnegie Mellon’s former vice provost for education, retired at the end of last year following 32 years of dedication to the university. This past Tuesday, she returned to campus to deliver a lecture as part of “Journeys,” one of Carnegie Mellon’s University Lecture Series and the successor to the “Last Lecture” series. Her topic was “Teachers All Around Me: My Life of Learning.” She spoke about the “lessons learned along this journey and the worlds they opened up.”
More a narrative than a memoir, Nair’s lecture discussed the most important learning opportunities of her life and what she described as her “intellectual journey.” She used her life as a learning ground for four significant themes: the ethic of care; identity, authenticity, and integrity; respect for time and questions; and literacy versus expertise.
In her introduction, Amy Burkert, the current vice provost for education at Carnegie Mellon, welcomed her as “the creator and architect of the Journeys series.” 
Nair began her lecture with her childhood experiences in Trivandrum, Kerala — a state on the southwest coast of India — where she grew up with a unique, statewide emphasis on education and literacy. Offering a sample of the atmosphere, Nair recounted one story where a government official came to her house demanding to know why she, a five-year-old girl, was not in school when children were required to begin their education at age four. Even today, she said, Kerala has the highest literacy rate in all of India.
Nair’s family reinforced this early government-based focus on education, insisting that she achieve her bachelor’s degree and teaching her a lasting lesson about the value of internalizing knowledge.
As she moved on to her experiences in higher education at Elphinstone College’s Institute of Science, graduate school in Kansas, and a Ph.D. at Northwestern University, Nair talked with passion about her love of physics. Once she graduated from Northwestern, she and her husband decided to come to Pittsburgh; a decision that eventually led her to Carnegie Mellon.
After some time teaching science classes at Bishop Canevin High School, Nair joined Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy (EPP). She began as a part-time research assistant, post-doctorate, and a part-time administrative worker. 
According to the University Lecture Series website on Nair’s lecture, “She founded the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Student Pugwash to encourage students to think about the social responsibility of science and technology.” While working as a professor in EPP, Nair developed strong relationships with students, she said she would sometimes “[advise] whole fraternities because one [student] was [her] real advisee.” She also grew close to fellow faculty members and mentors. 
Reflecting on her success at the university, she stated that “freedom and a trust in our abilities,” was what allowed her and her colleagues in her department to develop.
Nair also commented on the lessons that she learned from unexpected sources — her children and time. She credits her younger daughter with having taught her the importance of wonder “in life and in teaching.” Time, she said, was responsible for a different side of her learning: the differences between economy and ecology, cure and care, and efficiency and efficacy. Time is also responsible for what Nair described as the “only edge [professors] have over [their] students.”
Nair ended her lecture with a passage from Rainer Maria Rilke, an Austrian poet, that addresses the issue of living and learning. 
“Love the questions themselves,” he wrote in Letters to a Young Poet. “Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them.... Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually ... live along some distant day into the answer.”.

2011-04-04,CMU,India,"Both the men and women’s track and field teams for Carnegie Mellon competed in the Washington & Jefferson Invitational on Saturday, April 2.
The men’s team finished third out of the 19 competitors. Notre Dame, Penn State, and Indiana were some of the notable competitors at the invitational.
In field events, standout first-years Nathan Cheek and Zachary Erra-Hernandez won the hammer throw and the shot put, respectively.
Sophomore Graham Shore finished third in the 10-kilometer run. Sophomore Noel Titus finished second in the 200-meter dash, and first-year Tim Kikta finished sixth.
Sophomore Daniel Ching placed in two events: third in the 400-meter hurdles and sixth in the 110-meter hurdles. First-year Mike Standish finished sixth in the 400-meter hurdles.
The men’s track and field team sports a youthful and talented bunch. The age factor is key for this team, as these competitors will be around for a couple more years, continuing to improve and placing higher and higher in their respective events. This is a great benefit for the Tartans.
The women’s track and field team finished 10th out of 17 teams at the invitational.
Senior Morgan Faer placed fourth in the hammer throw and fifth in the discus throw. Senior Melissa Hwang and first-year Marissa Bynoe both placed in the triple jump: third and fourth, respectively.
Junior Luci Laffitte finished seventh in the high jump, and seniors Laura Mckee and Courtney Baker placed fourth and sixth, respectively, in the 800-meter.

2011-04-11,CMU,India,"At this very moment there are at least 30 million humans being trafficked around in the world — more than during the height of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, according to the Not For Sale Campaign. An average slave in the American South in 1850 cost the equivalent of $40,000 in today’s money; today a sex slave costs an average of $90, according to the Free the Slaves project.
While most human sex slaves are sold in South Asian countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, the impact of modern slavery is not felt only overseas. According to a conservative estimate by the U.S. government, between 14,500 and 17,500 human slaves are trafficked into the United States per year; the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children estimates that at least 100,000 American minors are the victims of commercial sexual trafficking and prostitution each year.
This semester a group of Carnegie Mellon students has gathered evidence that suggests sex slaves are being exploited in Pittsburgh. The students have approached Pittsburgh City Council asking for a new city ordinance that could regulate one major form of human trafficking in Pittsburgh out of business. The Polaris Project defines those who seek out massage parlors selling sex as ‘Johns.’ According to their website, “ ‘Johns’ who frequent brothels disguised as massage parlors make it a ‘hobby’ to buy sex and to track all massage parlors nationwide. There are more than 5,000 brothels disguised as massage parlors nationwide.”
“John’s boards” are websites where people rate and explicitly describe commercial sex. Using these sites, Jessica Dickinson Goodman, a senior ethics, history, and public policy major, and Ismail Smith-Wade-El, a senior humanities and arts major, found at least 15 Asian massage parlor establishments (AMPs) in Allegheny County that appear to sell sex. One of these establishments, which is advertised on the Adult section of backpage.com, is directly across the street from the Giant Eagle on Murray Avenue where many Carnegie Mellon students buy their groceries.
Goodman, a former member of the Polaris Project, stressed that not all AMPs sell sex. “[We are targeting] massage parlors which are brothels that have trafficking and are pretending to be massage parlors.... I think this ordinance is good for legitimate masseuses because it means they will no longer have to compete with fake masseuses and no longer have people coming in expecting sex.” Goodman also explained that an establishment soliciting commercial sex does not necessarily practice human trafficking, but that it is at a high risk of trafficking, which is characterized by force, fraud, and coercion.
Goodman submitted a model ordinance to Councilman Doug Shields that would require Pittsburgh massage parlors to be licensed to operate. This model ordinance, drafted in part by the Polaris Project, would place operational requirements on the massage parlors such as restricted hours of operation, prohibition of indecent conduct, required registration of massage practitioners, and non-obstruction of windows with things such as paint, paper, or plywood.
Goodman and Smith-Wade-El have teamed up with representatives from Carnegie Mellon International Justice Mission (IJM), Amnesty International, Life Matters, and Heinz International Development Group, as well as Pittsburgh’s Project to End Human Trafficking to advocate for those whom they believe to be trapped in sex slavery. They have organized a letter-writing campaign to the nine City Council members, with a goal of 500 letters urging the passage of a massage parlor regulatory ordinance. Councilman Shields is expected to introduce this model ordinance to City Council this Tuesday.
Smith-Wade-El has helped to gather evidence and has done footwork for the letter writing campaign. He first learned about modern slavery, or human trafficking, through involvement in his high school theater group and involvement with Free the Slaves. “We had the opportunity to meet with trafficked persons, and their stories really touched my life.... It made me think of all the things I’m lucky to have and all the things I take for granted — even if it’s just as simple as being able to walk out my door in the morning when I want to.”
“Knowing is half the battle ... once people become more aware [of human trafficking] they will start to fight and stand up to eradicate this issue,” said Jaime Turek, assistant director of the Project to End Human Trafficking in Pittsburgh. Turek has been actively supporting the Carnegie Mellon student activists’ initiative. “It is my hope that we can see this through together to the very end,” said Turek.
Amy Badiani, a senior international relations and politics major, is associated with both Amnesty International and the International Development Group. Badiani said that she is involved with the letter-writing campaign to “make a change locally in Pittsburgh that has a global impact.”
Emily Kennedy, a junior ethics, history, and public policy major, helped start a chapter of International Justice Mission at Carnegie Mellon. Kennedy said that her faith plays a big role in her involvement in the campaign. “I think that the God of the Bible does care about seeking justice for the oppressed.... He commands us not to sit around and be complacent but to act.” 
Both Kennedy and Badiani said that a serious injustice is committed against men and women who agree to come to the U.S. seeking opportunity, but instead find themselves trapped in networks of human trafficking. 
“The goal is to eliminate this particular form of sex trafficking from Pittsburgh and Allegheny County by regulating it out of existence,” said Goodman. “Hopefully this will make it easier for Harrisburg to pass a comprehensive criminal approach to sex trafficking.... In addition to a fine and being shut down, people who are selling other people for sex who don’t want to be sold — human traffickers — will be thrown in jail.”
UPDATE 4/17/11: In a statement received by The Tartan, an individual speaking as the owner of the AMP identified on Murray denied Goodman's allegations. He stated, ""We have measures in all of our operations that tightly control the activities of our therapists and explicitly prevent any sexual contact or other illegal activity whatsoever.""
Goodman and others will be tabling for their letter-writing campaign this Wednesday from 11:30–3:30 p.m. in Wean Commons in the University Center. They encourage the campus community to stop by to read the model AMP ordinance and to write a letter to City Council representatives..

2011-04-18,CMU,India,"As video games continue to become more popular, the market for a more diverse selection of games has spurred increased development of educational games. Popular titles such as Brain Age help users keep their minds sharp and hone math or logic skills. One Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), Derek Lomas, is the next promising developer of games with educational purposes. 
Lomas has a five-year fellowship with the Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research (PIER) in HCII, and strives to create efficient educational software for underprivileged youth. Together with his collaborators Dixie Ching of New York University and Jeanine Sun of the University of California at San Diego, the team recently won the $50,000 National STEM Video Game Challenge Prize for their game, NumberPower: Numbaland!. United States Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra awarded the prize to the team as part of President Obama’s “Educate to Innovate” Campaign a few weeks ago.
In a White House press release, Chopra wrote, “As the President noted earlier this month when announcing the new ARPA [Advanced Research Projects Agency] for Education, this Administration is committed to harnessing the best ideas from the public, private, academic, and philanthropic sectors to deliver an educational system that ensures we can win the future.” In an article from the Sesame Workshop, he added, “It is efforts like these that will ensure our nation’s continued economic and technological leadership well into the 21st century.”
Similar to games such as Mario Party or WarioWare, where the player can choose from several different minigames to play, Numbaland! offers five different number-based games, each designed to hone a particular math skill. The core of Lomas’ research is to improve what he calls “number sense,” which is basic intuition and understanding of mathematical concepts. “If you don’t understand what numbers mean, [it is] harder to understand why math works; you are at a loss to self-explain things to yourself. It correlates with overall high math achievement,” he said. One minigame titled “Battleship Numberline” aims to help kids understand the relationship between number magnitudes and different number forms such as decimals or fractions. In one setting, an animated battleship is positioned between two white flags marked “0” and “1.” The player then must enter in a decimal that he or she thinks represents the actual location of the ship.
“We want to systematically investigate the design decisions in the games we make. There are lots of different ways to display feedback, different ways to sequence the instructions, lots of different aesthetics, and there is even the question of whether it should be a task to begin with,” Lomas said. He and his team created several versions of their games to investigate which version helps children learn the most efficiently. In one game, they found children can improve their number sense after only 20 minutes of play. In the coming months, Lomas and his team expect to launch versions of Numbaland! for the iPad and iPod touch platforms, but currently the games run solely on computers. He hopes to put some of his prize money into making his games marketable and eventually self-sustaining.
The next step in development is to “integrate” these minigames together. To better test how people react to video games and “systematize” how data is collected, Lomas hopes that part of his prize money can be invested in better facilities, an example being a larger and more organized “video game room.” Lomas also mentioned several open research opportunities for eager students. Another facet of research involves gender discrepancies. “It’s sometimes easier to make games for boys, like our ‘Battleship Numberline,’ but we struggle to make games that are not necessarily gender-neutral, but appealing to both sexes,” he said.
This summer, Lomas and his team are going to work with underprivileged youth in after-school centers and summer programs to better understand the scaffolds of game play. He said that his life’s work was inspired by the experiences he had during an internship he had with Qualcomm in Mumbai, India. “There’s so much economic disparity and so much demand in [the] emerging middle class. There is a population the size of America that makes between $80 and $100 a month ... and the government educational systems are really poor. The missing piece is the content, as there has been very little educational content that has been proven effective.” Lomas and his team are doing their best to close that gap..

2011-04-18,CMU,India,"Carnival brought a lot of things to Carnegie Mellon University – Booth, flea markets, rides, food stalls, games with stuffed toys for winners, warm and sunny weather, girls in skirts and shorts once again, frat boys out of their houses, geeks out of the library, Pitt students from a couple of blocks away — and one comedian all the way from Kansas. So who was this guy standing on a newly built platform in a shiny peach tracksuit pretending to be all that? It was none other than Eddie Griffin.
On Friday night, Carnival got a lot more than its usual dose of fun and entertainment as comedian Eddie Griffin hit the stage. Organized by the Activities Board Comedy, this show turned out to be a memorable one. By 7 p.m. there was a long queue of students waiting to watch Griffin perform. Although Griffin reached Carnegie Mellon a little after 8 p.m, the time gap left students even more anxious and excited to watch him. After the buildup, Griffin entered holding a glass of champagne and asked for refills repeatedly throughout his performance but maintained that college students were not allowed to drink. He covered a wide range of topics, from legalizing marijuana, to the Obamas, to obituary columns. But he maintained his signature style and stuck to racist and sexist jokes, and expected the audience to take them in good humor. Griffin also involved members of the audience and made them part of his gimmick. He teased almost everyone present from the old people in the front row, to the young students at the back, to the policemen on the sides, and even the students who were standing outside the tent hoping to catch a glimpse of his performance. But it made the audience crack up, and that was the entire point of the show. Dan Ladenheim, an information systems and human computer interaction major and an organizer of the show, said, “I think his stand-up is great, and I thought it was hilarious the way he interacted with the audience. You’re never supposed to sit in the front of a comedy show unless you’re prepared to get made fun of, and Eddie proved that true.”
So what did Carnegie Mellon think of his performance? Michelle Berman, a sophomore economics and statistics major, said, “Although I haven’t seen Eddie Griffin perform previously, I was excited as many people have told me previously that he is hysterical.” But with the kind of jokes Griffin made, some students booed, and even cringed. As Berman said, “I enjoyed the show; however at times I was concerned as to what more conservative people in the crowd were feeling.” On a similar vein, Aashish Jindia, a first-year computer science major, said, “Griffin was really funny in the beginning and I felt as if the show was a lot of fun. But then he got kind of drunk and started cracking jokes that were not in good humor.” Many people in the crowd felt that he should have left once he hit the one hour mark, as his jokes became far too crude toward the end.
Ladenheim said, “The content of the show was definitely for mature audiences, but we were prepared for that. All alumni who got tickets were told about this in advance, the onsite line management crew were looking for kids to warn their parents, and on top of that we printed and laminated about 20 warning signs. I don’t believe the content was overall a bad thing. It’s a part of Eddie’s personality and his culture, which is everything in a comedian. And in the end, it’s important to remember that this is a comedy show. Everything is really just a joke.”
Aditya Goyal, a sophomore statistics and economics major, said, “I think it was a good change to see an artist like Eddie Griffin come to CMU — [it was] something unique after last year. Unfortunately, however, keeping with the crowd, it felt like he may have upset a large audience of both parents, elderly, and also the LGBT community. The show could have been better if there was more sensitivity both to CMU administration and possible members of the crowd present, but on the whole it was a good show.”
Landenheim said, “We made a good choice to bring Eddie Griffin. He actually wasn’t our first choice, but I’m still really happy we got him. He has a very different style than some comedians we’ve had in the past such as Michael and Michael, and it’s important to bring these different styles so you can appeal to all audiences. Obviously in a school of over 5,000 people you can’t please everyone with one show, so we try our best to do that over a few years.”
Ladenheim added, “I was happy that we were able to fill the tent up, but to be honest, the comedy show is always that packed. It’s more important to us that people enjoy the show.”.

2011-04-25,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon’s ultimate Frisbee team competed in the Western Pennsylvania Conference Tournament this past weekend. Going in as the third seed, the team successfully advanced to the Ohio Valley Regionals.
“Our goal this conference was to hold seed to continue onto regionals next weekend,” said senior Daniel Kotovsky.
The A team, Mr. Yuk, finished strong on Saturday with wins over West Virginia University, Edinboro University, and Shippensburg University.
“We were able to soundly beat two teams lower than us, bringing us to the most important game of the weekend against Shippensburg — who play on par with us and defeated us last year in the game to go to regionals,” Kotovsky said.
This year will be the first time in five years that Carnegie Mellon has made it to regionals. Mr. Yuk hopes to show how much the Frisbee program has improved over the years.
“We only need to win one more game tomorrow [Sunday] ... and we’ll be spending our next weekend on the beautiful fields of Manheim, Pa., playing against the highest-caliber teams of the Pennsylvania and Ohio region,” Kotovsky said after the team’s three wins on Saturday.
It’s a Carnegie Mellon ultimate Frisbee tradition after every win to give a hard hat to the player who worked the hardest during the game, and the player gets to place a Mr. Yuk sticker on it. The last three winners were graduate student Robbie Paolini, graduate student Akshay Krishnamurthy, and senior Anthony Rice.
The team lost to the University of Pittsburgh on Sunday, but defeated Indiana University of Pennsylvania 13–6 to clinch a third-place finish in the tournament and a spot in the regional tournament..

2011-04-25,CMU,India,"Although the fickle weather of the last couple of weeks might suggest otherwise, summer is, in fact, only a few weeks away. Most students will probably pack up all of their belongings and either put them in storage or bring them home, only to bring everything back a few months later. If you don’t have plans back in your hometown yet, consider staying in Pittsburgh for the summer.
Many students leave Pittsburgh during the summer simply because they do not have a place to live; if students reside on campus, they must vacate their dorm buildings during the summer. However, there are multiple options for summer housing for students.
Carnegie Mellon students are eligible for summer housing through Housing and Dining Services. Students can apply for single or double rooms in Donner House or for off-campus apartments in Fairfax Apartments or Webster Hall. Obtaining summer housing through Carnegie Mellon serves as a convenient option for many. “It was easy to find and it was close to where I was working, and the furniture was already provided,” said Lianne Cohen, a junior biological sciences major who lived in Fairfax Apartments while doing research in Mellon Institute last summer. “It was a nice apartment with a good location, and it had air conditioning, which was a big plus in Pittsburgh over the summer.”
Although summer housing through the university is convenient, there are some downsides. “It was more expensive than if I had looked for a sublet,” Cohen said. “Moving into the apartment was also difficult. I lived in Morewood during the year, but I went home for two and a half weeks, so I put stuff into CMU storage. I had to contact the housefellow and make separate arrangements to get my stuff out, which was inconvenient.” Students can apply for housing through the Summer Housing 2011 application available on the Housing and Dining website. Applications should be submitted to the Housing and Dining Office in Morewood Gardens by Friday, May 6.
Another on-campus alternative is Greek housing: Many fraternities and sororities offer sublets over the summer. This option is often a cheaper alternative than campus housing, with the rent averaging about $100 per month. “I lived here last summer in [Alpha Chi Omega],” said Emily Forney, a junior philosophy major who worked for the university last summer. “I know that it was super cheap for sisters and non-Greek women to live in the house and a great social experience.” Students who wish to live in Greek housing can visit a chapter’s website and e-mail the house manager about room availability.
Students can also sublet off-campus apartments. “It tends to be easy to find sublets in Pittsburgh. Most of the people you know who live off-campus are looking for students to rent their rooms during the summer,” said Ellen Obenshain, a sophomore civil and environmental engineering major who worked at the university last summer. “I got my room on Wilkins from a friend of a friend of a friend just by asking around.”
There are also several websites that serve as resources for students staying in Pittsburgh over the summer. One useful website is Padmapper.com; this Web application aggregates apartment listings from Craigslist, Apartments.com, and other sources, and compiles them into Google Maps. Users can then filter the listings by specifications such as price, location, and number of bedrooms. “I used Padmapper to find my apartment for this summer. It was a total lifesaver,” said Jessica Virdo, a junior computer science major who is working and taking classes at the university this summer.
Another newer method of searching for housing is through miscmarket.org, a website developed by Carnegie Mellon students for students. As Alex Price, a sophomore business major who worked with the team that developed miscmarket.org, explained, “Miscmarket is like an organized Craigslist for college students. [It’s] super safe and super easy.” In order to join the website, users must register with their Andrew e-mail addresses; the website has a section dedicated to housing that includes listings for summer sublets.
Once you have gained housing for the summer, you can start planning what you can do while in Pittsburgh. The city is full of fun events and activities during the summer — art festivals, food festivals, and film festivals abound, along with other fun activities.
Kicking off the string of summer festivals in Pittsburgh is the Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival, which takes place May 6–15. The festival, which first began in 2006, will show 26 different films in the Regent Square Theater in Regent Square, Harris Theater downtown, and the Melwood Screening Room in Oakland. The festival will begin with an Opening Night Gala in the William Penn Hotel, featuring a variety of dance and musical performances and Asian food. The opening night film, which will be shown at Harris Theater, is [ITAL]I Am[ITAL], a movie about modern Indian society; tickets for the movie are $15 in advance. As the organization’s website explained, “Silk Screen hopes to become one the best festivals of its kind in the world, putting Pittsburgh on the world cultural map for Asian culture, particularly Asian films.”
From June 3 to 12, the 52nd annual Three Rivers Art Festival will take place in downtown Pittsburgh. The self-described “region’s largest multidisciplinary showcase of visual art and performing arts” has cumulatively featured over 10,000 visual and performing artists over the years. Lauren Milisits, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering and computer science, attended the festival last year and commended it, saying, “There were a lot of vendors. It was something different.”
Cohen, who also attended the festival, said, “[It was] nice to see all the booths because there’s a lot of different types of art. It’s really different from other things in Pittsburgh.” Last year’s festival included music performances, art workshops and exhibits, an indie craft market, free yoga lessons, and poetry readings. The musicians booked so far for this year’s festival include Brandi Carlile, 14-time Grammy Award winner Ricky Skaggs, and Pittsburgh’s own Formula412.
To celebrate Independence Day, attend the Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta, a three-day event from July 2 to 4, that includes a sand sculpture contests, a boat race, a “Circus Spectacle,” and a grand fireworks display on the Fourth of July. “The fireworks were really nice,” Cohen said. “We got there early and got great seats, so it was really cool. There were so many people in Point [State] Park that it was hard getting out and finding buses. But they had fair foods and stuff on both sides of the river, and it was really fun.”
Aside from the festivals, there are also many events that occur regularly throughout the summer. The Dollar Bank Cinema in the Park presents free movie screenings in parks throughout Pittsburgh, with showings on Flagstaff Hill on both Wednesdays and Sundays at dusk. The movie showings are “nice because they played a lot of popular movies,” Cohen said. “You bring your own blanket and it’s a fun thing to do.”
Another regular event is the Mellon Square Summer Concert Series; go downtown around lunchtime on Thursdays and listen to local bands entertain the city at Mellon Square.
Even if you don’t feel like going far from campus, there are still plenty of ways to stay entertained that are conveniently located. Virdo worked and took classes in Pittsburgh last summer, and said, “I took day trips to the museums and stuff with my friends. Carnegie Mellon has a lot of events during the summer too. Some student organizations still meet during the summer, like KGB. They had meetings once a week and had events on campus on Fridays and Saturdays.” 
She continued, “There were interesting talks from visiting scholars and lecturers, and grad student defenses and stuff over the summer. You just have to look for anything that is relevant to your field — most of the standard stuff is still going on.”
Although Carnegie Mellon students spend plenty of time in Pittsburgh during the winter, they should also consider spending their summer here — they might be surprised by all this city has to offer.
Editor's Note: This article was modified on 4/25/11 to clarify ticket prices for the Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival. The article originally stated that tickets for the event were $15; in fact, only tickets to the opening night film are $15..

2011-08-21,CMU,India,"As you enter Carnegie Mellon, most of you will be ready to embrace college life and the freedom that comes along with it. Now you will be able to stay out until 4 a.m. on a school night, be excused from the routine of waking up early, and be exempt from doing your old chores — except your laundry. Perhaps one of the most thrilling freedoms of all is that you now have the decision-making power to eat anything you want. But with all of the choices Carnegie Mellon provides, this freedom might become a bit overwhelming. We’ve provided you with a head start to where the best food is available on campus.
The Exchange (formerly known as Ginger’s)
Located on the ground floor of Posner Hall, home of the Tepper School of Business, this place is an absolute delight. It not only provides the best sandwiches on campus, but it also allows you to create your own. Other than sandwiches, you can also choose from the daily meal — pastas, hot soups, and the like — and grab a brownie or a cookie at the counter. Jimmy Murphy, a sophomore math major, is a die-hard fan of The Exchange. He said, “The food does not carry any of the negative connotations that usually come with campus food.” And it’s not only the food that keeps him coming back to this place. Murphy added, “The people working there are happy and enthusiastic, making the whole place a great environment to eat in. Additionally, because of their location, the food is named after business concepts or places.” Murphy suggests trying the “Free Market” and the “Wall Street” sandwiches.
Hannah Kumar, a sophomore psychology and social and decision sciences double major, also rates The Exchange one of the best places to eat on campus. Although she considers the seating space inadequate for the crowd this place attracts, Kumar gave a helpful tip: “If you want to try something new but don’t know what to order, ask for ‘something good’ and the guys there will whip up something random that’s usually delicious.” She’s also experimented and has come up with a recipe for the perfect sandwich: “chicken salad, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, pickles, and spicy mustard.” Trisha Ambe, a materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major, considers the food to be fresh and tasty — plus, as a true Tartan would say, “It’s not far from the library!”
Tazza D’Oro
Located in the Gates Center, Tazza D’Oro at the R-Bar Café provides the freshest and healthiest eating options on campus. With a great variety of paninis, pastries, and desserts to choose from, Tazza D’Oro is not for those looking for a greasy meal, but it is delicious and satisfying. Each panini comes with a side of mixed greens on the plate, and you could finish off that meal with a “to-die-for apple tart,” as Michelle Berman, a junior economics and statistics double major, described it. “D’Oro caters to both vegetarians and meat lovers. It is definitely the best place to eat on campus as the interior of Gates is very modern and minimalist, providing a quiet and relaxing environment,” Kumar said. 
Laura Schraff, a junior computer science major, loves Tazza D’Oro; she said, “It’s not only because Gates is my home building — the food is delicious and healthier than probably anywhere else on campus. Also, the people there are so energetic and super nice. They’ve got great paninis for lunch and some of the best baked goods on campus. It’s also a great environment to casually hang out and study with friends.” Michelle Lin, a sophomore social and decision sciences and economics major, couldn’t agree more: “I swear you can’t go wrong with anything you order there. Whether you’re craving something savory or sweet, it will be there and it will be delicious.”
La Prima Espresso
It’s not exactly a conventional breakfast or lunch location, but La Prima, located on the fifth floor of Wean Hall, remains a great place to get food for those on the go. Available in-house are fresh baked goods like croissants, cinnamon rolls, desserts, breads, and bagels with cream cheese, and some quick meals like focaccia sandwiches. From a vegetarian’s perspective, two highly recommended options are the almond croissants and the tomato and mozzarella half-sandwiches with pesto. Lin recommends grabbing a cup of coffee from La Prima in between classes. And if plain coffee is not your deal, you need not worry. The menu also includes juice, iced tea, lattes, and even double mocha cappuccinos.
Evgefstos!
Meat lovers beware, but vegans and vegetarians are welcome to falafel, wraps, flatbread pizzas, and salads. The best side option: whole-wheat pita bread with artichoke and spinach dip. Sounds healthy? It’s delicious as well.
Pasta Villagio
Located close to Evgefstos!, on the second floor of the University Center, this is the best place to get pasta on campus, and what’s more, you can create your own. The only thing the food lacks, at least to some taste buds, is salt, so be sure to grab a few packets on your way out.
Spinning Salads
If you felt sick after eating the Schatz buffet, took only a bite of your Skibo pasta, consumed a fat-filled burger at the City Grill, and felt heartburn after chowing down some chicken wings at the Tartans Pavilion, then maybe it’s time to visit Spinning Salads in the University Center. Providing a bowl full of greens with a variety of vegetables, proteins, and salad dressings to choose from, this salad place makes even healthy food tasty.
Maggie Murph Café
This café in Hunt Library has provided fuel to many all-nighters and saved many students from failing their exams. It also deserves mention for its quick-pick sandwiches, sushi rolls, and especially bagels — choices include garlic, whole wheat, multi grain, cinnamon, and everything, along with cream cheese. Some students wander over to the library just for the bagels.
The Underground
Located in the basement of Morewood Gardens, the Underground provides free coffee during finals, when it stays open 24 hours (otherwise closing at 11 p.m.). Still, some like the Underground for other reasons; Berman insists that the grilled cheese sandwich with fries makes for a great stress-busting meal.
—
There are still many more campus places worthy of mention like Taste of India; the Carnegie Mellon Café, which provides breakfast all day long; and Entropy+, Carnegie Mellon’s own convenience store that offers frozen food, fresh items like fruits and salads, sweets, juices, and those savior energy bars.
If you get tired of campus food, put your DineX to good use and walk down to Subway on South Craig Street, or order a Vocelli pizza to your dorm. Murphy believes that most places on campus get old after a while, but with so many additional eating options available in Oakland, you should always be able to find something delicious to eat..

2011-08-29,CMU,India,"CulinArt is teaming up with Housing and Dining Services to plan a series of new events to officially begin the Fall 2011 semester.
They have scheduled three events during the month of September that are “like nothing ever done by any Carnegie Mellon food service vendor in history,” said Shelby Cole, the Student Activities director of CulinArt.
CulinArt has planned a taste testing/vendor showcase, a Luau buffet, and a tailgate party.
To start the semester off, CulinArt is hosting a “Welcome Back Vendor Showcase” on Aug. 31 at the Merson Courtyard of the University Center. In this free event, students and staff will get to taste 14 new products from CulinArt vendors and vote on their favorite ones. The top three most popular products will then be sold in Entropy+ for a limited time. Vendors that are attending the event include Pepsi, The Chico Bakery, Pepperidge Farms, and a few others.
CulinArt is also hosting a “Welcome Back Luau Theme Night” on Sept. 7. This event will be co-sponsored by the Asian American and Pacific Islander Graduate Student Caucus. It is a buffet-style event that will feature luau-themed dishes. The main dish of the evening will be a traditional roast pig.
“When you’re stuck on a meal plan and don’t always have your own kitchen, campus food can get pretty boring, so it’s good to be aware of whatever variety is available,” said Corinne Rockoff, sophomore psychology major and Mudge mentor. “The Luau night definitely sounds different from the usual CulinArt food.”
The Luau Night is also being entered into a National Association of College and Unversity Food Services (NACUFS) special events competition, competing for the Loyal E. Horton Dining Award. According to the NACUFS website, the award “celebrates exemplary menus, presentations, special event planning, and new dining concepts.” NACUFS frequently has competitions among schools; past winners include Iowa State University, Brock University, and Washington and Lee University. Just last year, Carnegie Mellon chef Aldo Ramirez participated in a NACUFS Culinary Competition and won a bronze medal.
The final event is a “Tailgate Party” taking place on Sept. 25, which will be hosted in the Tartans Pavilion.
In traditional tailgate fashion, the event was planned to coincide with the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Indianapolis Colts football game.
It will feature a live performance by the band Julia McGinley, a student group, which frequently performs at Carnegie Mellon and won the 2010 Carnegie Mellon Battle of the Bands. The Tailgate Party will also feature prizes, giveaways, and “food specials for both block and non-block students,” according to a press release.
When asked about CulinArt events, Max Illfelder, a sophomore computer science major, said he “had not heard about any of the previous CulinArt events” as “the events have not been very well publicized,” but likes the idea of some of the new events that are to come.
Specifically, he said he is excited for the Vendor Showcase, as it will provide an opportunity to see new products..

2011-09-12,CMU,India,"With his $265 million gift to Carnegie Mellon, trustee William Dietrich has provided not only the largest donation in the university’s history, but also one of the largest private donations to higher education anywhere.
Dietrich’s gift is nearly five times larger than the $55 million given by David and Marlene Tepper in 2004, which until last Wednesday had been the largest single gift to Carnegie Mellon in the university’s history.
“This gift is truly historic; that’s not just talk,” University President Jared Cohon said at Wednesday’s ceremony honoring Dietrich’s bequest. “Even taking into account the time value of money, this gift is larger than the one Andrew Carnegie made in establishing this university in 1900.”
In a letter dated Nov. 15, 1900, Carnegie announced his intention to provide an initial $1 million in bonds to create a technical school in Pittsburgh. Inflation data from Yale University economist Robert Shiller and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that Carnegie’s grant would be worth approximately $28.9 million today. Carnegie made further donations to the school multiple times.
Also referencing the university’s other namesake, Cohon said that Dietrich’s donation “will have lasting effect in the way the Mellon family’s generosity has had on this university over many, many decades.” Among other gifts, members of the Mellon family founded the eponymous Mellon Institute in 1913, donated $10 million to establish what is now known as the Heinz College in 1968, and left the university a $43 million bequest in 1999.
Other recent gifts to Carnegie Mellon include $30 million from an anonymous donor in 2008, $22 million from the Heinz Endowments in 2007, and $20 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2004.
Looking outside the university, information released by Carnegie Mellon and reported in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette estimated that Dietrich’s bequest was the 14th largest gift by an individual to higher education worldwide and among the top 10 in the United States. Taking personal and family foundations into account, The Chronicle of Higher Education placed Dietrich’s donation as 11th in the United States among single-university grants and 14th worldwide.
Nationally, the biggest private donation to a single university went to the California Institute of Technology in 2001. Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty gifted $600 million in cash and stock to Caltech to be paid out over a 10-year period, The Chronicle reported.
In 1997, the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering was established in Needham, Mass., with a $460 million grant in cash from the F.W. Olin Foundation. Adjusted for inflation, these two gifts would be worth $765 million and $648 million, respectively, in 2011 dollars.
Nine other U.S. universities have been the beneficiaries of private donations of more than $250 million in the last 10 years, according to The Chronicle.
International universities have also received headlining donations. The Anil Agarwal Foundation presented the largest higher education gift in the world, $1 billion cash, to establish Vedanta University in India in 2006. Taiwanese businessman Terry Gou gave $454.5 million to the National Taiwan University in 2007 for cancer research..

2011-09-12,CMU,India,"Under mostly cloudy skies and in view of a Fence painted in stars and stripes, around 100 members of the Carnegie Mellon community came together Sunday afternoon to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States.
The 45-minute program on the CFA patio began with a selection from Aaron Copland’s “Fanfare for the Common Man,” played by the Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble. After the musical introduction, University President Jared Cohon opened the ceremony with some brief remarks.
Calling Sept. 11, “a day of trauma for this country [and] a day which many have called the saddest day in our history,” Cohon contrasted the horror of 9/11 with the heroism of first responders in New York, the bravery of passengers on the crashed Flight 93, and the compassion Americans showed each other in the days following the attacks. At Carnegie Mellon, he said, “the response of students was something we were all proud of.”
As the immediateness of 9/11 wore off, Cohon said he was disappointed in the way American society “closed in” against certain groups of people. In a university context, he mentioned that visas for international students, even 10 years later, are still more difficult to get. “It would be a shame ... if one of the long-term effects is if we lose openness and diversity,” he summarized.
Seven Carnegie Mellon alumni lost their lives in the 2001 terror attacks. Cohon read their names, and English department professor Jim Daniels recited “Us, Now,” the poem he wrote in their honor. The poem is printed on a plaque in front of Carnegie Mellon’s 9/11 Memorial Tree on the hill next to the tennis courts. Currently, the plaque is also decorated with roses left by the members of the university’s alumni association board.
After Cohon’s remarks, the Carnegie Mellon choir sang “America the Beautiful” and a Hebrew version of Psalm 133. The text’s English translation was read by sophomore biology major Angela Yi. Junior social and decision sciences student Archit Kumar read a Hindu prayer for peace in Sanskrit and English. Steven Pepin, a junior in mechanical engineering, gave the Prayer of St. Francis, which was concluded with a choral “amen.”
The only applause of the somber but brisk gathering occurred when Cohon asked the crowd to recognize the event’s planners and participants. The ceremony then concluded at the Memorial Tree, where Cohon led a moment of silence.
The event was organized by the Student Life Office and School of Music professor Robert Page, with participation from campus musical ensembles and students of faith contacted by Student Life, said Student Life coordinator Ken Lawson. “There’s no prescriptive way that a group of any students ... are going to look to think about this day,” said Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, noting that Sunday’s ceremony was designed to bring the community together but to allow individual participants to reflect and react in their own ways.
Pepin, president of the Catholic Newman Club, was one such participant. A fourth-grader at the time of the 9/11 attacks, he said after the ceremony that he had been thinking about the perspective that today’s kids would have toward the events of 10 years ago. “They probably weren’t even alive,” he said. “Even I didn’t understand the repercussions at the time.” He also hoped that the commemoration would encourage people to remember the lessons of 9/11 throughout the year, not just on the attacks’ anniversary.
Despite the societal polarization and divisiveness that Cohon referred to in his speech, Pepin and Casalegno both thought that Carnegie Mellon had remained a welcoming environment for students of all backgrounds.“It’s a very friendly place. There’s always people smiling and making you feel welcome,” Pepin said.
Casalegno recalled a vigil held at the Fence in the wake of the November 2008 terrorist bombings in Mumbai, India, at which a Pakistani student spoke about her fear of being alienated because of her background. “The way she was received by the campus was very touching to me,” Casalegno said. “I’ve been touched on many occasions ... by the openness of our students.”
Other facets of Carnegie Mellon’s 9/11 commemoration included a panel discussion Friday with members of the local media, and bagpipers who played on the Cut Sunday morning at the times when hijacked planes struck New York, Washington, and western Pennsylvania..

Exploring Impossible Spaces: Practical Illusions in Virtual Reality
Wednesday, Sept. 28 at 4 p.m.
Mauldin Auditorium (Newell-Simon Hall 1305)
Postdoctoral research associate Evan Suma from the University of Southern California will describe experiments with “impossible spaces,” environments that leverage perceptual illusions to relax physical space constraints when walking naturally through a virtual world.
His lecture will begin with an overview of the topic, discussing how natural locomotion is one of the fundamental challenges for immersive virtual environments. His study’s results have shown that these illusions can successfully fool the senses into believing there is an expansive virtual environment despite being in a considerably smaller physical workspace.
Mahatma Gandhi Birthday Celebration
Sunday, Oct. 2 at 3 p.m.
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium, University of Pittsburgh
This Sunday is Gandhi Jayanti, the national holiday celebrated in India to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday. This event will celebrate Gandhi as a global humanitarian figure with cultural performances, interfaith presentations, and a talk by Uma Majmudar, a Gandhian researcher and published author. Majmudar’s lecture will be titled “Gandhi’s Legacy of ‘Satyagraha’ in the Modern World.” In her talk, she will answer such questions as what “Satyagraha” is, whether it involves passive resistance or civil disobedience, how Gandhi coined this term, and what it meant to him.
Majmudar’s most famous work is her novel Gandhi’s Pilgrimage of Faith: From Darkness to Light..

2011-10-03,CMU,India,"Most of my free time is spent reading music blogs and talking about new music with the people around me. Recently, the topic of buzzbands has been coming up pretty often. My friends are sick of reading about buzzbands, sick of hearing about them on Pitchfork, sick of obsessing over them and then forgetting them a month later. It’s a weird, endless cycle of mediocre bands gaining temporary fans and then being replaced almost immediately by some newer, cooler band.
But is that really what’s going on here? I’m not convinced that all buzzbands are so bad. In fact, I think there are some great bands out there that are being unjustly overlooked and forgotten as a result of their status as “buzzbands.” I’ve seen countless articles online mocking buzzbands and even providing step-by-step guides to becoming a buzzband. I’ve seen writers try to undermine hipster media by publishing scathing satires of what it means to be a buzzband. But this just seems silly to me. A lot of bands that were once classified under the apparently reputation-ruining label of “buzzbands” are actually talented musicians putting out quality music.
Buzzbands have a bad reputation because people make unwarranted assumptions about them. People assume they aren’t actually very talented or that they won’t matter in a month, so why bother? But the reality is that buzzbands do more than occupy the blogosphere for a few weeks. They can use their newfound fan base as a way to get noticed by record labels, which puts them in a position to grow as musicians and put out more music with better production and professional promotion. Bands like Girls, Twin Sister, Real Estate, and Neon Indian are prime examples of genuinely talented artists who have continued making quality music despite their previous status as buzzbands. So next time you find yourself rolling your eyes at some new, hip artist on Pitchfork, stop and give them a fair listen instead of immediately writing them off. You might be surprised..

2011-10-03,CMU,India,"Throughout the past week, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff commemorated Gandhi Jayanti, a national Indian holiday that signifies the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, who was considered to be India’s leader during its independence movement through his promotion of non-violent means of protest.
Multicultural student organizations OM and Mayur-SASA presented a series of events with themes rooted in awareness, service, and reflection to honor Gandhi’s legacy. These events culminated in a “Mahatma Gandhi Birthday Celebration” in the University of Pittsburgh’s Frick Fine Arts Auditorium last Sunday. The celebration was sponsored by the Alliance for Humanitarian Initiatives, Nonviolence, and Spiritual Advancement (AHINSA), Carnegie Mellon, and other various organizations. Sunday’s event included interfaith presentations, cultural performances, and a lecture titled “Gandhi’s Legacy of ‘Satyagraha’ in the Modern World” by Uma Majmundar, a published author and Gandhian researcher. Performances consisted of a patriotic Indian song sung by students Alimpon Sinha, a first-year computer science major, and Neel Nadkarni, a sophomore business administration major.
M. Shernell Smith, coordinator of student development, also spoke at the celebration. She noted that “the practices and principles of Gandhi had an impact on other movements, such as the direct influence that he had on Martin Luther King Jr. and the American civil rights movement.” Smith called the series of Gandhi Jayanti events, which she helped to plan, “vital to the vibrancy of our campus community in regard to cultural awareness.” She also said that the point of these events is “about empowering our students to engage as well. It is about meaningful dialogue and engagement.”
In addition to the lecture by Majmundar, OM hosted a tree planting service initiative, “Planting the Seeds of Non-Violence,” in Frick Park. About 20 OM members participated, and, in conjunction with Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy members, they planted about 50 trees.
“The purpose of this service initiative was to support the positive values that Gandhi stood for, including peace and non-violence,” said Vishalsai Daswani, the vice president of OM and a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major.
Trisha Ambe, a sophomore materials science and biomedical engineering double major, is a part of hOMies, OM’s planning committee, and participated in the tree planting initiative. “It was cold and rainy but still a rewarding experience and good bonding activity,” Ambe said.
Ambe, who considers Mahatma Gandhi to be her personal role model and hero, also pointed out, “This service event and the other events for Gandhi Jayanti successfully made students aware of Gandhi’s teachings, which is why it is important to continue to celebrate his life.”
Other events held throughout the week included passing out slices of a “Happy Birthday Gandhi” cake and “Be the Change” wristbands, as well as selling Gandhi T-shirts. CulinArt also stepped in to celebrate, adding “Gandhi specials” on menus throughout campus dining locations.
Archit Kumar, a junior information systems and social and decision sciences double major and OM president, noted the importance of commemorating Gandhi. “His message is so strong and powerful that we must take moments of our day to celebrate with the CMU community the power of non-violence and perseverance,” he said.
The Gandhi Jayanti events seemed to have an effect on students. Senior economics and Chinese double major Crystal Wray saw the “Be the Change” wristbands and said that it inspired her to try to become a more selfless person. “I want to get more involved with volunteer work,” she said. “Remembering Gandhi and everything he stood for simply empowered me to take more time to think about others.”
OM puts on a variety of other events throughout the year; the next upcoming event is the Diwali Garba on Oct. 14 in St. Nicholas’ Greek Orthodox Church..

2011-10-10,CMU,India,"Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., passed away this past Wednesday in his family home in Palo Alto, Calif., seven years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. According to a statement released by his family, Jobs died peacefully. He was 56.
He was born in 1955 to a Syrian graduate student and his American girlfriend. Jobs was put up for adoption and raised by Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, Calif. He enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Ore., but dropped out after just one semester. He continued to audit courses, including a calligraphy course that Jobs claimed influenced the typefaces that would eventually exist in the Mac.
A spiritually motivated visit to India and a short stint with Atari eventually led Jobs to co-found Apple Inc. in 1976 at the age of 21. One year and one computer design later, Apple released the Apple II, which “reflected the first stirrings of Jobs’ keen instincts” with its “emphasis on ease of use and its stylish case design,” according to Time magazine, and eventually became one of the first highly successful mass-produced home computers. After an industry-wide sales slump in 1984, the former CEO of Pepsi-Cola and then-president of Apple John Sculley stripped Jobs of his decision-making powers, which eventually led to his resignation in 1985.
Jobs made use of his time away from Apple by founding NeXT Computer, a company that focused on computer workstations for higher education and business markets, as well as buying the animated film studio that would eventually become Pixar. Jobs referred to this period with Pixar and NeXT as “one of the most creative periods of my life” during his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University.
After rejoining the Apple team in 1996, Jobs officially became CEO of Apple Inc. in 2000. Since then, Apple has become one of the leading consumer-electronics companies with its widely successful iMac and MacBook systems. It has transformed the way popular culture listens to music (through the iPod) while also influencing the way it communicates and shares information (through the iPhone and iPad). 
Speaking about Jobs’ success, Time noted that “some leaders push innovations by being good at the big picture. Others do so by mastering details. Jobs did both, relentlessly.”
The loss of Steve Jobs has been felt across campus at Carnegie Mellon. “I elected this field specifically because of Steve Jobs,” Ben Nimmons, a master’s student in human-computer interaction (HCI), said in an email. “When asked why I was quitting my previous work and going back to school, I explained my interest ... as simply as I could: ‘I want to learn to do what Steve Jobs does naturally.’ ”
Katie Rivard, another master’s student in HCI, reflected on her childhood and Jobs’ impact on it. “One of my favorite childhood photos is of my sister and I at the computer table in our living room,” she explained in an email. “My sister is hamming it up for the camera; I’m focused on the screen. The computer is a Macintosh SE.”
A private funeral service was held last Friday. Jobs is survived by his wife, Laurene, and their two daughters and son, as well as one other child from a former relationship..

2011-10-10,CMU,India,"This weekend I went to what’s known as a “date auction”: Attendees bid on a guy or girl, and the proceeds go to charity. In this case, two of Carnegie Mellon’s great a cappella groups, Counterpoint and the Originals, auctioned off select members to the highest bidder. Out of the five guys and five girls auctioned, I don't think a single date will occur, so it obviously wasn’t done in all seriousness. And the people seemed really nice — it’s nothing about them. I just think that date auctions are an unwise way to raise money.
Let me set the scene. We met in The Underground, which coincidentally makes me think of a holding tank for slaves, but at least the singers looked dapper in their outfits. Of the 50-ish people there, most seemed to be unintentionally present — playing pool, eating with friends — although many were attentive. I was creepily off to the side taking notes. Several gaggles of girls were there to cheer on their friends. I think one girl’s dad was even there with a video camera, so now she can remember her auction forever.
The performances were captivating, so to speak. I don’t think the songs were intentionally self-referential, but when the girls sang about how there was a “Shark in the Water” and the guys sang (a fantastic rendition of) “Teenage Dream,” I did wonder. Pitches were full of innuendo and domination (“our next item up for bid”), and the bidding was about what you would expect from college budgets: a pretty consistent $25 per person price, except when one bidding war over a girl with a ring on her finger forced her significant other into valuing his girl at an awkwardly specific $38.
Now you may say to me, “Will, why ask someone on a consensual date when you can just pay for it at a date auction?” 
And I admit, now that Craigslist took down its “Erotic Services” section, there is more demand. But for one thing, think of the children! No, really, if the relationship worked out, it would be like the end of a bad MasterCard commercial: “Falling in love with my wife: priceless.... Well, actually it was $46.” If date auctions are harmless because they’re so slightly attended that they’re not really able to auction dates, then it seems silly to justify an event by its ineffectiveness.
At some point, I realized that there’s another comparison that can be made besides slavery and prostitution. Date auctions don’t only have you paying for sexual attention, they also have you paying for sexual attention. It’s like the ads on Google. (Now I see the Carnegie Mellon nods.) Companies bid for their favorite keywords. Even if they win, all they get is to show off to people who already see a lot of ads.
In connection with that, I will say that there was a lot of click fraud at the auction. Most people had arranged for their friends to buy them. One cute girl who actually tried to bid on a few guys kept getting shut down by artificially high prices. I thought about walking up to a girl at the end and saying, “Your AdWords were too pricey for me,” but I thought that even in my suavest tone it wouldn't land me a date.
There are alternative fundraisers to date auctions. Carnegie Mellon’s Donut Dash looks inventive and awesome, for instance. Even that entrepreneurship group that sold Indian food to win a class contest was working off of a cool idea. But date auctions encourage lighthearted enactments of human ownership, Facebook comments like “buyyyyy meeeeeeeeee (two people liked this).” One poor girl actually wrote that, and it reminded me of Gandalf the Grey’s cry as he fell down that chasm fighting the Balrog, never to be seen again. Except she would do it in perfect C. Next time we see that girl, she'll probably be like, “I’m Gandalf the White, suckers!” 
Now that would make a great fundraiser..

2011-10-17,CMU,India,"The National Football League season has had an unpredictable start this year. Before the season started, if you had told me that at week five the Detroit Lions would be undefeated, the Philadelphia Eagles would be pretty much eliminated from the playoffs, and that the San Francisco 49ers would have a winning record, I would have thought you had amnesia and thought it was the ’90s again.
But alas, Lions quarterback Matt Stafford is an MVP candidate, leading his team to a ferocious season’s start. Sure, the Lions faced some of the bottom-tier teams, such as the Kansas City Chiefs and the Minnesota Vikings. But they did beat the up-and-coming Tampa Bay Buccaneers on opening day, and then the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears in weeks four and five.
The deadly combination of Stafford and wide receiver Calvin Johnson has made the Lions’ offense very potent. Stafford boasts the sixth-best passer rating (101.4), third-most touchdowns thrown (13), and eighth-most yards per game (287) in the league. He is a leading candidate in the early MVP race along with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Green Bay Packers quarterback  Aaron Rodgers. Combine those numbers with Johnson’s receiving statistics, who’s been the best receiver in the NFL this season. He has four more touchdown receptions than any other receiver at nine, and is fifth in receiving yards with 451.
The young Lions team was bound to break out of its shell eventually, with the dynamic offense backed by a powerful defense led by the monstrous defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. The Detroit fans deserve some success for their football franchise after what seems like an abysmal last two decades, and a winless season in 2008.
What really has me puzzled is the success of the 49ers. Niners, you had your prosperous years with Joe Montana and Steve Young through the ’80s and ’90s; let someone else have a turn. 
But lo and behold, quarterback Alex Smith has led this squad to an unforeseen start. Through the balance of their run game, with Frank Gore, and a passing game with wide receivers Michael Crabtree and Josh Morgan, and tight end Vernon Davis, they have been able to attack some of the league’s top defenses in a variety of ways. They have downed the Buccaneers, the surprisingly awful Philadelphia Eagles (who I will get to), and the Cowboys. But with injuries to starting nose guard Isaac Sopoaga and Morgan in last week’s game against the Bucs, only time will tell if they can maintain this hot start.
Now to the topic that will please the vast majority of NFL fans, with the small minority being their fans: the unpredicted mediocrity of the Eagles. After having the most successful offseason of any NFL team, signing quarterback Michael Vick to a long-term contract, and picking up pro-bowl cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, the Eagles developed a villainous identity, while being the favorite to win a Super Bowl. Now, at 1–4, making the playoffs would be a stretch.
Vick has been an interception machine, with seven already this season. And the defense is abysmal at stopping the run, at 30th in the league in run defense, with 140.2 opponent rushing yards per game. In post-game interviews, you can see how frustrated Vick and head coach Andy Reid are with the lack of success this year.
A players-only meeting was called after last week’s loss to the Buffalo Bills. But given how little time this team has spent in its current construction, I believe that a players meeting with players who do not know each other very well can only end badly. They do not know what makes one another tick and it will most likely end in a slew of accusations. As a member of the previously mentioned majority, I hope this is the case, and that this is the beginning of the Eagles’ demise.
These unforeseen events have been at the forefront of NFL fans’ minds and analysts’ reports through the early parts of this season. If you haven’t noticed, the Bills are in first at 4–1 and the New York Jets are surprisingly unsatisfactory at 2–3. Quarterback Tim Tebow has already replaced Kyle Orton as the starter for the Denver Broncos, and the Indianapolis Colts have proven that Peyton Manning is the most important player in NFL history, as his absence has led them to an 0–5 start after a 10–6 season last year with virtually the same team (but with a healthy Manning of course). Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has been equally electrifying as he has been mediocre, and Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork has two interceptions, more than most secondary defenders. This season has been anything but predictable.
There were some exciting matchups in week six, such as the Lions vs. the 49ers, the Bucs vs. the New Orleans Saints, the New York Giants vs. the Bills, and the Patriots vs. the Cowboys. Hopefully you guys put on your hometown jerseys, ordered a pizza, put off your homework, and enjoyed some regular season football while it’s here..

2011-10-17,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon’s recent history of research on geoengineering provided an interesting backdrop for visiting professor James Fleming’s lecture, titled “Fixing the Sky,” this past Thursday. Fleming touched on various geoengineering issues discussed in his book, Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control.
Fleming, professor and director of Science, Technology, and History at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, spoke to a public audience in Porter Hall about climate geoengineering’s past, status quo, and possible future. Climate geoengineering, the deliberate modification of the Earth system in an attempt to counter the effects of climate change, has been heavily researched as part of Carnegie Mellon’s NSF-funded Climate Decision Making Center (CDMC), which collaborates with a number of other universities around the world.
“Both because we may need it in an emergency, and because geoengineering is something a nation might start doing unilaterally, the time has come to undertake a transparent and globally coordinated program of research,” Granger Morgan, head of the department of engineering and public policy and director of the CDMC, said in a 2009 university press release.
Fleming began the lecture by stating his own definition of scientific research as “the cutting edge of ignorance.” After a short pause and a few chuckles from the audience, he explained that he believes that some scientists may let their overbearing enthusiasm affect their logical, big-picture way of thinking about their research. “Quite a few people fall into the category that I call ‘sincere but deluded scientists’ — that is, they are pathologically enthusiastic about their research, but not able to really rein in their enthusiasm,” Fleming said.
Social, historical, humanistic, and ethical concerns with geoengineering were not widely considered until very recently, Fleming told the audience, as he reviewed the history of climate geoengineering and how people have been discussing and attempting to modify the Earth’s atmosphere for quite a long time.
One of the many examples of historical climate engineering Fleming discussed was the idea of injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere in order to increase the reflection of sunlight back into outer space and cool the Earth. The proposal of such an act, he explained, was highly motivated by the global cooling that resulted after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, which sent ash and other particles high into the stratosphere. 
However, Fleming warned that such a “man-made volcano” may have adverse side effects, such as stopping the Indian monsoon or causing severe drought in Africa, both of which also occurred after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Given all of the geoengineering ideas proposed throughout history, Fleming argued, “You’re changing the way people relate with nature, and you’re doing it by a small group in power imposing this idea on the world. How do you gain consensus like that?”
What the geoengineering field needed to be, Fleming said, was what he referred to as “the Three ‘I’s: international, interdisciplinary, intergenerational.” The people discussing these ideas need to be from a diverse group in order to provide a more balanced look into the future.
Fleming’s lecture sparked curious discussion within the audience. “I think Fleming reminds us that recent talk about geoengineering as a way to avoid a climate disaster is not the first time that it has been proposed or tried,” said Kevin Brown, a Ph.D. student in the history department. “In those earlier endeavors, the hubris of the scientists, and anti-democratic means in which these projects were developed and implemented, I believe, should give us serious pause before we consider attempting them on an even greater scale.”.

2011-10-24,CMU,India,"Dale Clevenger (A ’62), the principal horn player for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO), has been chosen as this year’s recipient of the College of Fine Arts Distinguished Alumni Award. Clevenger has been in the CSO for 45 years; he currently serves as a professor of horn at Roosevelt University and an adjunct professor at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music.
Clevenger was first attracted to the horn at a young age, when his father took him to local concerts. “The horns gleamed and caught my eye. Their sounds resonated in the marrow of my bones. The more I listened, the more I became infatuated,” Clevenger said on his website. In an interview, he explained that he loves how “the horn is a very versatile instrument. It’s a brass instrument, but it gets paired with the woodwinds. It gets paired with the strings.”
Clevenger, who paid his way through Carnegie Mellon by performing with local symphonies, won the position of principal horn in the CSO only four years after graduating. He credited winning the position with the CSO, whose brass section The New York Times has called “legendary,” to “a lot of hard work and an excellent education” at Carnegie Mellon.
He quickly garnered acclaim as an instrumentalist in the CSO; the Milwaukee Journal praised his playing as “satin smooth,” and the Chicago Tribune wrote, “Dale Clevenger has been widely and justly admired in every musical capacity.” 
He has received three Grammy awards, recorded six albums, and premiered John Williams’ Concerto for Horn and Orchestra, a piece the CSO commissioned for Clevenger. He also held an adjunct professorship at Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music for 27 years.
Clevenger has also worked as a conductor, leading multiple orchestras, including the New Japan Philharmonic, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the West Australia Symphony Orchestra, and the National Philharmonic of Slovakia. He admitted, however, that between playing the horn and conducting an orchestra, “conducting is easier.”
Even though he has held the same position for over 40 years, Clevenger is still passionate about his career: “I get to wake up every day and do what I love,” he said.
Despite all his personal successes as a musician, Clevenger considers his moments as an ensemble member to be the highlight of his musical career. “The [CSO] went and performed in New York City at Carnegie Hall for the first time in several years ... and the audience applauded for over 20 minutes,” he recalled. “I’d never heard of anything like it before then or since then.”
Clevenger recently endured a personal tragedy. His wife, Alice Clevenger, died this past March after battling cancer for eight years. “I still can’t talk about her without crying.... You don’t move on,” he said, as he choked up.
From this loss, though, sprang the generosity of his friends and peers. This September, after returning home from the CSO’s European tour, Clevenger received a package from Williams. “At first I thought it was just some final revisions [on the Concerto for Horn and Orchestra],” he said. “But then I opened it up and I saw what he had done.” Williams had composed a piece titled Serenade for Horn and Strings dedicated to Alice Clevenger.
“I cried for 20 minutes [when I saw that] because I knew what it meant,” he said. “It meant he had dropped everything ... for however long it took [to compose the piece for her].” By comparison, it had taken 10 years for his commissioned Concerto for Horn and Orchestra to be completed.
While Clevenger said that he would not be able to perform the piece, as it would be too emotional, he does already have an idea as to where it will premiere. He established the Alice R. Clevenger Scholarship in his wife’s memory at Roosevelt University, where she was a horn professor, and he hopes to throw a benefit concert to raise funds for the scholarship. Yo-Yo Ma, who became the CSO’s first creative consultant in 2009, has already agreed to perform at the concert.
Clevenger will deliver a lecture in Kresge Theatre on Friday at 2 p.m. and a master class in Kresge on Saturday at 9:30 a.m., both of which are open to all School of Music students, faculty, and staff. The Alumni Awards Ceremony will take place in Rangos Hall on Friday at 5:30 p.m.; pre-registration is required to attend..

2011-10-24,CMU,India,"This year, the International Festival will be a part of Cèilidh Weekend, and will celebrate Carnegie Mellon’s ethnic and cultural diversity. Although typically held during a separate weekend from Homecoming and Family weekends, the International Festival is now part of a larger celebration. The festivities will include keynote lectures, traditional religious ceremonies, and an international poster and photo fair.
The main events of the International Festival will center on keynote lectures and discussions by Freddie H. Fu, M.D., and novelist Chris Abani.
On Thursday, Fu will host a discussion on his personal experiences and his career in the medical profession, specifically within the field of orthopedic surgery. His lecture will be followed by a Q & A session.
Fu grew up in Hong Kong and later made his way to America, where he attended Dartmouth College as well as Dartmouth Medical School. He eventually arrived in Pittsburgh, where he attended University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine. Since then, Fu has worked at Pitt for 36 years.
He specialized in sports injuries and spearheaded the creation of UPMC’s $80 million Sports Performance Complex, a state-of-the-art sports medicine complex which opened in 2000. The center has acted as a model for other medical complexes around the world and has attracted surgeons from over 50 countries on six continents.
On the topic of the center, Fu said, “People come to Pittsburgh [to learn about sports medicine] ... not just patients, but also countries.” He explained that the center was an opportunity to “rejuvenate Pittsburgh” and to “showcase that we [Pittsburgh] are a very good place.” 
Fu, a Chinese-American, has made numerous contributions to the Pittsburgh community and even has a noodle dish, the Dr. Fu’s Special, named after him at Lu Lu’s Noodles on Craig Street. Fu’s cultural diversity and commitment to the community made him an obvious pick to highlight the goals of the International Festival.
The second keynote lecture, taking place on Friday, will center on Abani and his experiences as an exiled writer. His discussion will be followed by a special luncheon.
At 18, Abani was imprisoned by the Nigerian government for his first novel, Masters of the Board. In the novel, Abani describes a fictional takeover of the government. The Nigerian government believed it was a real plot for rebellion and subsequently imprisoned the author. After serving six months in jail, he was released but continued to speak out against the government. Abani was ultimately arrested and jailed three times and was almost sentenced to death.
Abani finally fled Africa in 1991, and fled again to the United States in 1999. After escaping political suppression, he was able to write freely and publish his works without fear. “Happiness is learning to live with difficulty and grace,” he said, in reflection of his experiences in Africa.
He has published three novels, two novellas, and five books of poetry. Abani is currently a professor at the University of California, Riverside, and the recipient of the PEN USA Freedom-to-Write Award. He also received the 2001 Prince Claus Award, the Lannan Literary Fellowship, the California Book Award, and the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award.
Besides the keynote speakers, the International Festival will incorporate the experiences of students who have studied abroad. The Tartans Abroad Poster Displays will showcase posters, photos, and other memorabilia in Kirr and Hoch Commons in the University Center throughout Cèilidh Weekend. This event will showcase Carnegie Mellon’s international campus locations as well as provide information on the cultural opportunities that study abroad programs give students.
The International Festival will also feature a dual religious celebration of Eid and Diwali, traditional Muslim and Indian festivals, respectively. Taking place in Wiegand Gym and sponsored by MayurSASA, the event will celebrate the religious and cultural histories of South Asian countries as well as the different ethnicities within the Carnegie Mellon student body..

2011-10-24,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon’s MayurSASA will be hosting a joint celebration of Diwali and Eid ul-Fitr in the University Center’s Wiegand Gym on Thursday. The event will feature games, crafts, live performances, and a buffet of South Indian fare.
The games and crafts portion of the event will include diya-making, where attendees can make their own candles. This part of the evening will also include lessons in raas, a type of dance that originated in India. The section is specifically geared toward entertaining younger participants.
Some of Carnegie Mellon’s premier dancing and singing groups will be making an appearance at the event as part of the live performance portion. Chak De, a bhangra dance group; Tufaan, another dance troupe; and Deewane, a South Asian all-male a capella group, will each showcase its talents throughout the celebration.
A second part of the evening’s performance portion will include prayers for both Diwali and Eid. MayurSASA members will present a short speech that will explain both of the events’ histories and what they represent to South Asian culture.
Diwali, the first religious celebration of the event, is an Indian festival also known as the “Festival of Lights.” Translated from Sanskrit, Diwali literally means “row of lamps.” The festival is celebrated differently throughout the world. The main focus of the festival is to rejoice in the “Inner Light,” or self. Furthermore, the event celebrates the triumph of good over evil.
The second religious celebration will center on Eid ul-Fitr. Usually abbreviated to Eid, this holiday marks the end of Ramadan, or the Muslim holy month of fasting. Eid, like Diwali, celebrates a blessed period of forgiveness. The holiday is also celebrated on a global scale.
Shilpa Balaji, a junior computer science major, appreciated that MayurSASA wanted to celebrate the religious holidays, but was skeptical of how pious the events might actually be. 
“It’s great that clubs are trying to offer outlets for religious individuals. But, just as in every religious community, there is a risk of insincerity,” she said. “If organizations are going to put themselves forward with intentions of upholding religious beliefs, the members of the organizations should be aware of how their actions in the college community relate to their actions in their cultural and religious organization.”
An Udupi buffet will also be a part of the evening’s events. This type of food gets its name from Udupi, a town on the southwest coast of India. The food traditionally includes dishes made from beans, grains, vegetables, and fruits; Udupi is vegetarian-friendly. The buffet will cost $10, and tickets will be available for purchase during the week.
Since this event is a combination of two celebrations, MayurSASA members wanted to ensure that there would be educational opportunities for participants about the history and meaning of the two festivals. MayurSASA President Anisha Vyas, a junior biomedical and mechanical engineering dual major, said that his organization will be displaying facts about both festivals on the Cut throughout the week. This way even students who cannot attend the celebrations can still learn about both events..

2011-10-31,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Mellon research group TechBridgeWorld held its annual interactive event in the Newell-Simon Hall atrium last Wednesday. 
This year’s theme was “TechCaFE: Making Learning Fun.” The TechCaFE project, short for Technology for Customizable and Fun Education, offers tools for teaching and practicing English literacy. The four essential tools of TechCaFE — called CaFE Teach, CaFE Web, CaFE Phone, and CaFE Play — were all on display on Wednesday.
M. Bernardine Dias, an assistant research professor in the Robotics Institute, founded TechBridgeWorld in 2004 with the hope of implementing technological solutions that promote sustainable innovations in developing countries. 
TechCaFE, which was initiated five years ago, has been one of the most successful projects TechBridgeWorld has done so far, Dias said.
Using TechCaFE tools, Dias explained, a student can link English grammar exercises to games on his or her phone. The games are developed by TechCaFE’s CaFE Play team, while the exercises are created online by teachers through CaFE Teach. Students are able to download questions for each new class.
“The biggest feature of TechCaFE was its high-level customization,” Dias said. “We try to customize it on different levels. The first thing is that we want the concept of the game and the content to be separated. That’s one of our key innovations.” 
Teachers using TechCaFE have the power to customize their own exercises and create their own content through the games. In addition, TechCaFE can be customized through close partnership with local communities.
“We worked very closely to communities,” Dias said as she explained the project’s beginnings, and how it has evolved over the years. “It’s not like we sit in the lab and think ‘What shall we build next?’ There is always a partner, a partner in the community, that wants us to do something. When we first started, we begged people, asked them about their difficulties. So for the first year and a half, we had to work very hard. But now I get way too many requests, and we sometimes have to say no. It’s kind of sad that we can’t do everything.”
TechCaFE has been put into use in many places, including Tanzania, Somalia, Uruguay, India, Qatar, and the United States.
Jayce Maravich, a teacher from the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, attended the event on Wednesday. Her school began to use the CaFE Phone, a mobile phone game created by the project, two years ago. Maravich said that the tool was very helpful and that the school got a lot of positive feedback from the students. As a teacher, she used CaFE Teach to create questions online that students could download to their phones.
“It is very easy to use and very flexible,” she remarked.
TechCaFE not only has an impact on local communities, but it also influences the Carnegie Mellon students who become involved in the project.
Hatem Alismail, a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute, said, “It made me realize the importance of people, the importance of listening to what they want and what they need — listening to their feedback and encouraging them to contribute to the development.”
Students who attended the interactive event had positive reflections.
“I read the descriptions online and I thought [the event] would be all about robots or computers or machines. I was surprised to find here it was all everyday technology,” said University of Pittsburgh media and professional communications major Hebah Elmasri. “It has so much information here. I really appreciate the theme of CaFE to make learning fun.”
TechCaFE is still a research project, and it is free for public use. Dias said that her goal is to make the project as accessible as possible.
“We could go with some open-source license,” she said. “We are not planning to make money out of it, but the best way to get it to the largest number of people might be to let someone else to make money. So I haven’t fully decided yet, but from our purpose it’s free.”.

2011-11-07,CMU,India,"As one of the premiere franchises in the NFL and in all of sports, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the most analyzed teams in the game today. Prior to this year, many experts and other fans thought the Steelers would take a step back, considering that their already-old defense aged another year and their division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens, looked to be even better with younger players.
In the beginning of the season, it looked like the Steelers were lowering themselves to those expectations, as those very same Ravens pummeled them with a score of 35–7. Almost instantly, the city of Pittsburgh went on alert. Many fans worried that the experts were correct and that this team was destined to miss the playoffs, or suffer a first-round exit in the playoffs. Luckily, the NFL has 16 games in a season. The Steelers have gone 6–1 the rest of the way, with their only loss to the Houston Texans, and they are in the driver’s seat for the first seed in the AFC and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Looking back on the season so far, it was pretty ridiculous to panic about the Steelers, seeing as how they brought back the same team from last year’s almost-championship run. Sure, the defense is old, but in a season where there was almost no training camp, it may be better to be old. This team is full of veterans that have been playing together for years, and this has likely been a big reason for their current success. Even with injuries to linebackers James Harrison and LaMarr Woodley, the defense has been a strong unit, and it has only given up greater than 20 points in one contest this year. Their secondary, which I have long pointed out as a weakness, has really stepped it up this year, as cornerback Ike Taylor has performed as a top-10 CB and William Gay hasn’t hurt them as much as expected.  
Just last week, the Steelers had a vintage performance against the New England Patriots, who, at the time, were considered the best team in the AFC. Leading up to that game, fans were still doubtful as to whether or not Pittsburgh could come away with a win, because some of the Steelers' wins over bad teams had not been convincing. However, the Steelers dominated the Pats from kickoff to the final kneel-down, using short passes to eat up the clock and keep Tom Brady off the field. When the Patriots did get the ball, the Steelers were able to limit the amount of production from quick receiver Wes Welker, who has eaten teams alive throughout the year. All of this led to a classic Steelers win, where the offense eats up clock and depends on the defense to win them the game in the end. This win has changed everyone’s perception of the Steelers, as they have gone from perceived third or fourth in the conference to first. There are even some experts picking them and the Packers to meet again in this year’s Super Bowl in Indianapolis.  
With a fairly easy schedule coming up for the Steelers, my prediction would be that they pick up the first seed in the AFC, which is a huge advantage, especially since they are one of the best home teams in the league. Expect the Steelers to run through the rest of their schedule, with a potentially tough game against the 49ers. A 14–2 regular season is not out of the question, but even 13 wins or possibly 12 should get them through the first round for sure. Either way, the Steelers will be making noise in the playoffs once again, something that I’m sure everyone in this city has come to expect..

2011-11-07,CMU,India,"“Sick moves. Great beats. Fly costs. Hot people. For a great cause.” These were five reasons to attend Bhangra in the Burgh, according to the promotional posters floating around campus the past few weeks. On Saturday, 2,500 people filled up the auditorium in Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall to watch the fifth annual bhangra dance competition. The event did not disappoint, as the audience got exactly what was promised in the flyers.
Eight competing teams from around the country came to show off their dance skills in the high-energy competition. Bhangra is a dance style originating from Punjab, which uses traditional, beat-heavy folk music, but modern versions often combine this with popular hip-hop or club music. All the teams — D.C. Bhangra Crew, Anakh-E-Gabroo, Cornell, First Class Bhangra, D.C. Metro Punjabi Arts Academy, Virginia di Shaan, Drexel, and UNC Bhangra Elite — had extremely high levels of skill and technique. Dressed in brightly colored clothes, the performers seemed to glide across the stage from one formation to the next.
Given the high caliber of each performance, it was inevitably an intense competition. However, “a good show is a competitive but friendly show,” said administrative chair Sonum Garg, a sophomore mechanical engineering major. This was evidenced by the teams cheering for one another during each dance. The sportsmanship demonstrated by the teams was probably facilitated by the fact that the Bhangra in the Burgh committee organized a mixer the night before, so that the teams could get better acquainted.
The night was full of laughter, thanks to charismatic Master of Ceremonies Suraj Baxi, a senior social and decision sciences major. He and co-host Stefan Dezil, a senior drama student, created smooth segues between the acts with their wit and charm. The insertion of non-competitive exhibition acts also helped with the flow of the show.
The exhibition acts included non-dance groups such as Carnegie Mellon’s all-male South Asian a cappella group Deewane, as well as dance groups of other styles, like Tanah and SoulStylz. Additionally, the audience saw some fresh faces when groups from outside Carnegie Mellon performed. Boston University’s dance group Jalwa was a crowd favorite with its fast-paced and high-energy performance, and Northwestern’s Brown Sugar a cappella group serenaded the audience with beautiful harmonies.
Among all the excitement of the dance, it was easy to forget that the event was a charity fundraiser. Of the proceeds, 75 percent went to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The remaining 25 percent went to the Bhangra in the Burgh grant, which “is committed to facilitating the service-based endeavors of the students of Carnegie Mellon University,” according to the show program. In order to remind people of the philanthropic efforts of the event, a representative from St. Jude’s presented a short and touching video at the end of the competition on the type of patients that the proceeds support.
The subdued mood in the room was short-lived, however. As Carnegie Mellon’s own Bhangra team took to the stage, the crowd cheered with excitement. The Bhangra in the Burgh staff members swarmed into the aisles of the auditorium to get a better view of their home team, who performed energetically and passionately on stage. It was hard not to join them.
The show as a whole ran smoothly, with only a few minor technical issues such as missed or botched music and lighting cues. Although performers may have been irked at such mishaps, the audience seemed not to take much notice, as they were too caught up in the excitement of the night. Even the intermission was made enjoyable, with inexpensive and tasty samosas for sale as audience members chatted excitedly about their favorite teams.
Unfortunately, the results weren’t announced until later in the evening, and many audience members had already left before the winner, UNC Bhangra Elite, could be announced. This may be a testament, however, to the way that the show focused not on competition but rather on spreading awareness of Indian culture and bhangra in general. As Liaison Chair Reema Thawrani, a junior business major, said, “It’s a great cultural experience.”.

2011-11-07,CMU,India,"Students and faculty members gathered in the Connan Room of the University Center  last Thursday to participate in a conversation with Vandana Shiva, an eco-feminist and physicist.
Shiva came to Pittsburgh to accept the Thomas Merton Award given by the Thomas Merton Center, a Pittsburgh-based non-profit, for her remarkable contributions to world peace and social justice.
In her lecture, Shiva shared personal stories and talked about a wide range of topics, from biopiracy — the practice of exploiting nature for commercial gain, as when a particular seed is patented by a company — to hunger.
“I grew up in the Himalayan forest. My father was a forest council officer,” she said. “I’ve seen the Himalayan forest rich and dense, but I remember the particular day when I went swimming and my favorite tree wasn’t there because forest trees were chopped down for an apple orchard.”
Shiva said that her childhood memories exerted huge impacts on her values and the path she would take later. In 1991, Shiva founded Navdanya, a national movement in India to protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seeds.
Shiva’s work has involved her in the campaign against biopiracy. She said that no one can invent and have ownership of a plant simply by introducing a gene into it. However, companies such as Monsanto genetically modified seeds and then tried to patent them so that farmers had to pay for every “patented” seed to those companies. 
Shiva gave the audience a personal analogy of biopiracy, using her own physical disability.
“Now I was wheeled very kindly to [the Connan Room] in this wheelchair,” she said. “Do I turn around and say because I’ve introduced a new element to the room, this room built in Carnegie Mellon is something I created? And now Carnegie Mellon gives me rent? It’s a ridiculous notion. And all we’ve done in genetic engineering is just shoot a gene.”
“I believe in integrity of biodiversity,” she added. “And for me, it’s ethically wrong to say that ‘I’ve invented this life form.’  ”
In 2004, Navdanya scored a victory against biopiracy when the European Patent Office in Munich revoked Monsanto’s patent on the Indian variety of wheat “Nap Hal.” Back in India, Shiva’s organization has helped set up 65 community seed banks across the country to protect diversity of seeds.
Students and professors had positive feedback following Shiva’s lecture. 
Caroline Acker, a history professor and a historian of medicine and public health, supported Shiva’s ideas. “I appreciated Dr. Shiva’s discussion of the patenting of life forms such as seeds. The idea of patents was developed so as to encourage innovation and thus a diversity of possibilities. Ironically, as Dr. Shiva noted, the patenting of seeds and the insistence on selling them contributes to monoculture and to cultivation of single varieties of crops.”
Jihoon Min, a Ph.D. student in the department of engineering and public policy, said, “I think [Shiva] is great, because she was educated through a totally Western perspective, which can be an obstacle that will prevent average people from having a holistic view about the world, or from respecting the local knowledge of local people. She went beyond this obstacle and made people around the world sympathize with the environmental issues and the corporate violence.”.

2011-11-14,CMU,India,"The Chinese Student Association (CSA) hosted the Chinese Cultural Late Night in the University Center on Friday night.
The highlight of the event was a show by the band Free Bullet, comprised of six Carnegie Mellon students — two from mainland China, one from Taiwan, one from India, one from Korea, and one from the U.S.
Besides the live concert, CSA also offered free bubble tea, Chinese board games, and karaoke, one of the most popular entertainment activities in China. However, due to certain technical problems, the karaoke equipment did not work. 
“Through this event, we hope to spread Chinese culture, to make CSA a more active club, to make Chinese culture more mainstream in this school,” said Chang Qi, a junior mathematics major and the organizer of the Late Night event. 
She explained that last year’s Chinese Cultural Late Night was a combination of traditional and modern culture, but this time CSA focused more on modern Chinese culture, as evidenced by the Chinese pop music.
Jiaxing Yu, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said, “It’s a nice try to reach out for CSA, and people are really interested in this. Except for the not very Chinese band performance — otherwise it would be perfect.”
Since most of the songs Free Bullet played were American pop songs, several students said that they enjoyed the music, but did not know that it was specifically a Chinese Cultural Late Night event. 
Elliot Rosen, another first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said, “I had no idea, really. I was just there for the music. I didn’t know it was a Chinese culture thing, even though nearly everyone was Chinese ... but the music was good because I don’t see live music that much.”
Free Bullet was formed one month ago, according to the band leader, Pei Pang, a senior mathematics major.
“The thing is that we are a new band,” Pang said. “We tried to get all the connections we have to have shows. I’m very familiar with CSA.... Actually my old band played for them last year, but definitely the new band is better than the old band. It’s just a revisit to the show.” 
Pang also mentioned that it was hard for his new band to play Chinese pop music because the group is so international. 
“If we play a Chinese song, it’s probably kind of sad to [non-Chinese members],” he said. Yet Pang said they might incorporate more Asian or Chinese elements into their music in the future. 
“My drummer actually mentioned that he wants more exotic elements in the songs,” he said. “He thinks it’s pretty cool.”
Chinese Cultural Late Night is just one of the events celebrating Asian Heritage Month throughout November. There will be a Taiwanese Culture Night in the University Center on Nov. 19..

2011-11-21,CMU,India,"Catching Ghost Particles in Oil and Plastic: The NOvA Experiment
Monday at 3 p.m.
Allen Hall 318, University of Pittsburgh
Luke Corwin, a post-doctorate fellow at Indiana University, will present and discuss his recent research in the field of neutrinos and particle physics, emphasizing the NOvA experiment.
Corwin will discuss neutrinos in detail, as well as how he believes they are some of the most mysterious particles in the known universe. 
Neutrinos are fundamental particles that weakly interact with other particles, and as a result are sometimes referred to as ghost particles. According to Corwin, particle physicists are actively trying to solve many unknowns about neutrinos, such as which neutrino type is heaviest and how they change from one type to another.
After his preliminary discussion on neutrinos, Corwin will delve into a talk about the NOvA experiment. This experiment is one of the latest generation of neutrino detection mechanisms being built to find out more about the particles. Currently, the mechanism is under construction at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in northern Minnesota. It will consist of a near and far detector composed mainly of PVC extrusions and scintillating mineral oil. Corwin’s lecture will review the motivation, current status, and future plans for this experiment.

Maya Apocalypse: 1562 or 2012?
Nov. 28 at 6 p.m.
Rangos 1, University Center
Amara Solari and Matthew Restall will discuss the ongoing debate over the Mayan doomsday prediction. Solari is an assistant professor of art history and anthropology at Penn State University, and Restall is the Edwin Erle Sparks professor of colonial Latin American history, anthropology, and women’s studies at Penn State University.
Solari and Restall will argue that the prediction has become an international industry. They hope to explore whether there actually was an ancient Mayan prophecy that the world would end in 2012, and if not, how society’s obsession with the year 2012 came about. Solari and Restall co-authored the book 2012 and the End of the World: The Western Roots of the Maya Apocalypse, which will be the basis of their lecture..

2011-12-05,CMU,India,"Names proposed for newest elements
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has proposed two names for heavy elements 114 and 116, the most recent two additions to the periodic table of elements. The two proposed names are flerovium (with atomic symbol Fl) and livermorium (with atomic symbol Lv) for elements 114 and 116, respectively. The names must go through a five-month public approval period before becoming official. In the past 250 years, new elements have been added to the periodic table about once every two and a half years, according to Carnegie Mellon professor of chemistry Paul Karol, who chairs the IUPAC committee that recognizes new elements.

Texting is so easy, a lion can do it
The research company Ground Lab has developed new collars for tracking the locations of lions in Kenya. The collars can send the GPS locations of lions to a central server which processes these locations and texts local herders whenever a lion gets too close to their livestock. The collars incorporate a GPS receiver and a cellular modem capable of making calls, sending an SMS message, or even accessing a mobile data network. The process of tracking animals normally utilizes satellite linkage technology, but the company claims the cell phone route is less expensive. They have only been used on 10 lions so far, though plans to expand the program are in place.

World’s heaviest insect found
Researcher and adventurer Mark Moffet claimed last week to have discovered the heaviest known specimen of the giant weta, the largest insectsin the world, after a two-day search in the forests of Little Barrier Island, New Zealand. At 71 grams, the insect is heavier than three adult mice. Known as the wetapunga to the local Maori natives, the giant weta has been driven nearly to the brink of extinction by recently introduced rats and other mammals that feed on the insects, and can now only be spotted in the “little” islands of the country, like Little Barrier Island.

Violent video games affect brain
Researchers from Indiana University have linked extended exposure to violent video games to changes in some brain regions associated with emotional control. The study observed less activation in the frontal regions of the brain in MRI scans of young men who played violent video games over the course of one week than in other participants who did not. “The affected brain regions are important for controlling emotion and aggressive behavior,” said Yang Wang of the IU department of radiology. Similar studies of this nature have been conducted before, but this is the first time scientists have found a direct correlation between playing violent video games and emotional controlling brain function.

Mayans never said 2012 was ‘the end’
Experts on Mayan civilization are increasing their efforts to dispel the popular belief that the Mayans predicted that the end of the world would occur next year. A panel met at the archaeological site of Palenque in southern Mexico last week to emphasize that the so-called end day of Dec. 21, 2012 on the Mayan calendar is actually just the start of another long 5,125 year counting period (similar to the transition between Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 for our 365-day counting period). “We have to be clear about this. There is no prophecy for 2012,” said Erik Velasquez, a Mayan etchings expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “It’s a marketing fallacy.”

Mars-bound rover to explore life
Curiosity, a car-sized rover developed by NASA, was propelled toward Mars by an unmanned rocket with a goal of analyzing the red planet. Launched just over a week ago, Curiosity is expected to touch down in August 2012, and its main mission will be to discover whether Mars currently has life or was ever capable of supporting it. The probe is equipped with 17 cameras and 10 different instruments that can analyze the Martian soil and identify elements in samples dug up by its drill-tipped arm. The rover, powered by a small nuclear generator, cost $2.5 billion to make.

2011-12-05,CMU,India,"A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi alongside a commemorative plaque was installed in the Andy’s Eatery area of the University Center basement last Wednesday. A brief ceremony dedicating the portrait and plaque was held.
“An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,” one of Gandhi’s most well-known sayings, is printed at the bottom of the portrait. Gandhi was the political and spiritual leader who helped lead a peaceful Indian revolt against British colonial rule.
Blue and yellow streamers were hung across the portrait before being cut by the president of Carnegie Mellon’s Indian spirituality organization OM, Archit Kumar, a junior double majoring in information systems and decision science. A small group gathered to watch the unveiling, while other students went about their business working or opening packages.
“After Gandhi Jayanti in October we worked with the dean of Student Affairs [and] with Marcia [Gerwig] and the University Center crew to get a picture of Mahatma Gandhi up somewhere in the University Center,” Kumar said. “[It’s] a reminder of everything that Gandhi-jhi has done.”
The portrait can be found next to the Giving Wall in between the package pickup window and the FedEx and PNC Bank branches. The space has a television as well as tables and seating. Kumar said that the area was chosen because “[it] is really for the students, this entire area.... It’s a place where students have freedom of expression ... where they have full expression of themselves.” 
As he gave a brief address to those gathered to watch the commemoration, Kumar emphasized a lesser-known Gandhi quote: “In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” 
While the portrait is not on the same scale as a hunger strike or other forms of civil disobedience, Kumar expressed hope that the picture would serve both as a reminder of Gandhi’s work and as inspiration for others to emulate.
Professor Kunal Ghosh, OM’s faculty adviser and assistant head for undergraduate affairs in the physics department, said that in addition to being proud of the permanent mark OM has left on the university, he hopes that students will take the portrait’s message to heart. “Retaliation is not the way, that’s not how to change the world,” he said.
After the ceremony, however, few students seemed to notice the portrait and no one was interested in giving a comment on the installation.  While not a controversial figure, only a small number of students had an opinion of the portrait, and even fewer had seen it.
Yet, for those involved with the Indian community on campus, the portrait has become a source of pride. “It’s a really great gesture to have Gandhi-jhi’s portrait in the University Center,” said Anisha Vyas, a junior mechanical engineering major and president of MayurSASA, “especially where everybody walks by and remind everybody of what he did in some small way.”.

2012-01-30,CMU,India,"Super Bowls define careers: They separate good players from great players. As we look toward Super Bowl XLVI, we look at crossroads in the careers of two very different quarterbacks. Tom Brady, the New England Patriots’ veteran quarterback, will face Eli Manning, the New York Giants’ quarterback and little brother of Indianapolis Colts’ quarterback Peyton Manning.
Brady is the golden boy who was picked 199th in the NFL draft and wasn’t even a full-time starter in college, while Manning is a high-pedigree, four-year college starter who has struggled to step out of his famous family’s shadow.
Walking off the field in Super Bowl XLII, Manning was the top player and had just completed one of the greatest upsets of all time. Brady, meanwhile, was handed a crushing defeat that still stings him today. On that night, both of their career paths changed completely. Brady lost his aura of invincibility and Manning gained the respect and recognition he had been fighting for throughout his career.
Now, four years later, we are looking at another career-changing moment for these two quarterbacks. On Sunday night, their legacies will be even more tied together, forever linked.
This game will change not only how people will view each of them, but also how people view at Super Bowl XLII. This is a rare opportunity to rewrite history. This Sunday, Brady and Manning are not just playing for themselves but for their legacies, along with the legacies of those connected to them — past and present.
A win on Sunday would allow Manning to take another huge step out of his brother’s shadow. He would solidify his preseason claim of being an elite quarterback in the league and silence most of his critics. 
Winning another Super Bowl would turn Manning into one of the best clutch quarterbacks of all time, forcing people to focus on his record-setting 15 fourth-quarter touchdowns and his 110 fourth-quarter passing rating. Another Super Bowl win and people would no longer be debating whether he deserves the Pro Bowl, but rather if he is worthy of the Hall of Fame.
However, a loss would add doubt. Losing would increase suspicions that 2007 was a fluke. Falling to the Patriots would devalue all the work he has done to become his own person and not just Peyton’s little brother. Defeat would leave Manning in the category of good NFL quarterbacks, not great ones.
Winning for Brady would mean being considered one of the best quarterbacks of all time. With a win, Brady would prove that defense doesn’t win championships — record-breaking quarterback play and great tight ends do. Victory would show that Brady doesn’t need superb coaches or receivers to achieve greatness. With a victory in Indianapolis, the ghosts of 2007 would fade away.
On the other hand, a loss would show decline. A defeat would leave Brady’s record barely over .500 in the playoffs since 2006, after starting his career 10-0. 
Losing would make people question if Brady is a good enough quarterback to win big games on his own, without a great defensive or offensive talent to back him up. A loss would have critics questioning if Brady was coasting on his former glory.
This Sunday, the legacies of two men will be changed forever. Between the funny commercials and the lavish halftime performance, these quarterbacks will fight for how history and critics will view them.
In the end, it may be out of their hands as they watch hopelessly from the sidelines. But after it’s all over, when one is raising the Vince Lombardi trophy and the other is sulking in the locker room, both of their paths will be changed.
The winner will have silenced the critics and proved his worth; the loser will have a new chorus of doubters questioning if he’s worth the praise..

2012-02-06,CMU,India,"“It’s déjà vu all over again.” That famous quote by the Yankees’ Yogi Berra could not be more appropriate, even if it regards a different sport and a different era.
Almost mirroring the events of Super Bowl XLII, the New York Giants beat the favored New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI in Indianapolis. On the coattails of a terrific fourth quarter drive by quarterback Eli Manning, a defining catch reminiscent of David Tyree’s, and a game-sealing sack, the Giants pulled out the upset.
Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was looking to cement himself into an even higher echelon of great quarterbacks, but instead Manning made his way to Hall of Fame consideration. The Giants stand alone at the top of the NFL, defeating the Patriots with a final score of 21–17.
It seemed like the Patriots had the Giants’ number during the first three quarters. After a good start in the first half by the Giants, their respected defensive line could not stop the short, quick passing plan of Patriots’ offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien and head coach Bill Belichick. It essentially negated the dominant Giants’ pass rush, allowing the Patriots a touchdown at the end of the first half.
In that half, the Giants scored on a questionable safety call via intentional grounding in the end zone by Brady and on a Manning pass to wide receiver Victor Cruz. Regardless, the Patriots appeared to have the edge. 
The third quarter was similar to the first half. An aggressive, quick passing game by New England helped the Patriots score their second touchdown, and sloppy play by New York, including two fumbles, pointed to a Giants collapse.
However, in the fourth quarter, the Giants snapped out of it, and Manning did his best Brady impression. Brady, who has seven career fourth-quarter comebacks in the postseason, is considered one of the greatest clutch quarterbacks ever to play the game. Manning may now be considered in that conversation.
At the 3:46 mark in the fourth quarter, the Giants’ final drive began with the score sitting 17–15, advantage Patriots. A 38-yard pass from Manning down the sideline in double coverage was cradled in by wide receiver Mario Manningham, as he   barely kept his feet in bounds.
After eight plays of pin-point passing by Manning and physical play from the offensive line and wide receivers, running back Ahmad Bradshaw ran up the middle, turned around, and sat hindquarter-first into the end zone. The Patriots allowed the Giants a touchdown, in hopes of preventing them from running down the clock, thereby preventing a Patriots’ final drive.
That last drive ended poorly for New England. A sack by Pro-Bowl defensive end Justin Tuck crushed any remaining momentum for the Patriots. One last heave by Brady ended with the ball hitting the grass of the end zone, as the outstretched arms of the Patriots’ tight end Rob Gronkowski extended about a foot short of winning. 
Manning is now the 11th multi-Super Bowl winning quarterback. This win secures him the elite status that was so heavily questioned by the media earlier this season. It puts him ahead of his brother Peyton, who has received more praise as a quarterback throughout both of their careers.
Brady is already in the realm of greatness. However, a victory in Super Bowl XLVI would have tied him with Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana with four Super Bowl titles. Now people are left questioning if “Spygate,” where Belichick was accused of spying on opposing coaches’ play-calling, was the reason for his three Super Bowl victories. Since “Spygate,” Brady is 0–2 on the biggest stage.
The fact of the matter is that Brady and Manning both played unbelievable games. But it was Manning’s supporting cast that put the Giants over the top. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin runs a tight ship in New York, and it showed in Indianapolis. 
Super Bowl XLVI is over, with the Giants reigning supreme — twice in four years. It could not have been put better than Giants’ running back Brandon Jacobs: “We decapitated them.” Call it what you want, but the Giants are the Super Bowl champions once again..

Fomalhaut b, one of the first planets outside the solar system to be discovered through direct imaging, is under debate; scientists are beginning to question whether or not it is actually a planet.
The so-called planet does not exhibit light in the infrared range, even though a planet visible through a telescope should be hot enough to emit infrared light. Second, Fomalhaut b’s brightness decreased by half within two years, interpreted as having lost half of its mass.
Paul Kalas, the planet’s discoverer, argued that it may have a large dust ring in orbit that reflects light while still having a mass too low to emit enough detectable infrared light. Markus Janson, who conducted the follow-up experiments, argued that the detected object may be the result of asteroid collisions producing an expanding cloud of light-reflecting dust instead of condensing into a planet.

Cheaper catalyst developed for cheaper goods
Researchers at Princeton University developed an iron-based catalyst for the silylation of organic compounds. Silylation is a widely used procedure for the production of complex compounds, such as adhesives and pharmaceuticals. Industrial catalysts in past decades have been restricted to high-cost precious metals like platinum instead of cheap metals like iron.
While catalysts are not destroyed during chemical reactions, they can still be lost in chemical production on industrial scales. For example, an estimated 5.6 metric tons of platinum was used by the silicone industry and could not be recovered for future use. In addition to its low cost, the new iron catalyst may also increase the purity of products.

Genetic damage in chemotherapy patients’ children
It is not uncommon for cancer survivors to have children, especially with ongoing improvements in chemotherapy. However, cancer patients’ medications may lead to damaged DNA and increased rates of cancer in their children.
Researchers at the University of Leicester in England measured the mutation rates of mice exposed to common chemotherapy agents at an equivalent dosage used for human therapy. They measured for mutations in the sperm of males who were treated and untreated with chemotherapy, as well as in their offspring. Extensive genome-wide damage was found and, for one drug, as many as three times the normal number of mutations were found in the offspring.

Female leadership impacts gender gap and women’s roles
The Indian government set aside leadership positions for women in a number of rural villages in 1993. Collaborating researchers in several top universities have found that these leadership positions have had tremendous impacts on the gender gap and the roles of women in these societies. 
Aspirations were measured with questions pertaining to desire for early marriage, future education, and high-skill jobs. Parents’ aspirations increased 20 percent and children of both genders had a 32 percent increase in aspirations. These changes occurred in addition to an increase in favorability of female leaders. Since increases in favorability occurred alongside the increases in aspirations, researchers suggest that the increase in aspirations reflects the power of role models in society.

Facebook to sell stock publicly, $10 billion expected
Last Wednesday, Facebook filed for an IPO that would allow the company to sell stock publicly. The company is expected to face a flood of prospective buyers and raise almost $10 billion. The announcement was followed by expectations that Facebook users will also benefit in some way from the company going public. 
Many expect Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO and co-founder, to uphold honorable business practices while engaging with Wall Street. Facebook makes its revenue in part from the advertisement opportunities it offers businesses, but it also makes more by developing new technologies. The company spent $388 million last year in research and development, and will likely continue to devote itself to new technologies in the future.

The ongoing Texas drought has forced the central Texas community of Spicewood Beach to have its drinking water delivered from out of town. Since last Monday, the water has been delivered several times a day by a 4,000-gallon- capacity truck. 
State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon explained that the drought started over one year ago, and the state received just 15 inches of rain last year, far below the average of 28 inches. The Spicewood Beach community water well is just one of 13 public water systems in the state that are expected to completely run out of water in the next six months.

2012-02-06,CMU,India,"Public schools in the U.S. are offering an increasing amount of parental exemptions for certain coursework. Usually these exemptions are used for sexual education and health issues, but parental objections in the classroom have recently been taken to a new level. Last month, the Republican-dominated New Hampshire legislature passed House Bill 542, which allows parents to issue “an exception to specific course material based on ... [their] determination that the material is objectionable.”
New Hampshire parents now possess complete control to object to any program or assignment that arises. 
The bill indicates that school districts can no longer mandate a parent to send his or her child to any school program to which they are “conscientiously opposed.” 
In addition, the law does not require parents to give an explanation for the specific curriculum alteration. In essence, parents can now reject course material on a whim, as long as the student graduates with “state graduation requirements.”
The New Hampshire legislation was a clear attempt by the Republican legislature to continue undermining the public school system. As Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson highlighted in the case McCollum v. Board of Education, “If we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any [person] or is inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave the public schools in shreds.”
Robert Kunzman, education professor at Indiana University in Bloomington, expressed the over-arching question of balancing parental discretion and public school freedom. Earlier this year, in a report on abcnews.go.com, he posed the question, “How wide can we make the circle in our public schools in terms of helping families to feel welcomed and feel their beliefs and perspectives are accommodated?” Although parental discretion in common offensive cases is understandable, this new law funnels an excessive amount of power to the parents and tilts the balance almost to the point of educational obsolescence.
The law transforms public school education from a public good into a private (family-owned) mechanism. It is bound to lead to disagreements between parents and administrators on suitable lesson alternatives, and as a result, with every alternative plan, curricula will become increasingly conflicting. It is beneficial for a school to offer accommodations for students, but there need to be clear limits.
The New Hampshire law, biases and all, is beginning a trend of parental domination within the realm of education. Arizona and Georgia state legislatures are proposing similar legislation.
Although some district agreements should be made, the bill completely rejects the district-parent negotiation process and allows parents to object to school instruction in an ongoing state-wide culture war. The law is demeaning, disrespectful, and dangerous to the future of New Hampshire students, and to students across the nation..

2012-02-13,CMU,India,"It seems the time has come for a change in the Pittsburgh Steelers. With the exception of their head coach and offensive skill players, the Steelers are some of the oldest in the league: They have grizzled veterans both on the field and in their coaching staff. After watching their franchise quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, get knocked down and beaten up nearly every play, team owner Art Rooney II made a change in the team’s offensive coordinator position without consulting head coach Mike Tomlin. 
Although it was publicly announced that former offensive coordinator Bruce Arians retired, there were rumors that Rooney forced him into retirement. This was an attempt to avoid the bad publicity of not renewing Arians’ contract.Meanwhile, Arians became the new offensive coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts, further justifying that he was forced into retirement instead of making the decision himself. 
To make matters worse, Roethlisberger was publicly upset with Arians’ supposed retirement.
Roethlisberger and Arians joined at the same time in 2004 and developed a very good rapport. When the news of Arians’ retirement reached Roethlisberger, he responded by publicly requesting a meeting with Rooney.
To fill the void, the Steelers hired Todd Haley to be the new offensive coordinator. Haley made his name as the offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals in 2008, the season they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII. He was then hired to be the head coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, but was fired with three games left in the season due to the Chiefs’ poor record and Haley’s poor relationship with the players and the front office. 
Haley’s offensive philosophy is very different in comparison to Arians’. Haley’s game plan is similar to the high-octane passing attacks used by the Green Bay Packers or New England Patriots. This is in stark contrast to the “Ground and Pound” running-based style that the Steelers have employed in the past. The players hope this move will bring their offense into the modern style and eliminate much of the predictability that has plagued them in recent seasons. 
While Haley brings a completely different offensive philosophy with him, he also brings a significantly different personality. He has an abrasive personality and has had rocky relationships with his past teams. The sight of Haley and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner yelling at each other became common. There were also rumors of Haley and Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli having strong disdain for each other and butting heads on personnel decisions.
Many believe Haley was added to Tomlin’s staff not only to revitalize the offense, but also to put a little more pressure on Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger was very comfortable with Arians and may not have been performing at his best. The Steelers believe Roethlisberger can turn into a 5,000-yard passer, like Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
But the Steelers have never been a pass-first team. Their offensive line was built with the idea of creating holes for the running back, and protecting the quarterback was an afterthought. Moreover, having Roethlisberger drop back to pass 20 more times per game will open him up to even more hits and injuries.
Another problem is the Steelers’ receivers. Wide receivers Antonio Brown and Mike Wallace thrive in the deep-passing game. The issue is that most of these deep plays are set up by the play-action, and thus need a strong running game to succeed. The Steelers don’t have the wide receivers or tight ends to run a pass-first offensive. 
While Haley’s hiring may be seen as a way of turning Roethlisberger into a better quarterback, it is important to look at the effect on the rest of the offense. Historically, new offensive coordinators and returning quarterbacks underperform. Fans should not be surprised next season if the Steelers’ high-octane offense gets stuck in neutral..

2012-02-13,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team was victorious against Slippery Rock University, a Division II school, this past Friday.
 It was the first match of the season, and the Tartans won with an overall score of 9–0. 
Starting with the No. 3 doubles, first-year pair Clare DuBrin and Bryn Raschke came out with a strong 8–0 win.
In the singles matches, sophomore Katie Cecil at the No. 3 was the first to win, with scores of 6–1, 6–1.
Senior Laura Chen won the Tartans’ third singles match at No. 1 singles with scores of 6–3, 6–4, solidifying the team’s victory over Slippery Rock. 
“It was a great way to start the season,” Chen said. “We look forward to the next couple of matches because they will prepare us for indoor Nationals in a couple of weeks.” 
Senior Courtney Chin played a long match at No. 2 singles; she was the last Tartan left on the courts after splitting sets.
Since the match had already been decided in favor of Carnegie Mellon after the 5–0 lead, Chin played a third-set tie-breaker to decide her match. Chin ended with scores of 6–7, 6–4, and 10–3.
“Everyone has been working really hard in practice so far this spring, it was great to finally get out and play some external competition,” said head coach Andrew Girard. “There are a couple kinks that we need to work out here and there, but overall a very solid performance for our first match of the spring.”
The Tartans will host Indiana University of Pennsylvania and California University of Pennsylvania next Saturday at 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., respectively.
Editor's note: Courtney Chin is a staffwriter for The Tartan..

2012-02-20,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, last Wednesday and stayed through Saturday for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship meet. The men’s team took fifth place in the conference, while the women came in third overall.
Swimming in his first season for the Tartans, first-year Anton Razanav had a strong performance. Razanav won the 200-yard backstroke on Saturday; his time of 1:51.53 was not only a season best, but an NCAA qualifying time.
“This season, as a rookie, I want to make a good name for myself in Division III swimming as well as in the UAA. If my times allow me passage to nationals in March, then the only thing I can hope for is to improve even further. But I am focusing on one thing at a time in order to maintain a clear view of my goals,” Razanav said.
The Tartans’ next-best finish came from junior Daniel Glaser-Garbrick finishing second in the 200-yard butterfly with a provisional time of 1:51.42. Following Glaser-Garbrick, junior Brandon Yee also placed in the same race, coming in fourth place at 1:53.00.
With a personal goal to make it to the NCAA meet this year, sophomore Austin Bohn came out strong at the UAA meet, winning the consolation final of the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:08.20.
At the deeper end of the pool, senior divers Eli Fatsi and Mike Alexovich finished sixth and seventh on the one-meter board with 437.70 and 400.40 points, respectively.
For the women’s swimming team, first-year Debra Lin won the consolation final of the 200-yard backstroke at 2:06.99, a season best for her. First-year Kelley Sheehan also placed in the same event, finishing in third place with 2:08.40.
Sophomore Soleil Phan, who has been swimming since she was seven, swam in the finals of the 100-yard freestyle and finished sixth with a time of 52.78.
Junior Breanna Stillo followed closely behind, coming in seventh with 53.23 in the same race. Speaking about her experiences and goals, she said, “It was an awesome experience being part of the first women’s relay to go to Nationals last year, so it would be great to send an even bigger group of people there this year.”
Junior Price Kinney finished in fourth place in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:24.59, a season-best time for her. Sophomore Tatiana Duchak made the finals with a preliminary time of 2:28.50, but was disqualified during the final run.
At her last UAA meet, senior Hannah Gonzalez swam in the consolation finals for the 200-yard butterfly, finishing strong in third place with a time of 2:10.87.
The men and women who made an NCAA provisional mark this season are waiting to hear if they made the draw for the National championship meet that will be held in Indianapolis, Ind., in March..

2012-02-20,CMU,India,"Regent Square Theatre has been showing the 2012 Oscar-nominated short films since Feb. 10, in preparation for the Academy Awards on Feb. 26. This year’s Oscar-nominated shorts showcase a variety of creative influences in the field. While some are certainly stronger than others, all of the contenders have a unique story, style, and perspective.
Live-Action
Pentecost, an Irish film directed by Peter McDonald and Eimear O’Kane, follows the story of Damian, a young boy who is forced to serve as an altar boy when he would rather be out playing football (soccer). This comedic film portrays Damian’s tough decision between conforming to what his parents want him to do and following his heart. Pentecost had the audience laughing all throughout the credits and into the opening of the next film.
Raju is a German and Indian film directed by Max Zähle and Stefan Gieren. The story shows a German couple that travels to India to adopt a young boy. The couple faces a moral dilemma when they find out that the child they are adopting was not abandoned, but rather kidnapped. The film was well made and featured an excellent soundtrack, but the nuances of the story would have been better in a feature-length film with more background about the couple’s relationship.
The two films that followed, The Shore and Time Freak, were enjoyable but forgettable. The Shore was the longest of the short films and seemed to drag on. Despite its heartwarming message of making peace with regrets and facing a troubled past, the film lacked any compelling reason to pay attention for 31 minutes. Time Freak is an American film about an inventor who creates a time machine, but gets caught up traveling around yesterday. The short was funny and the audience seemed to enjoy it, but its cuteness also made it seem a bit amateur.
The last film for this category was Tuba Atlantic. Directed by Hallvar Witzø, this Norwegian short follows the final days in the life of Oskar, a 70-year-old man who is going to die in six days. He is faced with the challenge of making peace with his brother before he dies, and is only able to do this by sending huge sound waves across the Atlantic Ocean from a giant tuba that he and his brother built when they were younger. The film brought tears to my eyes three separate times in 25 minutes, and it was the only film in the Live-Action category that received applause from the audience at the end.
Animation
The films in the Animation category were less impressive as a whole than the live-action films.
Dimanche/Sunday, a Canadian film directed by Patrick Doyon, followed the story of a family’s Sunday routine and a young boy’s imagination. The animation was cute and the music was excellent, but by the end the audience was left underwhelmed.
A Morning Stroll shows the story of a New Yorker who walks past a city-savvy chicken on his morning promenade. The scene is shown three separate times — once set in 1959, once in 2009, and once in 2059. Each scene has a different animation style, which made it one of the more visually interesting animated shorts.
Wildlife, directed by Amanda Forbis and Wendy Tilby, follows the story of a young Englishman who travels to the Canadian frontier to become a cowboy, only to find that he doesn’t quite fit into his dream life. His life is compared to that of a comet throughout the film, and in the end, the young man sees a comet in the sky and freezes to death in a snowy field. The story was interesting, but the film seemed to drag on for much longer than 13 minutes.
The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore is an allegory about the healing powers of books. The animation was sophisticated and impressive, and the message of the story felt very relevant when it seems like few people read novels anymore. The film was a bit cheesy at times, but it was enjoyable and delivered a poignant message.
The last film of the evening, La Luna, was a coming-of-age fable about a young boy who helps his father and grandfather clean stars off the moon every night. The story was well written and humorous, and left the audience with a positive message about finding oneself.
Predictions
While all of the short films deserve their spots as nominees, two films stood out. Tuba Atlantic will win in the Live-Action category. The story was beautiful and the film was expertly produced. Humorous and heartwarming, it was impossible to walk away from the theater without making some sort of positive comment about the film. The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore will win in the Animation category. It was perfect: perfect story, perfect animation, perfect message, perfect for the award.
The Oscar-nominated shorts are showing at Regent Square Theatre through Feb. 23; the Academy Awards will take place on Sunday, Feb. 26..

2012-02-27,CMU,India,"Peyton Manning, the soon-to-be-former quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, is caught up in a media frenzy. His fight to return to the field is being challenged by Colts owner Jim Irsay, but his departure from the team where he made his legendary career seems imminent. 
The last example of this was the Brett Favre saga starting five years ago, when the Green Bay Packers decided they wanted Aaron Rodgers to be their quarterback and would let the face of their franchise walk away. Favre eventually went to the New York Jets, where he appeared to prove the Packers right with his poor play, and then to the Minnesota Vikings, who, under his great play, came within one game of the Super Bowl.
Manning is now in a similar situation. He is coming off his fourth neck surgery, and any team he signs with is taking a risk that he will be able to perform near his old level — if he can play at all. There are currently four teams rumored to have interest in Manning: the Arizona Cardinals, the Miami Dolphins, the New York Jets, and the Colts. Each of these teams has strengths and weakness that can facilitate or hinder his success this season.
The Cardinals have a good supporting cast on both offense and defense, but since quarterback Kurt Warner’s retirement in the season following their 2009 Super Bowl bid, they have been desperately looking for a quarterback. They traded for former Philadelphia Eagle Kevin Kolb last year, but he has been a dud so far.
If Manning ends up in Arizona, he will be teamed up  with perennial Pro-Bowler Larry Fitzgerald. That combination is a recipe for a high-octane offense. The problem is that the Cardinals may not want to acquire another quarterback after giving so much up for Kolb. Moreover, Manning is a risk.
The Dolphins have been looking for a quarterback since Hall of Famer Dan Marino retired over 10 years ago. Dolphins fans desperately want a new quarterback, and Manning is one possibility for them. 
Their defense wasn’t at its best last season, but it is still one of the better defenses in the league. But their offense, even with all its weapons at running back and wide receiver, has stalled without good quarterback play. The question for the Dolphins is whether to sign Manning, the much older and injured talent, or a younger, up-and-coming quarterback.
For the Jets, it all comes down to their trust in their young quarterback, Mark Sanchez. After making strides in his play two years ago, he regressed last year and did not play at the level necessary for playoff contention. Playing in New York would give Manning a chance to play in the same city as his brother, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.
Additionally, Manning would be playing in the biggest sports market in the country. But with the Jets comes their boisterous coach Rex Ryan. In Indianapolis, Manning was given a high degree of freedom with offensive play, but Ryan is much more controlling of his players.
It is possible the Colts may end up keeping their Hall of Fame quarterback. The Colts have the No. 1 pick in the 2012 NFL draft, and will likely select the University of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. Manning could come back and let Luck sit on the bench for a few years to gain some experience. 
However, the Colts and Manning are not on such good terms: Irsay has fired many of the people Manning worked with, including former coach Jim Caldwell.
Wherever Manning ends up, he can turn that team into an instant contender. But what team is going to pull the trigger on this high-risk, but potentially high-reward quarterback?.

2012-03-26,CMU,India,"The Miller Gallery is currently featuring the work of seven Carnegie Mellon Master of Fine Arts students in the exhibition The You Inside of Me. After three years of study at the School of Art, the artists — Jonathan Armistead, Agnes Bolt, Sung Rok Choi, Jesse England, Riley Harmon, Oscar Peters, and Nina Sarnelle — are presenting their final theses in the exhibit, which opened last Friday.
The first floor of the gallery features work by Sarnelle, who “makes fantasies, miracles and lies ... [whose] performances explore the physicality of metaphysics and the malleability of belief,” as described in her artist’s statement. Sarnelle’s featured work tells the story of a social experiment in relationships that she conducted over the last year.
She mailed 400 letters to people living near her home. Each letter began, “Dear Soon to be Old Friend, I am interested in inventing the narrative of our relationship. This story may not have existed before but will most certainly exist from now on.” Sarnelle’s experiment resulted in the formation of friendships based on an improvised non-reality. “I really enjoy getting lost in something and not knowing what’s real anymore,” she explained.
Sarnelle’s art is different from what people visiting the gallery may initially expect, as her chosen medium for this particular project was not painting, drawing, or sculpture. Instead, she worked through people, building fictional relationships that have developed into real relationships that continue to flourish today. In this way, her work is among the most interesting of the exhibition.
Choi, Peters, and Bolt’s artwork is featured on the second floor of the gallery. Stepping out of the elevator, visitors are immediately struck by the enormousness of Peters’ work, which takes up the central area and includes a six-foot, 300-pound model of the moon that is situated on a circular wooden track. In the center of the track, a large green lion’s head sits atop a spar, and three red banshee heads, which appear to be silently screaming, hang from the ceiling. If the sheer size and aesthetics of Peters’ piece — which he described in his artist statement as “halfway between Sisyphus and Indiana Jones” — aren’t interesting enough, the piece is also mechanized so that the banshee heads move and the moon rolls around the track.
“I love Oscar’s piece. I like the physicality of it,” said Sarah Keeling, a sophomore art major. “It’s like a lot of his other work in that it’s really physical and you don’t know if it’s going to be dangerous or not.”
While Peters’ piece was certainly entertaining to observe, it lacked cohesion. For the art observer who tries to connect the dots between the swaying banshee heads, the lion, and the moon in order to derive meaning, the piece disappoints.
On the left side of the room is Choi’s project — a watercolor animation series titled “Operation Mole.” His animations show a capsule-shaped time machine and its driver tunneling into the earth amid images of human carnage, war, pop culture, and political events. The work is loosely based on events from Korean history, but also draws inspiration from comics, science fiction, and dark humor to create what Choi called “a kind of ridiculous, absurd landscape.” His work in this exhibit is aesthetically impressive and thought provoking.
Students who attended the opening expressed an appreciation of the balance that Choi and the others were able to strike between seriousness and fun.
“I like that everything I’ve seen so far is a little bit silly,” said Reese Adams-Romagnoli, a first-year art student. “I think that’s really the way to go. I was expecting something more serious, but I was pleasantly surprised. I can see that a lot of thought has been put into what these artists produce, and I appreciate the mental stretching that it took to create things that are both fun and valid at the same time.”
Bolt’s work occupies the right side of the second-floor space. Her piece “I’m Only Now” centers around what appears to be a stripper pole, which spectators can hold onto while a platform beneath their feet rotates around it.
Bolt explained that when spectators opt to take part, her project can be experienced in one of two ways. If the pole is perceived as a prop for a stripper, taking part will result in a “low experience.” Conversely, whirling around the pole can also be something very spiritual. “There is a suggestion of time being both present and kind of eternal,” she said. “The point [of the experience] is to use your body to see what you believe. You make it what you want it to be. You can get something more from the experience — this feeling that you’ll live forever.”
On the third floor of the gallery, England’s work includes custom-built gadgets, books, and cameras that are meant to engage viewers in the issues surrounding contemporary image consumption. “Technology has made it very easy for us to share media, but it is also very easy for us to lose that media,” England said. “I take impermanent things and make them permanent.”
England constructed a video-sharing mechanism, made from a wooden box and mounted on the gallery wall, as a parody of YouTube. The piece, complete with a view counter and pad of paper for viewer comments, is quite amusing, but it also raises a serious question about accessibility. Is ease of access more valuable than having media and information physically in our hands? England’s work feels very relevant to the issues our current generation faces.
Also on display is a camcorder that has been manipulated to function like its more primitive predecessors. Pieces of wood have been screwed to the camera’s frame to eliminate higher-tech features. Additionally, England has produced a physical back-up for his e-book copy of George Orwell’s 1984, as well as pamphlets that teach one how to mimic popular typefaces.
Armistead’s art — a large, pink, fountain-like structure made from office chairs, lotion bottles, and tissue boxes, all of which are held together by a metal frame — takes up the center space. White liquid flows from the lotion bottles into bowls that sit on the seats of the office chairs, while tissues fan out from the tops of the tissue boxes.
Armistead aims to “highlight an often dormant sexuality that exists within our everyday,” according to his artist’s statement. He said that his sculpture, titled “Reach Out and Touch No One,” reveals the importance of the office chair as a prop in people’s sexual lives.
“Every time I see an office chair in someone’s house, I think about how often they masturbate on it. I see an office chair, and I see sex,” Armistead said, pointing out that the majority of porn circulation takes place through the internet and that people in long-distance relationships can now engage in “Skype sex.”
“Also, these chairs represent the body because they are ergonomically designed to fit the body,” he continued. Armistead’s fountain of lotion and chairs is comical, disturbing, and effective. It successfully approaches a socially taboo topic without pushing viewers away, and simultaneously maintains the important element of visual appeal. “I really like the armchair piece,” said Katie O’Conner, a first-year art major. “I like that the aesthetics hide the technological parts of it — the pipes and tubes.”
To the right of Armistead’s work, Harmon presents a series of three videos. Though created separately, the videos share certain elements, including guns, performances, and the space inside of a vehicle. The videos coincide in a way that blurs the line between past and present, fantasy and reality.
Along with the three videos he created, Harmon also displays pictures of people imitating a popular scene from the movie I Am Legend that he found on the internet. The pictures all feature individuals curled up in their bathtubs with a gun and something else they value, most often a pet.
For the opening of the exhibition, Harmon also had a live musician who resembled Ryan Gosling playing guitar. This coincided with Harmon’s integration of scenes from the movie Drive, which features Gosling, into one of his three videos. The discreet way in which the pieces of Harmon’s piece come together sets it apart from the other projects.
Commenting on Harmon’s piece, Talia Levin, a first-year Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in creative writing and drama, said, “I like it, because I feel like you can draw your own conclusions from it. It’s a lot to take in but not so much that it’s unreachable, or that I felt detached. The message isn’t shoved down your throat, but it’s also not so abstract that you can’t get it.”
Together, the seven artists have put together a memorable exhibit that explores a variety of topics — from masturbation to technology — through a variety of mediums.
The exhibition will remain open to the public through April 22. The Miller Gallery is located in the Purnell Center for the Arts..

2012-03-26,CMU,India,"The OM organization brought five speakers and a dance group to the Carnegie Music Hall on Saturday to share their views on happiness in an event called OMx.
The five speakers were Tim Bono, a professor of psychology at Washington University in St. Louis; Hari Chandan, a post-doctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy; Indira Nair, Carnegie Mellon’s former vice provost for education; Patty Eppley, a meditation expert; and Helen Wang, a Carnegie Mellon housefellow. They were joined by the Pitt Nrityamala, an Indian classical dance team.
Bono discussed the ways the focus of one’s attention determines one’s happiness. He described studies which showed that people randomly assigned to think about good things that had happened to them in the previous week became happier than people randomly assigned to think about bad things. “One of the easiest ways to increase happiness is to regularly practice gratitude,” Bono said.
Chandan explained the Hindu spiritual approach to happiness. He told a parable of two birds sitting in a tree. One eats fruit, some sweet and some sour, and is happy and sad accordingly. The other eats nothing, and is fulfilled of its own glory. Occasionally, the fruit-eating bird glimpses the fulfilled bird. Chandan said that our true nature is that of the fulfilled bird.
“If our real nature is that infinite happiness, why don’t we see it? Because we are too distracted all the time,” Chandan said. He described the four Hindu paths to happiness: knowledge, devotion, action, and meditation.
Nair said that she believes happiness can be found through authenticity, integrity, and mindfulness. When she took her children to campus in the ’80s, they asked her, “Why does nobody smile at Carnegie Mellon?” By the ’90s, she said, the campus was happier. Nair said that one of the reasons for the change is that there is more love at Carnegie Mellon now. According to Nair, love, connection, and kindness are the keys to happiness, and they can be achieved by practicing authenticity, integrity, and mindfulness.
Junior information systems major Christian Reyes said that he connected to Nair’s presentation. “She spoke right to me, with the idea that you don’t have to worry about what others think,” he said. “That really resonated.”
Eppley focused on meditation. She said that regular meditation had made her a happy person. Eppley said that in her adult life, she had once been a “crisis meditator” who only meditated when things went wrong. Then, she said, her life fell apart. She went to study meditation with Deepak Chopra, a physician who specializes mind-body medicine. Later, Eppley was going to travel to India to find a guru, but found she did not need to. “The guru is within,” Eppley said.
Wang discussed her personal journey to happiness, speaking about pain. She said that discussing and acknowledging our pain is not detrimental to happiness, nor is it necessarily selfish. “When we give our story to the world, we celebrate our common humanity. We create safe spaces for others to have their pain lifted off of them. And when we do that, we create happiness.”
Wang told a story about her first years in America. She would bring lunches full of her mother’s cooking to school, and other students made fun of it because it looked and smelled strange to them. Eventually, Wang traded her beloved curry for turkey sandwiches and juice boxes.
After she grew up, though, Wang said that she learned that she was denying a huge part of who she is. She said that she stopped doing that, started being who she really was, and became happier. Wang stressed that, in order to be happy, we need to be our effortless, authentic selves. “We walk in the world as if we were broken, but really, everything that we have is more than enough.”
Attendees liked Wang’s section of the presentation. “I thought she had a good perspective on Carnegie Mellon students,” said Vicente Estrada, a first-year in CIT.
“She seemed to really believe what she was saying,” said junior cognitive science major Susan Dou. “If she didn’t have her notes, I bet she would have made the same speech.”
The six presentations were structured around a narrative, delivered by junior information systems and decision science double major Archit Kumar, the president of OM. Kumar played a Carnegie Mellon student named Arjun Patel, a senior chemical engineering major, who was searching for happiness. Each of the presentations was meant to be a person or experience Arjun engaged with along his journey.
First-year CIT student Vijay Iyengar, one of OMx’s co-chairs, said that the point of OMx was not to teach happiness, but to make attendees think about the way they practice happiness in their own lives. Every speaker touched on that idea. “The shortest distance between point A and point B is a straight line. And each of our speakers converges into one straight line,” Iyengar said.
He said that he has already started putting some of the speakers’ ideas into practice in his own life. In particular, he said, he has taken Eppley’s advice to heart. “I have started taking five minutes out of each day to just step back and distance myself.”
Proceeds from OMx were donated to the Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation, which sets up single-teacher schools in small villages..

2012-04-02,CMU,India,"Less than two weeks after he was released by the Indianapolis Colts, future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning signed with the Denver Broncos. Manning chose the Broncos over the Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins, Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans, and San Francisco 49ers — all teams he had visited during the “Manning Free Agent Tour.”
The Denver front office and coaching staff were some of the main selling points for Manning. With former Broncos Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway leading the front office and experienced head coach John Fox directing the team, the Broncos’ management is both quarterback-friendly and experienced in the NFL.
The Broncos also have a much better supporting cast than the Colts have had over the past few years. Denver has a young, top-tier defense headed by linebackers Von Miller and Elvis Dumervil, who carried the team to the playoffs last year, and good receivers in Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker.
The Broncos will also be returning most of their league-leading rushing attack led by running backs Knowshon Moreno and Willis McGahee.
Adjusting to the Broncos will be a challenge for Manning. This will be the first time in his professional career that his home stadium is not a dome and is wide open to the elements. For Manning, who forces the offensive play calling to pass first and uses the running game as a change of pace, the weather can potentially grind his offense to a halt.
There is also the issue of altitude. Aside from the effects on the actual football, the altitude change makes it harder for Manning and his teammates to catch their breath. He frequently used to hurry the offense in Indianapolis as a way to tire out the defense and to stop them from resetting after each play. With this altitude, Manning may be forced to slow down his offense so the larger offensive linemen have time to recover in between plays.
Manning may also have trouble adapting to some of the key role players around him. With the addition of Manning, the Broncos are switching from the running spread attack they used last year under starting quarterback Tim Tebow — who has since been traded to the New York Jets — to a much more pass-heavy offense.
Because of this transition, many players’ roles are changing dramatically. Tight ends in last year’s offensive scheme would focus on blocking first, with running routes and catching passes as afterthoughts. But with Manning under center, the Broncos’ tight ends are expected to be more like wide receivers than offensive linemen. To ease this transition, the Broncos have acquired former Colts back-up tight end Jacob Tamme who, due to injuries to starter Dallas Clark, has developed a very good rapport with Manning.
The biggest challenge for Manning will ultimately be his health.
While it is true that he was one of the best quarterbacks in Indianapolis, he is coming back from four neck surgeries. The team obviously believes he is at least close to his previous level of play, but the risk is still there.
The Broncos have a lot more riding on Manning than just money. Even though their contract with Manning has health contingencies, the Broncos will still be in serious trouble if he goes down. They do not have a competent backup yet, and they still need a quarterback for when 36-year-old Manning inevitably retires.
The partnership of Manning and the Broncos is not without risks, but both sides seem to think the possible rewards outweigh them.
There will be high expectations of playoff successes, and any struggles will have Broncos fans enraged about the swap of winning, fan-favorite Tebow for Manning..

2012-04-09,CMU,India,"Fragrant smells, bright colors, and chirping birds await visitors of the Phipps Conservatory Spring Flower Show. Described as “a trip around the world” on the Phipps website, the month-long show offers plenty of variety to engage patrons of all ages and tastes. From interactive displays to tranquil spots, this year’s show lets viewers escape the hustle and bustle of campus in exchange for some peace and quiet.
The main atrium includes large, brightly colored, stick figure-esque pieces of art, adding to the show’s playfulness and serving as a nice introduction to the bombardment of vibrantly colored flowers to come. Another piece of artwork in the atrium includes cut outs of the flags of each country represented in the show: the United States, Greece, France, the Netherlands, China, Sweden, the French Polynesian Islands, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Germany, Holland, and Ireland.
Housed in the Serpentine Room are tulips representing Holland and the Netherlands. Shades of bright yellows, oranges, and purples combined with the room’s tall ceilings allow for a beautiful view of the tulips lining three of the walls. Amid signs describing the flowers of the region stand large, wooden, brightly painted tulips with pairs of clogs fastened to the bottom of the tulips for decoration. The exhibit is made possible in part by the Distinctively Dutch Festival. Supported by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the Distinctively Dutch Festival focuses on bringing contemporary art, performance, and culture from the Netherlands to Pittsburgh in exhibits like this one.
Some rooms have themes set in a broader context than just a country, like the orchid room. Boasting hundreds of orchids of different shapes, colors, smells, and sizes, winding along a small river swarming with koi fish, the room includes educational signs for visitors answering the question, “What is an orchid?” According to the signs, the orchid is a member of the largest and most advanced blooming plant family, and there are approximately 35,000 orchids and 80,000 orchid hybrids throughout the world.
The exhibit honoring Japan is outside, unlike the majority of the other exhibits. Away from the hum of other patrons and secluded on a corner of the roof, the exhibit features a variety of bonsai trees set on wooden tables, a small waterfall running through the middle, and more swimming koi fish.
The exhibits for China and France are organized to be observed, as opposed to most others that can be walked through. The China exhibit is outfitted mainly in red and gold, described by the accompanying placard as colors of good luck and good fortune for the year to come. The France exhibit includes tables and chairs reminiscent of a Paris street café and was topped with a miniature Eiffel Tower.
The exhibit representing London includes a bright red, life-size telephone booth. Upon further examination of the flowers in the room, patrons will notice they are specifically arranged by color to resemble a large British flag. Other features to watch for include an interactive fountain in the room on Greece and a children’s market with plastic food to teach younger guests about eating locally and choosing healthy options.
The Tropical Forest India exhibit will be at Phipps for the next three years and focuses on sustainability. Larger in size and scale than any other exhibit, the room features winding paths and displays intended to replicate actual Indian markets. According to Phipps employee Kara Gilbert, “They sent two people from the horticulture staff to India for research. They were there for five weeks, I think, so they did a lot of research throughout different sections of India to represent the plants that you see here.”
Gilbert also explained the process behind getting exhibits in and out of Phipps. Before the summer show, there will be a two-week blackout period while old plants are taken out and new plants put in their place. In the case of the India exhibit, about 80 percent of the plants from the previous forest were removed to make room for the new forest. The removed plants are either saved for use in later exhibits, or composted for use with the new plants.
Gilbert thanks the volunteers for the speedy turnover in new exhibitions. “We depend a lot on our volunteers,” she said. “Our volunteers are wonderful, they come in and help rip out plants and plant new ones.” Thanks to the work of these volunteers and the Phipps staff, the Spring Flower Show offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in an around-the-globe adventure of nature.
The Spring Flower Show will be on display until April 15..

2012-04-16,CMU,India,"Jim Rugg is a Pittsburgh comics powerhouse. His contributions to the vitality of the comic scene have included mini-comics, self-publishing, and creator-owned work with independent publishers. It’s no wonder the ToonSeum is honoring the contemporary cartoonist and working artist through the month of May with its exhibit, This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny.
This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny features Rugg’s well-known work on Street Angel and Afrodisiac as well as new and seldom-seen pieces. This is Rugg’s first solo exhibition and a first for the ToonSeum, as the exhibition reflects the more adult sensibilities of the comic world. Most of the pieces exhibited are recent, shorter pieces originally made for anthologies and newspapers, dating from after the completion of Afrodisiac. Much of the pieces are directly inspired by original production art of the 20th century, the often-discarded line art that was produced for the sake of reproduction.
While it’s safe to say that the idea of comics in fine art galleries has found its place in contemporary art criticism, it is still unclear how a viewer is intended to engage with comics in a gallery environment: whether one is supposed to pay respect from a distance or inspect the minutiae in search of the human touch. While both are valid approaches, they go against the cognitive escape afforded by the traditional private experience associated with comics.
As such, contemporary artists are asked to present their work either as fine art or as comics. It seems that they must determine whether the focus will be on the art or the narrative. When facing this dilemma, artists feel they must choose. In This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny, Rugg bravely provides solutions to this forced dichotomy.
Rugg approaches the puzzle of exhibiting comics in a museum by creating art specifically for the gallery environment. By drawing single large panels, the comics fit within the traditional framework of a painting, and by allowing his panels to feature characters drawn at different sizes, he can create an unparalleled sense of depth. As a viewer gets closer, smaller details make themselves apparent.
A noticeable example of this practice is Rugg’s use of word balloons of different sizes within individual panels. The word bubbles’ varying sizes invite the viewers to get closer, if they want to read the text. In this way, Rugg consciously designs his work so the audience engages with it in the gallery space and so the work can confidently straddle the seeming divide between comics and fine art.
It’s important to note that while it’s safe to label Rugg as a pop artist, his work does not exhibit the intrinsic post-modern detachedness of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein’s mid-20th century work. His work has real heart. As he describes on his website, Rugg seeks to “reconcile pop culture’s adventurous promise with the realities of the world around [him]” and he “[uses] the style and visual vocabulary of cartoons to question and lampoon consumer culture.”
Rather than communicating solely through abstract notions of color, line, and form, Rugg expresses his visions and communicates in the language of our collective, mass media-constructed childhood memories. That image language is his pop. Rugg uses comic tropes in unexpected ways: narratives advanced through fragments, covers for nonexistent stories, or sketched splash pages.
“I live in a complex world of race and gender roles, politics and religion, suburban isolation and the confusion of middle age,” reads Rugg’s artist statement on his website. “In my artwork, I bring these realities to bear on the once-safe world of escapist entertainment and attempt to understand the values of the world around me through India ink, steel pen nibs, sable-hair brushes, and pixels.”.

2012-04-16,CMU,India,"Phillip H. Scanlan, the Australian consul general in New York, visited Carnegie Mellon and gave a lecture last Tuesday on the future of Australia in a changing world. 
Scanlan focused on the future of the G-20 and how Australia’s position in the world will change as its neighboring developing nations like Indonesia advance economically.
Scanlan said that Australia is shifting its strategy from that of a big economy to that of a consistent high performer. According to Scanlan, Australia has thrived economically, but will soon be surpassed by its neighbors because of their higher populations.
Scanlan believes that the solution to this problem is global engagement. He said that if Australia works with its neighbors to promote cooperation in the southwest Pacific, it could create an economic environment where each nation benefits from each other’s growth through the free flow of ideas, people, and trade.
In order to promote international cooperation, Scanlan founded the non-governmental organization Australian American Leadership Dialogue to bring together young leaders from the U.S., China, India, Australia, and other nations to network and form a spirit of partnership and collaboration. 
Scanlan has continued his efforts toward international cooperation as consul general through the New York Young Leaders program. The program gives young leaders the opportunity to discuss issues behind closed doors, free from the pressure of internal politics or other political and cultural norms that stand between their nations.
Master’s student at the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management Amy Badiani, who attended a luncheon with Scanlan on Wednesday, spoke positively of the program. “Because of [the program’s] nature behind closed doors ... young leaders have actually created change,” Badiani said.
Scanlan said the goal of constructing networks for leaders of various nations is to solve global issues multilaterally. Scanlan pointed to climate change, intellectual property reform, immigration, and the fight against human trafficking as global problems that require mutual cooperation to find and execute solutions. According to Scanlan, while unilateral action can improve the situation for one nation, without international accord, problems simply shift across borders.
Students who attended the lecture and luncheon seemed to find Scanlan’s ideas interesting. “I think it was good that he visited CMU, because he was able to convey Australia’s role in global politics,” Badiani said.
“[The lecture] was informative,” said Carmen Easterwood, a senior economics major. “He seems like a really intelligent guy.”.

2012-04-23,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon’s women’s track and field team have competed at invitationals the past two weekends, setting several season bests and career highs.
Last Saturday, women’s track and field went to Indiana University of Pennsylvania to compete in the Ed Fry Invitational. The other competing teams were Indiana University of Pennsylvania, California University of Pennsylvania, Grove City College, Slippery Rock University, Clarion University, Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Behrend, and Seton Hill University.

The team participated in the Western Pennsylvania Conference Tournament that was held April 14–15 in Trafford, Pa. The University of Pittsburgh was the first seed, followed by Shippensburg University and Pennsylvania State University as the second and third seeds, respectively. Mr. Yuk was seeded fourth.
Only the top six from the tournament advance to the Ohio Valley Regionals. Ohio University, Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University, University of Cincinnati, Toledo University, University of Dayton, Wright State, Millersville University, and University of Pennsylvania have already advanced from the Ohio and East Pennsylvania Conferences. 
On the first day of competition, Mr. Yuk faced the Edinboro University Fighting Scots and won 15–11. After, they fell to the University of Pittsburgh Panthers 15–9. Mr. Yuk took the next game against Indiana University of Pennsylvania Crimson Hawks 15–9, before finally falling 15–8 to the Penn State Nittany Lions.
On Sunday, Mr. Yuk won both of its games. First the team beat West Virginia University 15–4, and then the team was victorious over the Shippensburg University Raiders, 15–9.

2012-04-23,CMU,India,"The theme of this year’s Spring Carnival, “As Seen On TV,” allowed for a number of creative individual booth themes, but also provided some challenges for certain organizations. Instead of basing booths on cheesy infomercials, as the theme might suggest, most groups chose television shows for their booth themes.
Patrick White, senior mechanical engineering major and Midway chair, organized the judging and helped pick the theme. “It ended up between ‘At the Theater’ and ‘As Seen On TV,’ ” he said. “And then ‘As Seen On TV’ won the final vote.”
With its Indiana Jones-themed booth, Kappa Alpha Theta came away with first place in the Sorority category. The sorority’s booth was highly detailed and, despite certain touches being ruined by the rain, it created an all-encompassing environment for visitors to explore and enjoy. Visitors were taken on tours in small groups, led by members of Kappa Alpha Theta. This tour-style presentation made the booth seem more like an experience than other booths, where visitors just walked through and looked around on their own.
The Asian Student Association won first place in the Independent Organizations category this year. Its booth was based on Looney Tunes and featured a number of creative touches. While the Asian Student Association’s theme wasn’t terribly novel, its booth was well-constructed and deserved the win.
Featuring an impressive façade that mirrored the exterior of Squidward’s Easter Island statue-shaped house, Spongebob’s pineapple-shaped house, and the Krusty Krab, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Spongebob Squarepants-themed booth won first place in the Fraternity category. With such an amazing exterior, the fraternity’s booth grabbed visitors’ attention before they even entered. The inside of the booth featured different rooms from the cartoon show and included details like glowing jelly fish. With its attention to accuracy and detail, Sigma Phi Epsilon created a memorable booth that stood out from the others.
In the Blitz category, Lambda Phi Epsilon won first place for its World Cup-themed booth, which featured a miniature field where visitors could play soccer. Upon first glance, it didn’t even look like a booth, but it actually provided a nice space for some of the younger visitors to play and run around.
Second place in the Sorority category went to Delta Gamma for its Shark Week-themed booth and Delta Tau Delta for its Lunar Landings booth in the Fraternity category. Delta Gamma’s booth, which featured several fake large sharks, sand on the bottom floor, and a laser-cut ship’s wheel, was one of the more impressive and enjoyable booths to walk through, and it was clear that the sorority members had spent a lot of time constructing it.
Third place in the Sorority category went to Alpha Chi Omega for its traveling circus-themed booth. While the booth did not really fit the overall theme of “As Seen On TV,” it was nicely decorated and felt very sturdy. Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Pinky and the Brain booth won third place in the Fraternity category.
Not all booths were so enjoyable, however, as some felt like they were thrown together at the last minute.
Fringe’s Planet Earth-themed booth was underwhelming, despite its theme being one of the best. BioSAC’s MythBusters booth featured interesting facts, but it was not very exciting to walk through.
This year’s theme of “As Seen On TV” opened up an opportunity for creative booths, and while some organizations did a great job with the theme, others chose themes that did not quite fit. “There’s a lot of room for interpretation, so it’s always interesting to see what people can come up with,” White said. “I think a lot of them you could actually link back [to the theme] pretty easily.”
“We’ve been trying to make the booths a lot safer and stronger and I think we’ve done a lot of good stuff with it,” White said. The increased safety standards imposed this year and the inclement weather provided an interesting challenge for many booths, but ultimately did not hinder the outflow of creativity on Midway..

2012-04-23,CMU,India,"Student group OM hosted a celebration for the Hindu holiday Holi last Saturday in Porter Hall and on Flagstaff Hill for interested students. The holiday, known as the Festival of Colors, is notable for how participants throw colored powder at each other. Most end up completely covered in all sorts of different bright shades. The event has a positive reputation on campus and draws large crowds every year.
Holi is a holiday that welcomes in the new season, celebrating the passing of winter and the arrival of spring through fun and festivities. While a Pittsburgh spring often consists of a few inches of snow and freezing temperatures, it was difficult to dampen the mood. The cold and wet day did nothing to deter students from packing the basement of Porter Hall.
OM accommodated well for the weather by hosting the pre-celebration preparations in Porter Hall. Participants received a free T-shirt for the event, printed with OM’s tagline for this year’s celebration, “Color Me If You Can.” Another nice touch was the Indian buffet open to those celebrating the holiday.
After a few small rain delays, the main portion of the celebration began on Flagstaff Hill. Packets of colored powder were sold for $1 outside Porter Hall, with which participants went wild. The chaos of all of the colors being thrown in the air and at other participants was incredibly fun. Anticipating when someone may hit you with a handful of powder was important, especially if you didn’t want to cough up blue for the rest of the day. While the event is usually attended by various groups of friends, the lines between friends, acquaintances, and strangers disappeared with the white of the T-shirts.
Overall, OM’s Holi celebration on campus was a truly unique and fun experience. The experience of being covered in all sorts of colors, blending together with a palette of friends and strangers alike, is truly memorable, and is an experience all Carnegie Mellon students should have..

2012-04-30,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team finished out its season at the Dave Labor and Ed Fry Invitational meets on April 14 and 21, respectively.
At both meets, the athletes worked to improve their performances in preparation for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship meet, hosted by Carnegie Mellon this past weekend.
At the Dave Labor Invitational, hosted by Slippery Rock University, the men recorded three first-place finishes. First-year Thomas Vandenberg and sophomore Mike Standish competed in the 800-meter run, with Vandenberg coming in first with a time of 1:55.64.
“The freshman talent on the team this year is amazing. They’ve had some great performances so far this season,” Standish said.
The second victory was by another new face on the team, first-year Elliot Watson, who won the 3,000-meter steeplechase in 10:19.62. Senior Ryan Kissell carried the Tartans to its third first-place finish of the day in the long jump, with a mark of 6.23 meters. Kissell also placed second in the triple jump, with a distance of 12.59 meters.
The following weekend at the Ed Fry Invitational, hosted by Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the field events helped the Tartans to dominate the meet. Senior Anthony Hernandez came in second in the hammer toss, throwing a distance of 47.91 meters. Sophomore Nathan Cheek followed close behind in third place, with a mark of 45.67 meters.
With a distance of 15.00 meters, sophomore Zachary Erra-Hernandez finished fouth in the shot put. Junior Dan Cardenas Rivero came in fifth in the pole vault after clearing a height of 4.05 meters.
With numerous outstanding performances throughout the season, the Tartans hosted the UAA Championships this past weekend.
Athletes from all eight universities in the conference participated. The Tartans came in second place to the Washington University in St. Louis Bears.

2012-04-30,CMU,India,"And then there were 16. The 2012 NBA Playoffs, after the shortened regular season which seemed to dash to the finish line, are now here. Since each team needs 16 wins to receive an NBA title, the playoffs feel like a whole new season. The long journey to the precipice of the best league in the world began last Saturday. But let’s talk first-round predictions. I’m sorry to inform you, but I don’t see any upsets happening in the first round.
Eastern Conference:
No. 1 Chicago Bulls vs. No. 8 Philadelphia 76ers
This may be the hardest match-up to predict. Since the Bulls’ point guard Derrick Rose tore his left ACL with just 1:10 left in the first victory over the 76ers, this first-seed vs. eighth-seed battle could be closer than initially thought. However, the Bulls have played with Rose injured throughout the season, going 17–9 with the reigning MVP on the pine. The 76ers, who got off to a hot start and on pace to win the Atlantic Division in the East, limped to the finish line and fell to the eighth seed. The team is led by shooting guard Andre Iguodala and has explosive play off the bench from point guard Lou Williams and small forward Thaddeus Young. This is a must-watch series that will go deep, but I give the Bulls the advantage: Bulls in seven.
No. 4 Boston Celtics vs. No. 5 Atlanta Hawks
The Celtics looked like an ancient artifact from when they won the championship in 2008. But the team played stellar basketball post All-Star Game, with shooting guard Ray Allen coming off the bench, although head coach Doc Rivers says he is 50/50 for the start of the playoffs. The Hawks come into the playoffs with the same team it has taken to the playoffs the last four years, led by small forward Joe Johnson and power forward Josh Smith. Well, the same except for All-Star center Al Horford. However, the Hawks have a knack for losing to experienced teams in the playoffs: Celtics in seven.
No. 3 Indiana Pacers vs. No. 6 Orlando Magic
The Pacers are my dark horse team to win the East. It is the deepest team in the conference, with six players averaging double figures in points and eight players averaging more than nine points per game. With the Magic’s center Dwight Howard out with a back injury, Pacers center Roy Hibbert may be the best center in the Eastern Conference. He has led the Pacers’ rebound to fourth in the league. Head coach Frank Vogel has made a great case for Coach of the Year and has his team in great shape heading into the first round. The Magic is heavily dependent on the defense Howard brings to the table. Without him, I don’t think the Magic can do much damage: Pacers in five. 
No. 2 Miami Heat vs. No. 7 New York Knicks
If the first game was any indication, the Heat should handle this series. Most expect the Heat to dominate this entire conference, as it is without Rose and Howard. But the matchup between Heat’s small forward Lebron James and Knicks’ small forward Carmelo Anthony is intriguing. Fantasy nerds will relish this: The first playoff matchup between these two superstars of the 2003 draft class. Forget about all the other superstars in this series, it is all about James and Anthony going head-to-head. But in the end, this series won’t be close and the Heat will dominate just as people expect: Heat in five. 
Western Conference:
No. 1 San Antonio Spurs vs. No. 8 Utah Jazz
Although the Jazz is reputable for the scrappy, tough, and sometimes overly-aggressive play typical of playoff-style basketball, this series will be all Spurs. The Spurs, who typically wear other teams down with its defense, have made it to the top of the Western Conference with its offense, led by point guard Tony Parker. Despite losing in last year’s first round to the eighth-seed Memphis Grizzlies, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich won’t let that happen again. Spurs power forward Tim Duncan will go for his fifth title, and the Jazz will have no answer for this team: Spurs in four.
No. 4 Memphis Grizzlies vs. No. 5 Los Angeles Clippers
It is no surprise that the fourth-seed vs. fifth-seed match-up is the most compelling. The Clippers were the center of media attention when the team brought in All-Star point guard Chris Paul; the Clippers claimed the nickname “Lob City” from Paul’s exceptional passing combined with power forward Blake Griffin’s insane hops. When guard Chauncey Billups went down with an Achilles tear on Feb. 8, the Clippers seemed to be struggling. But if Griffin can learn to play through the hard fouls he seems to always attract, the team can win this series. However, I like the Grizzlies in this series. The Grizzlies are the Pacers of the Western Conference, as they also have six players averaging double-digit points per game. Led by Rudy Gay, I think the depth of the Grizzlies will be too much for the Clippers’ mediocre defense: Grizzlies in seven.
No. 3 Los Angeles Lakers vs. No. 6 Denver Nuggets
Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant begins his journey alongside power forward Pau Gasol in search of his sixth NBA Championship. After another great season by Bryant, the Lakers look poised to make a deep run in the playoffs. Bryant is well rested, sitting out eight of the Lakers’ last 10 games, which will be key to winning a playoff series. Additionally, taking advantage of the size and skill Gasol and center Andrew Bynum bring to the table will almost certainly secure a first round series win. But sometimes the Lakers shy away from that game plan, and the Nuggets can do some serious damage with their run-and-gun style. The Nuggets led the NBA in scoring, averaging 104.1 points per game. The team’s speed and depth could cause the older and slower Lakers a lot of trouble. However, on the back of Bryant, I don’t see the experienced Lakers falling in the first round: Lakers in six.
No. 2 Oklahoma City Thunder vs. No. 7 Dallas Mavericks
The reigning three-time scoring champion small forward Kevin Durant and point guard Russell Westbrook may be the best perimeter player combination in the Western Conference. But after last year’s playoffs, I cannot immediately count out power forward Dirk Nowitzki’s Mavericks. His ability to catch fire and rain threes is a serious concern for the Thunder, which doesn’t have a matchup for him. But the Mavericks can’t match up with Westbrook at point guard. This series will be close, and even though the Mavericks are superior decision makers in the fourth quarter, the reigning champs will be out in round one: Thunder in six..

2012-04-30,CMU,India,"In the original 1960s television series Star Trek, all one had to do was ask the ship’s computer a question and it would automatically search through every book ever written to find the relevant information for the answer. This is what Gloriana St. Clair, Carnegie Mellon’s dean of University Libraries, hopes for the future of libraries.
St. Clair, 72, has watched over Carnegie Mellon’s books for nearly 15 years. Her lengthy career will come to a close in June 2013, as she plans to retire and spend time on her own research endeavors. Throughout her time at Carnegie Mellon, she has not only managed the books in Hunt Library, but also millions of others around the world.
Since 1999, St. Clair has been working alongside colleagues in the School of Computer Science to digitize millions of books. Digitizing books is “the direction society is going in,” according to St. Clair, who has worked in the library business since 1963. With Carnegie Mellon computer science professors Raj Reddy, Michael Shamos, and Jaime Carbonell, St. Clair developed the Million Book Project. Collaborating with several U.S. partners and a broad coalition of libraries and computer scientists in India and China, the project digitized over 1.5 million books and made them free to read on the internet.
Since her undergraduate days at the University of California, Berkeley, St. Clair has had an interest in the intersection between technology and printed texts. She originally received her bachelor’s degree in English in 1962, but the job market pushed her toward a career in library sciences. “I was sitting outside a class, waiting for it to start, and there were few other people standing there,” St. Clair said. “They were talking about going to library school because there weren’t very many jobs for people in English, and there were a lot in library studies. And I thought, ‘Hmm. I could do that.’ ”
A master’s in library science is mandatory for any practicing librarian. The field is interdisciplinary. Library science utilizes management; information technology; education; collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and political economy of information.
St. Clair received her master’s degree from UC Berkeley in 1963. “And at that time, it was one of the top three schools,” she said. “Generally, you could get jobs in academic libraries, in public libraries, in special libraries, and children’s libraries.”
For her library sciences degree, St. Clair specialized in technology. “I was kind of focused on academic libraries and on science and technology,” she said. “So as soon as I finished the program, I immediately got a job as a cataloguer at the Water Regional Center Archives at Berkeley.”
It was this initial emphasis on the technological aspect of library sciences that spurred St. Clair’s interest in the digitization of books during the rest of her career as a librarian. She has held 13 different positions, working across multiple institutions, such as Pennsylvania State University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Oklahoma. As the digital age came into focus and she began her work at Carnegie Mellon, St. Clair immediately found a niche for her interests.
“Raj Reddy was the dean of computer science when I came here as head of the library. I went around to all the deans to talk to them about what their needs were and what they wanted from the library,” St. Clair explained. “I went to him and walked in, and said, ‘The future of libraries is digital.’ So we talked for an hour, and then he sent his colleague Mike Shamos over to meet me and make sure that I was a true believer that we should digitize books and they should be free to read.”
This moment marked the start of what would become the Million Books Project, something St. Clair is very proud of. It began as a “proof of concept” project — she and her colleagues started by digitizing 1,000 books to see if the concept was feasible. The team then moved onto larger numbers and collaborated with international partners.
“So then I became a director of Universal Libraries, which was a project that [Reddy] had ongoing, and we were interested in how we could manage to digitize a million books,” St. Clair said. “We started out by convening a bunch of librarians from states that don’t get as much National Science Foundation money as other states, and that didn’t work out. So he began to work internationally and work with his colleagues in China and India, and we started two Million Books Projects, one in China and one in India.”
Currently, the project in China has managed to digitize approximately 2 million books, while the project in India digitized about 300,000.
According to St. Clair, the Million Books Project was in part the inspiration for the Google Books program, which has digitized about 20 million books.
“The power of digitization is knowledge,” St. Clair said. She cited the story of a current Carnegie Mellon student who is getting his Ph.D. in English. St. Clair explained that his dissertation was on Charles Darwin, and she had helped him use digitized copies of Darwin’s books for his research. 
“All of Darwin’s books are digitized and searchable through Google Books, and he doesn’t need to read every single page; he can use key words to find the bits of information he’s interested in,” St. Clair said.
This is St. Clair’s goal for the future of libraries. She hopes that someday “people all over the world will have the information they need because of digitization.”
As for libraries being potentially threatened from such easy and accessible knowledge through digitization and the internet, St. Clair isn’t worried. She remains confident that neither libraries nor librarians will ever go out of business. 
“They will always have a use as long as books need to be paid for, as long as people need help sorting through information, as long as people need help differentiating between good and bad information,” she said. “People will always need libraries.”.

2012-04-30,CMU,India,"CMU joins IBM in New York City technology consortium
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced last Monday that Carnegie Mellon will be a partner in the city’s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a consortium of academic institutions and technology companies with research space in Brooklyn.
With support from New York City and the city’s Metropolitan Transit Authority, CUSP will research and develop new technologies for cities facing challenges in transportation, energy efficiency, public health, and other areas. Carnegie Mellon joins New York University; the University of Toronto; the City University of New York; and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay — among other university partners — in the project; IBM and Cisco are among the companies involved. CUSP will confer academic degrees in the sciences or engineering, will start immediate work in Brooklyn, and is expecting to fully renovate a building there as a research hub by 2017.
Carnegie Mellon’s participation in the CUSP proposal has been led by Richard McCollough, the university’s vice president for research, and James Garrett, the head of the civil and environmental engineering department.
The center is the second stage of Bloomberg’s Applied Science NYC initiative, which in the first stage last December announced a joint “technology campus” between Cornell University and the Technion in Israel. The mayor hopes to increase New York’s presence in applied sciences and to foster connections with major research universities worldwide.
Young people drive better with tactile GPS instructions
Reinforcing a car’s GPS directions with tactile stimuli keeps some drivers’ eyes on the road longer, according to a recent study conducted at Carnegie Mellon.
Researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) and at AT&T Labs produced a driving simulation using a new steering wheel lined with 20 vibrating actuators. Vibrating in a clockwise pattern signalled the driver to turn right, while a counter-clockwise pattern indicated a left turn. The team tested the use of steering wheel feedback in the simulation on a group of 16 drivers under age 36 and 17 drivers over age 65.
Compared to the standard audio instructions provided by a normal GPS, drivers of all ages in the simulation spent more time looking at the road when they had access to the tactile information in the steering wheel as well. 
Combining audio, tactile, and graphical information, however, was only helpful to younger drivers, who favored the added visual instructions over the audio version.
“Our findings suggest that, as navigation systems become more elaborate, it would be best to personalize the sensory feedback system based, at least in part, on the driver’s age,” said SeungJun Kim, a systems scientist in the HCII, in a university press release. 
For older motorists, the study said, it may be better for future GPS systems to keep a driver’s cognitive load small rather than be concerned with dividing the driver’s attention..

2012-08-19,CMU,India,"Physicists discover 'Higgslike' subatomic particle
Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, shook the world July 4 with news confirming the existence of the elusive Higgs Boson particle. Commonly referred to as the “God Particle,” its discovery marks one of the most important milestones of modern physics.
In 1964, English physicist Peter Higgs and his team theorized that the existence of such a particle would prove an invisible force field called the Higgs Field was responsible for giving objects mass. Without the Higgs Field, matter would zoom around at the speed of light; life as we know it would not exist.
Scientists maintained that while their current data resembled the theory of the God Particle, further research would be necessary to fully characterize it.

NASA's 'Curiosity' lands on Martian surface
On Aug. 6, viewers around the world watched a live feed of mission control at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Ca., where scientists cheered as the Mars Science Laboratory landed on Mars. NASA invested eight years and $2.5 billion into developing the small SUV-sized rover, dubbed ‘Curiosity,’ which will be able to explore the surface of Mars.
Over its two year mission, the rover will scale the base of a three-mile-high mountain, sending back high-definition panoramic pictures while simultaneously utilizing its robotic arm and rock-vaporizing laser to collect samples of the ground for chemical analysis. 
NASA scientists hope their data will one day answer the question of whether Mars has ever been suitable for life.

Tech companies compete during tablet revolution
The past decade has seen the evolution of personal computing, from desktops to laptops to tablet computers. Since Bill Gates’ Microsoft-designed Windows operating system (OS) debuted in the 1990s, Apple Inc. and Google have been developing their own OS for consumers to utilize mobile devices.
This summer, Apple and Google rolled out updates to their latest operating systems, OS X Lion and Jellybean, respectively, which highlighted the companies’ focus on touch interfaces for tablet computers. 
Microsoft Windows, which is the still the dominant OS, joined the summer update frenzy by showcasing its own newly rebuilt Windows 8, which is scheduled to be available for consumers in October 2012.

Solar storms kept sun busy this summer
Earth was subject to a few sun storms this summer, producing flares that sent solar particles toward the planet. On July 12, the sun released an X1.4-class solar flare — the most powerful type of flare it can emit — less than a week after releasing a slightly less powerful X1.1-class solar flare. 
This flare was the strongest of the summer season and means the sun is in an active phase, expected to peak in 2013.
Solar flares are capable of traveling at speeds of up to five or six million miles per hour, reaching the earth in roughly one to three days.
Intense X-class solar flares threaten Earth, as they can interfere with satellites that control navigation, communication signals, and power system infrastructures. This causes blackouts similar to the one seen in India at the end of July.

FDA approves drug to reduce HIV infections
In July, the FDA approved the first drug aimed at reducing the risk of sexually acquiring HIV. 
The drug, marketed as Truvada, includes a daily morning and night pill as a prevention strategy for individuals with high risks of getting HIV. In clinical trials, it reduced the frequency of infection in both heterosexual and LGBT subgroups.
Although anti-HIV drugs have been used in previous years, this drug is the first to prevent HIV infection, rather than treat those who have been born to HIV-positive mothers. 
Nearly 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with HIV every year. FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said the drug’s acceptance is an “important milestone in our fight against HIV.... New treatments as well as prevention methods are needed to fight the HIV epidemic in this country.”

Researchers find bacteria-resistant surfaces
Earlier this month, researchers at the University of Nottingham in the U.K. released a study in which they found new types of polymers that are resistant to bacterial attachment. Polymers are large molecules composed of repeating structural units that play an essential role in forming materials like many rubbers and plastics. 
Bacteria that collect on surfaces form communities called biofilms, against which our bodies have difficulty defending. They are also resistant to conventional antibiotics. These newly identified polymers prevent the formation of biofilms and can be used to construct the surfaces of medical devices like catheters, heart valves, and prosthetic joints, protecting patients from infection.

2012-09-24,CMU,India,"Ideas, like good beer, take time to perfect. Key components to both are the right ingredients, environment, and timing.
So what do you get when you combine two fraternity brothers with a passion for craft beer, Carnegie Mellon’s entrepreneurship program, and a city full of beer lovers? The Brew Gentlemen.
Created in 2010, The Brew Gentlemen is a Braddock-based craft brewery that began as the brainchild of Carnegie Mellon 2012 alumni Asa Foster and Matt Katase. Foster and Katase are “The Brew Gentlemen.”
“We both lived in Morewood freshman year,” Foster said. “And then we both joined [Sigma Alpha Epsilon].” The bonds of brotherhood, as well as a feeling of disenchantment with their majors, brought the two together. Foster was an art student, while Katase was studying operations research.
“We were both interested in craft beer and we often joked around with the idea that we would create a brewery someday,” Foster said. “Then, the Thanksgiving of our junior year, Matt came to Boston for the break and we were sitting on the couch just watching football and decided to just drop everything in life and do it.”
With the craft brewery scene quickly gaining popularity, the pair petitioned and received permission to change their areas of study to a student-defined major. “Our majors were in the way of what we really wanted to pursue,” Katase said. In their new majors, Foster and Katase were allowed to take the entrepreneurship and marketing classes they needed to make The Brew Gentlemen a reality.
“We got a lot of help from entrepreneurship professors,” Katase said. “[Barbara] Carryer and [Robert] Culbertson, in particular, really helped us form the backbone of our company. They told us our business plan was sh*t, that this has to be more than just a dream, and they really got us to think about the specifics. And they’re still helping us to this day — which is awesome.”
Carryer, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship in the Tepper School of Business, continues to coach and encourage the pair to focus on the business end of the endeavor. “I really pushed them to go out and talk to distributors, to restaurants and bars to see who would carry the beer, to make them figure out how a new beer gets to market,” Carryer said.
Culbertson — an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship and CEO of GetABBY, a consumer communication platform — also lent some hard-hitting advice to the young businessmen. “I got pissed off at them in one class,” Culbertson said. “To the point of saying, ‘Would you just get off the pot already and do it?’ I told them they were making some stupid decisions, and oftentimes I kind of embarrassed them in front of the class. But that really made them get off the pot and start doing something.”
“[Robert] is a tough-love kind of guy,” Katase said. “But we got past that.” As part of an apprentice project Culbertson conducts in one of his classes, Foster and Katase started throwing dinner and beer-tasting parties for friends, peers, and individuals involved in Pittsburgh’s craft beer scene.
“For our first event,” Foster said, “we put on a four-course beer dinner cooked entirely by us and featured our White Sky alongside three other beers.”
“We’re both foodies; we love cooking and mixing ideas and ingredients,” Foster said. “So making nontraditional beers like our White Sky is what we want to be doing.” The White Sky is The Brew Gentlemen’s flagship beer, and it has received positive feedback in the brew community. It’s a wheat beer brewed with chai spices like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper.
The beer’s spicy taste, combined with the lightness of the wheat, makes it a “year-round seasonal,” as The Brew Gentlemen call it. White Sky is a good winter beer because of its warmth and spiciness, but it also works as a summer beer because of its light and refreshing taste.
“I actually hired them to provide the beer for a party that I gave in the middle of August,” Carryer said. “It was really great beer, and all my friends — about 50 people — really liked the beer, too. Super enthusiastic response.”
The duo has also created a beer called Business Casual, a caramel-colored session red ale, and revived General Braddock’s IPA, a bittersweet East Coast India pale ale.
“Part of our agreement with [Barbara] is that we have to come in and talk to her students once we’re successful,” Katase said. “... and bring beer.”
Carryer wasn’t alone in her praise of The Brew Gentlemen’s products. “It’s good beer,” Culbertson said. “If they had it in a restaurant, I would absolutely order it. I think they could sell their stuff tomorrow.”
Culbertson advised the duo to take advantage of the growing interest in craft beer and to get their product on the market as soon as possible. “Right now the window for craft beers is huge,” Culbertson said. “Everybody wants a craft beer and they don’t care so much if they have to pay six bucks a bottle for it, and I don’t want them to miss that window.”
The Brew Gentlemen already have some prospective restaurants and bars wanting to buy their beer, but the pair is waiting to perfect and test its recipes before officially opening for business.
“I think there’s another hurdle to get over, which is how they will handle demand,” Culbertson said. “We are all fearful of failure — there’s no question about that — but we’re also fearful of success.”
“Every entrepreneur wonders, ‘Gee, what happens if I suddenly get orders for 1,000 kegs, what do I do?’ ” Culbertson said. “The new entrepreneur always reacts, ‘Oh my god, I’m done, I’m doomed.’ I sit here and say, ‘Hey, time to throw a party! Wow, people want 1,000 kegs of your beer? Holy crap! That’s a great problem!’ But when you’re living it, all you can see is the logistics: How are we gonna deliver it, how are we gonna brew that much by that time, et cetera. It goes back to the dating analogy, ‘She invited me to the prom. Oh my god. Oh my god, I’ve gotta rent a tux.’ ”
Although The Brew Gentlemen undoubtedly have some hurdles in their future, things are looking good from their Braddock facility. “Braddock is the perfect backdrop for a brewery,” Foster said. “It’s quiet and we’re right in the backyard of the steel mill.”
Their establishment, which is about 3,000 square feet and currently houses their production facility and pilot brewing system, is owned by the Heritage Community Initiatives. “The mayor [of Braddock] and the Heritage Community Initiatives — a nonprofit that’s trying to revitalize Braddock — really helped us find our space,” Katase said.
Foster and Katase are surprised by the amount of support they have received from the Braddock and brewing communities. “The cooperation and willingness of other breweries to lend a hand has been overwhelming,” Katase said. “From just giving us feedback on our beer to letting us borrow equipment to just teaching us anything and everything we want to learn.”
“Everyone is extremely willing to pour you a beer,” Katase added. “Because, really, the competitors are the big three: Bud, Miller, and Coors. The craft guys are all in this together, and they wanna see each other do well because, what is that saying, ‘Rising tides float all boats?’ ”
Since their first dinner party in April, The Brew Gentlemen have been invited to and have attended a number of other beer dinners and tastings, the biggest of which will be held on Oct. 6 in Braddock. The event, “Tapped: Braddock,” will feature a pop-up beer garden provided by The Brew Gentlemen, cocktails from Bar Marco, local food trucks, and live local music.
“We’ll be pouring the White Sky and the General Braddock’s,” Foster said. “And there’ll be a pig roast by Kevin Sousa [owner of Salt of the Earth], who’s opening a restaurant above our brewery. He’s a resident badass, so that’s gonna be awesome.”
The Brew Gentlemen plan to open their facility to the public early next year, where they will have beers on tap.

2012-10-08,CMU,India,"The Mayur South Asian Student Alliance (Mayur SASA), along with the Muslim Student Alliance and OM, celebrated both Diwali, a Hindu holiday, and Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holiday, in Wiegand Gymnasium on Thursday. The actual date of this year’s Diwali is Nov. 13, while Eid al-Adha is on Oct. 26. According to Sanjana Padmanabhan, first-year chemical engineering major and first-year representative in Mayur SASA, “We’re combining [Diwali] with Eid because it’s around the same time.”
“Diwali is the festival of lights,” said Meghna Raghunathan, junior design major and president of Mayur SASA. “It’s a religious celebration ... of Rama bringing Sita back from Sri Lanka to India.”
Sruti Modekurty, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major who attended the event, went into further detail about the significance of Diwali for Hindus. “Diwali celebrates the return of a king who was forced into exile by his stepmother,” Modekurty said. “The king’s name is Rama, and he was in exile in the forest for 14 years, so everyone in his home town celebrated his return.... Diwali celebrates the return of him from exile and him taking over, becoming king again.”
Modekurty also described how Diwali is traditionally celebrated: “We decorate our front lawn with tea lights. And then sometimes we put up Christmas lights around our house, and we usually make sweets and dress up and stuff. And sometimes we set off firecrackers.”
Amulya Uppala, a first-year computer science major, shared how she celebrated Diwali at home. “There’s a lot of food, a lot [of firecrackers]. That’s the main part.... Basically, you have so many different types of firecrackers, you play with them the entire night.” Appropriately, Wiegand Gymnasium was strung with Christmas lights and decorated by electric tea candles spread across the floor.
Eid al-Adha is an Islamic celebration of sacrifice. Iman Mazloum, a first-year international relations and politics major and member of the Muslim Students Association, explained the religious history of Eid. When Abraham was told to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, “Abraham closed his eyes and struck down his blade, and when he opened his eyes, in the place of his son was a sheep,” she said. Mazloum explained that Eid usually involves “a charity of normally a sheep to those in need.”
The Diwali/Eid celebration kicked off with South Indian food catered by a local restaurant; a variety of booths around the room had games, henna tattoos, face painting, and other activities. The Mayur SASA and Muslim Students Association also had their own tables. Halfway into the event, the performances began, opened by the first prayer of the Quran, led by Mazloum, and another prayer led by the members of OM, an organization that describes itself as “an independent, nonsectarian forum for the education and promotion of Indian cultural heritage” on its website.
Following the prayers were exhibitions from Carnegie Mellon’s South Asian dance teams, including Carnegie Mellon Raasta — a dance team that practices the West Indian folk dance garba-raas — and Carnegie Mellon’s official Bhangra team.
Teja Shah, a senior biomedical and mechanical engineering major, did a solo dance routine as well. There was also a performance by Neel Kadkarni, a junior business administration major, who sang songs by a renowned Indian singer, Mohammed Rafi. Kadkarni was assisted by Tejavir Singh Rekhi, a first-year art major, on the tabla. The last performance of the event was by members of the executive board of Mayur SASA, who all danced to an Indian remix of PSY’s “Gangnam Style.”
Although Diwali and Eid al-Adha are still upcoming, the celebration in Wiegand Gymnasium captured the spirit of the holidays for Cèilidh Weekend. As Padmanabhan said, it was a great time “just to bring everyone together.”.

The exhibit is more than just a collection of plants: It’s a green teleporter of flora and fauna that whisks you away to the forests of India.
Cheery impatiens are dotted throughout, accompanied by tea plants. Palms with gigantic leaves stand over hundreds of plant varieties. The impossibly thick vegetation is swathed in fog from a fog machine. A “river” flows through the room that houses the exhibit, lined with dainty purple blooms and vibrant green leaves.
The exhibit goes beyond just displaying tropical plants and some dirt, incorporating interesting cultural tidbits and extra displays throughout. Among these are waterfalls, the river, and a quaint Indian bazaar that displays different varieties of teas and spices native to the country. Also featured is a collection of field research that highlights the work of botanists around the world, an outpost that features the medicinal uses of the plants and, of course, as much tropical forest as can be packed into one room in Pittsburgh.
The vast array of species spills over from the carefully designed beds onto the winding pathway, truly transforming the room into a little slice of paradise. Immediately upon walking through the doorway — which is decorated with an Indian temple façade — visitors experience a sense of peace and tranquility mixed with a dose of ancient wisdom. Plants labeled with tags that beg, “Smell me, I’m fragrant!” are the first to welcome visitors with their powerful and sweet scent, setting the vibe for the entire exhibit. At the charming Indian bazaar just down the path from the waterfall, samples of tea and spices create an aromatic bouquet.
Besides the pleasant scents and the explosion of exotic flora, the exhibit is packed with signposts that feature interesting facts about the country, its culture, and its native plants. The Ayurvedic healing garden and outpost highlight the interwoven histories of the religious culture and medicinal uses of the plants growing in the exhibit. It’s interesting and educational to browse the easy-to-ingest information presented in a fun, original way, and to find out how many uses the Indian culture has for the plants that surround it.
A unique Pittsburgh gem, Phipps is a wonderful escape that mesmerizes and immediately calms. There’s something about being surrounded by lush greenery that feels cleansing and healthy. Take advantage of this amazing place: It’s just across Flagstaff Hill, it’s free for Carnegie Mellon students, and it’s open until 10 p.m. on Friday nights..

2012-11-05,CMU,India,"Have you ever spent too much time looking at image macros on the internet, or scrolling through videos of cats on Youtube? Many people regard these diversions as pointless yet amusing wastes of time, much like other aspects of today’s digital culture.
New York-based artist Cory Arcangel, however, finds something of artistic merit in American digital culture. Arcangel uses mostly ready-made digital technology in his art. In a sense, his artwork is a subset of pop art — taking elements from popular culture and giving them a twist — but its heavy emphasis on the digital era makes his approach more unique. In his work, Arcangel also uses hacked and obsolete pieces of technology, such as old video game cartridges.
Cory Arcangel: Masters, a new exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art, shows off selected pieces of art that Arcangel has produced over his decade-long career, including five videos, a modified video game, a modified flat screen television, a wallpaper installation, and a collection of archival materials. The exhibit, which opened on Saturday, also debuts a new work: Arcangel’s collection of catalogued trance and techno LPs.
Like other pieces of modern art, some elements of Arcangel’s work may come off as somewhat overrated. One work featured in the exhibit, “Super Mario Clouds,” simply displays the sky and background clouds from the game Super Mario Bros. — nothing else.
But the exhibit still has its merits. Few people in modern art address the values and concerns of the digital age, despite its growing influence on our culture and society. Above all, Arcangel’s work is a commentary on American culture in the digital era. His pieces highlight how most of the technology we use quickly becomes obsolete in our consumer culture; every year there is a newer, fancier iPhone or tablet that quickly becomes replaceable.
Many of the works in the exhibit focus on the transient and pointless nature of technology. The work “Untitled Translation Exercise” is basically a showing of the 1993 American film Dazed and Confused, but with the script dubbed by an outsourced Indian firm. The odd juxtaposition of the depiction of American culture with the stilted, wooden voices of the foreign firm create an interesting commentary on the outsourcing of American labor and the effects of globalization on American culture. Moreover, it’s incredibly funny to watch.
In an interview posted on the Carnegie Museum of Art website, exhibit curator Tina Kukielski describes Arcangel and his work: “I’ve always thought of Cory as a cultural purveyor. He is an artist who understands the mechanisms and systems of technology and the internet and is able to intervene in the slightest way in the sense that he upsets the rhythms or patterns of culture just enough to expose their very being.”
Cory Arcangel: Masters will run through Jan. 27 at the Carnegie Museum of Art (4400 Forbes Ave.)..

2012-11-05,CMU,India,"As election season draws to a close, the candidates for the presidency are making their last speeches in the 11 battleground states that will decide which candidate gains the 270 votes necessary to win the election and goes on to occupy the Oval Office this January.
There are a total of 538 electoral votes at play in the presidential election. In order to be elected president, a candidate must win a majority of the votes — in other words, at least 270.
Electoral votes are allotted based on the popular vote in each state. A state has a certain number of electoral votes apportioned by population; the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state wins all of that state’s popular votes (except for the few states that allow split electoral votes). In this electoral cycle, there are a surprisingly large number of states that are considered toss-ups.
The 11 battleground states in which both President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney stand a chance of winning are New Hampshire, with four electoral votes; Iowa and Nevada, with six electoral votes each; Colorado, with nine electoral votes; Wisconsin, with 10 electoral votes; Virginia, with 13 electoral votes; North Carolina, with 15 electoral votes; Michigan, with 16 electoral votes; Ohio, with 18 electoral votes; Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes; and Florida, with 29 electoral votes.
The other 39 states are fairly reliable to go either Republican or Democrat, leaving Obama with a virtually guaranteed 201 electoral votes, and Romney with 191. The battle for the presidency lies in the battleground states’ collective 146 electoral votes.
Obama won the 2008 election with 365 electoral votes; he swept the battleground states, including the traditionally red Indiana, North Carolina, and Virginia. This year, however, the race is much closer. Romney has seen positive poll data in the traditionally blue Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania; meanwhile, Florida and Ohio remain as important now as they have been in past years.
The political aggregator site RealClearPolitics averages poll data from many local and national political polls. According to the site’s averaged polls, Obama is up 1.5 percent in New Hampshire, 2.5 percent in Iowa, 2.8 percent in Nevada, 0.6 percent in Colorado, 5 percent in Wisconsin, 4 percent in Michigan, 2.8 percent in Ohio, and 4.1 percent in Pennsylvania; and Romney is up 0.3 percent in Virginia, 3.8 percent in North Carolina, and 1.4 percent in Florida.
If the averages given by  RealClearPolitics represented actual popular vote totals, Obama would take 290 electoral votes and Romney 248, giving Obama the presidency. Even if Obama lost the two states where the poll results from RealClearPolitics has him winning — New Hampshire and Colorado — he would retain 277 electoral votes and win the election. The New York Times political blogger Nate Silver said in a post on Saturday that in order for Romney to win the electoral college, state polls would have to be systematically oversampling Obama voters.
One interesting caveat in this presidential election is the possibility of an electoral college tie. Several possible scenarios can leave both candidates with a total of 269 electoral votes. If Romney can win Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado, and Nevada, he’ll be one shy of 270. Similarly, Romney could lose Virginia, but win Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, and either Iowa or Nevada for the same tied scenario. Silver considered the scenario in which both Romney and Obama win 269 electoral votes to have a 0.2 percent chance of happening.
If no candidate wins a majority of the votes, the House of Representatives votes for the President from among the three highest-voted candidates, and the Senate chooses the Vice President from among the two highest-voted vice presidential candidates. Each Senator casts one vote, but the House of Representatives votes in blocs by state. Each representative casts a vote, and the most popular candidate among the delegation from each state wins that state’s vote.
If the House vote ends in a tie, the 20th Amendment specifies that the vice president-elect takes office. If both the House and the Senate votes end in ties, federal law specifies a successive list of people who should take office, starting with the Speaker of the House.
In the history of the U.S., only John Quincy Adams has ever been elected by the House of Representatives.
There is also the possibility that a “faithless elector” could shake up the count. An elector is a person who represents a state in the Electoral College. Electors cast the actual votes that determine the President. Different states appoint their electors differently, and not all states legally require electors to vote for the candidate who won the state’s popular vote. A faithless elector is an elector who votes against the will of his or her state’s popular vote.
Faithless electors are relatively rare; the most recent instance was in 2004, and in the 20th and 21st centuries, no election has ever had more than one. In addition, some states have laws that invalidate the votes of faithless electors. Unless the race is already extremely close, faithless electors are unlikely to impact the outcome.
There is  the possibility of a disparity between the electoral vote and the popular vote, as in 2000. Silver places the odds of Obama winning the popular vote and losing the electoral vote at 1.1 percent, and vice-versa at 5.7 percent. If the election had been held just a few days ago, according to the RealClearPolitics averages, Romney would have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote.
All electoral math and possible constitutional crises aside, the race will probably come down to Ohio. Silver has Ohio with a 50 percent chance of being the deciding state, far more likely than Virginia, the next highest, at 15 percent. Once Ohio’s votes are tallied, it seems likely that the U.S. will know who its next President will be..

2012-11-05,CMU,India,"Disney officials announced last Tuesday that the company was buying Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion and would release Star Wars Episode VII in 2015. 
Created by filmmaker George Lucas, Lucasfilm produced the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, in addition to running subsidiary businesses in audio and special effects. 
The acquisition of Lucasfilm presents Disney with a significant opportunity. The desire to expand the Star Wars movie universe with another trilogy of films may prove extremely profitable and successful, but may also backfire. However, if these films prove to be critical successes, they offer the potential to reinvigorate the Star Wars brand and restore faith in the franchise after three disappointing prequels. 
Star Wars already suffered, not financially, but creatively, from these three prequels overseen by Lucas. While Lucas is only slated to contribute to the new series as a creative consultant, any more mishandling of the franchise may leave a permanent mark on Star Wars. 
Despite the large amount of negativity and uncertainty surrounding this announcement, it is also important to acknowledge that Disney has proved to be a successful manager of other well-known brands. The most recent example is Marvel, which released the Joss Whedon-directed The Avengers to great critical and financial success. However, more involvement on Disney’s part does not always result in success, as Pixar’s latest offerings Cars 2 and Brave received less favorable receptions than any of Pixar’s previous works. 
But Disney knows how to market a movie. Cars 2, despite being the worst-reviewed Pixar film, still turned a massive profit. For a franchise that has had a shaky recent history, this marketing skill could be valuable. But whether it will succeed in producing high quality Star Wars films, however, remains to be seen.
Disney is perfectly capable of creating quality films, and will reap the inevitable financial profits that will come from the release of a new Star Wars film. 
Unfortunately, it remains unclear as to whether the company will try to do this or not. Let us hope that decent screenwriters and directors sign on for these movies and help to restore the magic of this classic franchise..

2012-11-12,CMU,India,"Intriguing souvenirs and relics well worn by the sands of time send visitors hurtling back to the past in Inventing the Modern World: Decorative Arts at the World’s Fairs, 1851–1939 at the Carnegie Museum of Art.
The exhibition, which opened Oct. 13 in the Heinz Gallery, is more than a simple collection of artifacts from eras gone by: It’s a veritable time travel portal. Opening with a rich collection of beautiful wood furniture, elaborate vases, and intricate jewelry from the mid-19th century, the exhibition advances chronologically through the world’s fairs spanning into the late ’30s.
The exhibit looks like a behind-the-scenes tour of a strange movie that’s a combination of Indiana Jones, The Great Gatsby, The Phantom of the Opera, and a live-action version of The Jetsons. It gives off the feeling of walking through a time traveler’s bazaar, weaving a cohesive and elegant thread through a medley of artifacts that are otherwise startlingly incoherent.
Besides taking its audience on a fascinating trip into the golden days of the past, the exhibition inspires viewers to reflect on the place of art and craftsmanship in modern society. Everyday objects in the exhibition, from puff boxes to bookcases and arm chairs, are transformed from mundane to magnificent solely for decoration. 
Have we as a society lost that appreciation for flowery detail and unnecessary embellishment, or is there still a vibrant culture that supports an artistic, innovative spirit? The exhibition subtly asks these questions of the viewers from behind the beautiful display.
It’s impossible not to wish you were seeing all of these items for the first time at the world’s fairs. A collection of early Tiffany & Co. jewelry shines brightly under the lights of the display case, and the Art Deco-era radio broadcast panel from KDKA’s first broadcast is on display. The bookcases look as if they’re straight out of Hogwarts; the chairs range from absurdly futuristic to old and indescribably detailed; and the vases and teapots from all over the world make Paul Revere’s silver teapot look like a toy.
The exhibition is appropriately — fulfilling, yet not overwhelming. It takes viewers back in time for a stroll through the world’s ever-changing aesthetic tastes while also prompting them to think about the relationship between the arts and the world. This blending of themes was certainly no easy task. 
As is always the case at the Carnegie Museum of Art, the exhibition is well researched, informative, and interesting. It’s quite apparent that the exhibit planners paid great attention to detail, resulting in a satisfyingly rich color scheme and minute details, such as a draped curtain on the door between rooms. All of these elements come together to create a fascinating exhibit that blends history and art.
Whether you’re interested in ogling Tiffany & Co. bracelets and necklaces or discovering the trendiest way to style a chair in 1918, this exhibition will satisfy both your historical hankering and your artistic craving.
Inventing the Modern World: Decorative Arts at the World’s Fairs, 1851–1939 will run at the Carnegie Museum of Art through Feb. 24..

2012-11-12,CMU,India,"Tuesday’s election didn’t amount to a rejection of the Republican party, but a rejection of social conservatism. This didn’t play out too strongly in the presidential election, but in state-wide ballot measures and Senate races, social conservatism was almost unilaterally rejected by the American public.
Starting with Senate races, losing Republican candidates Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana were absolutely decimated by their remarks about rape. Both were running in very winnable Senate races in states that were noncompetitively in Romney’s column. Mourdock was defending the seat of the incredibly popular moderate Republican Dick Lugar, who served for six terms.
Both candidates were ahead in their respective races until they made their respective comments about rape. Akin said, “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” Meanwhile, Mourdock said, “I think that even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.""
Immediately, the polls flipped. The margins Akin and Mourdock shared went to their opponents, and they subsequently lost their races. While being pro-life isn’t a particularly extreme policy position, having a fundamental misunderstanding of female anatomy and saying that rape is the will of God will land you in the nut job category. Voters are okay with pro-life candidates, but they will reject anyone trying to control their bodies.
At the ballot initiative level, gay marriage went three for four, winning in the states of Maine, Maryland, and Washington. I believe that we hit the inflection point on gay marriage sometime within the last few years, and it will soon progress to become the law of the land. Similarly, marijuana legalization went three for three, becoming recreationally legal in Colorado and Washington and medically legal in Massachusetts. I believe we've hit a similar inflection point here, and the federal government will soon get out of the way and let states decide for themselves if marijuana should be legal.
It’s time for the Republican Party to see the writing on the wall. We don’t need two liberal parties. We don’t need varying degrees of Democrats. The message of economic conservatives is still incredibly popular. Especially with the pending implosion of Europe, the message of fiscal restraint is something that voters want to see more of. Similarly, many Republicans prioritize economic issues over social issues. I lament that Republicans couldn't gain control of the Senate because of their social stances, and now we have to live with Obamacare.
Republicans can’t let antiquated social views get in the way of an economic message that could not be timelier.
It’s time not for the Republican party to pander to the left or to the center, but for its Libertarian wing to do so. To Republicans, I say embrace the mantle of limited government. Let social issues go; fiscal balance and restraint need to be priority one. Work with Democrats. Make concessions on social issues. Let us live free. But, please, don’t let anything get in the way of an sharing your economic message..

2012-11-19,CMU,India,"The pulse of drums, Indian rhythms, and techno beats filled the air of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall this past Saturday for the sixth annual Bhangra in the Burgh competition. Nearly 2,500 people filled the space to watch bhangra teams from across North America dance to win.
The event was highly anticipated, as its organizers had been advertising and tabling for over a month before the competiton. “The planning process for BIB6 began before the academic year with countless man hours being spent on the event. The level of organization was very impressive,” said first-year statistics major and operations committee member Vinay Viswanathan.
The competition showcased eight bhangra teams, each of which was introduced with a video that gave a preview of the team’s members and core values. The competing teams were: First Class Bhangra, UVA Di Shaan, Virginia Tech Bhangra, Cal Bhangra, GMU Bhangra, Toronto Allstar Girls, Cornell Bhangra, and UNC Bhangra Elite.
Each team brought great talent to the stage, making for an impressive, powerful event that kept the audience pumped. Whenever a team was announced, the yells and cheers of that team’s fans could be heard loud and clear. But despite the competition, the atmosphere remained friendly; the teams recognized that they were not only competing against each other, but also promoting the art of bhangra, and were supportive and respectful of the other teams.
The show included other non-bhangra dance groups, as well as Carnegie Mellon’s own South Asian all-male a cappella group, Deewane. Carnegie Mellon’s Tanah and DS Company and Point Park University’s Impulse provided a look into the world of hip-hop and artistic dance, a good change of pace from the competitive bhangra.
When Carnegie Mellon’s bhangra team took the stage, the excitement in the air was palpable: This was what many had come for. The team staged a lively performance, which was made even more exciting when all of the nonperforming members and alumni, dressed in bhangra team jackets, joined the performers on stage. With the stage filled, Carnegie Mellon Bhangra provided a passionate ending to the evening.
Comedian Dan Nainan kept the energy up by amusing the audience between acts. Although Nainan’s sense of humor occasionally leaned toward the racially offensive, his charm and wit were effective in transitioning from act to act.
The show ran smoothly with few technical glitches. The colorful lighting and the loud pulse of the music made the event feel more like a concert than a dance competition. During admission, audience members were able to keep themselves fueled for the excitement of the second half by purchasing inexpensive samosas.
There were five judges for the event, but audience members could also vote for their favorite team to win the People’s Choice Award by voting on the event’s webpage. Unfortunately, by the time the results were announced, many people in the audience had already left. Cal Bhangra, Cornell Bhangra, and the Toronto Allstar Girls took the first, second, and third spots respectively, while UNC Bhangra Elite took the People’s Choice Award.
All proceeds of Bhangra in the Burgh 6 went to Variety the Children’s Charity of Pittsburgh, which provides custom bicycles for disabled children. Charles LaVallee, a member of the Variety team and a Carnegie Mellon graduate, showed a video of a mentally disabled man first learning to ride a bike. He discussed how important something as simple as learning to ride can be for both kids and their families. His speech served as a reminder that nothing should be taken for granted.
Overall, the event was an enlightening and enjoyable cultural experience. “I came out wanting to do Bhangra. I’d definitely go again next year,” said first-year biology major Myriam Bejjani..

2012-11-19,CMU,India,"Members of the Carnegie Mellon community engaged in discussion in Steinberg Auditorium last Friday during Nico Slate’s lecture on the connection between the freedom struggle of South Asians and African-Americans.
Slate, an assistant professor of history, referenced the research he conducted for his book Colored Cosmopolitanism: The Shared Struggle for Freedom in the United States and India to discuss how to create collaboration between peoples of color.
“There’s hope and optimism, but there’s also misunderstanding and misinterpretation. That’s what makes this history so rich,” Slate said.
Addressing what he called “colored cosmopolitanism” as something “strangely foreign, but strangely familiar,” he said, “In many ways, a world in which whites controlled things across the globe has tumbled and fell, but in many ways it hasn’t.”
Slate spoke of the work of activists, such as Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Pauli Murray, in bridging the African American fight for civil rights with the Indian freedom struggle.
He utilized the Indian term “satyagraha,” which means “holding firmly to the truth,” to refer to Murray’s civil disobedience and active efforts in the civil rights cause. 
Slate said that as a young student, Murray compared the advantages and disadvantages of fighting for freedom as an African-American to those of a South Asian.
The first major difference between the black freedom struggle and the Indian freedom struggle, he said, is the fact that in India, Indians were the majority and in America, blacks were the minority. 
Murray used this fact to demonstrate that not all tactics used in India can be directly implemented on the plight of African-Americans.
Moving on to describe an example, Slate addressed the tremendous amount of poverty in India due to class disparities as a result of the caste system.
Slate cited the example of a point of realization for Martin Luther King Jr. on a visit to India. 
“The principal of the school introduced MLK as an untouchable of the United States. Although King was at first insulted, he realized that his treatment in the States meant he was, in a sense, an untouchable. Then King went on to say, ‘I am an untouchable, and all of my people are untouchables.’ ”
Slate pointed out that in this way, King was connecting caste oppression in India to the oppression of African-Americans.
Slate said, “That conception of colored solidarity is still alive. Many young South Asians feel a sense of solidarity with African-American struggles, which has grown even stronger after 9/11, when racial profiling has targeted people of color.”
Slate said that President Barack Obama carried a large number of minority communities in the election. For example, 75 percent of the South Asian and Indian communities voted for Obama.
“Most Indians were happy that Obama was reelected, but not for all the right reasons. I think that they are mainly focused on Obama’s foreign policy to India, which, like President [George W.] Bush’s policy, has been warm and friendly,” Slate said.
“I think that most of the people in power in India think that Obama can inspire societal change, and is something I wish is more present,” he continued.
Students who attended the lecture had positive things to say.
“I’m in his global histories class, and he really emphasized the transnational aspect of this movement, which I found fascinating. I liked that he mentioned that we can create this solidarity and learn from it. We can learn from history and act on it today,” said Josh Levitson, a fourth-year piano performance and professional writing double major.
“I really liked the fact that he covered so much of the struggle for civil rights of different cultures, whether that be in America or India,” said Theophilus Onime, a first-year information systems major. 
“The freedom struggle is not just confined to one place, like we think it is,” he added.
Slate’s lecture was part of the Center for African-American Urban Studies and the Economy 2012–13 speaker series. 
The talk was also held in collaboration with The Senator John Heinz History Center Exhibit, “From Slavery to Freedom.”.

Carnegie Mellon is no stranger to international students. More than 20 percent of its student body is from another country, and the university has a dedicated Department of International Education to assist with financial aid, English skills, and career options after graduation.
Senior business administration major Parikshit Mistry from India said that he decided to travel overseas for his education for the career prospects. “Just saying that you got a degree from an American college opens up so many job opportunities back home in India,” Mistry said. “I want to work in the United States when I graduate, but I might want to return to India later.”
Mistry said his biggest challenge adapting to a U.S. college experience was learning to work under a much more hands-off system of teaching.
“In India, the teachers really prod you to do well, and they’ll let you know if you aren’t doing well.... The professors here don’t really do that, and it’s more up to the students to make sure they learn the material,” he said. “It took some time getting used to, especially during my freshmen courses.”
While Mistry said that he is fortunate to come from a family that can pay out of pocket for his education overseas, not all international students have this luxury. So rather than pay out of pocket, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Chin Yang from Singapore is instead participating in a scholarship program offered by his government. “[The government] is paying for my education and travel,” Yang said.
In exchange for the scholarship, the government requires a high level of academic performance from him. “I have to keep my GPA above a 3.75... and my scholarship requires that I complete a master’s degree in computer science in four years. It means I need to graduate in three [years],” Yang said. “I also have a six-year bond. After I graduate, I need to work for [the government] for six years.”
Like Mistry, Yang has not had much of a problem adapting to American culture. “I’m sure there are a lot of cultural differences, but I haven’t really noticed many of them,” Yang said. “I have an accent, so sometimes I have to repeat myself when talking to new people, but people who get to know me can understand me.”
According to Yang, the Singaporean students on campus are a particularly close-knit group.
“We all know each other because it’s such a small community, and most of us are under the same scholarship program,” he said. 
Yang said that he met up with his Singaporean friends almost every day during his first year. 
“There’s also the Singaporean Student Association on campus.... Most of us come to the meetings and events,” he said.
However, Yang said that Singaporeans never become very invested in cultural events and activities because of the level of academic performance they are expected to achieve.
Carnegie Mellon also hosts several foreign exchange students, including junior computer science major Syed Moosavi from Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus. 
“It’s a semester-long program where instead of taking courses at Qatar, we take our courses in Pittsburgh,” said Moosavi, who is originally from India. “The computer science department sends two to three students every year to Pittsburgh.”
Moosavi’s biggest challenges adapting to the U.S. involved just getting around the city. “I’ve had a problem definitely understanding how things work here; the bus system, groceries, buying a ticket,” Moosavi said. 
“[In Qatar], everything is centrally located in a big shopping complex,” he added.
However, Moosavi made a point of arriving in Pittsburgh during the summer so he could figure out these logistical issues before the semester started, and since then, he said he hasn’t run into any problems. 
“I have an accent, but people can understand me.... It’s been easy for me to meet new people, and everyone is nice,” he said..

2012-11-19,CMU,India,"When you order a hamburger from City Grill, pizza from Skibo Café, or pasta from The Exchange, do you know what’s in your food? The Tartan Food Tracker, a project currently in beta version, aims to help you find out.
Although work on Tartan Food Tracker is currently on hold, the beta version is available online. It lists nutritional information for food on campus. Next to each dish, the nutritional value is given in a variety of different formats, including “per bowl,” “per order,” and “per cup.”
Some students think the website, as it currently stands, is unclear. Kashish Mittal, a first-year electrical and computer engineering and computer science double major, posed some questions about the food: “What consists of a meal? How much is considered a bowl or an order?”
CulinArt does not combine nutritional information for foods that go into the same carton. So, for instance, the nutritional information for an order of chicken tikka masala at Taste of India does not include the naan or rice that generally accompanies the meal.
Sean Minahan, executive chef with CulinArt, explained why CulinArt lists food the way it does. “Every dish is not going to be the same,” he said. “If you’re dining on campus, like at Pasta Villaggio, where the food is rich, we’re not going to limit what you can and can’t have, and let you make that decision on what’s best for you.”
On food containers bought in a grocery store, nutritional information is listed in servings, but in parentheses there is a measurement of weight that explains just how much counts as one serving. Although Tartan Food Tracker does not list a serving’s weight, Minahan said CulinArt ensures servings are properly and evenly portioned.
“I’m not sure what it is, but a cup is by liquefied volume, liquid weighted ounces,” Minahan said. “The analysis we provided for Tartan Tracker was based on portion size of the protein or whatever food it is, and we measured it in terms of the caloric volume. Measurements for an ‘order’ will be different for different locations. Pasta Villaggio, Spinning Salads, all those are given measurements. With regards to protein, we pre-portion in bags. We also have a cutting team with a butcher shop that portion meat for grilling.”
Paula Martin, a registered dietitian with University Health Services, said, “[Tartan] Food Tracker is currently on hold, and it’s not a finished product and is being tested. Right now, we have launched food icons, and some vendors are putting them on vendor boards and some are not. You can find nutritional information using the food icons described on the Housing and Dining site.”
The icons include “Whole Grain,” “Healthful Choice,” “Heart Smart,” “Vegetarian,” and “Vegan,” and give general information about food on menus. Not all campus dining locations, however, use the icons.
Mittal also posed another concern: “Why can’t each dining location clarify which foods are vegetarian or not, and give a description of each? Someone not from here surely would be confused with some options here.” 
While some places, like the Carnegie Mellon Café, list what is in different foods, other places like Skibo Café and Schatz Dining Room do not.
Minahan said CulinArt could do better on that front. 
“We do have identifier cards for many places, but at places like Schatz, there may not be total clarity, and sometimes we do miss it,” Minahan said. ""It’s something that we’re working on every day.”
Other students have concerns about the availability of food. On weekends, when dining locations in the University Center are closed, some feel that food and drink options are limited. 
“We have to spend a good amount of money on food that probably isn’t the healthiest. Besides water, there are no healthy options to drink,” said Joetsaroop Bagga, a first-year biomedical engineering and chemical engineering double major.
Martin refutes this claim. “Our locations are all pretty unique, and we have a system in place in which access to food is broad,” she said. “I’ve been here for seven years, and I’m quite pleased with the food offerings. We’ve looked at health standards and offerings, so we look at access, variety, food safety concerns.” There are healthy options at dining locations, other than sweet or carbonated drinks: The Carnegie Mellon Café, for instance, offers milk, orange juice, and bottled water.
If students have concerns, Minahan said there is a “dining service group that acts together on a monthly basis, with vendors and groups, so if people have concerns, that’s a great place. There are also chefs and managers with our vending locations, so if a student has a concern, they should go to them.”.

2012-12-03,CMU,India,"With a new semester approaching, most Carnegie Mellon students are finalizing their schedules. For those students who still need one more class, foreign languages are a trend that seems to be increasingly worthwhile.
According to a Modern Language Association (MLA) enrollment survey, more than 1.6 million undergraduates who attend American colleges and universities this year will take at least one foreign language class at some point in their college careers. That works out to a national average of 9 percent per university. Susan Polanski, the head of Carnegie Mellon’s modern languages department, said that at Carnegie Mellon, it’s 52 percent.
According to the MLA, interest in language study has been steadily on the rise since the late ’90s. Executive Director Rosemary G. Feal said in an MLA press release, “Students increasingly see their futures taking place in a multilingual world, and they want language preparation to help them function in that world.”
Which foreign languages are American undergraduates studying these days? While 70 percent pick one of the three historically most popular languages — Spanish, French, or German — those who want to try something different will find a long list of languages to choose from. And that list is growing.
The study of Portuguese, in particular, is gaining popularity. According to Ana Paula Carvalho, the University of Pittsburgh’s Portuguese language coordinator, one out of two Latin Americans speaks Portuguese, as it has always been an important language. But now Brazil is the sixth largest economy in the world, which has led to more demand for Portuguese speakers in both business and international relations.
Carvalho has seen not just an increase in enrollment in Portuguese courses at Pitt (which now offers a minor in Portuguese), but also a broadening awareness of Brazilian culture, particularly music, dance, and food. Pitt’s Brazil Club — the Brazil Nuts — becomes more active each year, recently hosting an annual Brazil festival.
Last summer, Carvalho led a group of 14 Pitt undergraduates in a unique study-abroad program in Brazil.
“Over six weeks, the students conducted research studies in Brazil. They didn’t take classes. They set up interviews and used questionnaires, and then they finalized their research papers after they returned to Pittsburgh,” Carvalho said. Students in the group were majoring in engineering, linguistics, and political science, and there was even one student from the dental school.
Carvalho said, “Fourteen students were chosen out of 50 applications, and all of their expenses were covered.”
Another language that students choose to study is Mandarin Chinese. Enrollment has risen in U.S. universities from 34,000 in 2002 to 61,000 in 2009. Polanski illustrated how Chinese language studies have expanded. At Carnegie Mellon, there were five students studying Mandarin Chinese in 1992. Polanski said, “Initially we hired a tutor, and the courses were taught through distance learning. Today, over 300 students fill 23 sections of Chinese language courses at Carnegie Mellon.”
Mark Dyehouse, a sophomore Chinese and physics double major, had the opportunity to take three years of Chinese in high school. Unlike many students who take Chinese language classes, Dyehouse has no Chinese heritage.
“I began to find the many facets of the language, culture, and history fascinating,” he said. “I visited China and Hong Kong for a few weeks last summer, which intensified the hold that the language had on me.” He would like to become fluent and to potentially use his Chinese language skills to conduct research in physics.
Many Pittsburghers’ roots are Slavic, so it makes sense that Pitt’s department of Slavic languages and literature offers Russian, Polish, Slovak, Ukrainian, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Czech, and Bulgarian. Those languages are also taught during the summer, with Hungarian and Turkish added to the mix.
“In addition,” said Christine Metil, director of the Summer Language Institute, “for the next three years, Pitt will host the Baltic Studies Summer Internship, the only program in the country to offer Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian.”
The U.S. government is always looking for speakers of “critical languages,” a constantly-changing list tied to areas of conflict in the world. According to the American Councils for International Education website, in 2006, the U.S. Department of State, along with the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, set up the Critical Language Scholarship Program to “expand dramatically the number of Americans studying and mastering critical-need foreign languages.”
This year, 631 critical language scholarships (out of over 5,200 applicants) were awarded for the study of Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bangla/Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Punjabi, Russian, Turkish, and Urdu. 
The scholarships cover all costs, including travel between the student’s home city and program location, orientation costs, visa fees, and room and  board.
“Critical languages” are often not taught in college language programs. Claude Mauk, the director of Pitt’s Less-Commonly-Taught Languages Center, knows all about that: “This center, which is part of the Linguistics Department, began in the 1960s, mostly for graduate students to help with their research. Now it’s mostly undergraduate.”
The assortment of languages offered through the center changes often, but at the moment, the list includes Farsi, Swahili (the only truly African language taught at Pitt), American Sign Language (ASL), Arabic, Modern Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Irish Gaelic, Swedish, Icelandic, Turkish, Vietnamese, and Quechua (a language spoken in the Andes).
Of all of the languages in which the center provides instruction to undergraduates, Arabic has had the highest gain in percentage of students since 2002.
“In the fall of 2001,” Mauk said, “Arabic was fourth as far as student enrollments. It was behind ASL, Irish Gaelic, and Swahili. By spring of 2002, the number of Arabic student enrollments doubled. In 2009 the number of students enrolled was 352, up from 75 in 2002. And this was after Carnegie Mellon started their own Arabic language courses.” If not for budget cuts, it would likely be much higher.
The field of careers for critical language speakers is growing. Do you speak Ibo/Igbo (spoken in Nigeria)? How about Assamese (spoken in northeast India)? If you do, the U.S. government has translator job openings right now. Becoming a translator generally requires more than an undergraduate language degree, but even a passing knowledge of another language can be useful for travel or perhaps as the basis for a completely different career.
Erin Taylor is a junior math and linguistics double major. She is fluent in French and Spanish, and studies Italian at Carnegie Mellon. “I’m looking into a minor in language technology. I’d like to use my knowledge of the structure of languages to work in artificial intelligence, perhaps in code breaking.” And someday she’d like to learn Tagalog, one of the predominant languages spoken in the Philippines..

2013-02-04,CMU,India,"America’s house cats more violent than thought
A new analysis conducted by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute found that domestic cats have been killing more wild birds than scientists thought. America’s domestic and feral cats kill between 1.4 billion and 3.7 billion birds per year, a number that is drastically larger than the previously estimated 500 million.
These numbers were determined by studies assessing the hunting habits of cats in the United States. The result from calculating the percentage of cats that live outdoors, the percentage of household cats that are occasionally allowed out, and the amount of hunting a cat will normally do when outside was “alarming.” Conservationists have tried capturing and neutering wild cats, but the process has been too time consuming and expensive.

Wristwatch to help combat sexual violence in India
In response to the string of violent gang-rapes of female bus passengers in New Delhi and Gurdaspur, Indian officials are developing an innovative wristwatch that can help protect women. The watch’s main feature is a button that sends a text message to close relatives and the nearest police station. 
A GPS inside the watch will determine the wearer’s location and a small camera will record for 30 minutes after the button is pressed. The prototype for this wristwatch is due to be released in half a year. While rape-prevention technology is a step in the right direction, some are skeptical on how effective it will be. 
“I don’t think this will make any difference in controlling rape cases,” said Sehba Farooqui, a women’s rights activist in Delhi.

South Korea launches first successful satellite
After three failed attempts in the past four years to launch a civilian rocket, South Korea launched its first space rocket carrying a science satellite last Wednesday. While previous launches failed within minutes, this rocket, named Naro, successfully entered orbit. 
However, South Korea is still far behind its rivals, China and Japan, in space efforts. While South Korea is capable of producing satellites, it has relied on other countries to put them into orbit. South Korea plans to build a rocket on its own by 2018 and eventually send a probe to the moon. South Korea’s rocket program is an issue of contention with neighboring North Korea, which is included in the United Nations’ sanctions for launching long-range rockets.

Storm on Saturn travels the globe; then swallows self
Scientists from NASA’s Cassini mission recently published a paper detailing a 267-day-long storm on Saturn. The storm was tracked by Cassini’s radio and plasma wave subsystem and imaging cameras. It erupted at the 33 degrees north latitude and moved west, covering 190,000 miles and wrapping around the planet. Unlike terrestrial storms that run into mountains and other topographic features, causing them to die out, Saturn’s storm traveled all the way around the planet — unimpeded by any land features — until it reached where it began. At this point, the storm ran into itself and mysteriously dissipated, putting an end to one of Saturn’s longest-running storms.

2013-02-04,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Mellon community has found a new outlet for complaining, trolling, and messing around on the Internet in the Facebook page “CMU Confessions.”
The page now has over 900 likes and hundreds of posts ranging in length from a short phrase to short stories. 
Besides wasting time reading all the posts, some people start online wars by commenting about racism, sexism, and other issues plaguing our campus. Although it’s admirable to care about your beliefs, posting your opinions on CMU Confessions is a waste of time. You are not addressing the original author of a post, nor do you know what the original intent of the post was.
For those of you smart enough to avoid the page all together, the way it works is simple. The person running the page has created an anonymous Google Survey that students can fill out. Barring some very extreme cases, all confessions will be posted to the Facebook and Twitter feeds of the account within a few days.
The biggest problem is that anyone can post anonymously, and readers of the page have no idea if they are addressing a fellow student, some random person, or their best friend. This uncertainty is what makes commenting on posts such a colossal waste of time.
The Internet is full of websites that are victim to “trolling,” defined by urbandictionary.com as “the art of deliberately, cleverly, and secretly pissing people off, usually via the Internet, using dialogue.” CMU Confessions is a prime example of a page that attracts people who do just that. Many anonymous posts to the group are understood, and rightfully so, as racist, sexist, or just plain mean.
Does replying to these anonymous posts actually do anything? In my opinion, the answer is no. By getting worked up about posts made anonymously, all you are doing is making someone more likely to post something obnoxious again.
CMU Confessions should continue to be a place that people feel safe offering their opinions, secrets, or anything else they want to share anonymously with other students, but I don’t think paragraph-length replies are necessary or worthy of anyone’s time. 
Next time you see a post that upsets you, stop and realize that by posting a long reply berating the anonymous author of the original post, you are giving that person the satisfaction they want. Take a minute and realize it’s probably more constructive to become involved in an organization that works to end the kind of discrimination that upset you. Use the anger you feel toward these ill-informed and anonymous cowards to do some good.
CMU Confessions definitely isn’t all bad though. The page is full of well-intended compliments, gripes people identify with, and tragic stories of unrequited love (I’m looking at you, green-eyed Indian girl). I think reading the page is a lot of fun, and even leaving a word or two of encouragement here or there for someone struggling with their academics, self-esteem, stress or other issues is definitely a nice thing to do. However, beware of wasting your time when something makes you mad.
Getting into heated arguments does nothing to change the underlying problems, and instead perpetuates a cycle of offensive posts. In the wise words of Maya Angelou, “If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude. Don’t complain.” Instead of complaining about ignorant comments, be proactive and do something about it.

2013-02-18,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon’s varsity tennis team has made quite the racket in recent weeks. The nationally ranked men's squad is undefeated with a 6–0 record, as the team’s spring portion of the season has officially begun. 
Yesterday, the women’s team defeated Indiana University of Pennsylvania 8–1. The team went 3–0 in doubles with wins from junior Katie Cecil and sophomore Angela Pratt, sophomores Bryn Raschke and Chelsea Motie, and first-years Abbey Hamstra and Brooke Tsu.
The match also benefited from singles victories from Cecil, Motie, Pratt, Hamstra, and sophomore Lydia Utkin.
“This weekend was a really good test for our team and a great way to prepare for the indoor championship,” Hamstra said.
While the women celebrated the win, the men’s team continued its undefeated streak with a 7–2 victory over the Stevens Institute of Technology. Sophomore Bryce Beisswanger and first-year Abhishek Alla won the first match of the day against the Stevens Tech No. 3 doubles pair. After Stevens Tech tied the match, sophomores Christian Heaney-Secord and Thomas Cooper paired to win at No. 2 doubles in a tiebreaker 9–8.
Senior Harsha Rao gave the Tartans a 3–1 advantage with his win in singles play, and Alla followed with another singles win.
Senior Duke Miller sealed the win for the Tartans with his singles victory. First-years Yuvraj Kumar and Kosuke Hasegawa also won for Carnegie Mellon.
On Sunday, the men’s tennis team defeated Haverford College 6–3. Although the team encountered three losses in doubles matches, the men rallied back with stellar singles matches. Alla, Miller, Hasegawa, senior Jooho Yu, and Heaney-Secord all sealed victories for the Tartans to remain undefeated.
Unfortunately, the women’s team faced tough competition just the day before against eighth-ranked Division II California University of Pennsylvania and fell 6–3. Tsu and Hamstra won their doubles matches, while Hamstra and Pratt each won their singles matches against Cal U.
On Feb. 9, the men’s team defeated Division I Bucknell University. Beisswanger and Alla won 8–4 in doubles play to give the Tartans an excellent start. Kumar, Miller, and Rao all won in singles to contribute to the 5–4 victory.
""We've had a few great wins for the guys' team, which is especially important going into some tough spring break competition in California,"" Kumar said of the team's victories.
The day before, the women’s team took down Slippery Rock University in a 9–0 victory. The ladies won all of their singles and doubles matches to win on their home court. On the doubles side, Cecil paired with Pratt to win 8–0 against the No. 1 doubles team from Slippery Rock. Motie and Hamstra also won their doubles match against the No. 2 team.
Cecil, Motie, Martin, Pratt, Hamstra, and senior Alex Tapak all won their respective singles matches to contribute to a resounding Tartan victory.
The tennis team heads to Skidmore College on March 1 for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Team Indoor National Championship..

2013-02-18,CMU,India,"Many people would agree that food is one of the great pleasures of life. However, one of the principle tools we use to eat — our teeth — are poorly rewarded for the work they perform. In return for their work in crushing food and enabling us to eat all sorts of delicious substances, they are attacked by acid and dental bacteria. Fortunately, toothpaste can help mitigate the harmful effects that can befall teeth. This commonplace substance contains many ingredients that give it its potency and make it so essential to dental health.
According to researchers at New York University, toothpaste is not a recent invention; humans realized long ago the importance of keeping teeth clean and healthy. This substance originated about 6000 years ago in several forms. In China, twigs, flower petals, salt, water, and bones were mashed and put on the end of a sharp bamboo leaf to apply to teeth. In Egypt, salt, pepper, mint leaves, and iris flowers were mixed into a paste and used. In India, twigs from trees known for special dental properties were chewed upon and rubbed against teeth. All these methods led to healthy teeth that did not suffer from dental problems.
Now, let’s brush up on the science (pun intended) behind dental problems with some help from dental.net. Our teeth are made of layers; the outermost one is comprised of hard enamel. This hard substance protects the softer inside and nerves of our teeth. When taken care of, this enamel can last us an entire lifetime. However, modern-day diets that are extremely high in sugars and carbohydrates can cause several dental problems.
Sugars and carbohydrates release sulfur molecules that are responsible for dreaded bad breath. In addition, these substances are consumed by bacteria living in the teeth and enable them to multiply quickly. These bacteria release acids that eat away at enamel. If the enamel erodes, it exposes the nerves underneath which can lead to extreme pain and discomfort. Also, if the acid keeps building up, it may reach the root and render the tooth useless. The bacteria that cause all these problems live in plaque and food debris in our teeth. Toothpaste can help remove these bacteria, helping to prevent several dental problems.
According to thefactsabout.co.uk, one of the most well-known ingredients in toothpaste is fluoride. This element is naturally found in several foods like tea, fish, vegetables, and fruits. It is necessary for healthy teeth as it helps draw in minerals like calcium to the enamel and helps repair the tooth. Fluoride also attaches itself to weakened parts of the tooth, which keeps the tooth stronger in the future. These properties of fluoride are also the reason it is added to water supplies, and has been instrumental in improving the dental health of most people in the last few decades.
In addition to fluoride, toothpastes also contain other common materials. Toothpaste can contain abrasives, which help remove plaque and polish the teeth. These abrasives need to be able to scrub away harmful substances without causing permanent damage to the tooth enamel. 
Toothpaste also contains detergents, which give rise to the foam created while brushing. Toothpaste manufacturers also give importance to the texture of toothpaste. Humectants are the substances used to ensure that toothpaste stays moist and doesn’t dry out while in the tube. Thickeners are used to make the toothpaste stick together when squeezed from the tube and stick to the brush. Finally, preservatives and flavors ensure that toothpaste stays fresh and is enticing to users no matter what their taste preferences might be.
With the variety and styles of toothpaste available to us today, it is possible for everyone to find a type suited to their exact needs. The various benefits of toothpaste make it an essential part of our lives. Now, if only we could all floss regularly too..

2013-02-25,CMU,India,"First-year Abhishek Alla — known as “Shek” — although far from his home of Hyderabad, India, has served up a series of wins and greatly contributed to the undefeated Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team.
Most recently, Alla was named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Athlete of the Week for his performance the weekend of Feb. 16–17. Alla helped lead the Tartans to victory with his 2–0 dual-match record against some of the team’s toughest competition to keep the team at an unbeaten 6–0.
Alla posted a 2–0 mark in singles play. He started the weekend with a straight set victory at No. 3 singles, 6–1 over Matt Romei of Haverford College, and then turned in another straight set victory with a 6–4 win at No. 2 singles against Matthew Heinrich of the Stevens Institute of Technology.
“I think that, in addition to my 4.0 for the last semester, the last two matches have been the highlights of my college career so far,” Alla said.
The Tartans recently defeated big rivals such as Amherst College, which Alla said has been “[the] greatest accomplishment thus far this season.”
Alla is certainly no stranger to the sport of tennis, having played for 12 years. He values the traveling involved with the sport and the opportunity to “meet new people.”
Put simply, tennis for Alla “just feels good.”
“Abhishek’s game style is very unique and he understands tennis very well,” senior teammate Duke Miller said. “He is good at finding weaknesses in players and knowing how to use those weakness to win. Playing against Abhishek can be very confusing and frustrating for other tennis players.”
“Abhi has a very cool demeanor on the court. He doesn’t allow worries to get in the way of his abilities and naturally maintains a positive mindset, a trait that puts the whole team at ease,” sophomore teammate Bryce Beisswanger said.
Besides tennis, Alla enjoys watching movies and participating in activities sponsored by the Mayur South Asian Student Alliance, such as the recent MayurSASA dance show.
Of course, his civil engineering major keeps him busy with challenging coursework.
“Physics kicks my butt, and I plan to take Physics II at the [University of Pittsburgh] this summer,” he said. “Other than that, I can’t complain.”
Despite the adjustment to college life, Alla said that the “transition into college tennis has gone well.”
“The team has really been a big part of this adjustment. They’re just a funny group of characters,” he said.
His teammates feel the same way about Alla. “He is one of the most entertaining people on the team,” Miller said. “He is able to talk about school and tennis and doesn’t take anything too seriously. He always seems to be enjoying himself and having a good time as well, whether during matches, practice or workouts. He is good at speaking his mind and being very direct with people, which is often really funny.”
His antics are well known among the tennis team. “Abhishek thought it would be funny to pack a bag within another bag on our most recent trip to Philadelphia,” Miller said. “Everyone else was really confused, but he found it hysterical.”
“Shek always has a song in his head when he’s playing,” Beisswanger said. “Often a lot of players do the same but he surprised me in the fall when we played doubles together and following a missed shot he sounded of the chorus of ‘Don’t You Worry Child.’ ”
Alla emphasized the close-knit atmosphere of the tennis team, shown by their use of “meta-language.”
“I can’t even really describe the [meta-language],” Alla said. “It’s our own secret code.”
In addition to an enjoyable team atmosphere, Alla cites the proximity to family in the  Pittsburgh area as a favorite part of Carnegie Mellon, as well as another factor in helping him adjust to college life.
“It’s great to be able to get some delicious Indian food,” he said.
All settled in, Alla now sets his sights on his ambitions. “I want to be an All-American and compete at NCAAs.”
His teammates believe these goals are well within reach for Alla, whose fierce playing style and sense of humor continually surprise them. “He has a really funny style of playing so it’s hilarious when he starts playing and everyone is shocked. Abhishek is simply incredible,” first-year teammate Yuvraj Kumar said..

2013-02-25,CMU,India,"David Cameron, prime minister of the United Kingdom, expressed regret last Wednesday over the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during a visit to the area to discuss trade agreements. The bloodbath took place in the Jallianwala Bagh public gardens in Amritsar, a city in northern India. Fifty British soldiers fired on a crowd of Indian protesters. British sources reported the death toll at 379, while the Indian National Congress estimated that the number was closer to 1,000.
The date of this tragedy? 1919.
Acknowledging the crimes that the British Empire committed in India is important, but there is a difference between “expressing regret” and actually acknowledging fault. Cameron didn’t even apologize fully. This declaration was also made during a trip to India to discuss trade agreements, which makes the sincerity of his statements even more questionable. Admitting that the massacre was a travesty paints both Cameron and the United Kingdom in a better light; though that benefit was probably not Cameron’s only motive, this sudden revelation of national culpability is certainly convenient. 
Cameron is not the first man in politics to dance around wrongdoing. History has no shortage of “almost” apologies, even with the Jallianwala Bagh massacre itself. Cameron “offered his regrets,” just as Queen Elizabeth labeled it “a terrible tragedy” in 1997. In fact, in 1920, Winston Churchill referred to the event as “monstrous.” He was not the prime minister at the time, and once he actually gained power, he was markedly less sympathetic to the Indian plight. 
Cameron did not apologize, because if he apologizes for Jallianwala Bagh, what’s stopping him from apologizing for the Bengal famine of 1943? Why not apologize for any of the other famines in India caused by British mismanagement and neglect — or for the conflicts and bouts of imperialism they visited upon other nations, such as Afghanistan? The list of peoples wronged throughout history is a long one. 
Apologies, once begun, are difficult to stop.
And even if Cameron had offered India a full and complete acknowledgement of the evils of British colonialism in the early 1900s, what true good would that have done?
There is no bravery in apologizing for something that you have no control over. Sometimes it is necessary, but acknowledging the immorality of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre does not cost Cameron much. The massacre happened about 100 years ago. The current British government had no agency in the event.
Admitting that the legacies of colonialism still deeply impact the world today would be a braver act.
The massacre at Jallianwala Bagh is not still relevant today because 1,000 people were killed by an imperial oppressor in 1919. Of course the victims of that day deserved to remembered and honored. But the massacre itself is still relevant because it was part of a greater narrative of colonialism and oppression by imperial powers. Great Britain was one of those powers, but it was not the only one.
India, as a nation, still struggles with the after-effects of colonialism. A Harvard University study by economist Lakshmi Iyer concluded that specific regions within India that were under direct British rule still have more difficulties accessing schools and health centers, and that colonialism still impacts colonized nations greatly in the postcolonial period.
Cameron’s efforts would perhaps be better spent recognizing the lingering impacts of colonialism itself instead of apologizing for a single tragedy in that narrative.

2013-03-04,CMU,India,"This week was an interesting one for Pittsburgh sports fans. The Penguins are succeeding even with some injury issues, the Pirates are starting spring training, and the Steelers are setting themselves up for what will likely be a very busy off-season.
While this may be a slow time in terms of Pittsburgh sports, things are about to heat up with the NHL Playoffs, the start of the MLB regular season, and the NFL draft all on the horizon. Hopefully each team makes the right moves now to put themselves in a position to win when it counts.
Hockey
It seems like déjà vu for Penguins fans. As we near the halfway point of this shortened season, yet another of the Pittsburgh superstars has gone down with a concussion. 
The only difference is that this time it is Evgeni Malkin, not Sidney Crosby, who is out for an indeterminate time period.
Malkin was injured last Friday against the Florida Panthers, after taking a brutal hit from Panthers defenseman Erik Gudbranson. 
Malkin was skating in Florida territory with the puck, hoping to break a 1­–1 tie in the third period, when Gudbranson checked Malkin to the ground causing him to slide on the ice and slam his head against the boards.
He was immediately removed from the game due to severe headaches, mild disorientation, and other early concussion symptoms. 
The play itself was a clean hit, but the real damage was done when Malkin’s head and neck whiplashed when he hit the boards.
The glimmer of hope for Pens fans was the speed with which Malkin has returned to the ice. 
Wednesday, Malkin skated around for 30 minutes during practice, but he still has a ways to go before he can play again. 
It is also important to remember the varied progress Crosby had in the nearly two years he spent trying to recover from his own concussion.
Thankfully, the Penguins are still in an easy position to make the playoffs with Crosby finally returning to his dominating form after two years off due to concussions. 
Goalie Marc-André Fleury and the Pens’ defense is also doing its part, ranking in the middle of the league in points allowed.
When coupled with their second-rank offensive, their defense’s performance has led the team to second place in the NHL’s Eastern Conference.
Baseball
For the Pirates, this may finally be the year that’s different. On the back of all-star Andrew McCutchen, third baseman slugger Pedro Alvarez, major free-agent acquisition Russell Martin, and a rotation that includes A.J. Burnett, Wandy Rodríguez, and James McDonald, the Pirates look to finally end this season with a winning record for the first time in 21 years.
The Pirates are still a year or two away from really making some noise in the National League Central Division, but at least they are headed in the right direction.
The front office has shown a commitment to winning by negotiating a big-money contract extension for McCutchen and out-paying the New York Yankees for Martin’s catching services.
Starling Marte is a name to keep an eye on this year. 
He got called up from the minor leagues in July last year, and appears to be in position to win the starting left field job out of spring training. 
At just 24 years old, he has plenty of room to grow but has some good power and great spee
Football
After last season’s crazy off-season with the team firing offensive coordinator Bruce Arians, who went on to win coach-of-the-year honors with the Indianapolis Colts, the Steelers missed the playoffs and barely had a winning record.
This off-season is setting up to be just as hectic, with the Steelers trying to get younger players on defense while also trying to get under the salary cap.
So far the Steelers have renegotiated quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s contract, but have pretty much given up all hope of signing free agent receiver Mike Wallace again.
The Steelers have better draft picks than in recent years — the 17th pick in the first round — due to their poor regular season performance. This could be used either to continue fixing their aging and porous offensive line or to rejuvenate the slowing defense..

2013-03-04,CMU,India,"TEDxCMU, a conference devoted to bringing together innovative thinkers, brought 11 speakers — including two Carnegie Mellon students — to the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium on Sunday to give short talks that covered a wide array of topics, ranging from urban revitalization to delivering happiness in students’ daily lives.
Ketaki Desai, a third-year graduate student in public policy and management and presdient of TEDxCMU, described the idea behind TED talks. “TED is basically a conference that was started by journalist Chris Anderson, and the idea was that people should be able to describe what they’re doing in 15 to 18 minutes or even less. The idea was to inspire people with things that everybody was doing, because there was no way to know what people were working on,” Desai said.
The theme of TEDxCMU this year was “Spark”; the event’s goal was “to spark collaboration and foster connections between participants, encouraging aspiring individuals to follow their dreams and make a difference.”
Zofia Tillman, a first-year chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major and volunteer at TEDxCMU, said that the theme of “Spark” refers to “that moment when you figure out how to develop your idea, or when you figure out what you’re passionate about.”
This year, TEDxCMU featured Jon Clark, Jenn Lim, Darell Hammond, Judy Swan, Rodrigo Arboleda, Eve Picker, Linda Benedict-Jones, Jeff Ferrell, and Rob Daley, as well as first-year computational biology major Rebecca Alford and senior directing major Stephen Tonti.
TED began in 1987 as a conference to bring together the worlds of technology, entertainment, and design. According to TED’s website, their mission is to spread ideas and change the world, noting that, “we’re building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world’s most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.”
TEDxCMU is independently organized; TED’s website describes such TEDx events as “giv[ing] communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level.”
Continuing a practice that began last year, this year’s TEDxCMU featured two Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students as speakers: Rebecca Alford and Stephen Tonti. Compared to only 18 entries last year, this year’s contest to be a student speaker generated 55 student entries, Desai said.
Sophia Nanda, a sophomore physics major in attendance at TEDxCMU, talked about the first speaker of the day. Jon Clark, medical director at Red Bull Stratos, described his work on the team that organized Felix Baumgartner’s record-breaking jump from the stratosphere on Oct. 14, 2012.
“As a science student, I saw [Clark’s] bio before coming and he was what I was waiting to hear about. It was really amazing seeing one of his applied projects come to life; it’s something I want to do later in life,” Nanda said.
First-year economics major Cynthia Hsia commented on the message of collaboration that Clark spoke about. “It was really inspiring, especially with the video that he showed. It was cool to see how everyone as an individual made it work together.”
The next speaker, Eve Picker, chief executive officer at cityLAB Pittsburgh, focused on what she called the “cure for the common city.” Picker explained the difference between bottom-up and top-down city design, using Pittsburgh’s CONSOL Energy Center as an example of an expensive, top-down project and the Toonseum in Downtown as an example of a cheaper, bottom-up method for revitalization.
“Imagine a city where 5 million visits are generated by 13,000 small projects — that’s a cure for the common city,” Picker said.
Rachel Fowler, a first-year business administration major, said she liked that Picker “focused on improving cities in ways that no one has really focused on before.”
Linda Benedict-Jones, curator of photography at the Carnegie Museum of Art and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon, talked about her journey as a photographer after getting her bachelor’s degree in English literature.
Holly Dennis, a first-year dramaturgy major, said that she admired Benedict-Jones’ passion for photography. “I’m taking my first photography class this semester, and that was really inspiring because I’ve always had a passion for photography, but just dabbled in it. [Benedict-Jones] talked about the magic of print and stuff and it really is magic; it’s crazy magic.”
TEDxCMU also featured a performance by first-year MBA student Chinmayi Bhavanishankar, who performed a classical South Indian dance and talked about her passion for the narrative nature of Bharatanatyam dance. 
She emphasized how Indian dancing has evolved from a hobby to a passion and into a daily routine that she cannot imagine living without. 
In the second half of the event, The Originals, Carnegie Mellon’s all-male a cappella group, also performed, engaging the crowd with a few songs, including a mash-up of two popular songs.
The last speaker before the lunch break was Robert Daley, the chief executive officer of 4moms. 
Daley showcased several baby products produced by his company that used robotics to make them “dramatically better.” 
One of the devices featured was the mamaRoo, a baby seat that mimics the natural rocking and bouncing motions of a mother comforting her child.
After lunch, first-year biological sciences major Rebecca Alford gave her talk. Alford has congenital stationary night blindness, a rare, incurable disease that impairs her vision.
“I can see about half of what the normal individual can see,” Alford said. “What was most important about this was that it introduced the idea of adaptation. The reality was that there wouldn’t be some change or cure for my condition any time soon.”
Alford’s condition led her to do novel computational biology research as a 14-year- old at her high school and at the Bonneau Laboratory at New York University.
Jenn Lim, the next speaker, spoke about Delivering Happiness, a company she co-founded with Tony Hsieh, chief executive officer of Zappos.com. 
According to her presentation at TEDxCMU, Lim described Delivering Happiness as a way “to inspire science-based happiness, passion and purpose at work, home and everyday life.”
Chairman and chief executive officer of One Laptop per Child Association (OLPCA) Rodrigo Arboleda gave his lecture on “provid[ing] equal opportunity of access to knowledge to small children in developing nations and in some communities within the USA.”
Jeff Ferrell, professor of sociology at Texas Christian University and visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, gave a talk about “the broader issues that we confront in our lives, such as ... what rules are made and why, the issues we confront as citizens ... [and] going over to an area beyond those rules.”
Senior directing major Stephen Tonti began his talk stating that he had ADHD and continued to speak about how this disorder led him to his passion of directing. He had a light-hearted approach to his speech, emphasizing that because of his ADHD he had the opportunity to explore all different avenues in discovering his zeal.
The talks at TEDxCMU were interspersed with videos of lectures from other TEDx events. TEDxCMU brought together speakers from all facets of study and experience, allowing students to gain new perspective. 
It challenged students to think about their own goals and their futures in terms of helping change the world.  .

2013-03-25,CMU,India,"March Madness is the time of year when the sports world stops what it’s doing and focuses on college basketball for three weeks. Office pools for the NCAA tournament destroy productivity and more employees can be found in bars than in cubicles watching a plethora of games involving teams no one has heard of, but that everyone suddenly has opinions about. This is the time of year when Cinderella underdogs steal the heart of the nation, except for the people whose brackets are ruined by an improbable upset.
This year has been no different. With competition at the highest it’s been in years, no real powerhouse team has dominated opponents and small unknowns have beaten the longstanding powerhouses during the regular season. The level playing field has been apparent throughout the first two days of the tournament.
After an uneventful first round, the second round opened on Thursday, and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers were quickly sent home. Pitt, an 8 seed in the tournament, was dominated by Wichita State University, a 9 seed. The game was a slug fest with the two teams combining to shoot only 3–37 from three-point range and both teams averaging less that 40 percent from the field.
Both 14 seed Davidson College and 16 seed Southern University came within a few minutes of overthrowing 3 seed Marquette University and 1 seed Gonzaga University, respectively. Davidson led for most of the second half and had a chance to seal the deal with five seconds left, but threw an errant pass out of bounds, allowing Marquette to make a quick game winning layup. Southern University took a brief lead in the first half only to turn into a down by one situation after missing several shots in the last two minutes of the game.
The traditional 12–5 upsets continued with the University of Oregon beating Oklahoma State University and the University of California, Berkeley beating the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in a buzzer beater. Oregon exerted its dominance early, taking the lead for good half-way through the first half. The game was not even close in the second half, with the Oregon lead slipping into double digits. California kept the game closer, but never trailed in the second half as they cruised to victory.
The real upset of the night came in one of the late games, with Ivy League champion and 14 seed Harvard University defeating 3 seed University of New Mexico with relative ease. Harvard shot over 50 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range.
Friday had many more upsets with 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 seeds all losing to double-digit seeded opponents. Fifteen seed Florida Gulf Coast University knocked off the perennial basketball powerhouse Georgetown University in impressive fashion. This was only the seventh time since the tournament expanded to its current 64+ team format that so many upsets occurred; last year notable upsets included Lehigh University defeating Duke University, and Norfolk State University toppling the University of Missouri.
The 13 seed in the West Region, La Salle University, defeated the 4 seed Kansas State University, albeit in less convincing fashion than some of the other lower seeds. La Salle nearly choked, surrendering the lead late in the second half. They reclaimed the lead with 30 seconds to play and barely held on through a missed Kansas State jump shot that would have given them the lead with less than 10 seconds left.
Five seed University of Wisconsin-Madison fell to the University of Mississippi, winner of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament. Mississippi is home to March Madness’s most animated player, Marshall Henderson. Henderson became known for his on-court antics after Ole Miss’ ran through the SEC tournament to earn their spot in the NCAA tournament. His most infamous move is the Florida gator chop sign, which he created after taking the lead against University of Florida in the SEC tournament finals.
Eleven seed University of Minnesota never trailed in their game against the historic basketball program of University of California, Los Angeles. They did it with lights-out shooting, making over 50 percent from the floor and over 56 percent from three-point range, ending the game with a 20-point margin of victory.
Iowa State University rounded out the double digit team success with its win over 7 seed University of Notre Dame. Iowa State scored early and quickly took control of the game, cruising to an 18-point victory.
As we go forward into the tournament, it appears that brackets will continue to get busted left and right. The upsets continued in the third round on Saturday, with first seed Gonzaga falling victim to Wichita State, and Oregon continuing to play bracket buster, this time defeating 4 seed St. Louis University.
This is the year of the unknown as parity reaches an all-time high in college basketball. While some of the traditional powers still remain (University of Louisville, University of Kansas, Indiana, Duke, Michigan State University), it seems just as likely that this year’s Final Four will likely consist of newcomers to elite college basketball..

2013-03-25,CMU,India,"After the highly publicized trial surrounding the Steubenville rape case, where a 16-year-old girl was raped at a party by two high school football players, it's natural that the media had an immediate response to the rapists’ sentencing. Their response, however, was less than ideal.
Rather than bemoan the fact that these rapists received the minimum sentence — both serving a year for the rape and one serving another year for circulating pictures of the rape — major news outlets like CNN grieved the guilty verdict. CNN correspondent Poppy Harlow, while reporting from the scene, stated how difficult it was to watch ""as these two young men, [who] had such promising futures — star football players, very good students — literally watched as they believed their [lives] fell apart.""
The judge of the case mentioned that ""this is the problem with social media."" A correspondent for NBC again emphasized the sadness of the future of the rapists: ""Both boys had promising football careers — Mays the quarterback, Richmond the receiver — on the beloved high school team and dreams of college. In court, their lawyers and parents pleaded with the judge not to impose a harsh sentence.""
In what world is this a proper reaction to a rape sentencing? Despite how promising their careers may have seemed before this trial, the guilty verdict is not what ruined their futures. What ruined their futures was their decision to commit a rape.
A boy can be a football star and an excellent student, but that doesn't mean anything if he is also a rapist. These boys made the conscious decision to take advantage of a girl and brag about it on social media, and none of that says ""promising future."" They committed the crime and they should have to pay the consequences for their actions. A few years in jail and registration as juvenile sex offenders is a lighter sentence than they would have gotten had they been tried as adults.
The most disturbing part of these reactions is not the fact that they happened, but the fact that they happen so frequently. As a country, we decry India and Egypt for being rape friendly, but we close our eyes to what happens on our own soil. The reaction to the Steubenville case was abhorrent, but it was not unusual. 
When someone tries to take their rapist to court, it is common for rape apologists to come out of the woodwork to ask questions and draw conclusions that don't matter. ""What were you wearing? Were you drunk? Do you have casual sex? Did you lead him on? Was it really rape, or just sex that you regretted in the morning?"" These are just a few questions that rape survivors must answer — it’s no surprise that 97 percent of rapists never spend a day in jail, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).
The reaction to rape needs to change. It's sickening to live in a country so saturated in rape culture that we blame the victims for ruining the lives of the rapists. 
Without a drastic change in the way we react to cases of rape, there is no way we can change anything else about the crime; everything from how often rape is committed to how many rapes go unreported is a direct result of valuing the rapist over the victim. In a report published by the U.S. Department of Justice, women admitted that they feared reprimands from police officers for reporting an incident.
Rape is a problem in America, and it's clear from the reactions to the Steubenville case that people don't even realize it..

2013-04-01,CMU,India,"Baseball’s opening night game last Sunday between new American League (AL) West opponents, the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros, began a season that will introduce one of the most sweeping changes in Major League Baseball. The season will also hopefully see the Pittsburgh Pirates achieve their first winning season since 1992.
The most notable of these changes is the Astros’ move from the once-six-team National League (NL) Central to the previously four-team AL West in an effort to balance the divisions and to give teams a more even field in which to win their division and guarantee a playoff spot.
With this move, the AL and NL are now balanced at 15 teams apiece, forcing Interleague play to shift from a three- to four-week novelty during May and June to a year-round necessity. The Pirates and the rest of the NL Central should be relieved that their six-team divisional logjam is finally remedied, even if it means removing the pitiful Astros. Unfortunately for the Pirates, the division is still stacked, and they face an uphill battle to finally posting a winning season.
Let’s look at each team in the NL Central, breaking down off-season moves, strengths and weaknesses, as well as predicting how they will finish come September.
First Place
Cincinnati Reds
The Reds finished last season in first place with a devastating offense and a lights-out pitching staff. Even though they finished last year with the second-most wins in baseball, the Reds were still active this off-season, trading center fielder Drew Stubbs for right fielder Shin-Soo Choo from the Cleveland Indians in a three-team deal. While some people question this move from a defensive standpoint — Choo has never played center fielder in his major league career — the offensive impact is quite apparent. Choo fills the large hole at their lead-off spot and turns the already potent Cincinnati lineup into one of the best in the league.
Second Place
St. Louis Cardinals
The Cardinals seem unfazed by any loss of talent. Each year, several key players suffer injuries, and yet St. Louis keeps winning. This year is no different, with ace Chris Carpenter and starting shortstop Rafael Furcal already lost to season ending injuries.
All that being said, the Cardinals have one of the best farm systems and have several minor league players who are expected to contribute this year, including outfielder Oscar Taveras who will start the year in the minors, and three young pitchers starting in the majors — Trevor Rosenthal, Shelby Miller, and Joe Kelly.
Third Place
Pittsburgh Pirates
After a close call last year, this should be the year that the Pirates have their first winning season in over 20 years. All-Star Andrew McCutchen is fresh off his best season and still has room to grow. Catcher Russell Martin made waves in the off-season by turning down a contract to remain with New York Yankees and instead signing with the Pirates. Hopefully this influx of leadership, in addition to the continued improvement of McCutchen, slugging third baseman Pedro Alvarez, and former All-Star Gaby Sánchez, will help the Pirates avoid the late-season slumps that plagued the team the past two seasons.
Fourth Place
Milwaukee Brewers
Even after losing slugging first baseman Prince Fielder last offseason, hitting the ball was never the Brewers’ main issue after leading the league in runs and home runs last season. Milwaukee’s real problem lies with its pitching. Milwaukee recently signed veteran free-agent pitcher Kyle Lohse ago to bolster its starting rotation behind ace Yovani Gallardo. While this move certainly helps firm up their starting pitching, there are still major questions with the young pitchers rounding out the back end of the rotation.
The bullpen is also a mess for the Brewers. Last year, closer John Axford blew seven of his first 23 save opportunities — part of the team’s league high 29 blown saves.
Fifth Place
Chicago Cubs
Last year the Cubs were really bad, and this season appears to be no different. Playing for the future is Chicago’s strategy during the second year of general manager Theo Epstein’s rein. The Cubs have a good group of young players lead by Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo, but they still need another year or two to reach their full potential.
A strong free-agent class headlined by starting pitchers Edwin Jackson, Carlos Villanueva, and Scott Feldman may give the Cubs some spark this season, but the real payoff will come in a few years when all of the prospects Epstein has amassed begin to make the majors..

2013-04-08,CMU,India,"Travel writer Pico Iyer spoke at Carnegie Mellon last Tuesday as part of the ongoing Adamson Writers Series. A writer for Time magazine since 1986, Iyer has authored multiple fiction and nonfiction books, with his latest being The Man Within My Head.
The title of the lecture was “Moving and Sitting Still in Our New Global Order” and primarily discussed how, in today’s internationally minded society, many people straddle different cultures and places they can accurately call home. Iyer had much insight on the subject: He traced his family roots to India, split his youth between boarding schools in England and his parents’ home in Santa Barbara, and talked about how he now spends seven months of the year in Japan.
While billed as a lecture, the event was anything but. Iyer opened by saying he wished to have a conversation instead of just talking, and that kind of informal mood pervaded the event. Iyer didn’t use a PowerPoint presentation and didn’t speak as if he were carefully arguing a point. He shared humorous anecdotes about friends such as the Dalai Lama, of whom Iyer is a close companion; in fact, Iyer wrote an account of his travels with His Holiness in his book The Open Road. Iyer also spoke charismatically and energetically about events in his life and the lessons he took from them, which kept his modest audience very much engaged and hanging on to his every word.
While his talk was somewhat disappointing in that it lacked focused points, Iyer made many interesting small points about where people come from in today’s society, eloquently spinning them into phrases such as “stained-glass homes,” and saying that, “Home is where you become yourself.” As his own globe-hopping proves, he doesn’t see “home” as an exact place; instead, he sees “home” as a state of mind and a definition of the self. He says that the greatest pressure of the modern moment is “to figure out where we belong both physically and internally” — a relevant idea at a place so full of different nationalities as Carnegie Mellon.
Iyer also expressed his excitement at how our increasingly globalized society introduces new sights, sounds, and smells into daily life that we often may not notice or take for granted. For example, how often do any of us eat cuisine from different areas of the world for each individual meal of the day? The fact that he was able to bring in these kinds of little details from our everyday lives and connect them to such grander themes helped make the talk extremely thought-provoking.
At the end of his talk, Iyer enthusiastically answered many questions from the audience, some in response to his talk and others that had clearly been rattling around in people’s heads for a while. 
When asked why he chooses to spend so much of his time in Japan, he replied that it was a country with a “mix of energy and serenity,” and that being a foreigner in Japan allows one to enjoy a combination of familiarity and strangeness without the social pressures that natives feel. In response to an excited audience member holding up his interview with Leonard Cohen that had come out in Time earlier that day, he talked about his experience living in a monastery with the famed poet, singer, and songwriter. He also attributed the recent increase in interest in Cohen’s works to the idea that our increasingly complicated lives are losing the kind of simplicity and honesty that he embodies.
The final question asked whether Iyer had ever been to the Japanese region of Hokkaido, which is famed for its beauty. Iyer responded that he has yet to make it there and desperately wants to as well. It turns out that, for all the traveling that Iyer has done over the years, there are still places he wants to go..

2013-04-15,CMU,India,"Victoria Espinel, the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator for the Executive Office of the President, gave a talk in Hamburg Hall at noon last Thursday as part of the Heinz College Convocation open forum series. Titled “Protecting U.S. Intellectual Property: A View from the Front Lines,” Espinel’s lecture covered how one manages to wind up in such an obscure yet important position and offered a look at the current issues facing the United States in the realm of intellectual property enforcement.
Espinel’s talk was divided into two categories: The biography of her professional life, and what her department is currently engaged in doing. In terms of career, she offered several key pieces of advice to those gathered there. “Do things that intimidate you,” Espinel urged students, saying that she would never have reached her current position if she had not made career moves that were not “safe.” Students were also advised to find their own styles and not to worry about being credited with work.
“If you’re building a team,” Espinel said, “hire people better than you, people who want your job.” She argued that people after your job will be motivated to prove themselves, meanwhile making you look good so that there will be a job for you to move on to.
Those strategies served Espinel well as she made her way from law school to law school, going from a job as a securities lawyer to working in telecommunications law. Ultimately, Espinel found herself as an expert on copyright issues after she registered for a semester at a school in London where the professor she intended to take classes with was on sabbatical. Espinel was appointed to her current position in September of 2009 by President Obama, and was confirmed by congress shortly after.
“Protection of intellectual property is critical to our economy,” Espinel said, citing former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan’s claim that the U.S. economy is currently based more on conceptual goods as opposed to physical goods. On a related note, she argued that the trade deficit is not quite so dire as it may appear if one takes into account that it is offset by a trade surplus in services and intellectual properties.
The main concern in the world of intellectual property enforcement seems to be trade secrets. Manufacturing processes and technological advancements are of critical importance to some businesses, but to stay effective in the face of globalization it is often necessary to share important pieces of intellectual property in regions where they are at risk of being pirated.
However, Espinel stressed that “the country should be “supporting companies even if they move jobs overseas, but they need to do it in a way that makes sure that they retain their value to the U.S.”
While fielding questions, Espinel commented on some of the more sensitive issues in international copyright law. While she acknowledged the need for relaxing some of the stricter parts of Intellectual Property Law in regards to technology transfers with developing countries, it is important to prevent “forced technology transfers, [with] companies being forced to hand over know-how” by foreign powers.
Audience reaction to Espinel’s lecture was positive. Master’s student in public policy and management Adhithi Adhi said, “It was nice to know what the current administration is doing about trade secrets and copyright.” Adhi appreciated the talk for helping her understand an issue she didn’t know much about , having come from India.
Ian Kloo, a fellow master’s student in public policy and management also enjoyed the talk. “[It’s] not super related to my studies but it’s a hot topic.” Kloo was also pleased with the forum series as a whole. “In general the Convocations have been pretty good, they’ve managed to get pretty high-level people.”.

2013-04-29,CMU,India,"A simple telephone game called Polly hardly seems like a life-changing technology with the potential to aid developing countries. However, Carnegie Mellon Language Technologies Institute professor Roni Rosenfeld and Ph.D. student Agha Ali Raza’s use of Polly to help illiterate people in Pakistan get in touch with prospective employers does indeed have that potential.
Polly is a simple game in which a caller can record a message, add various funny sound effects, and send it to a friend. The user begins the game by calling Polly’s number. “It’s a missed-call mechanism,” Raza said. “When you call, Polly doesn’t pick up, but instead calls you back so you don’t have to pay for the call. This is because the people with whom we are working with are generally poor so they are sensitive about the air-time cost.”    
Next, the user records a message. Polly then plays back the message with several different sound effects, such as the “I have to run to the bathroom” effect, the “drunk chipmunk” effect, the “whisper” effect, or background music. The user then selects one of the effects and gives Polly the number of the friend whom it will be sent to.
“A system as simple as Polly is easy for people here to use,” Raza said. “But in developing countries it’s a big challenge for people because they expect a person on the other end of the phone. So how do we teach them? One way is to develop something so fun that they want to learn it themselves.” 
Polly is this development. It teaches low-skilled and illiterate people how to use speech interfaces in an entertaining way.
But as fun as it is to send silly messages to friends, that’s not all that Polly is capable of doing. In Polly’s main menu, there is also an option to listen to job postings. “Part of our team is working in Pakistan,” Raza said. “They scan the daily newspaper and try to find advertisements that are suitable for low-skilled workers. These are updated every two to three days.” Examples of such jobs include positions for maids, gardeners, and drivers. 
This unique feature offers illiterate individuals the opportunity to apply for jobs they wouldn’t have heard of otherwise. Polly also gives the option of forwarding advertisement postings to friends. “It’s very hard to reach people who aren’t educated and can’t read or write,” Rosenfeld said. “You can’t reach them through newspapers or through billboards. The only way you can reach them is by sound — by voice.”
Polly has been an extreme success since it first launched last May. According to a live tracker of Polly online, its overall call volume has reached over 160,000 users and job advertisements have been listened to by over 380,000 callers. There are approximately 700 job advertisements posted in the system; this means that, on average, each job advertisement has been listened to around 500 times. In addition to job postings, Raza and Rosenfeld are looking into how to incorporate surveys and public service announcements into Polly. This way, Polly can both disseminate and gather information. Other possible directions for future expansion include giving reports on health, agriculture, or weather — things that people need on an everyday basis.
Polly is currently centered in Pakistan, because that is where Raza is from, which makes it easy for him to communicate with the people there. “It’s generally a good idea to have locals working with you who can also understand the work you are doing,” Raza said. They plan to launch Polly in India next week, and they will continue to expand it in the years to come. “We will just write down the phone number and give it to some low-literate people and tell them to call it and see what happens,” Raza said. “That’s how we launched Polly in the first place, and that’s how it took off.”
In fact, Raza and Rosenfeld only gave Polly’s number to five Pakistanis last May. “We haven’t given it to anybody else. Polly spread by itself,” Rosenfeld said.
Polly is a simple game, but it exemplifies a concept that has the potential to make a big difference in the world: using entertainment to reach underprivileged populations. If Polly spreads throughout the rest of the world as fast as it spread through Pakistan, it will change millions of lives..

2013-04-29,CMU,India,"Tucked away at the back of the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is a small room filled with dazzling jewels and stunning necklaces, bracelets, brooches, and more. While they look as though they could belong to royalty, in reality the precious gems in this room are the works of artist Paula Crevoshay as part of the Garden of Light exhibit.
As one enters the room, a large turquoise and gold necklace glittering under its display case immediately catches the viewer’s eye. Strategically placed at the center of the room, this necklace drew several visitors to the exhibit and was unarguably the main attraction. Nevertheless, the multitude of sparkling artifacts lining the walls could capture the attention of jewelry aficionados and those indifferent to jewelry alike.
Crevoshay, who has been designing jewelry for more than 30 years, began doing so as a hobby. After four years of learning ancient metal techniques used in India, she launched her career in jewelry design. Crevoshay’s workshops currently span the U.S. from New Mexico to New York, with additional locations in Thailand and Hong Kong. Her pieces are priced between $5,000 and $250,000, and have been compared to those by designers Fabergé and Lalique. The main reason for such steep prices is her design process: According to Whirl magazine, each piece is drawn by hand, and contains 18-karat yellow gold intertwined with gemstones that have been sourced from all over the world.
Each collection featured in the Garden of Light exhibit is entirely unique from the next, yet still unified by the common theme of nature. Crevoshay draws inspiration from the beauty of the environment, evidenced by names such as “The Undersea Garden” and “Big Blue Marble” for her jewelry collections.
The previously mentioned turquoise and gold necklace is part of “The Undersea Garden” collection. Other standouts in the exhibit include the “What is Green?” display, consisting of jewelry characterized by gold swirls and intricately carved gems in the emerald hue, as well as the water-centric “Big Blue Marble,” which contains jewels with opal, pearl, and turquoise. Yet another called “Winged Partners” pays tribute to its namesake, with glimmering brooches in the shapes of butterflies and dragonflies. Even for someone without any interest in brooches, it is impossible not to admire the elegance of Crevoshay’s designs.
Those with no inclination toward jewelry should not be discouraged from visiting this exhibit. As beautiful as the Garden of Light is, it is educational as well. There is one display of famous diamonds from around the world, where the description reads, “Many have adorned the crowns of royalty, while others have been lost in the mists of time.” Each gemstone has its source location indicated, and some are even emphasized, such as the “Tourmalines of Brazil” collection. This enchanting exhibit takes visitors out of the museum and transports them to, as the name indicates, a garden of light.
The Garden of Light exhibit will be on display at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History through Aug. 11..

2013-04-29,CMU,India,"This isn’t your typical high-brow list filled with Oscar nominations or European art films. Let’s face it: Argo was far from the best picture of the year and only won Best Picture because it kissed Hollywood’s butt and featured the comeback of Ben Affleck and his amazing facial hair. The films listed below are the ones that impacted college students. They’re actually exciting, and they took us to another world without leaving us hopeless or depressed at the end (cough Amour cough). In no particular order, we present to you some of the best films of the 2012–13 school year.
Facing Morality Without Sentimentality
Flight
Don’t let the trailer fool you. While at first glance it may seem like a ridiculous plot centered around Denzel Washington commandeering an upside-down airplane, Flight presents a very real and very difficult struggle over addiction and responsibility. Washington gives a powerhouse performance as the alcoholic pilot driven to humility and acceptance over the destructive choices that make this film so believable and human.
The Sessions
A story about a quadriplegic who vows to lose his virginity with the help of a sex surrogate, The Sessions is an incredibly beautiful film about living a life unrestrained by fear and paralysis, physical or otherwise. John Hawkes provides a miraculously powerful yet accessible portrait of a man who wants to live a normal but fulfilling life — one that not only moves viewers to tears but also inspires them to do the same.
The Mind Bender
Looper
Expertly blending futuristic sci-fi with old-school gangster movies, Looper follows time-traveling mobsters who kill victims sent from the future. Rather than getting bogged down in the mechanics of time travel, Looper instead focuses on thorough character development, allowing for a meaningful and contemplative story arc.
Seven Psychopaths 
Written and directed by legendary playwright Martin McDonagh, Seven Psychopaths is a refreshing black comedy crime film with an all-star cast that delivers amazing performances and biting wit. The film begins with a seemingly harmless and playful plot around a struggling screenwriter named Marty, played by Colin Farrell, trying to find the perfect movie. He becomes entangled in a dog kidnapping plot while trying to deal with two men named Billy and Hans — played by Sam Rockwell and the incredible Christopher Walken, respectively — who run a dog-kidnapping business. Little do they know how much trouble they run into when they steal the beloved Shih Tzu of a dangerous and psychotic L.A. mobster named Charlie, played by Woody Harrelson. The story possesses incredible twists and turns that make the film very dark, yet genuinely funny within seconds. Walken is pitch-perfect as the delicately cunning Hans, and Farrell is marvelous as the anxiety-driven character driven into a whirlwind of psychopaths. Together, they make for a truly entertaining picture.
Man vs. Beast, Man as Beast
Life of Pi
Ang Lee managed to make a seemingly unfilmable book into one of the best films in recent history. The story revolves around a teenage Indian boy named Pi who has lost everything, including his family, in a shipwreck. Pi finds himself stranded in the vast nothingness of the sea with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. A visual and spiritual masterpiece of cinema, Life of Pi is a rare treasure that makes a viewer question not only the journey that Pi faces, but how one should view life itself: Should we focus only on the inevitable dark misfortunes of life, or should we convert those misfortunes into a beautiful experience of its own? In a way, everyone has a little bit of Pi in them, which makes this film a magnificent ode to life and how we as human beings should decide to live it.
The Heart Warmers
Silver Linings Playbook
A story about mental disease and about moving on with life, Silver Linings Playbook is a romantic comedy done right. With Bradley Cooper as an estranged husband diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Jennifer Lawrence as a sex-crazed but wounded widow, there is plenty of homely spark that provides warmth and joy for its viewers. In its vulnerable characters lies the relatable core of this film, making it a journey of hope and acceptance for two seemingly messed-up characters who find each other in chaotic circumstances.
The Intouchables
A cultural sensation in its native France, The Intouchables is a storytelling miracle in which a rich quadriplegic named Phillipe befriends a man off the street named Driss and hires him as a caretaker. While it seems like an overdone formula, The Intouchables conveys fresh and true feelings of affection and love that develop in the strongest human relationships.
The Troublemakers
Django Unchained
Quentin Tarantino’s wild Spaghetti Western epic is — as expected — filled with rich dialogue and spectacular performances that make it one of the most entertaining pictures of the year. With several stylistic showdowns between a vengeful Jamie Foxx as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie — a southern version of a young monarch who likes to play sick games —  Django Unchained exceeds any other film this year in terms of explosive charisma and energy.
Spring Breakers
There are going to be expectations when Disney starlets play wild party girls spending their college spring break with a “gangster with a heart of gold” named Alien, played by a James Franco complete with cornrows, tattoos, and grills. While it may seem like an airheaded excuse for exploiting young actresses, Spring Breakers takes a sudden and dark turn that feels more like a real-life experience than an actual film. Director Harmony Korine creates a splashy, fizzy portrait of a spring break gone too far — yet he infuses it with enough life that it’s hard not become invested in the girls’ wild journey. Plus, there is a Britney Spears montage. Enough said.
The Modern Masterpiece
Anna Karenina
One of the most overlooked films of this year, the newest adaptation of Anna Karenina provides a bizarre yet entrancingly beautiful new look for the Tolstoy classic. Joe Wright, director of films such as Pride and Prejudice, Atonement, and Hanna creates a blazing theatricality that enhances the majestic Russian setting as well as the dramatic nature of the story. With Keira Knightley playing the doomed protagonist, she provides a charming and complex portrait that falls in love with the seductive Count Vronsky, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson. The film is gloriously unique with its dream-like aura and fabulous performances that uphold the classic novel’s reputation.
Hopefully, this will serve as a refreshing guide from the otherwise redundant lists that overlooked a few films. With a wide array of genres and themes, there are many great experiences to be had when watching some of the best movies that helped us survive another year as college students..

2013-08-19,CMU,India,"On a festive occasion involving Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, staff, and alumni from around the world, former National Science Foundation (NSF) director Subra Suresh assumed office as Carnegie Mellon’s new president at the end of last school year. Suresh began his term on July 1 as the university’s ninth president, succeeding President Jared Cohon. 
Suresh was selected by a 17-member committee, which included representation from the university’s Board of Trustees, faculty, and alumni. Anthony Rollett, former head of the Faculty Senate and professor of materials science and engineering, chaired the faculty committee. The search committee selected Suresh from hundreds of outstanding candidates. 
“As the co-chair of the search committee, it was extremely rewarding to work with the entire community in the search process and to succeed in attracting such an outstanding individual as our new president,” Rollett said.
Suresh received his bachelor of technology from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in Chennai in May 1977, his master’s in science from Iowa State University in May 1979, and his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in August 1981. After completing his post-doctorate research at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the Brown University faculty in December 1983.
After 10 years at Brown, Suresh joined MIT in 1993 as the R.P. Simmons Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, and later became the Vannevar Bush Professor of Engineering. In 2000, he was appointed head of the department of materials science and engineering. In July 2007, when he began his tenure as the dean of MIT’s School of Engineering, he became the first Asia-born dean of any MIT school.
During his time as dean at MIT, Suresh recruited a record number of women faculty members in engineering and promoted cutting-edge interdisciplinary study. As an accomplished engineer, he made medical discoveries by studying the mechanical nature of individual human cells and highlighting their connections to human disease states.
Suresh’s ability to pioneer innovation by combining academic disciplines set a precedent for the broad scope of research and career applications for MIT scholars, in engineering or otherwise. He remained at MIT until September 2010, when he was nominated by President Barack Obama and unanimously confirmed by the Senate as director of the NSF.
As NSF director, Suresh focused not only on keeping the United States at the forefront of scientific development, but also on empowering current and future generations of scientists. The focus of his initiatives included training young scientists to balance work and family life, accelerating commercialization of university research, teaching researchers to transform their ideas into products, and emphasizing international scientific collaboration.
“Science and science policy are inextricably tied together, and Dr. Subra Suresh has power in both courts,” said Diane Turnshek, special faculty member in the department of physics. Beyond his leadership at MIT and the NSF, Suresh has been recognized worldwide for his work in the fields of engineering, life sciences, physical sciences, and medicine. He has co-authored over 240 research articles, collaborated on over 20 U.S. and international patent applications, and co-edited five books. He has also authored three widely used materials science textbooks: Fatigue of Materials, Fundamentals of Functionally Graded Materials, and Thin Film Materials. 
“The MSE faculty are absolutely delighted to have such a distinguished scholar as Subra Suresh as a member of the materials science and engineering department and we look forward to supporting him in any way that we can,” Rollett said via email. 
Suresh has been acclaimed by ScienceWatch.com as one of the decade’s most eminent and most cited materials scientists worldwide. Suresh made additional contributions to the field of engineering through his development of strategies to optimize strength, ductility, and damage tolerance of materials using nanoscale internal interfaces; his discovery of nanocrystallization during room-temperature mechanical contact in metallic glasses; and his identification of key mechanisms that influence the growth of fatigue cracks in a wide variety of brittle and ductile materials.  
Aside from his research highlighting important links between individual cell processes and human disease states, he has contributed to the medical field through his development of new microfluidic platforms for human disease diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug efficacy assays. 
Among many honors, he has received the American Society of Mechanical Engineers 2012 Timoshenko Medal, the highest global recognition in the field of theoretical and applied mechanics, and the 2007 European Materials Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the Federation of European Materials Societies. His work on nanobiomechanics was cited by Technology Review magazine as one of the top 10 emerging technologies that “will have a significant impact on business, medicine, or culture.”
“Carnegie Mellon University is a guiding force in the world today, and I celebrate that at its helm is a leader who has been trained as a scientist and engineer,” Turnshek said. “His record demonstrates that he’s thought deeply and scientifically about solutions to our global problems.”
With the dawn of the new academic year, Carnegie Mellon welcomes a president who is not only a distinguished scholar and esteemed leader, but also an individual who has remained committed to empowering scholars across disciplines..

2013-08-19,CMU,India,"Student gets first master’s degree in bagpiping
During Commencement ceremonies on May 19, Carnegie Mellon granted the first known master’s degree of music in bagpipe performance in the United States to Andrew Bova.
Bova began his musical career with the flute at a young age; he became inspired to pick up the bagpipes when playing for a war re-enactment at Fort Meigs in his hometown of Perrysburg, Ohio.
“I wanted to be part of a conservatory training program, to be immersed in my craft,” Bova said in a university press release. “There is a pervasive standard of excellence at Carnegie Mellon, no matter what area of study you’re in. That standard is so high, you’re always pushing yourself to do better, and I wanted that type of environment.”
Bova plays the bagpipes as part of the Canada-based 78th Fraser Highlanders Pipe Band, considered one of the world’s top pipe bands according to the press release. He also organized and performed in a benefit concert for Operation Smile, an organization that provides free cleft palate surgeries. Bova himself was born with a cleft palate and would not have been able to pursue the bagpipes without corrective surgery.
“The concerts were my way of giving back,” Bova said. “Plus, you can educate people about the instrument.”
Bova received an undergraduate degree from Carnegie Mellon in bagpipe performance in 2011. His master’s thesis was titled The Contemporary Performance Practice of Music Played on the Great Highland Bagpipe. He recently interviewed with the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow with hopes of earning his doctorate there.
Researchers’ software helps blind learn braille
Eight Carnegie Mellon students from both the Qatar and Pittsburgh campuses worked this summer on a technology research project in India to aid the visually impaired.
The team included senior business administration major Aveed Sheikh, senior cognitive science and computer science double major Madeleine Clute, junior civil and environmental engineering and biomedical engineering double major Madelyn Gioffre, robotics graduate student Poornima Kaniarasu, junior electrical and computer engineering major Aditya Kodkany, junior electrical and computer engineering major Vivek Nair, design graduate student Shree Lakshmi Rao, and senior applied and computational mathematics major Avia Weinstein.
The students spent the summer in Bangalore, having been selected to join the 2013 innovative Student Technology ExPerience (iSTEP) internship. They worked in partnership with the Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind on developing a software device that helps blind students learn Braille.
“It is a wonderful learning experience to work with a multitalented international CMU-Q team to make a positive difference,” Sheikh said in an article in The Peninsula, an English-language newspaper in Qatar..

2013-09-09,CMU,India,"After four teasing weeks of preseason while only getting glimpses of the starters, we finally get some real football. This weekend saw the start of the NFL season, and predictions abound as to how each NFL division will finish come January.
AFC East
For the past decade, this division has been dominated by the New England Patriots under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Miami Dolphins represent the only real threat to their reign, but even with their high-profile free-agent acquisitions of wide receiver Mike Wallace and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe, they still appear to be a few years and few playmakers away. 
The Buffalo Bills and New York Jets are starting rookie quarterbacks E. J. Manuel and Geno Smith, respectively. Both teams rely heavily on their defense, but neither looks to be a serious contender.
AFC North
Home to the Super Bowl champions Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers, this is shaping up to be the toughest division in the AFC yet again. 
The Ravens, Steelers, and Cincinnati Bengals are likely playoff contenders. The Bengals look to be in the driver’s seat to win the division with third-year quarterback Andy Dalton and his top target A. J. Green. Combined with the best defensive line in the league, these assets have turned the Bengals into a Super Bowl threat. The Ravens are dealing with major losses on both sides of the ball with leader Ray Lewis retiring and veteran wide receiver Anquan Boldin being traded away. The Steelers are still aging and returning many of the same pieces that produced a disappointing 8–8 season a year ago. The Cleveland Browns, while improving, are still easily the worst in this division.
AFC South
The Houston Texans look to make another appearance as division winners under defensive lineman J. J. Watt and running back Arian Foster. The only major addition is former Ravens safety Ed Reed, who is starting off the season with an injury. The Indianapolis Colts surprisingly made the playoffs last year under then-rookie quarterback Andrew Luck and look to repeat the feat this year. It may be difficult, though, as many expect the team to hit a sophomore slump and take a step or two back. The Tennessee Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars are both trying to evaluate their young quarterbacks, Jake Locker and Blaine Gabbert, in an attempt to decide whether or not to move on from their young projects.
AFC West
The Denver Broncos have put the division in their rear-view mirror as they focus solely on winning the Super Bowl. Quarterback Peyton Manning knows he only has a year or two left and is giving it everything he’s got. The Kansas City Chiefs are a completely new team after trading for quarterback Alex Smith and signing former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid. The San Diego Chargers are under new management with a new coach and general manager, but most of the personnel remains the same and thus so will their record. Unsurprisingly, the Oakland Raiders are in disarray with quarterback Terrelle Pryor coming out of nowhere to steal the starting quarterback job.
NFC East
Every year the fate of this division comes down to the last game, and this year seems to be no different. The New York Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and Washington Redskins each had a chance to win the division in the final game of last year’s season and all come back with virtually the same teams. With some substantial injuries to Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, and the Cowboys and Giants lines, this will likely be a war of attrition. The only major changes come with the Eagles, where Chip Kelly has replaced Andy Reid as coach. Kelly brings a very up-tempo college offense with him and looks to shake up the NFL, but is likely not to be competitive this season.
NFC North
This is another division that looks to be a dog fight with all four teams having legitimate playoff aspirations. The Green Bay Packers look the best on paper, but their rookie-based running games and sketchy secondary could be their downfall. The Minnesota Vikings’ hopes rest solely on the shoulders of MVP Adrian Peterson, with quarterback Christian Ponder acting more as a facilitator than a playmaker. The Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions both underperformed last year and have serious questions specifically concerning the offense for Chicago and the defense for Detroit.
NFC South
With the return of coach Sean Payton, the New Orleans Saints are looking to bounce back from a disappointing season. The Atlanta Falcons are returning a very similar team to last year’s division-winning squad with veteran running back Steven Jackson replacing Michael Turner. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers are both trying to evaluate their young quarterbacks, Josh Freeman and Cam Newton, who are not quite living up to expectations they set after their first few years in the league.
NFC West
This is by far the most stacked division in the NFL. The San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks are debatably the top two teams in the NFL and will be slugging it out for the division. Both feature young mobile quarterbacks and very strong defenses. The St. Louis Rams look to make major strides under their second season with coach Jeff Fisher, and they have hope after finishing 4–1–1 in the division last season. 
The Arizona Cardinals are the wild card with new coach Bruce Arians and quarterback Carson Palmer. If Palmer can find his timing with all-pro receiver Larry Fitzgerald, look for the Cardinals to have a good season..

2013-09-16,CMU,India,"As evidenced by the outcry over the potential closing of the local bar Panther Hollow Inn last spring, Carnegie Mellon students love their beer. However, students here may not know how this refreshing drink is made and what gives it that smooth taste.
Beer is composed of four main ingredients: water, malt, hops, and yeast. The simplest explanation of the beer-making process is that the malt releases sugars into hot water, the yeast turns these sugars into alcohol, and the hops provide the bitter kick. But let’s go into more detail. What are the steps of brewing beer? In the book Beer Craft: A Simple Guide to Making Great Beer, William Bostwick and Jessi Rymill describe the process in six easy steps.
The first step is called mashing. This step is done the same way one might make a cup of tea, except instead of a small bag of tea leaves in a mug of hot water, a large mesh bag of grain (malt) is steeped in a stockpot of hot water. On John Palmer’s website “How To Brew,” he describes the malting process: “The debranching, beta-glucanase, and proteolytic enzymes do their work, preparing the starches for easy access and conversion to sugars.” Depending on the type of grain being used and what type of beer is being made, different grain-to-water ratios and different temperatures for the hot water are used. For example, Beer Advocate says that specialty dark malts are used in small quantities and produce stouts or bocks; roasted malts are used in mild and brown ales; and wheat malt, obviously, is a main component of wheat beers. The temperature of the water is dependent upon what temperature the enzymes in the particular malt being used perform the best at.
The second step is to sparge the wort — this is the sweet mixture left in the stockpot after the grains have been steeped for about an hour. In this step, the mesh bag of grain is removed, and the last of the wort drains into the stockpot. After the mesh bag has been drained, the grains must be rinsed in a fresh pot of hot water, then allowed to steep, and sparged again. This is to ensure the maximum wort is made from the grain. 
The third step is boiling the wort. This is where the hops or other spices are added to the mixture. Some examples of hops that are listed on the website freshops.com include Amarillo, Cascade, and Centennial, which are citrus-like spices used in India pale ales (IPAs), and the aromatic Hallertau and Liberty that are used in lagers and bocks. About.com discusses the importance of timing during this step. Hops break down as they are boiled, causing their flavor to evaporate and disappear. Consequently, the more hops that are added early on during the boil, the more bitter the beer will be.
The fourth phase is chilling. This step is crucial because yeast cannot operate at the temperature of the boiled wort. During the chilling process, chunks of protein settle out of the mixture, leaving the beer nice and smooth. 
When the wort is sufficiently chilled, the fifth step is funneling the wort into a fermenter, which is when brewers add the yeast to the brew and convert the sugars into alcohol and officially turn the mixture into beer. This occurs because the glucose enters in the yeast through diffusion and is broken down through glycolysis. This process results in pyruvates and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), according to howstuffworks.com
While the ATP is used to supply energy to the yeast, the pyruvates are converted by the yeast into carbon dioxide and ethanol — the alcohol. For the first day or two of fermentation, a blow-off tube should be attached to the opening of the fermenter to collect proteins, hop resins, and dead yeast cells. This tube is then replaced by an airtight cap, and the beer is left to ferment. This process takes approximately one week, although stronger beers require longer fermentation periods.
The sixth and final step is bottling. As in the case of transferring the wort from the pot to the fermenter, the transfer of beer from the fermenter to bottles must be done carefully with a tracking cane and tube to make sure no sediment gets into the bottles. After the bottles are filled and capped, they should be allowed to carbonate in a dark, cool spot for a week or two. The last test of patience comes after this, when the carbonated bottles must sit in the fridge for another week.
And with that, any student can ponder over the process and the science of brewing while enjoying a cold beer..

2013-09-16,CMU,India,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for the first and second seasons of New Girl.
Fans of Zooey Deschanel know that the popular and — according to FOX — “adorkable” TV show New Girl will resume with its third season this Tuesday at 9 p.m. The second season finale left us with Cece’s (Hannah Simone) three-hour traditional Indian wedding, during which she left her fiancé Shivrang (Satya Bhabha) and acknowledged her feelings for Schmidt (Max Greenfield). Unfortunately for Cece, Schmidt had renewed his relationship with Elizabeth (Merritt Wever), his college girlfriend, after he and Cece broke up. Confronted by the choice between Cece and Elizabeth, Schmidt literally ran away.
Meanwhile, Jess (Deschanel) and Nick (Jake Johnson) flounder at the possibility of having something more than friendship, and Winston (Lamorne Morris)... well, Winston provides comic relief.
This drama leads to two main questions that FOX has indicated will be answered during the upcoming season: Who will Schmidt pick? And will Nick and Jess become a real couple? On its website, FOX has also revealed that “Winston will get serious about taking control of his own love life,” hinting that he might finally get his own storyline.
Returning guest stars include Brenda Song, who played Winston’s girlfriend Daisy in the past season, as well as Damon Wayans Jr., known on the show as Coach. He left after the show’s pilot episode to star in the show Happy Endings, but he returns to New Girl following the cancellation of Happy Endings.
In an interview with tvline.com, Morris indicated that Daisy will appear in only one episode, confirming suspicions that Winston and Daisy will break up. Coach is rumored to be in at least four episodes this season. New guest stars include Angela Kinsey from The Office, Eva Amurri from Californication, and Dreama Walker from Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23. The three are set to play a clique of “mean girl” teachers at the new school where Jess will begin working in the second episode of season three. This episode, titled “Jacooz” will feature Jess seeking Nick’s advice on how to fit in with the “cool” teachers, Schmidt at an office party gone wrong, and Winston suspecting Daisy of cheating on him.
What about the first episode? The promo video shows Jess and Nick crossing the border into Mexico and getting in trouble there, while Schmidt tells both Elizabeth and Cece separately that he’d like to be with them. It has the potential to be funny, but if the writers have only planned the third season to focus on lingering problems from the second, it can quickly become bland. Jess and Nick can only be an awkward couple for so long. This leads to the question of what would happen if their relationship does, in fact, work out.
Some of the most entertaining episodes in the past have centered on Jess’s love life, ranging from the time she has to pick up her things from ex-boyfriend Spencer’s house to when she tries to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for fellow teacher Paul, whom she had been dating. Nick and Jess’s relationship has been moving quite slowly so far, and the writers need to change things up. The same goes with Schmidt’s relationships. Though the show might still be funny, the writers need to vary the storylines to make sure that it remains interesting..

2013-09-16,CMU,India,"Late last year, a young physiotherapy intern in New Delhi was brutally gang-raped after boarding a bus by six men, according to The Washington Post. The attackers included the driver and one minor. The woman died soon after due to her injuries. Recently, a 22-year-old photojournalist from Mumbai was gang-raped in an abandoned textile factory, reports The Guardian. Additionally, Michaela Cross (otherwise known as Rose Chasm), published a now famous CNN iReport, in which she describes in horrific detail the way she was stared at, groped and harassed daily by Indian men during a study abroad trip to India in 2012.
As a young Indian man, I feel an uneasy mix of shame and indignation when I think about these incidents. The fact that Indian men can perform such acts is shameful, but at the same time, these isolated incidents result in the creation of broad stereotypes and incorrect generalizations. The really heart-breaking part about Michaela Cross’s CNN piece is the thousands of comments that accompany it. Some implore people, especially women, to stay away from India. Some apologize to Michaela on the behalf of Indians everywhere. There is ignorance, but also fear in what people wrote. As I read the comments, I found myself getting defensive and thinking, “We’re not all like that.”
India gives a whole new meaning to the word diversity. With 1.2 billion people, over 500 languages and dialects, and more than ten widely practiced religions, one simply cannot speak about every Indian citizen in one breath. I’m convinced that most Indian men are actually very helpful and warm people. 
There were 75,744 reported cases of sexual violence (including rape, molestation and harassment) in India in 2011, according to crowdvoice.org. The equivalent figure for the United States is 207,754 cases, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. India’s population is approximately four times that of America’s population, yet the United States’s rate of sexual violence is greater. Isn’t it a little unfair to generalize the negative tendencies observed in 75,744 people onto the 655.8 million males in Indian society?
Admittedly, the entire issue is bigger than just the number of sexual violence cases. According to Delhi-based psychologist Rajat Mitra in India Today, a substantial portion of sexual assault cases in India go unreported. It is even more depressing that a small minority of sexual offenders can poison India’s culture and create an atmosphere of fear. The average Indian woman longs for freedom from a society that has very strict expectations for her. 
Society may not hesitate to blame sexual assault on the victim, if it is believed that these expectations were disregarded. Especially in rural India, a girl must take certain necessary precautions, such as dressing conservatively, largely avoiding male company, and staying indoors after dark. Even in the urban and fairly liberalized setting of Mumbai, most of my female friends wouldn’t wear shorts on the streets, or dare to step out alone after 10 p.m.
However, things are getting better. There is room for optimism. The New Delhi rape led to one of the largest demonstrations against sexual violence the world has ever seen. Massive protest rallies populated by both women and men engulfed the city for weeks. The Mumbai case led to similar, albeit comparatively smaller rallies. Michaela Cross’s piece probably wouldn’t have gotten the massive response it did if it came out a couple of years ago.
A critical mass of people are talking about change — the kind of change that rarely comes along — in the privacy of their homes and in the public forum. People are tired of a small population of men distorting reality for the rest of us..

2013-09-23,CMU,India,"The Cleveland Browns have been the epitome of futility since they were refounded in 1999. The original Browns franchise moved to Baltimore in 1995, was renamed the Ravens, and has since won two Super Bowls, further proving that Cleveland is where sports teams go to die.
After another disappointing season and a transfer of ownership to businessman Jim Haslett, the Browns replaced their entire management, firing head coach Pat Shurmur and general manager Tom Heckert. Rod Chudzinski was hired to replace Shurmur and Michael Lombardi to replace Heckert.
The new management began the slow and arduous process of bringing the Browns out of the gutter and back to the level of their AFC North brethren: the Baltimore Ravens, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Cincinnati Bengals.
Normally, the standard ineptitude of the Browns isn’t headline news with the merry-go-round of head coaches, starting quarterbacks, and exceptional teams. This time is different, however, as the Browns have made one of the most shocking trades in NFL history: trading running back Trent Richardson, the third overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, to the Indianapolis Colts for a 2014 first-round pick.
The trade came as such a surprise that no one is quite sure who made the better deal, and more importantly, what in the world the new Browns management was thinking.
Richardson has been a polarizing player since his days at the University of Alabama. He first made an impact as the backup to the 2009 Heisman Trophy winner and current New Orleans Saint Mark Ingram. He then lead Alabama to a national championship in 2011 as the feature back, being named an All-American and winning the Doak Walker award for best college running back.
In the 2012 draft, the top two players were clearly quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III. The Colts had the first pick and drafted Luck, while the Washington Redskins traded up from the sixth pick to snatch Griffin. The Browns were also interested in trading with the St. Louis Rams for the second overall pick but were outmatched by the Redskins offer of three first-round picks.
This left the Browns in an interesting spot, holding the fourth overall pick while the Minnesota Vikings sat in front of them with the third pick. The Browns decided to pass on quarterback Ryan Tannehill who fell to the Miami Dolphins at No. 8, and instead made the curious move to trade up one spot with the Vikings. The Browns then filled their quarterback need by taking Brandon Weeden, the oldest-ever player taken in the first round, with their 28th pick.
Which brings us to the present day. Normally, moves such as bailing on the third overall pick after only 18 games are reserved for coaches and general managers who know their days are numbered. But in this case, it appears that Cleveland’s front office is taking the exact opposite approach, looking to the long term.
To return to relevancy, the Browns need a franchise quarterback. The Weeden experiment has failed; its failure is further pronounced when the other quarterbacks of Weeden’s draft class — Luck, Griffin, Tannehill, and third-round pick Russell Wilson — have established themselves as franchise cornerstones.
This upcoming draft is likely to be full of NFL-caliber quarterbacks with Teddy Bridgewater and Heisman Trophy-winner Johnny Manziel leading the way. The trade appears to be setting the stage for the Browns to pick any incoming quarterback and make the necessary trade to get him with multiple first-round picks in their arsenal.
For the Colts, this is an interesting move. Rarely do teams get the chance to bring in a potential Pro Bowl talent for only a first-round pick. The Colts gave up a chance to draft a great player for one they believe is already proven. But history will tell whether or not Richardson becomes a Hall of Famer, or another in the long line of running back busts who can’t last more than a few years, given the wear and tear they receive on a weekly basis.
If Richardson can help protect Luck from blitzing linebackers making the Colts offensive line look like Swiss cheese, and if the Colts can rebound from a tough 1–1 start to make the playoffs, the move will be considered genius. In addition, if the Colts’ legitimate passing threat forces teams to stop crowding the line of scrimmage against Richardson — thus making his pedestrian yards-per-carry rise to the level of a great player — the Browns will have added another item to their long list of poor moves.
The two teams are clearly heading in opposite directions, with the Browns looking toward the future and the Colts making it clear that they aim to win now. Let’s see how both teams fare in a year or two after all of the pieces have fallen into place..

2013-09-23,CMU,India,"The Bharatiya Janata Party announced last week that Narendra Modi would be its candidate for prime minister of India in the upcoming 2014 elections, according to The New York Times. Modi is the current chief minister of Gujarat, a western state of India, and one of the most controversial politicians in India today. Modi has supervised the improvement of Gujarat’s economy in the last decade, and wants to encourage Hindus to vote as a religious bloc, rather than be divided by caste. Caste division in India is analogous to racism in the United States, so subverting these divides would be a great step forward for India. However, Modi is also a Hindu radical who has been accused of encouraging the anti-Muslim riots that swept Gujarat in 2002. Because Muslims constitute roughly 13 percent of India’s population, having a prime minister with such virulent anti-Muslim sentiments will seriously damage the unity of India.
Back in 2002, anti-Muslim riots broke out barely a year into Modi’s ministership of Gujarat, in response to the deaths of 60 Hindus in a train fire, according to BBC News. Over a thousand people — 800 Muslims and 250 Hindus — died in the chaos. Citizens have gone so far as to accuse Modi not only of negligence, but of purposefully allowing the riots to continue. He was never charged, but several of his associates were convicted of inciting a riot.
These events took place, for the most part, over a decade ago, but many Indian Muslims still hate Modi with passion. This hatred intensified as more riots broke out in Uttar Pradesh last week after legislators from Modi’s party released a falsified video of Hindus being lynched by a Muslim mob, according to The New York Times. During the riots, 44 people died, and 42,000 people were displaced from their homes.
Despite the darker aspects of Modi’s political history, he has had some undeniable successes. One of his most visible victories is the economic strength of Gujarat today. Gujarat, which accounts for 5 percent of India’s population, produces 22 percent of its exports and 16 percent of its industrial products, according to The New York Times. According to the BBC, output from farms in Gujarat is nearly seven times the average in all of India, and its growth rate has remained in double digits for the past decade. While economic prosperity is a complex and multi-layered phenomenon, Gujarat’s fortune looks good for Modi’s campaign, especially when the Indian economy is looking shaky, according to The New York Times. Furthermore, Modi’s constituency resides in Maninagar, which is one of the most well-run and orderly neighborhoods in India. It has round-the-clock energy, functional streets, and a working sewage system. Maninagar is a wonderful place to live — except for the few Muslim communities within the town. These successes do not outweigh Modi’s history, but they do give him the appearance of a leader who can fix India’s ills.
Modi’s economic policy is not the only enticing aspect of his potential leadership. The minister wants to eliminate political barriers between castes as much as possible, creating a single Hindu voting bloc. One of the ways he plans on doing this is by focusing on young Hindu voters. In fact, he recently took to Twitter to encourage voters between ages 18 and 24 to register to vote, according to The Economic Times. For young people, Modi is a dynamic, impassioned leader who has the potential to both improve the economy and minimize caste divisions. Modi is even more appealing when compared to aging leaders of other parties, or to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is 80 years old.
For a young Indian person, Modi’s message is incredibly appealing. He offers economic and political stability on a platter, and both of these things would make life easier in India. However, Modi is also dangerous because his message of unity is subtly tied to the discrimination of Muslim Indians. India, like America, is drifting toward being more politically polarized every day. While Hindus represent 80 percent of the Indian electorate, they have never bonded to form a political bloc because of caste divisions. If Modi can mobilize Hindus to act as a political unit, which he has the potential to do — especially with the lure of dynamic change and improved economic policy — they could very easily control Indian politics.
This cooperation would not be a bad thing. In fact, having India move past caste divisions would be a great cultural and political boon for the nation. If this cooperation is linked to anti-Muslim sentiment, however, it would eventually cause division among all Indians.

2013-09-23,CMU,India,"During the 2014 Miss America Pageant on Sept. 15, Nina Davuluri of Fayetteville, N.Y., became the first woman of Indian descent to be crowned Miss America. Following the announcement, riled pageant viewers unleashed a toxic deluge of racist and xenophobic tweets targeted at Davuluri’s win.
These tweets, some of which were complied on the popular website Buzzfeed, ranged from objections such as “I swear I’m not racist but this is America” to extremely offensive personal attacks calling Davuluri “Miss 7-11,” “Miss Terrorist,” and “Miss Al-Qaeda.” One person laughably claimed, “we all know Obama bought that pageant!”
As goes without saying, such comments are indefensibly bigoted and hopelessly illogical. President Obama is about as likely to have done a deal with Miss America pageant owner Donald Trump as Muslim extremists are likely to enter bikini-clad catwalk competitions. In addition to these people’s obvious errors is their utter misunderstanding of American values. America is a nation of immigrants.
Isn’t the idea of a great American melting pot among the first of the values that patriots and pageant contestants should represent? Comprised of many races and unique ethnic groups, the American population ought to prize diversity as much as any other national value — and certainly shouldn’t be protesting it.
Yet despite the outrageous nature of these tweets, and despite reactions to them ranging from righteous anger to mockery, one reaction has been almost nonexistent: surprise. Almost nobody, it seems, is in any way surprised by this gross display of racism; the incident has been described as a “tired theme” by CNN.
This lack of shock is among the most troubling aspects of this story. Racism of this kind is apparently commonplace enough that it is unsurprising even when it is written publicly with no concealment of identity.
According to a World Values Survey published this year, the population of America is among the least racist in the world, and yet Americans are quite used to racism. The national struggle against bigotry is clearly too far from won.
Certainly, enormous progress has been made in American culture’s overall standing with diversity. From the civil rights movement of the 1960s to modern-day immigration reform, Americans as a whole increasingly accept diversity and condemn prejudice. This positive trend will hopefully and probably continue. However, the nation has a long way to go until racist vitriol of the sort exhibited following the Miss America pageant is rare enough to be anomalous — preferably shocking and wholly impermissible..

2013-10-07,CMU,India,"The men’s tennis team travelled to the University of Mary Washington on Sept. 28 to battle it out in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Southeast Regional Tournament. 
The team went deep, with junior Christian Heaney-Secord and first-year Kenny Zheng making it to the semifinals, and sophomore Abhishek Alla taking home the singles title. Alla had to duke it out with two of his own teammates to obtain the coveted title.
In the quarterfinals, Alla faced teammate junior Will Duncan and beat him in an intense three-set match (4–6, 6–2, 7–5). “It was bittersweet — it was pretty early, and it was a good match,” Alla said. He explained how thinking of tennes as an individual sport is essential to winning.
“You have to do what you have to do,” he said. “No hard feelings.” However, beating Duncan was only the first step. Alla moved on to the semifinals, in which he defeated Zheng (6–4, 6–2). Finally, to win the ITA singles title, Alla crushed Ben Hwang of Johns Hopkins University (6–2, 6–1).
Commenting on Alla’s performance, Zheng said, “He was playing extremely well. I knew he was going to kill that kid in the finals.”
“I don’t really get nervous. I just knew I had to make a lot of balls and not make any unforced errors,” Alla said.
When he won, Alla was overjoyed that he would get to skip three days of school this week to play in the ITA National Small College Championships in Fort Meyers, Fla.
The Southeast Regional Tournament began with 64 teams. In order to be victorious, Alla had to win a series of six matches over three days. Alla emphasized that the hardest match was against his teammate Duncan, because “he was just that good.”
By the third day, most of the team had to head back to Carnegie Mellon for class and did not get to see Alla win the title. “It sucked that not everyone from the team was there,” Alla said.
Originally from Hyderabad, India, Alla has played tennis since he was 6 years old. “My parents wanted us to try out activities. We started playing tournaments, it got competitive, and we started traveling,” Alla said. He attended IMG Pendelton School, a boarding school in Florida, for his junior and senior years of high school.
However, attending Carnegie Mellon gave Alla his first opportunity to play on a team. “It’s just fun to be around [my teammates] — they push me to work hard,” Alla said. This sense of teamwork has become one of Alla’s favorite aspects of tennis.
Alla’s strengths as a player go beyond his technical ability.
“I have good defense and attack,” Alla explained, “but my serve is pretty weak. My movement consolidates everything.” 
Alla also manages to do one of the more difficult things for a tennis player to do: keep his cool. “I don’t get too emotional on the court. My opponents get frustrated sometimes,” he said.
Winning this tournament means that Alla has gained the title of All-American, a title Alla has been keen on earning this year. 
Advancing to the national tournament, which starts Thursday, he will face off against seven other regional champions from Division III..

2013-10-07,CMU,India,"The Siebel Scholars Foundation announced the recipients of the annual Siebel Scholars awards. This program, which currently consists of nearly 870 Siebel Scholars, recognizes the most talented individuals of business, bioengineering, and computer science graduate schools across the country.
Each year, five graduate students from Carnegie Mellon are selected and awarded $35,000 for their last year of studies. This year’s Carnegie Mellon Siebel Scholars are Jason Koenig, Anuj Kumar, Gabriela Marcu, Ishan Misra, and Mrinmaya Sachan.
Koenig was a computer science major at Carnegie Mellon who graduated in five semesters. During his time as an undergraduate, he was a course assistant for Principles of Imperative Computation and did research with computer science professor and current head of the department of computer science, Frank Pfenning, on the researching aspects of the subset of the C programming language used in that course. Koenig also worked on the lunar rover project and interned twice at Microsoft. After graduating early, he interned at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, working on cybersecurity and formal methods. In August, he returned to Carnegie Mellon for a fifth-year master’s in computer science. On the topic of the Siebel Scholars, Koenig said, “It doesn’t just cover tuition. There is a pretty big community of former recipients, which looks to be a great resource.”
Kumar is a Ph.D. candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII). His research deals mainly with developing voice-user interfaces for atypical users, such as children, low-literate users, or speakers of minority languages. In the past, he has worked at Microsoft and IBM, as well as at the University of California, Berkeley, and the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad in India. 
He also served as a program committee member at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Intelligent User Interfaces conference, and as a reviewer at the Conference on Computing Factors in Computing Systems and MobileHCI. “More than the award itself, I think it’s the recognition and the community that I’m very excited to be part of,” Kumar said. “When I look at some of the alumni, especially their past research, where each of them have landed, and what they are doing currently, it’s a bit overwhelming, but at the same time tremendously motivating.”
Marcu is also a Ph.D. candidate in the HCII. Her research involves various fields, such as ubiquitous computing, applied sociology, and mental health. Throughout the past two years, she has led a 10-person research team studying behavioral data consumption and sharing among stakeholders in special education, conducted fieldwork in schools and homes, and developed a tablet-based data collection system and visual analysis tools through action research.
Misra is a master’s student in the Robotics Institute. After spending his undergraduate years exploring many different fields of computer science research — including theory of computation, databases, networking, operating systems, and computer vision — he found his passion working with object detection and scene detection, which are both important for systems in which robots encounter unknown objects. 
He is interested in pursuing a future in research and is currently debating between applying for a Ph.D. or looking for a job. “The ‘Siebel Scholar’ title feels really nice,” Misra said. “It is a unique scholarship with a really strong community of past scholars and faculty to it. Even though the scholarship lasts only for one year, the nurturing community stays with you.”
Sachan is currently a master’s student in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon. Before coming to Pittsburgh, he received his bachelor’s degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His past job experiences include interning at the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo and working in the Information Management group at IBM Research India. The main topic of his research involves understanding the structure of social networks and the flow of textual information to better understand interests and relationships among people. “It is indeed a pleasure to be part of the nice cohort of really smart and motivated people,” Sachan said.
All five of this year’s Siebel Scholars show the amount of dedication and intelligence required for the award. In a few years, they will become a part of the vast Siebel Scholars network, serving as mentors for future scholars from Carnegie Mellon..

2013-10-07,CMU,India,"Mahatma Gandhi is often attributed with saying, “Be the change you wish to see in the world.”
Taking inspiration from the life of Gandhi, Carnegie Mellon students from OM, a campus organization for Indian spirituality and culture, worked with the Pittsburgh nonprofit Moving the Lives of Kids Community Mural Project (MLK Mural) to create a mural of Gandhi on the side of Indian restaurant Coriander in Squirrel Hill on Sunday.
The mural is the grand finale to the Two Weeks of Peace and Gandhi’s birthday celebration that occurred all over campus through service projects, free hugs, lectures, and a screening of the film Gandhi in McConomy Auditorium.
“Initially we wanted to make it a service project by working with a student group, but we decided instead to make it an event for OM and CMU students to do to celebrate the end of Gandhi Week,” said sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani, who coordinated the mural painting.
The design for the mural was chosen through a contest by OM that sought submissions from talented Carnegie Mellon students. The winning design was submitted by senior art major Adelaide Cole, who was inspired by the intricacy of henna designs, the Indian art of ink-drawing on hands. Cole chose to use color symbolically, with orange fading into blue to symbolize the unity of people: She described orange as representative of the universal skin color, while blue is a symbol of peace.
MLK Mural is a Pittsburgh-based group of people who identify as both artists and community organizers. Through mural painting, they reach toward the goal of community progression by strengthening and bringing communities together.
A multifaceted organization, MLK Mural launches projects that range from working with youth groups, painting commissioned work. The organization also hosts a summer work program for at-risk teenagers to teach life skills such as collaboration in work settings. Muralist Kyle Holbrook of Wilkinsburg, Pa. started MLK Mural in 2007. It has since expanded to projects across the nation with offices in Pittsburgh, Miami, and Atlanta. Holbrook says, “The murals let people take pride in their neighborhoods. People will tell me how they change where they walk just to see the mural because it makes such a difference.”
Over the last six years, MLK Mural has created over 260 murals in Pittsburgh alone, including 13 this past summer. It’s an impressive feat, but more impressive is the number of young people that have been involved in the projects, which is well over 5,000.
A delicious lunch was provided by Coriander and a rough sketch of Gandhi was well under way — the energy grew as local kids and volunteers eagerly picked up paintbrushes to join the effort.

2013-10-14,CMU,India,"ExpressionBlast, a new search engine developed by scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and Bar-Ilan University, helps scientists compare gene expression data with millions of other studies in order to find experiments with similar profiles.
Ziv Bar-Joseph, associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s computational biology department, led the research team that published its work in the October issue of Nature Methods; Guy Zinman, Shoshana Naiman, Yariv Kanfi, and Haim Cohen co-authored the journal report. Multiple Carnegie Mellon employees and students also contributed toward developing the search engine.
Bar-Joseph’s research focused on creating a concise, systematic way to compare gene expression data.
“Everyone knows about DNA, the genetic material. We have exactly the same DNA in every cell of our body; however, all our cells are completely different in terms of what they do and look like [e.g., muscle cells vs. blood cells].... The reason that these cells are different is that different genes are being expressed,” said Zinman, now a research scientist in Carnegie Mellon’s Lane Center for Computational Biology.
Zinman explained that the idea for ExpressionBlast originated from a paper that explored longevity in mice. In this research, expression of a certain gene allowed male mice to live 15 percent longer than control male mice; this phenomenon only occurred in male mice. In order to make sense of the data, the researchers began to look for other experiments with similar results.
Currently, one of the main places to look for this information is Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the largest public database for expression data. GEO contains more than a million experiments, but does not provide an easy way for users to compare these experiments with their own results.
“As a research community, we had all this data, and it wasn’t being used as much as we would have liked. There was no way for you to compare your own results to the one million experiments that were out there,” Zinman said. “This is because every experiment uses a different machine, a different platform, a different animal, and is testing different conditions.”
ExpressionBlast automatically organizes data from genetic expression experiments on a weekly basis, so that they can be easily compared. “Everyone can now take their own experiment, put it on the web interface we developed, and find other experiments that have similar profiles,” Zinman said.
ExpressionBlast has many applications in and out of the realm of science. Drug companies, for example, could use ExpressionBlast to determine whether a potential chemical compound is affecting gene expression in a way shown to have the desired outcome in a previous experiment conducted by others, saving them time and money.
Zinman said that his work with ExpressionBlast was funded and greatly influenced by a program known as Innovation Corps (I-Corps), a program run by the National Science Foundation that focuses on giving entrepreneurial training to students and professors in order to foster commercialization of ideas that arise throughout research.
“It is a manner of thinking that is completely different from academia,” he explained. “I used this business thinking later on with my research, when looking for collaborators and research partners, and targeting my work towards more practical applications that the biological or medical communities are currently lacking.”
“The idea is to translate research to the marketplace,” Zinman continued. “There’s so much research being done at universities that can be applied to real world problems in a very short time, and many times the researchers don’t have the skill set to go outside of the comfort zone of their labs and look for customers and commercialization options.”
Aside from the possible long-term potential of ExpressionBlast, Zinman said that positive feedback for the tool is already surfacing. “I get about one to two emails per day. I’ve seen tweets from Cuba, I’ve gotten questions from people in India, and even thank you emails from researchers,” Zinman said. “If it wasn’t for the publication, it was for these emails. Just for them, it was worth it.”
Despite the success of ExpressionBlast, Zinman admits that there is still work to be done. “We still have many ideas that we would like to see implemented,” he said.
ExpressionBlast has made previously available gene expression data more useful, and has already begun to influence research worldwide. In the future, ExpressionBlast will undoubtedly affect the way in which gene expression data is analyzed and contribute to many aspects of the academic and commercial world..

2013-10-14,CMU,India,"Three Carnegie Mellon graduates recently created MeWants, recently created MeWants, an app that allows students to post requests for services they would like completed. Carnegie Mellon students, many without cars, often run into trouble when needing to obtain certain materials, furniture, groceries or supplies.
Former Carnegie Mellon graduate students Mohit Bijlani (HNZ ’07) and Mikhil Innani (HNZ ’11), along with SUNY Buffalo alumna Chaitanya Mehta (HNZ ’11), created MeWants in order to alleviate some of these burdens. The idea for the startup was conceived while the three were at Carnegie Mellon and it won the Keith Block Entrepreneurship Challenge offered by the university.
“MeWants is an outsourcing site that allows people to outsource their tasks to the community. Someone logs in, posts a task, and can make it visible for something like a 5–10 mile radius for the specific period. It’s like a Craigslist, but students have an inherent trust with others in the student community,” Bijlani said.
According its website, “MeWants lets you post tasks you’d like completed, as well as the price you’re willing to pay for the service, to a willing audience in your area.”
A person who wants to get their groceries picked up, receive help with moving or getting to an airport would log into the app and pay another user to help them. While currently focusing on Carnegie Mellon’s student body, MeWants hopes to expand to the University of Pittsburgh and beyond in the future.
Bijlani feels the app is appealing for students because it does not charge extra for its services. “The app itself is free, but we offer cash and Paypal options for payment,” he said. 
“We had students who have had similar issues, and we would willingly help people move out for a quick buck. The idea started there.... We didn’t really think about the monetary value, and we don’t want the app to have annoying ads. So we’re mostly using Paypal [to earn money],” he continued.
For those hoping to create a startup, Bijlani offered some advice. He particularly stressed the importance of networking. “I always wanted to create a startup, and I worked on my first startup with a friend from India.”
Innani originally approached Bijlani for advice, but after demonstrating passion for the project, “things took off from there. You should have an idea that you want to put 10 years of your life into, and having financial stability helps. You can also work for a startup,” Bijlani said.
Bijlani feels the entrepreneurial atmosphere at Carnegie Mellon, while imperfect, is constantly improving. “The focus is very much on getting jobs, but I know there has been a concerted effort by the university to build a connection between Tepper and the [computer science] community. There needs to be that push from the university to have students understand it’s okay to fail and have times when these things don’t work.”
Students are interested in the emergence of these campus-focused startup companies. 
Sarabeth Perry, sophomore global studies major, thinks that the idea behind MeWants is appealing. “It’s probably a better thing than CraigsList because you know the people [in the community]. It sounds like it could be messy, but it could also work,” she said.
In the past, students have often turned to Facebook for secondhand goods. Facebook pages for students of different years in the university have been used to advertise and sell goods ranging from tickets, phones, Megabus credits, and textbooks. This past year, another page, “For Sale @ CMU” was created to more directly offer students a chance to buy goods for lower prices from peers who are looking to unload their unwanted items. 
As of Sunday, Oct. 13 there were 823 members listed in the group, with things like food containers, longboards, books and hair dryers being bought and sold. MeWants hopes to cater to this audience.
Mehta and Innani are currently working on the app among other projects, while Bijlani is working on it full time and talking to investors..

2013-10-14,CMU,India,"An article published in last week’s issue of The Tartan titled “Address global warming to sidestep dire effects” stated that people of first world nations must aid those whom they have affected, seeing as first world nations have contributed most of the pollution that is perpetuating global warming.
But who is to blame for this climate change? Most would point fingers at these so-called first world nations and with due cause. According to CNN, 20 percent of the world’s wealthiest nations are responsible for 80 percent of global emissions. Meanwhile, the one billion poorest people in the world are responsible for a mere 3 percent of global emissions. 
Evidently, wealthy nations contribute most to environmental degradation while developing countries are doomed to experience the worst effects of climate change. In fact, University of California, Berkeley professor Richard Norgaard said on CNN that the environmental debt the world’s wealthiest nations owe to the poorest exceeds the estimated third world debt by over $4 billion.
However, when discussing environmental degradation, individuals must be considered above nations. Carbon footprint levels do not travel with national identity, but they might very well come paired with a person’s income.
Developing nations such as China, India, and Brazil are producing millionaires at increasingly higher rates. The rise of these new rich, coupled with the expansion of middle classes in developing countries, has dangerous implications for the environment. Increases in standard of living — modeled after Western consumer culture — must be tied inexorably to high levels of consumption. In addition, the two most prominent developing countries — India and China — are home to over 35 percent of the world’s population, according to the International Business Times. There is real immediate danger in these nations aiming to live like Americans; population blog Per Square Mile says that if everyone did, we would need about four planet Earths.
Ultimately, many environmental problems are beyond the scope of a single nation. Policing the world’s greatest common resource — the ocean — is impossible without collaboration, and who can say where one nation’s air stops and another’s begins? Most other limited resources only fall under the jurisdiction of a nation through the luck of geography. All efforts to save the environment must therefore be collaborative, with countries working together to salvage the only planet they will ever have.
Still, many developed nations have a habit of standing apart from the pack in negative ways. The United States is notorious for bowing out of international environmental treaties, most memorably the 1997 Kyoto Treaty for reducing carbon emissions. America was one of few industrialized nations not to ratify, and the treaty suffered a serious blow to its clout without the backing of such an internationally crucial player.
Clearly, developed nations must tackle their own lacking environmental policies before citing any kind of moral obligation to help developing countries rise to their level. This idea of a moral obligation suggests that the United States and similar nations intrinsically know much better than the leaders, scientists, and activists of a nation what is best for their nation’s development, which is hypocrisy on an extreme scale.
America remains the nation with the largest carbon footprint per capita by carbon dioxide emissions — a position it has held without shame for decades, according to Postconsumers.com. Although China takes first place for carbon emissions overall, China is distinguishing itself as impressively progressive in dealing with the environmental consequences of rapid industrialization. No other evidence can better disprove the insulting idea that developed nations somehow owe developing countries their expertise on matters of environmentally sustainable progress.
Perhaps placing blame is pointless. It certainly wastes time that could be better spent by taking a hard look at how our own actions are impacting the environment. After all, if individuals can hold great responsibility for degrading the environment, they also have the power to enact lasting positive change..

2013-10-28,CMU,India,"Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have collaborated with scientists from the Army Research Laboratory; Pennsylvania State University; the University of California, Davis; the University of California, Riverside; and Indiana University to develop methods for computers to make security relevant decisions in cyberspace. The project, called Models for Enabling Continuous Reconfigurability of Secure Missions, strives to increase security in cyberspace.
The five-year funding for the program is $23.2 million, with an additional $25 million for an optional five-year extension. The Carnegie Mellon branch of the project is funded through CyLab, the world’s largest university-based research and education center for computer and network security, information security, and software assurance.
The collaborative research focuses on detecting attacks in cyberspace, measuring and managing risk, and altering the environment to optimize results, all while minimizing cost. The previous three objectives will be reached with help of human behavior models that allow computers to predict the motivations of users, defenders, and attackers.
The lead researcher from Carnegie Mellon, Lorrie Cranor, is an associate professor of computer science and engineering and public policy. Cranor became involved with this project through her previous work, which also dealt with human factors related to security and privacy. She was recruited for the project team by Patrick McDaniel, a professor of computer science and engineering at Penn State and the principal investigator on this project.
Cranor’s main role is to lead the psychosocial team, which will be contributing to the project by investigating psychological and human factor issues. One of her teams developed techniques that allowed computers to distinguish between real and false cyberattacks, which may aid the performances of overwhelmed human analysts. Results from this research will enable future computing systems to take action derived from human decision making in response to attacks without physical human intervention. For example, a server observing unusual network traffic from an unknown entity might decide it is under attack and filter that traffic.
Despite the project’s seemingly technical nature, it requires a variety of expertise, most importantly that of people who understand risk, game theory, and human factor issues, according to Cranor. This is because an important approach to combating cyberattacks involves understanding the motivations and behaviors of attackers.
Cleotilde Gonzalez, an associate research professor of social and decision sciences and director of the Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory is responsible for many of the decision-making aspects of the project. Other Carnegie Mellon contributors include Lujo Bauer and Nicolas Christin, both assistant research professors of electrical and computer engineering and  associated with the CyLab.
Finally, Cranor stresses the role of researchers who specialize in the social sciences. “One of the salient aspects of our proposed research is in the realization that humans are integral to maintaining cybersecurity and to breaches of security,” Cranor said via email. “Their behavior and cognitive and psychological biases have to be integrated as much as any other component of the system that one is trying to secure.”.

India launched its first rocket to Mars last Tuesday with the goal to complete the mission using less money than other nations have previously. Successful missions to Mars thus far have been completed by the United States, the European Union, and Russia; China attempted an unsuccessful mission two years ago. India’s probe costs only 4.5 billion rupees ($73 million), which is a fraction of the cost of NASA’s upcoming Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. It has also been designed to orbit Earth six or seven times to build up momentum before being slingshotted to the red planet, in order to save fuel. The rocket is scheduled to enter Mars’s orbit by next September.

Discovery of Higgs only brings more mysteries
Joseph Lykken, a theorist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and Maria Spiropulu of the California Institute of Technology, conducted research that predicts that sometime in the distant future, a minuscule quantum fluctuation will cause the Higgs field to drop to a lower energy state. Since the Higgs field permeates all space, this seemingly small change would destroy reality as we know it in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, this is but one of many theories that have developed after the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson, which seems to have caused more mysteries than it’s solved.

Biologists study single-cell reproduction
While almost all multicellular organisms have evolved to reproduce using single cells, such as eggs and sperm, why this method became so universal has long puzzled scientists. To study this trait, University of Minnesota postdoctoral fellow William Ratcliff and associate professor Michael Travisano have transformed a single-celled algae into a multicellular one that reproduces with single cells. Many scientists assumed that single-cell reproduction evolved much later than multicellularity, but their study yielded surprising results: Single-cell reproduction arose at the same time as multicellularity.

Worldwide starfish deaths stump scientists
Starfish populations worldwide have fallen prey to the “seastar wasting syndrome,” which causes starfish to lose their arms. This disease usually occurs if the starfish is wounded or becomes too dry, and it grows infected lesions that lead to its arms falling off. While this disease usually only occurs to one or two starfish within a population and is not often lethal, millions of starfish from populations around the world have not only contracted the disease, but are unable to recover from it. While unusually warm waters may be a cause, the real culprit of this outbreak is yet is to be discovered, and scientists are unsure how long it will last.

2013-11-11,CMU,India,"A large crowd gathered in McConomy Auditorium last Tuesday afternoon to listen to spoken word poet and Project V.O.I.C.E. founder Sarah Kay. Kay’s performance of spoken verse rhythmic poetry was both personal and universal, focusing on themes of love, family, and learning.
Taking us on a journey of her own life, she began with her childhood family vacations and her little brother, before diving into first loves, long-distance relationships, mothers, and feminism, ending with a poem dedicated to teachers.
She captured a world of love and lost souls, full of both romantic lust and the cold truth of reality. That said, there was no trace of a Shakespearean imagined reality; rather, there were clear references to the modern world, where planes and phones connect people better than ever. An expert in crafting imagery, Kay created an environment that seemed fluid and full of emotional angst, yet also intricately detailed with specific imagery: “The years have spread us like dandelion seeds,” and “Cell phones that buzz as if it’s your hand.” Her performance was one of well-rehearsed spontaneity, complete with symbolic gestures and dramatic pauses that, rather than coming off as over the top and silly, felt like genuine reflections of her words.
In between poems, Kay caught her breath and became a “real” person again, with anecdotal remarks and stories that complemented her composed poetry. She seemed eager to connect with the crowd, asking questions to feel out her audience and bring up the energy.
Kay also referred to the work she does in addition to being a writer and performer. As founder of Project V.O.I.C.E., Kay works in schools nationally and internationally to teach poetry workshops to elementary and middle school students. She shared a story of using an analogy of pooping to communicate to middle school students that the hardest part about writing poetry is being able to both push through frustrations and be ready when inspiration strikes.
She also referred to the vast range of experiences she’s had even as a young woman in her 20s, from teaching in India to traveling in Nepal. These references added immensely to her work, expanding her sources of inspiration and helping her avoid cliché.
Part poet, part performer, part storyteller, and full comedian, Kay and her ability to bring life to words earned a standing ovation from enthralled Carnegie Mellon students. Her ability to articulate the struggles of growing up, being a woman, and figuring out what love is — offset by her no-fuss humor and attitude — connected with an audience struggling with many of the same issues. Perhaps most importantly, her candid chat with the audience prevented a common pitfall of poetry — the feeling as if the poet is attempting to leave us confused or mesmerized.
Kay’s first collection of poetry will be published in March. To learn more about Sarah Kay and Project V.O.I.C.E., visit kaysarahsera.com..

2013-11-18,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed Subra Suresh as the university’s ninth president last Friday. Following a campus-wide celebration onThursday, Suresh’s investiture ceremony was hosted at Carnegie Music Hall.
The event took place on the day of the 113th anniversary of Andrew Carnegie’s proposal to create what would eventually become Carnegie Mellon University.
Suresh has officially been Carnegie Mellon’s president since July 1. Previously, Suresh was director of the National Science Foundation from 2010–13. Before that, he was the dean and Vannevar Bush professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In Suresh’s speech, he compared his own journey as an immigrant to Andrew Carnegie’s. “In 1838, a 13-year-old boy and his family left their home in Scotland, crossing boundaries — and a very large ocean — to settle in the North of Pittsburgh. That journey transformed his life, and the lives of countless others around the world.”
Suresh, like Carnegie, made the journey to the United States to make an impact. “I’m here because of the vision and courage of a mother who herself was not lucky enough to go beyond high school. Still, she encouraged me to cross many boundaries, knowing all the risks and personal sacrifices she would have to endure, and knowing full well that my journey would transform my life and hers forever,” Suresh said.
“36 years ago, I crossed many national boundaries — and several large oceans — with a partially filled suitcase, less than $100 in my pocket, and a one-way airline ticket, purchased with a loan, to begin a new life that would eventually bring me here,” Suresh said, describing his journey as an immigrant to America.
Suresh’s comparison to Andrew Carnegie resonated with students. “I liked that he compared himself to Andrew Carnegie as an immigrant,” said Julia Eddy, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major.
Other students were inspired as soon as they heard the characteristic sound of the Carnegie Pipes and Drums open the ceremony.
“It was exciting; every time I come to these events I always get really emotional, just proud to be at this school. I hear the bagpipes and I start tearing up, like ‘wow, this is so great,’ ” said Siriana Abboud, a sophomore French and psychology double major.
The Carnegie Pipes and Drums were followed by the national anthem and a special performance by Carnegie Mellon alumna Patina Miller (CFA ’06). 
Miller, who is currently the star of the Broadway revival of Pippin and slated to be in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 and Part 2, sang Stephen Schwartz’s (CFA ’68) “Corner of the Sky.”
Raymond Lane, chairman of the Carnegie Mellon Board of Trustees, welcomed the packed music hall and hosted much of the ceremony.
The investiture included remarks and speeches from many prominent Carnegie Mellon staff members and alumni, including Carnegie Mellon’s longest-serving active faculty member, Allan Meltzer, the Allan H. Meltzer university professor of political economy.
Meltzer has served on Carnegie Mellon’s staff for 57 years, and has been here for five of the eight presidents before Suresh.
“Carnegie Mellon succeeded in moving from a good regional school to a major world- class university,” Meltzer said. “Let me assure you, that is an extremely rare achievement. Leland Stanford University comes to mind as another example, but they’ve had the benefit of oodles of substantial boodle — we did not.”
Meltzer’s remarks were followed by a poetry reading by Jim Daniels, the Thomas Stockham Baker professor of English.
Suresh was then welcomed by representatives from all parts of Carnegie Mellon, including Antoinette Ungaretti (MMCC ’70), president of the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Association and trustee; Roberta Klatzky, the Charles J. Queenan Jr. professor of psychology and chair of the Faculty Senate; and John Lanyon, chair of staff council.
The student body was also represented in the ceremony: Lindsay MacGillivray, senior biology major and student body president; Lukas Ronner, Student Senate chair; and Patrick Foley, chair of the Graduate Student Assembly, all gave remarks.
Many lauded Suresh’s outreach to the Carnegie Mellon community.
“It was gratifying that the first communication we got from him last year was ‘Oh, I’m going on a listening tour.’ It started his presidency on a good note to say that he understood that he didn’t know everything about this school, because not everybody does, but when you come into a position like [president], it’s easy to think that you might,” said third-year architecture major Nikhil Sambamurthy.
Ungaretti also praised Suresh’s listening tour. “Your first 100 days inured you to our alumni. You included us as one of the first stops on your listening tour, and you embraced us as an important constituency of CMU.”
The keynote speaker was introduced by John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Holdren said that Suresh “combines an enormous creativity, an enormous production of potential ideas to be implemented, with the capacity to figure out which ones can in fact be implemented and how he can go about implementing them.”
Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, gave the keynote speech. Schmidt noted that Carnegie Mellon has been a home for innovation and entrepreneurship since it pioneered the field of computer science in the 1960s. “It was a mythical place of achievement; the labs here were not just for experiments and research, they were where the future was dreamed up and created,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt, too, made a note of Suresh’s immigrant past. “What’s interesting about our energetic new leader is that he is also a testament to why we need to have an open country, to get extraordinarily brilliant people to come into our country to change our country and build our future.”
The ceremony closed with a performance by the Carnegie Mellon concert choir and the Carnegie Pipes and Drums. 
The choir performed “The Oak,” a piece by professor of composition Nancy Galbraith adapted from the poem of the same name by Alfred Lord Tennyson.
The ceremony left students impressed. Evan Wineland, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, summed up the mood of the investiture. “I think it was one of the most inspirational moments of my time here at CMU. I think anybody who is not beaming with Tartan pride right now is doing it wrong.”
Suresh received his undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras before coming to Iowa State University for his master of science and then receiving his doctorate from MIT.
Suresh is also one of only 16 living Americans to be elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Medicine..

2013-11-25,CMU,India,"The seventh annual Bhangra in the Burgh (BIB) competition was held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall last Saturday night. Although only seven years old, BIB has consistently brought together some of the best Bhangra teams in the North America and has sold out multiple shows.
“It was obviously a really fun show,” said Pranita Ramakrishnan, sophomore information systems major and BIB co-chair. Aside from the flashy dancing, however, the co-chairs were all most excited about getting the community involved in and excited about Bhangra, a dance style for which they all share passion.
This year’s competition differed from previous ones in that it was promoted accessibly all over campus. “Before the show we tried to make the PR really fun,” Ramakrishnan said. Anyone who walked past Doherty Hall the weeks preceding the show can attest to the energetic music that blasted while committee members sold tickets for both the event and the after-party.
This year, the committee also welcomed Indian emcee Jus Reign, a famous Punjabi comedian and YouTube sensation. As host for the show, Jus Reign kept the fun alive between sets as he held “impromptu” Skype video calls with his brother and joked about the lack of white people in the audience.
On Saturday, Pittsburgh welcomed eight competitive teams: the University of California, Berkeley’s Bhangra team (Cal Bhangra), Columbia University’s Bhangra team (Columbia Bhangra), Cornell University’s Bhangra team (Cornell Bhangra), First Class Bhangra (FCB), George Mason University’s Bhangra team (GMU Bhangra), Shaan Mutiyaaran Di Bhangra Club, the University of Virgina’s Di Shaan, and Virginia Commonwealth University’s Bhangra team (VCU Bhangra). Also featured were five local exhibition acts: Carnegie Mellon University’s Chak de Bhangra, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Masti, the University of Pittsburgh’s PantheRaas, Carnegie Mellon’s Deewane, and Carnegie Mellon’s Soulstylz.
Maintaining its roots in Punjabi folk dancing, modern Bhangra has been transformed into a lively dance style that hints at hip-hop and other modern influences. The teams performing last Saturday all put on technically stunning performances, the main discrepancies between the acts being the level of modern influence.
Columbia Bhangra started the night off strong. The group put on one of the more modernized performances and was able to energize the crowd, setting a good vibe for the rest of the night.
Crowd favorite FCB, an all-male Pittsburgh-area Bhangra group, brought a similarly modernized performance, easily the most dynamic and energetic performance of the night. The energy was evident before the dance even started; the dancers pumped up the audience by jumping excitedly up and down as they took the stage in dim lighting. The crowd cheered continuously throughout the performance.
The last competitive team to take the stage, UVA Di Shaan, ended the competition with another high-energy dance with obvious modern influence. Their performance started off with the most exciting light show of the night with rainbow colors flashing along with the beat. The fun didn’t end there, however: The performance was once again on the less traditional side, infusing techno music and hard-hitting hip-hop moves, and the choreography was both technically challenging and engaging for the audience.
Emphasizing one of the modern styles that has had a great impact on Bhangra, Carnegie Mellon’s elite hip-hop team Soulstylz also made an appearance. Although not so flashy and colorful as the Bhangra dances, Soulstylz provided a refreshing and creative set that left the audience wanting to dance along.
Cornell Bhangra, who placed second at last year’s Bhangra in the Burgh, came out with choreography that had moments of obvious modern influence balanced with a traditional overall feel. Cornell boasts one of the oldest Bhangra teams that competed, and the members’ experience was very obvious. The performance brought the night’s energy to a whole new level and the crowd roared before the dancers even took the stage. Their timing was impeccable; they truly danced as one cohesive group.
VCU Bhangra, a newcomer to the BIB stage, performed a similarly balanced dance. The team’s set, with its relevance and synchronization, produced a comparably great crowd reaction.
Another exhibition act, Penn Masti broke up the final run of Bhangra performances with its South Asian jazz fusion-styled performance. Their choreography was technical and captivating, at times very sexy and other times emulating a traditional folk dance.
Also demonstrating the influence modern culture has had on tradition, Deewane — Carnegie Mellon’s all-male South Asian fusion a cappella group — performed a short set. The team offered a captivating mash-up of a traditional song and an instantly recognizable ’90s hit —the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.”
Performing directly after Columbia, GMU Bhangra’s performance was starkly more traditional. They were the first performance group of the night to bring a dholi, a performer who plays a traditional Punjabi drum, into the mix.
SMD Bhangra Club, the only all-female performance of the night, also came out strong and performed its traditional piece with the most excited and passionate faces seen at the competition. The dance’s musicality was nearly unmatched in the competition.
Last year’s BIB champion, Cal Bhangra, kicked off the second half of the show with an analogous musically conscious and highly entertaining performance. Although it didn’t receive the same roaring applause as last year, crowd members happily watched the heartwarming performance with bellies full of samosas.
A performance by Pitt’s PantheRaas continued the theme of traditional Indian dance, but broke up the Bhangra flow with a Garba-Raas styled dance. Garba and Raas are both traditional Indian dances from the Guijarat and Vrindavan regions of India respectively. Their performance included similarly ostentatious costumes and the dancing had some similarities to Bhangra, but it brought a distinct Indian flair to the night.
While the scores were still being tallied backstage, Carnegie Mellon’s Chak de Bhangra took the stage as many of the performers’ peers cheered them on from the audience. At the end of the performance, the entire Chak de Bhangra family stormed the stage, marking the peak of the night’s energy level.
After the Carnegie Mellon performance, much of the crowd began to file out while the judges were still deliberating. When the awards were finally presented, crowd favorite FCB took first place followed by Cornell Bhangra, the runner-up from last year’s competition. GMU Bhangra secured third place.
Clearly there was no favored balance of tradition and modern influence when it came to the judging perspective, with a modern, mixed, and traditional team claiming each of the top spots respectively. The night featured a great blend of traditional culture and modern fun, creating a strikingly colorful, energetic, and musical experience..

2014-01-20,CMU,India,"With the end of the NFL’s regular season, many teams are now vying for a spot in Super Bowl XLVIII. For those teams not lucky enough to make it past the regular season, many coaching changes are underway. The following details a short guide to the head coaching changes around the NFL:
Tennessee Titans
Out: Mike Munchak (22–26)
In: Ken Whisenhunt (San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator)
​This firing was not a surprise after three middling seasons from Munchak, a 30-year veteran of the Titans’ organization. Big steps forward from cornerback Alterraun Verner, defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, and the rest of the defense were overshadowed by poor play from former feature running back Chris Johnson and injuries to franchise quarterback Jake Locker. Locker was clearly on the rise before injuries derailed his — and the Titans’ — season.
This team has a young core with a potentially talented quarterback who needs help getting the offense together. Whisenhunt’s resurrection of Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers might appear to make him a good fit, but the situation is not similar. Rivers was on a good team with a good coach for the first time in five years, and he was not a project like Locker.
Whisenhunt had two successful years as a head coach for the Arizona Cardinals, but when former quarterback Kurt Warner retired, he never found success again. Furthermore, Whisenhunt’s post-Warner quarterback carousel stunted the development of many strong-armed, athletic quarterbacks with accuracy problems. This assessment contrasts with more accurate, pocket passers like Warner and Rivers. Jake Locker, however, fits the former description, and a quarterback carousel between Locker and backup Ryan Fitzpatrick would do more to stunt Locker’s development than any injury could.
Whisenhunt’s hiring simply boggles the mind. It emphasizes his worst qualities.
Detroit Lions
Out: Jim Schwartz (29–51)
In: Jim Caldwell (Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator)
​Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco might disagree with me, but I do not think this decision was a good one for the Lions. This team is incredibly talented, and wide receiver Calvin Johnson and the entire defensive line are the best at their jobs in the NFL. Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford has shown both flashes of brilliance and completely incomprehensible decision making, and his development will be a key to the team’s future success. Schwartz deserved to be fired, as the Lions consistently underperformed on his watch.
The problem with this hire is Caldwell’s inconsistency. He helped develop Manning, but Manning was going to be good regardless of who coached him. In his year with the Indianapolis Colts without Manning, the team tanked for Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, so it is hard to evaluate Caldwell’s coaching abilities. 
Caldwell’s work with Flacco has been less inspiring. Flacco quietly played a mediocre regular season before the unmitigated disaster he was this year, throwing interceptions at a stunning clip. Flacco’s playoff success notwithstanding, Caldwell just hasn’t shown that he can change turnover-prone Stafford’s habits soon enough before Calvin Johnson is past his prime.
Cleveland Browns
Out: Rob Chudzinski (4–12)
In: No one (yet)
​Rob Chudzinski lasted only a season with the Browns, and despite a 1–10 finish to the season, his firing took most people by surprise. Chudzinski helped develop a good offensive line and an above-average defense, including huge leaps from cornerback Joe Haden, tight end Jordan Cameron, and wide receiver Josh Gordon. Poor quarterback play doomed the Browns, but Chudzinski was working with one of the worst quarterback situations in recent memory. 
Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Mike Pettine has emerged as a candidate for the vacancy, but the lack of rumors suggests that the Browns are waiting on one of the Seattle Seahawks’ highly touted coordinators, Darrell Bevell or Dan Quinn.
Washington Redskins
Out: Mike Shanahan (24–40)
In: Jay Gruden (Cincinatti Bengals offensive coordinator)
​What Mike Shanahan did with franchise quarterback Robert Griffin III (RGIII) is ridiculous and he deserved to lose his job for turning the situation into a media circus. Gruden’s hire is a toss-up. 
Gruden has done an excellent job with the Bengals’ offense in the past three years. Say what you want about quarterback Andy Dalton, but he has far exceeded the low expectations laid out for him. The receiving corps — particularly wide receiver AJ Green — the offensive line, and the running game were all impressive units that exhibited positive development over the years and prove that Gruden clearly has the ability to help surround RGIII.
However, the Washington offense was relatively successful despite RGIII’s apparent hindrance from knee surgery.  The big problem was a disastrous defense. Gruden is an offensive coach. Of course, personnel would fix the defense more than a coaching hire, but someone who could develop the team’s defensive talent would be more beneficial than an offensive mind.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
Out: Greg Schiano (11–21)
In: Lovie Smith (former Chicago Bears head coach)
​While players seemed to take the locker room from previous coach Raheem Morris, hiring a disciplinarian was Tampa’s solution to a team perceived as lazy and sloppy. Schiano’s hiring was such a success that franchise quarterback Josh Freeman bolted after a public feud with him, and a visibly disinterested team began the season 0–8.
Smith is a talented head coach and is not a disciplinarian, or a tough-love coach, or any of the other platitudes used to describe fools like Schiano. Smith took the Bears to the Super Bowl in 2006 and found success with his Tampa 2 defense, which would fit the Buccaneers’ defense perfectly. Mike Glennon may not be the answer at quarterback, and there are holes elsewhere on the team, but these are problems for Smith to address, and he will answer them.  
Minnesota Vikings
Out: Leslie Frazier (21–32)
In: Mike Zimmer (Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator)
​This hire was an excellent decision for a team that badly struggled defensively last season. Frazier did not deserve to be fired, as the holes in the defense were as personnel-based as they were scheme-based. Zimmer has compiled an extremely impressive résumé since his NFL origins in 1994. The pile of late-round draft picks and overlooked players starring on the Bengals’ defense became a fearsome unit under Zimmer, despite rashes of injuries, and showed Zimmer’s impressive talent for scouting and developing players. This unit will help a Vikings defense that couldn’t stop anyone last season; the offense isn’t the problem.
The team needs to address its quarterback carousel, but running back Adrian Peterson can carry a mediocre passing attack. This team is not far removed from a surprise playoff run, so expect improvement in the near future with an excellent new head coach..

2014-01-20,CMU,India,"Rituals form the basis of human social activity. While rituals may seem like things of the past, in truth, many have simply evolved over time in changing contexts. Moreover, rituals are not just significant cultural habits; they are also inherently personal decisions. In many ways, rituals form the basis for self-created practices to deal with personal issues.
Junior BHA student Nicole Anderson has always been interested in rituals of many types. She explored the concept of the evolution and origins of personal rituals and rites in a curated exhibit of books and artifacts from the Posner collection called “Make Your Own Meaning” in the Posner Center that opened this past Friday.
The driving force behind Anderson’s exhibit deals with the question of how a ritual can enable the individual to cope with change, focusing on large, life-changing moments that society deems important. The exhibition is composed of six displays organized into three stages of life: adolescence, marriage, and death. Within each stage of life, Anderson explores the traditional ritual in one display and an adaptation to the original in the next, creating an interesting interplay between the past and the present.
For marriage and death, Anderson compares traditional rituals with modern adaptations. She juxtaposes the rituals that make up a traditional Anglo-Saxon wedding with recent Indian-American weddings that combine traditional Indian weddings with their American counterparts. Likewise, the exhibit compares ancient Chinese death rites to the modern customs of Chinese Americans, showing what has stayed the same and what has evolved. The exhibit comments on the way in which individuals take ownership of outdated rituals in order to use them more meaningfully within the context of their own lives.
Anderson took a slightly different approach to the two sections devoted to adolescence. These exhibits focus less on the manner in which social groups change their ethnic customs due to migration, and more on how being a teenager in the United States has changed. “Prom” tells the story of tradition and how the “most important day of your life” evolved. The exhibit cites movies and TV shows that glorify simple events as well as critique them, from the age-old, yet constantly retold Cinderella fairy tale to 10 Things I Hate about You. An exhibit on the concept of the teenage bedroom explores the increased importance of the idea of creating spaces that reflect personal identity, drawing from Shakespeare’s Ophelia and the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides.
Through the use of both historical and contemporary examples, Anderson is able to give the viewer an appreciation for the rituals that define both individuals and cultures. The exhibit examines the way in which rituals are able to evolve, while preserving some sort of cultural integrity.
In the 21st century, the concept of identity has become increasingly personal; people create their own image and do what they are personally passionate about. The years of living lives based on the past seem distant and foreign, yet in truth, people are inherently bound to the past. Rituals become the glue that both links people to their heritage and inhibits them from recreating their identities.
Anderson’s exhibit offers an interesting perspective that is critical at times and celebratory at others. The range of rituals that are studied within the displays ensures that the exhibit resonates with a wide variety of patrons from all walks of life..

2014-01-27,CMU,India,"A large portion of America will watch football for the first time all season next Sunday as Superbowl XLVIII airs. Never fear, uninformed viewer — The Tartan is here to make sure you have at least some idea about what is happening.
The Football
The game features the Seattle Seahawks against the Denver Broncos. Both finished with the top seed in their respective conferences and had home field advantage through the playoffs up until this point.
The Seahawks are a primarily defensive team. Led by their hard-hitting secondary, the Seahawks are a suffocating team that embodies the defense-wins-championships mentality. Pro-Bowl Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman became the face of the team last week when he was interviewed right after the Seahawks’ win over their rivals, the San Francisco 49ers.
Sherman shouted: “I’m the best corner in the game! When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you gonna get! Don’t you ever talk about me.” This interview came on the heels of Sherman deflecting a potentially game-winning touchdown pass aimed at 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree for a game-clinching interception.
Sherman’s play and antics have further overshadowed the consistent, yet unimpressive play of the Seahawks offense. Led by running back Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch, the Seahawks consistently pound the football, focusing on ball control more than long touchdown throws. Second-year quarterback Russell Wilson has not put up the gaudy numbers of his draft class peers Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck and Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffen III. Instead, he acts as more of a protector of the football, waiting for the right moment to burst out with a long play by improvising with his legs and accurate arm.
The one ace in the hole for the Seahawks is the return of wide receiver Percy Harvin. Acquired from the Minnesota Vikings for a first-round pick this past offseason, Harvin has seen very limited playing time since sustaining a variety of injuries over the course of the season. However, his speed remains unmatched in the league, so expect to see Harvin running all over the field on Sunday trying to make things difficult for the Broncos.
The Broncos are the perfect foil for the Seahawks, relying heavily on their high-flying offense for most of their wins. Quarterback Peyton Manning had the greatest statistical season of any passer in NFL history, setting the record for most touchdowns and most passing yardage. With a variety of weapons — all-pro wideouts Demarius Thomas, Erin Decker, and Wes Welker, along with breakout star, tight end Julius Thomas — it is nearly impossible to fully cover all of Manning’s targets on any given play. When combined with the two-headed running game of running back Knowshon Moreno and rookie running back Montee Ball, containing the Denver offense is no easy task.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Broncos still have a top-10 unit more than capable of stopping the pass and the run. Large defensive tackle Terrance “Pot Roast” Knighton looks to play a large role in containing Lynch and forcing Wilson to beat the Broncos with his arm and not his running ability. The loss of all-pro linebacker Von Miller to a torn ACL has certainly hurt the squad, but backup Danny Trevathan has done a tremendous job filling in for him.
The Halftime Show
The Super Bowl halftime show is a huge guarantee for media exposure, which is why superstar artists are willing to perform for little to no pay. This year Grammy Award-winner Bruno Mars was tapped to perform in front of the world’s largest television audience. We can look forward to huge sets and visual effects as Mars sings with guest performers Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The biggest point of intrigue surrounding the halftime show, other than the set list, will be the impact of the weather. With the Super Bowl being hosted in an open-roofed stadium in New Jersey in the beginning of February, there is no guarantee of good weather and a possibility of freezing temperatures and precipitation. Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers both traditionally perform in large, indoor venues, so their adaptation to the cold will be interesting to watch.
The Ads
The final piece of the Super Bowl viewing experience is the ads. With a 30-second advertisement spot costing around $4 million, advertisers go out of their way to make sure they have an impact and stay with their audience. In the past, some of the best advertisements have been from Doritos, which uses fan submissions with a million-dollar prize for the winners, and beer companies who fully understand who their primary demographic is.
But not all Super Bowl advertising has to cost a lot of money. During last year’s power outage, Oreo tweeted a picture referencing the blackout. This tweet went viral as people wanted to share the humorous and timely picture with friends and family. This tweet was marked as one of the most successful social marketing images of the year, and gained as much, if not more, exposure from the Super Bowl than the companies that paid millions of dollars for 30 seconds of air time.
Prop Bets

2014-02-02,CMU,India,"After the Brooklyn Nets traded for power forwards and centers Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce in the off-season, adding to an already-talented core, the New York Knicks were supposed to progress from an exciting season that yielded a No. 2 seed in the East Conference and a trip to the conference semifinals. 
Instead, injuries and the peaking Indiana Pacers derailed the Knicks’ dream year. Few predicted the joyless abyss that would become the first half of this season’s incarnation of the Knicks.
The only notable roster changes from last year were the losses of retired point guard Jason Kidd, now coach of the Nets, and power forward Chris Copeland to the Indiana Pacers, as well as the trade of three-point specialist Steve Novak to the Toronto Raptors for center Andrea Bargnani, and Amar’e Stoudemire’s actual appearance on the court. 
However, this roster seems like a huge regression for what is basically the same team.
The Knicks have a lot of things working against them. One thing that always has to be noted with the Knicks is that the team is poorly managed. Players are handed awful contracts for lengthy periods, draft picks are shunned for aging talent, and without the huge draw of the best market in professional sports, this team would probably be sold or absorbed by the National Basketball Association (NBA) after years of bad results and little reason to care. 
Unfortunately, New Yorkers are stuck with this stinker of an organization pulling together nothing of note from 2000–10. This recent run of success was an anomaly, a case of stars wanting to play in New York rather than the Knicks actually doing something to create a good team. 
The result was a very talented and poorly constructed team with disappointing, early playoff exits in consecutive seasons. This bad management is one of the first reasons the Knicks are struggling so much this season.
This poor administration causes three big issues. The first is that the Knicks are perpetually capped out and cannot respond to legitimate team needs, making it easier for other teams to figure out how to beat the Knicks from year to year. 
The second issue is that Jay-Z’s Creative Artists Agency (CAA) has basically taken control of the Knicks’ basketball operations, causing silly basketball moves like giving small forward J.R. Smith (more on him later) a huge raise and signing his brother. 
The third issue is that players never really develop into the stars they’re supposed to become, and these disappointing results yield sad basketball stories like guard Iman Shumpert, a player who was supposed to be a star and regressed mightily this year due to poor coaching and frustration with trade rumors. These three issues have hampered the Knicks greatly in different ways and all contribute to this disaster of a season.
The lack of attention paid to key problems with the Knicks last year — basically, the defense behind rim-protecting center Tyson Chandler — was predictably a huge problem for the Knicks. 
When Chandler was lost to a leg injury early in the season, the Knicks went on a disastrous nine-game losing streak, putting them in a huge hole going forward. 
The defense last year was an unmitigated disaster. The Knicks could not stop anyone, and there is no way to win a basketball game if the other team scores at will. 
This issue was compounded by an awful offensive scheme from coach Mike Woodson, which basically boils down to passing to small forward Carmelo “Melo” Anthony and standing still while he tries to score by himself. To his credit, he’s put together a stellar season despite running what seems like infinite isolation plays. 
Poor point guard play from Raymond Felton and an injury to point guard Pablo Prigioni have caused ball movement to be a huge issue for the Knicks, probably contributing to all of the isolations.
Carmelo is clearly a top-five talent in the NBA and has been incredibly effective from midrange over the course of the year. His problem, as always, is that he is ineffective going to the basket and doesn’t play defense. It’s not a safe bet to build an entire team around a player whose bread and butter is the midrange shot — a usually very inefficient way of scoring — and absolutely no help on offense. 
With a consistently one-dimensional offense and little in the way of defense, it becomes more obvious why the Knicks are struggling: They’re playing to their weakness, and they’re taking no steps to help cover these weaknesses.
The team’s big off-season acquisition was draft bust power forward Andrea Bargnani, known as an awful rim protector and rebounder, further compounding the Knicks lack of defense without really diversifying the offense. 
In fairness to Bargnani, he has played very well, but he still has not clicked defensively, and protecting the rim is a huge hole behind Chandler, who is of almost no use on offense. With bad personnel and bad schemes, winning was never a likely outcome.
One player who was supposed to help the Knicks defensively was shooting guard and small forward Shumpert. 
He played very well in the playoffs and, compared to other Knicks, was a defensive wizard. The key phrase here is “compared to other Knicks.” His defense can get lazy and he watches the ball a lot instead of paying attention to who he is guarding. 
Offensively, he’s not useful for much any more besides three-point shots. Shumpert’s regression might be attributable to frustration with trade rumors earlier in the season, but that does not change the fact that he is having a significantly worse season than he did the previous year. 
The Knicks’ stubborn refusal to trade him at the beginning of the year turned out to be a missed opportunity. Shumpert may be good one day, but not for the Knicks. There is no system for developing players into stars on the Knicks. With no first-round draft picks until 2019, the Knicks probably 
understand this problem.
Speaking of regression, Smith, a key contributor last season, is having a terrible season. When on the floor, Smith has been missing shots at a stunning clip, shooting 37 percent and chucking 12 awful shots per game. That unimpressive record only happens when he’s not getting fined for untying opposing players’ shoelaces or getting benched for missing meetings. In games Smith has missed, the Knicks have been excellent, beating the Miami Heat and the Dallas Mavericks. 
The Knicks had an okay first five games of the season while Smith was suspended for violating the league’s illegal substance policy. Smith, playing upwards of 30 minutes a game, went from barely advantageous to a huge drawback this year.
In addition to his shooting deficiencies, Smith continues to hog the ball and play awful defense. His shoelace-untying and pot-smoking also comes in addition to his affiliation with the CAA, which he abused to force the Knicks into keeping his brother, point guard Chris Smith, on the roster despite not being a NBA-caliber player. 
J.R. Smith’s regression is probably the most apparent way in which Kidd’s retirement hurt the Knicks. Kidd consistently put Smith in a position to score, which inflated Smith’s stats noticeably. The missed shots this year have piled up and made the Knicks way worse for their efforts.
Though it’s not comprehensive, the coaching and personnel problems facing the Knicks show that the lofty projections for this team were probably more of an overestimation of the talent on the roster rather than a reasonable prediction of mediocrity. 
The Knicks should be able to turn their season around, but the team’s poor management is a bad omen for future results. 
The horrible Eastern conference means they should be a playoff team, but in the Eastern Conference, that’s not really anything to hang one’s hat on..

2014-02-10,CMU,India,"With the end of that big football game last week, the NBA All-Star Game is approaching quickly, and with it comes the year’s widely anticipated All-Star selections. 
Amid cries that players were stiffed out of well-deserved All-Star appearances, a group of very deserving candidates ended up receiving spots in the game. There is also a group of head-scratchers that truly don’t belong. So, as the yearly debate over who got snubbed rages on, here’s my two cents.
Let’s start with the Western Conference, since it’s far easier to identify which spots should be vacated. It’s almost impossible to say someone was cheated out of a spot when trying to dissect the extremely talented West, since there is a list of about 20 players who could fill the 12 remaining spots left. The only player who does not belong on this All-Star roster, based on play this season, is Kobe Bryant, and that’s only due to an injury.  
Unfortunately, Los Angeles Clippers reserve guard Chris Paul might also miss the game due to an injury, leaving two spots that might open up. Since both players are guards, the two reserves will likely be guards.
However, since there is one spot on the roster that can be either a frontcourt or backcourt player, it is possible that one guard and one frontcourt player will be added to the mix.  
There are four candidates who truly deserve these last two spots. One is Memphis Grizzlies guard Michael Conley. He has played fantastically on the offensive end this season, keeping afloat a Grizzlies offense that has been stagnant over the past few years, even with the absence of center Marc Gasol. What the team has lost in Gasol’s high post-passing they have regained in Conley’s excellent season at the point. 
Conley ranks near the top of the league in both Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Offensive Win Shares, which are statistics that show how well he has played using a massive volume of the team’s possessions, taking care of the basketball, and taking — and making — good shots. While his defense this year has worsened, his notable offensive uptick has carried a flawed team, plagued by injuries and an awful start, to compete for a playoff berth in the West.
Another deserving candidate is Phoenix Suns guard Goran Dragic. The Suns are one of the NBA’s best stories this year.  Despite preseason predictions that this team was tanking and playing for a draft pick, Jeff Hornacek’s stellar coaching and guard Eric Bledsoe’s development have turned this team into a legitimate playoff threat. In addition to Bledsoe, Dragic, who was known for so long as an excellent backup point guard, was having the best season of his career. Many people thought the Suns of Anarchy, as fans affectionately call them, were doomed when Bledsoe sat out for an undisclosed amount of time due to a meniscus injury. 
These people were wrong. Dragic has been an unstoppable force since taking over as full-time point guard, being near the top of the league in points and assists per game, field goal percentage, PER, win shares, and win shares per 48 minutes. After his massive amount of playing time, it’s time to consider Dragic one of the best guards in the NBA. His defense is above average and very few point guards in the league are actually good defenders, so he gets points for positional scarcity. 
Forget one of the two possible vacancies — Dragic easily deserved the nod above Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damien Lillard. Lillard is having an excellent season and deserves to be an All-Star, but with limited spots, Dragic’s superior offensive and defensive season should rank above Lillard’s impressive clutch shooting. 
It’s splitting hairs at this point, but denying the 47 minutes of star basketball that Dragic provides the Suns in favor of the one minute of superstardom that Lillard provides the Trailblazers seems unfair. Dragic might still make the All-Star Game if Chris Paul is unable to play, but Paul is one of the top five talents in the league, and hopefully he’s back on the court sooner rather than later.
The most baffling omission was New Orleans Pelicans center Anthony Davis. Already known as a premier defensive stopper, Davis was really coming around offensively as well, even placing fifth in the league in PER up to this point, taking high efficiency shots and protecting the ball.  That statistic does not even include how much Davis has improved without the ball. 
He has become a top pick-and-roll big over the course of the season. Despite an injury that stole some of Davis’s season, his offensive and defensive activity has been hugely positive for the Pelicans. This success is quite a task considering that the roster is built around three players with identical skill sets. There have not been any holes in Davis’s game this year, so the problem is figuring out whose spot he deserves.
It’s likely that Davis will get Bryant’s spot, considering that he both deserves it and that the game will be played in New Orleans. The fact that a deserving New Orleans representative was denied a chance to play in this game on his home floor is probably not something the NBA will let happen upon further review.
The fourth and final omission from this All-Star team in the West is Sacramento Kings forward DeMarcus Cousins. He has been an absolute beast offensively, regularly putting up 30 and 10 lines for the Kings. There are two reasons he ended up missing the cut. The first is that the frontcourt spots in the West are extremely difficult to get; there are far more deserving players than there are spots. The second is that Cousins often gets docked for perceived character issues stemming from spats with his coach and teammates as a rookie. 
The truth is that Cousins’s game has been elevated to another level. He’s getting better offensively without the ball and has become unstoppable when he has possession. His defense is still subpar, but it’s no longer the massive liability it was before this year. On a team with more assets than the Kings, he could be an MVP candidate, but his season to date has been excellent. The problem with saying he should be in the All-Star Game is figuring out whose spot he should take. The six big men on the current roster and, potentially, Davis, are all having stellar seasons. Clippers’ Blake Griffin, Houston Rockets’ Dwight Howard, and Trail Blazers’ LaMarcus Aldridge are in MVP talks, and Oklahoma City Thunder’s Kevin Durant is probably the MVP at this point in the season. Dallas Mavericks Dirk Nowitzki is having an excellent year and has been one of the most efficient players in the league to date, and Minnesota Timberwolves Kevin Love is probably the best all-around power forward in the game. Cousins should be in the All-Star Game — there just aren’t enough spots in the West.
The West does not have any true snubs because there are way too many deserving players to fit all of them on the roster. These four only scratched the surface, but players like San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan and Thunder forward Serge Ibaka are also worthy of consideration. The pool of players to choose from made for a tough field more than it resulted in snubs.
The Eastern Conference, on the other hand, probably stretched a bit to find enough players to be in this game. However, there are two definite snubs of players who were more than deserving of an All-Star spot, while others were seemingly chosen for no reason. 
The truth is, of the 12 East All-Stars, only eight deserved their spots. The omissions of Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson and Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry show just how far the East had to reach to find big names to put in an All-Star Game.
The inclusion of Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan over fellow Raptor Lowry makes no sense. With the possible exception of Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade, Lowry has been the best guard in the East. DeRozan was supposed to be a big piece of the Raptors before the season, but Lowry’s amazing year has put him at the center of the team’s astonishing turnaround, ascending from a cellar dweller last year to a division leader this year. Part of their record has to do with the Atlantic Division, but the Raptors are actually playing good basketball. DeRozan has been relatively inefficient this year, taking tons of bad shots, while Lowry has kept everyone in the offense humming. He has been generally excellent as a playmaker, in addition to being a good shooter. Lowry is having a better year than Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving by a long shot. Irving is having a subpar year by anyone’s standards — let alone the All-Star team’s — but he is still having a much better season than Brooklyn Nets forward Joe Johnson. Lowry probably deserved to be a starter.
Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson was also snubbed. His improvement has catapulted the Pacers from being the third team in the East to comfortably leading the conference. Last year he was a complementary player, but this year he is the best backcourt player in one of the best backcourts in the league. His defense has been suffocating, and he completely eliminates whoever he is guarding. His offense has been okay — it’s been very efficient thus far, but not spectacular. However, Stephenson deserved a All-Star spot in the East, and should not have been denied it because Irving’s name is more recognized (despite his huge regression) or because Nets’ Joe Johnson hit two buzzer beaters despite having a generally bad season.
The Eastern Conference All-Star team, which should have 10 deserving players, only has eight while the Western Conference All-Stars spill over the roster limit. This game will probably not be a classic, but the difference in talent between the East and West might be on full display. The exhibition nature of the All-Star Game means it usually ends up as a highlight contest, so the honor of being named an All-Star matters more than the game. This year, being named an Eastern Conference All-Star might be even less important..

2014-02-17,CMU,India,"Saturday night was the premiere and only night of Carnegie Mellon’s biggest annual fashion show, Lunar Gala, featuring dazzling designs created and modeled entirely by students. The theme this year was “Hypnôse,” with the tagline: “The Illusion is Beautiful.” The title and description fit the replaying eerie video that began with a girl standing alone in a wintry forest staring curiously at what appeared to be a multicolored hologram. Only with the culmination of the show did the audience discover what happened to the girl when she stepped into the hologram: her image became a series of hallucinations and warped images, meant to represent the inspiration for this year’s Lunar Gala. The show itself was grand, complete with high-energy dance performances from Carnegie Mellon’s very own Infra Dance Company and SoulStylz, as well as a catalog with descriptions of each line.
The show began with a DJ playing energetic music, after which the video flashed on the screen and the crowd erupted into applause and shouts. The first line displayed was titled “Cocoon” and was designed by sophomore design major Miriam Buchwald, who explains in the show’s magazine how the inspiration for her looks came from the unraveling of a cocoon. The series of delicate white dresses and gowns appeared angelic on stage, and seemed to include many different textures. It was most shocking, then, that each beautiful dress had been crafted completely from hot glue. The designer’s talent was apparent in the intricacies of each design, and how each look was unique, despite having been made from the same material.
Once “Cocoon” ended, there was a quick transition to the next line, “Saint Knox,” signaled by a change in music and pattern of lights on the light-board from which the models emerged.
The looks featured in “Saint Knox,” designed by junior design majors Keith Joseph and Hayden Smith, were more casual and edgy than the first line. In stark contrast to the delicate white dresses of the first line, the simple black or grey outfits were unique, often with sheer or entirely removed sleeves. The designers definitely achieved their goal of creating “an easy-going line of modern street wear,” as described in the magazine.
From the next line “Fjortis,” the most memorable aspect was the light display on the board under which the models entered. Setting the scene for designer senior decision science major Anna Cederquist’s vision, as described in the program, of combining “what is considered mature and childish” was a light design with bright colors and images that danced along the light board in tune to the fun, upbeat music. The designs themselves matched the theme, with silhouettes that appeared adult-like and accented with small, unexpected bursts of neon and childlike patterns.
Junior design major Liana Kong’s “Heteroptera” was next on stage. Citing her inspiration as the book Heteroptera by Cornelia Hesse-Honegger, Kong created an alternate environment through her use of geometric shapes and mixes of textures such as leather and tulle. Purposeful cutouts and rips accentuated her theme of human destruction. This line was followed by “Biome,” created by fifth-year architecture major Ying Lin, junior mechanical engineering major Josh Lopez-Binder, and fifth-year architecture major Paulina Reyes. Intricate patterns representative of the computational design involved in the creation of this line were juxtaposed against soft, wispy dresses.
Like its mysterious name, “Senhua” was intriguing with three-dimensional shapes, laser cut designs, and eccentric materials such as plastic. The designers — sophomore design major Chloe Chia, junior design major Alex Kane, and sophomore Bachelors of Computer Science and Arts student in computer science and design Jessica Shen — emphasized the importance of balance in their line. The product of a trio majoring in varying disciplines, “Senhua” was a combination of various techniques and styles, tied together by a playful-yet-serious vibe. The differences and similarities in design worked to make the looks that were displayed visually appealing.
Everything in Lunar Gala was the result of careful planning and consideration, including the order in which the different lines were displayed. Though it was obvious that each fashion line tied into the Hypnôse theme by playing with texture and pattern, it was also noticeable that each line seamlessly transitioned into the next. While three-dimensional shapes characterized “Senhua,” the next line, “Dilate,” placed emphasis on light. The line’s designers — sophomore industrial design major Gina Huang, sophomore communication design major Irene Joung, and sophomore fine arts major Angelina Namkung — achieved this emphasis through 3-D elements such as a string of light bulbs hanging around the model’s neck, or a few light bulbs dangling off a pyramid-shaped hat.
From one line based on light came another called “Lumi,” though this type of light came in the form of small LED bulbs that the models could control with Bluetooth technology. Through this line, designers sophomore art major Christin Bongiorni and senior business administration major Mia Skinner achieved their goal of fusing technology with fashion. This line was indescribably enjoyable to watch, due to the interplay between the lights and music.
Third-year architecture majors Shivani Jain and Jacqueline Yeung’s line, “Mureaux,” focused on what they described in the program as “extrusions of the body.” Most memorable from this line were the peculiar shapes in mostly neutral colors, accented by pieces in gold. This line easily transitioned to third-year architecture major Colleen Clifford’s “Capsaicin,” which was simultaneously simple and modern, marked by reusability of different fabrics.
Then came the futuristic neon plastics with junior design majors Samantha Chiu and Antonio Ono’s “UV,” followed by first-year design major Eileen Huang’s “Youth.” While “UV” was more futuristic and revealing, “Youth” was, as its name indicates, more childish with items such as a pair of neon pink overalls.
Like many of the lines that incorporated technology with fashion, the next line, “Errorz” was inspired by a type of music, as described by designers junior human-computer interaction and design double major Aya Demler and junior mechanical engineering and robotics double major Rick Shanor. They explained that they utilized inspiration from the stages of electronic dance music, concerts to create their looks. The models strode onto the stage wearing designs reminiscent of Transformers, featuring geometric shapes that lit up to the beat of the music. Fourth-year architecture major Vishaal Dokras’s line “Vagoba” followed. The line was a modern take on the British invasion of India. Junior design majors Susan Park and Jane Yoon’s “Avalokita” came next. This line was inspired by a Buddhist god. The repetition in patterns and contrast in layers made “Avalokita” visually appealing. Most memorable was the moment when the models all stood at the edge of the stage and bowed to the audience.
The show ended with “Spectral Discord,” another line that focused on pattern repetition, though in this case the designer, junior design major Rachel Ciavarella, stated in the magzine that she drew her inspiration from “excessive media exposure.” There was then an atmosphere of celebration as all the people involved in Lunar Gala strode out onto the stage and were greeted by wild applause from the audience for their hard work and dedication to the show. Lunar Gala is a spectacle that every Carnegie Mellon student must experience at least once in his or her years here..

2014-02-24,CMU,India,"“I’m Andrew Jackson, I’m your president, let’s blow the roof off!” (Cue intense rock music.)
Take one glance at a musical’s poster promising “sex, democracy amd rock and roll,” and you instantly know this play doesn’t take itself too seriously. The Pittsburgh Playhouse production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, an unorthodox play that briefly ran on Broadway, premiered at the Point Park University’s Rockwell Theatre on Friday.
The idea behind the musical is as far-fetched as it gets. The musical re-imagines seventh president Andrew Jackson as an emo rock star. The plot loosely follows Jackson’s rise to the presidency, with plenty of live rock solos and over-the-top dance acts in between. However, the musical is not for the faint of heart or for younger audiences. Every scene is chock full of swearing, sexual innuendos, and concert-level lighting. Some jokes rely heavily on racial stereotype as well. For those who aren’t overly sensitive to such elements, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is a roller coaster of a musical full of energy.
The play features a huge cast of characters. It’s easy to forget who’s who, especially if you lack a basic historical understanding of Andrew Jackson’s life. There are two prominent characters that stand out the most — Andrew Jackson himself (Reed Worth) and his wife Rachel Donelson (Brittany Dorazio). Both have strong singing voices that suit hard rock and emotion-laden moments. Most of the actors are local theatre students from Point Park University with the exception of seventh grader Dom Masciola, who plays Jackson’s adopted son Lyncoya.
A historically accurate timeline of Jackson’s life is included in each playbook, which lets the audience compare what they see on stage against the actual events. Jokes are taken to the extreme, with varying results. For instance, when Jackson swears vengeance on the Native Americans for killing his family, a crew of scantily clad men dressed in stereotypical garb dance to the “Sugar Plum Fairy” song. In another case, Jackson and Rachel cover each other with blood in some strange ritual of professing their love for each other.
Although it is obvious that the play takes itself very lightly and that these moments are for quick laughs, such moments could be unpopular with the wrong crowd. But here and there, tasteful history jokes are mixed in with pop culture references. Jackson uses an iPad for Indian treaties, complete with Siri. Jackson’s political campaign is turned into a rock tour, featuring the band “Andrew Jackson and the Populists.” At one point, Jackson unforgettably says to Rachel, “Sometimes when I’m on the battlefield suffering from dysentery and diarrhea, I think of you” in order to prove his love to her. 
There are ample jokes poking fun at slavery, diseases, and the practice of bleeding out. The play could benefit from having more of these moments, as they are entertaining for both history fans and the general audience.
The second half of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson — which focuses on Jackson’s struggles as the President — is considerably less crazy than the first. The jokes aren’t as offensive, and character struggles and moral issues become the focus, leading to a surprisingly somber ending to the play.
The set itself is impressive, accurately resembling a concert bar. But the set can sometimes distract from moments of the play that are supposed to occur at a battlefield since the set is never changed until the second half of the play. Lighting is also notably well done for the small production. At exciting moments, colored lights flash as a fog machine churns along. However, minor microphone issues did interfere with the overall flow of songs and dramatic plot points.
For the right crowd, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is an exciting musical sensation that’s rough around the edges. But it could easily offend, so those with strong opinions about the subject matter should steer clear. The play will be showing until March 2. Tickets start at $18 or $20, depending on the day of the performance..

2014-03-03,CMU,India,"As Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once said, “Music is the universal language of mankind.” This Saturday, Mar. 1, 64 musicians from across the globe were united through a virtual concert that was broadcast in Rashid Auditorium in the Gates Center.
Roger Dannenberg, professor of computer science, art, and music at Carnegie Mellon, was the “semiconductor” of the group, which is called the Global Network Orchestra and featured musicians from North America and Europe, as well as from New Zealand, Malaysia, Iceland, India, Turkey, and Australia. The universal musicians used their laptops to simultaneously perform together while Dannenberg conducted the group virtually from the Ammerman Center at Connecticut College.
Dannenberg emphasized in his opening statement that the Global Network Orchestra embodies the idea that everyone around the world is connected: “It helps us realize we are all brothers and sisters, no matter how far away or seemingly different we might be.”
But how could 64 musicians from around the world be synced together, especially with the amount of precision needed to perform in a concert together?
“There are several things that all have to work: cross-platform software, simple user interfaces, and low-latency robust networking,” Dannenberg said in an email. Streaming would be far too inefficient, so Dannenberg and Tom Neuendorffer — co-creator of the project and a principal engineer at Carnegie Speech, a developer of software for assessing and teaching spoken language skills — created a system which allowed the musicians to transmit audio information in a way that uses much less bandwidth than streaming.
Dannenberg explained that instead of having each musician send and receive streams of audio, which would take an enormous amount of bandwidth, the audio generated by each musician is decomposed into a pitch and a loudness, which only takes a few bytes.
“Each player receives the pitch and loudness information from every other player and reconstructs the audio with a local synthesizer, saving the need to transmit or receive streams of audio,” Dannenberg said. “The synthesis is based on samples that are shared and downloaded by all the performers before the concert.”
“Another challenge, which is more musical than technical, is the speed of light. The delays impose some limits on how well you can synchronize, and therefore influence what kinds of music it makes sense to perform,” Dannenberg said.The pieces performed are as follows: “Prayer for Peace,” which was composed by Dannenberg himself; “Grant Us Peace,” a Bach chorale from BWV 42; “Riffs and Drums,” a conducted improvisation led by Dannenberg; and finally, “Dona Nobis Pacem.”
Janelle Burdell, a professional drummer and percussionist, performed live in the Rashid Auditorium as the featured musician of “Riffs and Drums.” Two other renowned musicians who performed as part of the Global Network Orchestra include Pauline Oliveros, a well-known American composer, and Scot Gresham-Lancaster, a pioneer of networked and telematics music.
As with all performances, the Global Network Orchestra faced a few technical difficulties. For example, there were supposed to be 100 musicians total, but due to network connection issues, only 64 musicians participated. As Dannenberg joked at the end of the performance, though, “64 is 100 in base 8!”
While the idea of a virtual orchestra is still novel, the Global Network Orchestra’s performance confirms that it is not only entirely possible, but is a concept that may continue to grow in the future..

2014-03-24,CMU,India,"On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon women’s swimming and diving team finished off their season at the 2014 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana. Collectively, the team placed 39th overall at the meet.
Senior Soleil Phan finished her collegiate career on a high note, swimming a season-best 52.58 seconds in the 100-yard freestyle on the way to a 27th place finish. Phan also teamed up for a 26th place finish in the 400-yard freestyle relay with senior Megan Garvey, sophomore Felicia Wang, and first-year Gillian Crews. The four women combined for a time of 3:35.05.
Wang was another top individual performer placing 17th in the 100 meter breaststroke, setting a school record and narrowly missing out on a finals spot.
The top performers for the Tartans were the 200- and 400-meter medley relay teams which both set school records and earned honorary All-American titles in the process.

2014-03-24,CMU,India,"Coming off a spectacular February in which they went 9–1, only losing to the Utah Jazz, expectations were high for the Miami Heat and superstar small forward LeBron James for the month of March. Last year, March was a good month for the Heat, who were in the middle of their 27-game win streak. This streak helped them get the No. 1 overall seed and home court advantage throughout the playoffs. 
However, the performance drop-off seen from the entire team over the course of the last 10 games has been shocking and has seen them fall three games behind the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference. They have gone 4–6 over that stretch while giving up an average of 102.6 PPG, a number unusually high for this team’s stingy defense. What has suddenly gone so wrong for the Heat?
The most obvious and important reason for this sudden drop in performance is the drastic failure in James’s performance since the team’s 107–124 loss against the Charlotte Bobcats on March 3. Over the next three games, James did not reach even 20 points and made only three jump shots. He has not been himself since that game, and with the exception of wins against the Washington Huskies and Cleveland Cavaliers, has shot nowhere near his season average of 57 percent.
It doesn’t help that one of the best defensive players in the game isn’t playing anywhere near his capability on that end. There were several defensive rotations where James seemed lost and did not track his man down — definitely not the way to re-establish himself in the MVP race considering fellow small forward and MVP rival Kevin Durant is in the midst of a 33-game streak of 25 or more points.
Another factor working against the Heat is the presence of too many talented yet underperforming role players. Shooting guard Ray Allen, one of the greatest shooters in NBA history, has been in a season-long slump and is having his worst shooting season statistically. He’s had nowhere near the impact he had on the Heat’s title charge last season. The same goes for small forward Shane Battier. More often than not, Battier has been played on larger power forwards for purely defensive purposes. 0–5 shooting nights aren’t rare anymore; in fact, they’re becoming the norm. The Heat need their two premier perimeter shooters to be on top form to beat the Pacers or any possible contender in the loaded Western Conference. The likes of small forward Michael Beasley and center Greg Oden were supposed to be low-risk, high-reward moves, but both of them have been more of liabilities and have only displayed fleeting moments to showcase the talent they truly possess.
The inconsistent play of the Heat’s other two superstars, forward-center Chris Bosh and guard Dwyane Wade, has also exacerbated the Heat’s situation. Wade looked to be in prime form until this recent stretch and it looked like he would be in optimal shape for the playoffs, but concerns about his knee are resurfacing, and he sat out on one night of back-to-backs again. Bosh had been on a hot streak recently, but his poor defense and lack of menacing presence in the paint or rim protection hurt the Heat against the likes of the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets and the Denver Nuggets, who all exploited the freedom in the paint. 
The Big Three — Bosh, James, and Wade — came together so at least one of them could pick up the slack when other members were going through a slump, but when none of them are clicking, the Heat are in trouble.
Some of coach Eric Spoelstra’s decision-making has also been questionable. The Heat have not used previously key rotation players power forward Udonis Haslem and small forward Rashard Lewis at all during this stretch, which was evident in the recent loss against the Boston Celtics. 
The Heat have also been poor at holding onto large leads. They had double-digit leads in the games against the Celtics and Bulls, both of which they eventually lost.
The Heat haven’t had this bad a stretch since March 2011 when the Big Three were in their first season together. It’s been a similar story this time around. 
Teams like the Brooklyn Nets, Chicago Bulls, and of course, the Pacers are going to pose stern challenges in their conference and any of the West’s top eight teams would present a more than formidable challenge. If the Heat want their coveted three-peat, they need to get their act together and do it soon..

2014-03-24,CMU,India,"Fairfax Apartments
Location: 4616 Fifth Ave., near the corner of Fifth Avenue and Craig Street
Styles of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (two students) and efficiency (two students); the Fairfax Annex has two-bedroom apartments (three students)
Size: 272 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency
Lounges: Community room in basement with limited availability
Other amenities: Laundry room and aerobics room in the basement
The Fairfax Apartments are an excellent transition for upperclassmen to living in off-campus housing. Once acquainted with back-alley shortcuts, it’s a quick 10-to-15-minute walk to campus, and the building’s proximity to S. Craig Street, which houses many restaurants that are open late at night, make it appealing to many college students. 
Inside the individual apartments, every room is carpeted, except for the kitchen and bathroom, which have tiling. The walls, conveniently, are solid — a welcome change from the paper-thin dividers that separate rooms in some on-campus housing. Fairfax is also relatively quiet, although every now and then, a group of happy, shouting people may break the silence. The rooms are furnished and come prepared with beds, tables, and drawers. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator. Some units even have dishwashers. Air conditioning and heating are included, as well.
Bus stops for the 54C, 71 series, and 75 are also located close to the building’s doors. 
Laundry payment may be the largest problem students have with Fairfax. Doing laundry requires that students first buy a $5 card to pay for the machines. The card does not actually come with $5; students must input money manually, and the machine accepts only bills. 
In addition, Fairfax’s Internet connection uses Comcast rather than Carnegie Mellon’s Internet. Finally, the cost of living is one of the highest at Carnegie Mellon, but Fairfax’s amenities and its location may justify some of those expenses.
Doherty Apartments
Location: On the corner of Forbes Avenue and Beeler Street
Styles of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (three students) and efficiencies (two students); a two-bedroom suite for special-interest housing
Size: About 150 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency
Lounges: Study lounge, TV lounge
Other amenities: Lounges include a piano, pool table, and ping-pong table; laundry facilities include six washers and six dryers; exercise facilities include four cardio machines and dumbbells. 
Located close to campus facilities, Doherty Apartments is a good option for on-campus housing. It is a three-minute walk to the Resnik Café and 10 minutes from most classes. Doherty is a solid option for students who wish to have their own kitchen in an autonomous apartment style of living.
Doherty is divided into four separate towers, each headed by its own RA, who provides his or her residents with essentials: trash bags, paper towels, and, of course, toilet paper. Each tower consists of three floors and a basement.
As a community, there are weekly events to satisfy your sweet tooth and appropriate exercise programs to sweat off the day’s regret. However, due primarily to the tower layout of the building, making friends in Doherty can be more difficult than in other housing options. 
Doherty Apartments provides air conditioning only in its exercise room. However, the heating system was upgraded recently.
The rooms provide a mix of privacy and integration with roommates. The one-bedroom triples include a bedroom for the three beds, a bathroom, and a living room with a kitchenette. The living room also has three study desks, a dining table, a couch, and a small loveseat. Two-person efficiencies are similar, though everything is located in a single room without some of the furniture.
Doherty Apartments provides a decently-sized living area for those who seek autonomy in college life.

Location: On Margaret Morrison Street, beside the Greek apartments
Styles of housing: Apartments — two-floor, two-bedroom (four students)
Size: 80 students

Kitchens: In each apartment
Lounges: One near the storefronts
Margaret Morrison Apartments, located on the Hill, offers residents on-campus apartments. Each unit has two floors, with a lounge and kitchen on the first floor and bedrooms and bathrooms either up or down a floor, depending on the apartment. All of the “Maggie Mo” apartments were redone in 2007, when they were refitted with new furniture, appliances, and countertops.
The bedrooms are some of the biggest that you will find on campus. Each apartment has a kitchen, which is nice for upperclassmen tired of campus food.
Additionally, each of the apartment units is separate from the others.Residents also have access to laundry and exercise facilities, which are on the street level of Margaret Morrison Street.
Starting next academic year, Margaret Morrison apartments 131 and 132 will be a 16-person “Sustainability House” which is accepting applications for residents.
Although the common areas may be a bit tight, “Maggie Mo” can offer residents the chance to have independence while still living on campus.
McGill House
Location: The Hill — across the courtyard from Boss, in front of Hamerschlag
Styles of housing: Prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 71 residents (female only)
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One on the first floor
Lounges: One per floor, and one main lounge on the first floor with a study lounge
Other amenities: Laundry room
McGill, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-female dorm, offers residents prime doubles and singles arranged into suites. Each suite connects two doubles, or two doubles and one single. Rooms in McGill are small, so residents are often forced to loft their beds. However, the size of the rooms is offset by the convenience of semiprivate bathrooms in each suite.
McGill may be one of the smaller dorms, but residents’ social lives are certainly not limited. McGill offers a friendly environment, especially since residents can socialize in any of the individual floor lounges or in the large first-floor television room and study area. 
Weekly events bring together residents from both Boss and McGill and offer a reliable dose of fun and entertainment. Also, if residents tire of their own building, they are just a few steps away from other Hill residences.
McGill’s location on Margaret Morrison Street, like the other Hill residences, make it exceptionally convenient to a number of locations. Residents can catch art exhibitions, shows, and events at The Frame, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run art gallery on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street.
A short walk across the street, residents can take advantage of the nearby campus dining locations, including Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and the Zebra Lounge. When campus food gets too monotonous, the food trucks parked nearby offer a great alternative to on-campus dining.

Lounges: Two lounges per floor
Other amenities: TV room, quiet study lounge, computer cluster, workout facility, recreation room, and two laundry facilities at opposite ends of the building
While students of most residences have to pull on their shoes and head to campus to find a hot meal or a working printer, Morewood Gardens residents need not leave the premises. Fully equipped with a computer cluster, a source of convenient (albeit greasy) food at The Underground, large laundry rooms, and a gym, this dorm is completely self-sufficient. And what’s more, it’s smack at the corner of Morewood and Forbes Avenues, only a couple of steps away from campus.
The dorm’s proximity to campus gives it a significant edge over other residential areas. This factor maximizes your sleep time before early classes and also allows you to sprint back for your homework when you realize you’ve left it in your room. 
While both Stever and Mudge houses are located on Morewood Avenue, they normally house only first-year students, making Morewood the only choice for older students who want to live in this area.
Morewood’s plentiful lounges, including a few on each floor in addition to the larger study rooms and TV lounge on the first floor, allow for frequent group gatherings. While this is a positive attribute for more social students, it means that several rooms on each floor are likely to experience frequent noise disturbances throughout the day and night.
When choosing a room in Morewood, it’s hit-or-miss. Some rooms are spacious and quiet, while others are small and loud. It’s the luck of the draw, and sometimes you lose. Try to plan out which rooms look best from the floor plans online, and try to visit a room before committing. This will give you a good idea of what you’re getting.
Morewood Gardens could be a great place to live, but before deciding to move in, check out the rooms ahead of time and ask the current residents about the noise situation, as some rooms are better than others.
Neville Apartments
Location: 617 Neville St., at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Neville Street
Styles of housing: Apartments (six-occupant apartment with single and double bedrooms)
Size: 24 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment
Lounges: One common basement, four living rooms
The Neville Apartments are a living community through the Carnegie Mellon housing system, comprised of eight apartments that feature a mix of double and single bedrooms. Previously a co-op, Neville is now a traditional apartment living situation.
Neville apartments contains fully furnished bedrooms and living spaces, with each of the four apartments containing two bathrooms. Additionally, each apartment has a mix of single and double rooms, as well as two kitchens containing a stove and refrigerator. The basement contains laundry facilities and a student lounge, and students will have to purchase their Internet service from Comcast.
This switch back to apartment-styled housing is a new shift, as Neville had been run as a housing co-op since 2003. The co-op was created based on the tenets of sustainability and environmental awareness, activism, and equality in race, gender, and sexuality.
Residents who had applied for admission were encouraged to participate in various events hosted by the current members of the co-op during the room selection period. 
Neville Apartments will not be application-based housing, but can be selected through the standard university housing selection process.
During its time as a co-op, Neville had no RAs, instead using liaisons to the Housing and Student Life offices who would help the co-op solve housing problems. However, with the transition to apartments, this is unlikely to remain the case, as current Carnegie Mellon-affiliated apartments make use of the RA system.
What kind of community Neville will have after its co-op days has yet to be seen, but the building and space will remain the same as it was.
Roselawn Houses
Location: Roselawn Terrace (off Margaret Morrison Street)
Styles of housing: Three-bedroom houses (one single, two doubles)
Size: Five students in each of 12 houses
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each house
Lounges: One in the common Margaret Morrison space and a living space in each house
The Roselawn Terrace houses, located off Margaret Morrison Street, are some of the most sought-after housing options on campus. Roselawn is located on the edge of campus, providing students with a feeling of independence while still only having to walk less than 10 minutes to get to class. 
Each house, divided into a single-occupancy room and two double-occupancy rooms, holds five students. The bedrooms are quite small — so small, in fact, that one of the doubles can’t hold both residents’ desks. The upside to this is that the living area on the first floor is spacious.
Living rooms have hardwood floors and comfortable furniture. Each dining room has a large table that seats six by a wall of windows. Kitchens have been completely refinished with new cabinets and appliances. All the walls in the houses have been given a fresh coat of paint with vibrant accent colors.
One downside to the Roselawn houses is that residents no longer have access to the basement, cutting down on the storage space previously offered. The rooms also have closets that tend to be too small for most people’s wardrobes. 
In addition to the large living spaces offered in Roselawn, residents have access to the Margaret Morrison lounge and exercise room. All Roselawn residents are also on the campus laundry network, getting free laundry and access to laundromat-style dryers.
Another good thing about Roselawn houses is that, while there is more than enough living space, the cost of living in the house is less than the cost of living in some Oakland apartments.
Roselawn houses offer the feeling of living on your own, while still providing residents with the amenities and assistance of campus housing. If you don’t care about the size of your bedroom, Roselawn is the place to live.
Shady Oak Apartments
Location: 601 Clyde Street
Styles of housing: Apartments — efficiency (two students), two- and three-bedroom 
apartments (three students)
Size: 82 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each apartment and one in the basement
Lounges: One in the basement with multiple couches and a big-screen TV
Other amenities: Street parking available and a spacious backyard with a grill
Shady Oak, located on Clyde Street, contains apartments each boast a full kitchen complete with an electric stove and oven, as well as a dishwasher. The layouts vary greatly from apartment to apartment, with some having single bedrooms and no common living space, others having shared bedrooms with spacious living rooms, and others having a combination of the two. 
There is a lounge in the basement with numerous couches and a big-screen TV; this space is commonly used for watching sporting events and hosting study groups. Basic gym equipment is also located in the basement. For students who want to keep an active lifestyle and don’t get enough of a workout from the 10-minute walk to campus, there are multiple treadmills, an elliptical trainer, and a weight-lifting station. 
The basement is also home to four washers and four dryers — not on the campus laundry network and accepting only quarters — and a large table for folding laundry.
Venture outside to find a picnic table and charcoal grill that is always available. The backyard is large enough to play a game of Frisbee or football with friends. Across the street, there is a bus stop for the 71C, which can be taken to Downtown to watch a show or to East Liberty for a date at Target.
There are some drawbacks to living in Shady Oak. The plumbing has a tendency to malfunction, sometimes causing pipes to burst, leading to water shut-offs. The radiators have also been a cause for concern: They are set on a building-wide timer that can sometimes shut off in the middle of the night or be set on full blast on warmer days.
Woodlawn Apartments
Location: At the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street
Styles of housing: Apartment — one-bedroom (two students), two-bedroom (four students), and four-bedroom (seven students)
Size: 35 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One or two full kitchens per apartment
Lounges: TV lounge and exercise room, shared with Margaret Morrison Apartments
Other amenities: Two washers and two dryers are in the basement. The Frame, a small student-run art gallery, is also located on the first floor.
Woodlawn Apartments may be one of the older housing options on campus, but it is convenient for walking to class, and it’s right on the Forbes Avenue bus routes that can take you anywhere else that you’d like to go.
The bedrooms and living rooms both boast plenty of space, a definite upgrade for those used to sharing cramped quarters. Some rooms have hardwood floors; others have thin carpeting. The building will be undergoing renovations this summer to upgrade the wiring and fixtures in addition to installing brand-new bathrooms.
Several times per semester, The Frame art gallery, which is housed in the first floor of the apartment building, has loud parties that can be heard throughout the building. 
Woodlawn Apartments is great if you want to live with a big group of friends, since each apartment houses a lot of people. Woodlawn is also a good choice if you want a small community and are looking to live in an apartment on campus.
West Wing/Resnik House
Location: Adjacent to Gesling Stadium, next to the University Center
Styles of housing: Suite — typically five students share a common living space and bathroom
Dorm — prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 296 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: Two in West Wing, two in Resnik
Lounges: West Wing all floors, Resnik all floors
Resnik and West Wing are the ideal dormitory choices for students who aren’t ready — or aren’t willing — to move off campus but want a bit more of a grown-up place to live in than a typical dorm. While students in these dorms have the chance to be more independent, they also boast a quick walk to any of the academic buildings on campus, a definite benefit for those mornings when you just can’t stop hitting the snooze button.
Both dorms consist primarily of suites, which are made up of two doubles and a single with a common bathroom and lounge for the suite. A limited number of prime singles and doubles do exist in the buildings as well, though they are not as well known.
Resnik and West Wing are optimal for a group of friends who wish to live together but want to maintain their proximity to campus and the other advantages — like free toilet paper and a once-a-week bathroom cleaning — that living on campus offers. Students mostly stay inside their suites, leaving the hallways relatively quiet. The lounges do fill up, however — usually with groups of students either working on homework or playing video games.
Both buildings offer kitchens on certain floors, which is nice when you’ve had your fill of The Exchange and El Gallo de Oro. If you don’t feel like cooking, Resnik is home to a number of dining options. There is the Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and Resnik Café. In particular, Resnik Café offers a variety of choices, including sushi, Indian cuisine, and comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous amenities that Resnik and West Wing offer, it is not surprising that both of these dorms fill up early in the room selection process. Hopeful residents are advised to find a friend who can pull them in.
Webster Hall/Shirley Apartments
Location: 101/103 N. Dithridge St.
Styles of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (two students) and two-bedroom (three students); prime singles
Size: 273 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each apartment
Lounges: None, but each apartment has a living area
Other amenities: TV room, quiet study lounge, workout facility, recreation room, and two laundry facilities at opposite ends of the building
Webster Hall, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and North Dithridge Street, is a popular off-campus residence offered by Carnegie Mellon. Webster is located in the heart of Oakland, about a 10-minute walk from campus. One of the first stops on the Carnegie Mellon shuttle line, Webster offers easy access to the numerous restaurants, cafés, convenience stores, and shops located in the Oakland area.
Carnegie Mellon rents out one-bedroom apartments to two students, and two-bedroom apartments to three students. The apartments are spacious and offer many benefits that dorm rooms do not, including a fully-furnished living room, two bathrooms, and a kitchen. For many students, this escape from typical dorm life is the basis of Webster’s appeal.
In addition to the spacious apartments, students also benefit from the facilities offered by Webster. The building contains a gym, a homestyle deli, and even an in-house hair and waxing salon. Additionally, each floor has a trash-disposal facility and a laundry room.
There are, however, some small disadvantages. The laundry facilities can become a hassle for many residents. Using the facilities can become expensive, with a cost of $2.50 to wash and dry one load of clothes. The dryers on most floors are not fully functional, often requiring two full runs to completely dry clothes. For many students, this is one of the biggest complaints about Webster.
An additional point for consideration is the price. Renting apartments in Webster can be costly, but like Fairfax Apartments, its location and perks may justify the price.
Shirley Apartments, located next door to Webster Hall, contains a floor plan similar to Webster’s floor plan. Each apartment has a bedroom, a living area, and a kitchen, while the efficiencies are essentially rooms with a bathroom and a kitchen. One downside of Shirley, however, is that it is one of the farthest living spaces from campus. 
Welch House/Henderson House
Location: Behind Scobell House, on Margaret Morrison Street
Styles of housing: Prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 83 residents
Room retention: Yes, except for non-single rooms on the first floor
Kitchens: One on the lower level in each building
Lounges: TV lounges and study areas in both buildings
As one of the more recently renovated student dorms on campus, Henderson House is a clean and quiet place to live. This dorm offers students air conditioning and heating, connected bathrooms — which are cleaned once a week — shared with one other room, and the intimacy of a small building, with 20 rooms per floor. The first floor is generally reserved for first-years only. 
Accepting residents by application only, Henderson along with McGill are considered “Wellness Houses,” because they promote green practices, maintain a substance-free lifestyle, and generally encourage healthy living. Each student who lives here is expected to sign an agreement promising to adhere to these standards during the school year. Students can also take advantage of playing for the house’s intramural teams or participating in weekly optional community activities set up by the resident assistants. Tickets to special events like plays or shows are subsidized by the dorm, which is a nice perk. 
Henderson, although placed on the outskirts of Carnegie Mellon, is sheltered from any traffic or noise from campus. The dorm’s residents also respect an unwritten policy of peace and quiet, which makes this dorm ideal for studying. 
Despite all Henderson has to offer students, there are drawbacks. Dorm rooms are not the largest, and on occasion the heating will malfunction, overheating many of the rooms.
Welch is one of the Hill houses, but it distinguishes itself by having a 24-hour quiet rule. This often means that Welch attracts students who prefer to keep to themselves and are less interested in creating a community atmosphere. However, the atmosphere seems to suit students who want a comfortable home and don’t want to be distracted by noise. The rooms are large and bathrooms are spacious. .

2014-03-24,CMU,India,"As of last Thursday, the eighth annual Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is officially in full swing. Under this year’s theme of “Faces of Work,” the festival features a number of films from around the globe that all focus on workers and, often, their struggle for a better life. The festival, which began last Thursday night with a screening of the Polish film Walesa. Man of Hope and held its campus premiere on Friday with a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, will continue through April 5. Most screenings will take place in McConomy Auditorium.
The festival’s theme is in dedication to the life and work of influential Carnegie Mellon professor Paul Goodman, who passed away due to a stroke in early 2012. At Carnegie Mellon, Goodman pushed to expand international university projects in technological and environmental research, especially in developing countries in Asia and South America. 
According to the festival’s website, Goodman was an avid filmmaker who produced over 20 documentaries demonstrating “how global development and technological expansion are changing the nature of workplace demographics and methods of production” by highlighting the “important but often overlooked work of individuals such as a nurse, a factory worker, a glass blower, a fisherman, and a women’s rowing team.” Several of his works will be screened along with other films over the course of the festival — including Shipbreakers, for which Goodman posthumously won the Best Producer of Documentary Film Award at the 2014 Madrid International Film Festival.
Opening night Thursday at the Regent Square Theater included the screening Walesa. Man of Hope, directed by Andrzej Wajda. The film tells the true story of Lech Walesa, a common shipyard electrician who becomes embroiled in the workers’ rights movement of Poland, eventually becoming the leader of the Polish trade union, Solidarity. In this position, Walesa was able to negotiate significant concessions for workers from the communist regime. Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his efforts and was elected the first president of Poland following its independence in 1989. 
The world of Walesa. Man of Hope is a vivid nightmare: a Soviet-bloc country where the police beat and arrest citizens on the flimsiest suspicion and tanks roll through the streets. Indeed, when Walesa leaves home, he often hands his wife his watch and wedding band and instructs her to sell them if he doesn’t come back. Interspersed with documentary footage of the actual Polish riots and demonstrations that took place over the course of the 1970s, the film is a compelling narrative, focusing on Walesa as both an unlikely political leader — his talents for leadership coming not from books, but, as he says in the film, from ”knowledge of Poland and its people” — as well as a family man who struggles to provide for both the monetary and emotional welfare of his wife, Danuta, and their six children even when he is being paraded through the streets as a hero. Danuta Walesa was in attendance at the screening.
The film’s handling of Walesa’s private life occasionally slips into a whitewashing of the beloved figure — frequent verbal hints at the man’s dirty secrets or ill treatment of his wife are never explored — and the toll his efforts have on his family, especially Danuta, are given a very surface-level treatment. The depiction of the public Walesa, however, is where the film soars. One can’t help but feel moved watching him lead the workers’ strikes. Walesa truly was a natural-born leader, and the film perfectly captures that aspect of the man.
Before the film, Danuta Walesa gave a brief introduction of the film, in which she stated that “[the film] is more a creation of the director than a documentary ... in which you will be able to see the people struggling for their freedom.” She also addressed what was surely on everyone’s mind: the obvious relation between the political struggle in Poland depicted in the film and the current bloody revolution and ensuing political battles in another former Soviet nation, Ukraine. In a brief Q&A session after the film, Danuta Walesa fielded many questions regarding her husband’s life and legacy and how it has shaped many of the recent protests against totalitarian governments. In response to an audience member who asked if there was a moment that she realized the Solidarity movement was big, she responded that she was “only just coming to realize” how big it was.
The festival’s campus opening night on Friday featured a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, directed by Ralph Vituccio, an instructor in the Entertainment Technology Center, and produced by Paul Goodman. The film focuses on Indian migrant workers who dismantle decommissioned ships along the beaches of Alang, highlighting the terrible conditions in which the impoverished men perform this dangerous job. A panel discussion was held afterward with Vituccio, Shipbreakers cinematographer Tom Clancey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette assistant managing editor Mark Roth, and University of Pittsburgh professor of political science Michael Goodhart. University of Pittsburgh professor of global studies Roger Rouse served as moderator.
Keeping with the festival’s theme, Shipbreakers details an industry that requires virtually no electric power, but runs almost exclusively on manual labor. Much of the work is performed using brute force — there are many instances of a hammer and chisel being put to work against steel and iron — and the lax enforcement of workers’ rights and environmental regulations makes the occupation a virtual death sentence. While Alang is not the only site of this industry, virtually all privately-owned ships are dismantled in similar shipyards in developing countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan.
During the panel, Vituccio said that “many workers were reluctant to talk to us” due to the risks involved with publicly denouncing the shipyards. Therefore, he said, each worker who did speak had “incredible courage” in basically putting his life on the line by speaking to “people he’d never see again.”
The stories these workers tell are harrowing, to say the least. Among tales of men being crushed to death by falling steel, many of the workers complain of the smoke they are forced to breathe due to the lack of proper masks. Workers are largely unaware of the kinds of toxins to which they are exposed — many of them have been outlawed since the 1970s, but are still present in the ships being dismantled. Interviews with workers and managers reveal a large disparity in how the situation is viewed. One shipyard manager even insisted that because there were trees growing outside his office, that meant there was no environmental problems. “Greenery means no pollution,” is how he put it. 
The conditions in Alang are contrasted with the same industry being performed in Brownsville, Texas, where Mexican migrant workers dismantle U.S. government-owned ships according to strict environmental and safety standards. A chilling visual compared the workers in India wearing a simple cloth tied around their faces while workers in Texas performed the same task wearing a complete Hazmat suit and mask. 
While the film made a good case that the practice of ship recycling should follow the strict regulations followed in the United States, Clancey pointed out in the panel that the wages paid were “high for Mexico, but are extremely low by U.S. standards.” He also mentioned that ships are only dismantled in such a highly regulated fashion in Texas because they are owned by the U.S. government and, therefore, have to be dismantled in that manner according to EPA regulations. They are forbidden from being sold to private shipyards in developing countries.
The two films featured in the opening of “Faces of Work” are signs of good things to come in the festival. One thing is certain: Both films leave one with a greater appreciation of working conditions in the United States. After witnessing men beaten to within inches of death for protesting for their right to collective bargaining, or a man working nearly 20-hour days breathing in hazardous chemicals, recent protests over the wages of McDonald’s workers certainly lose some fire. While certainly present, this effect, however, isn’t the point of “Faces of Work.” Indeed, many Americans were in similar situations during our own Industrial Revolution. As Vituccio explained in his introduction to Shipbreakers, the goal of the film was to “focus on the burden of the common worker,” whether that be a dockyard worker in China or a gas station attendant in New Jersey. The films of “Faces of Work” demonstrate the past, present, and future struggles of men and women all around the world; celebrating their successes as well as mourning the losses felt along the way. 
“Faces of Work” will be hosting screenings through April 5. More information can be found at cmu.edu/faces.

2014-03-24,CMU,India,"Elena Karras
Junior chemical engineering major Elena Karras is running for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) on a platform of creating more transparency in the funding process. Karras said she aims to create transparency through open metric meetings, office hours, and better-educated JFC representatives.
Karras said she would like to host an open metric meeting at the beginning of the year so that organizations can voice their opinions about what metrics the JFC should use to fund organizations, and to answer questions about the metrics. Typical metrics include travel, food, and lodging, among others. “It’s sort of a way to hear the voices of the people who are involved in the process,” Karras said about the potential meeting.
To keep lines of communication open between the SBVPF and student organizations, Karras’s platform includes expanding the office hours that current SBVPF Jalen Poteat held this academic year. 
Karras said she would hold the office hours all year, with increased hours during the budget submission period. “I also want to make sure that [organizations] feel comfortable coming to me with any questions that they have,” Karras said. According to Karras, organizations are often unaware of all of their options for funding, what they can do with their money, and the funding process itself.
Karras said she would release JFC applications during the summer and choose representatives at the beginning of the academic year in order to train them extensively on the entire budget process. 
“It’s really important to choose [representatives] early and make sure they’re clear on what the funding avenues are — not just the JFC process — but the funding process as a whole,” Karras said. She wants representatives to be comprehensive resources for their organizations.
According to her platform, Karras would also strengthen collaboration with the student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO) to ensure that she and the SBVPO are both in agreement “in terms of where organizations are and what organizations need.”
Karras has been a member of Student Senate and the JFC for two semesters, where she has guided organizations through the funding process as a representative. She has gone through the funding process as the treasurer for College Democrats too. She is also a part of the Internal Development Committee, which educates Senators about recent happenings and brings them together as a cohesive body, according to Karras.
Karras is a lighting tech area head for Scotch’n’Soda, vice president of membership development and programming for Panhellenic, a sister of Alpha Chi Omega, president of College Democrats, and a general member of AB Tech, Spring Carnival Committee, and Carnegie Tech Radio Club.
Karras took an unusual road to becoming involved in Student Senate. 
She was originally a write-in candidate for the Carnegie Institute of Technology after her friends voted for her. 
A write-in candidate is not printed on the ballot, but can be handwritten onto it by voters. 
“I stuck with it because I realized it was something that I thought was very important because you need people who are passionate about serving our campus and who care that ... all organizations are being served to the best of their ability,” Karras said.
Fun Facts: 
Karras can solve a Rubik’s cube in under two minutes.
Karras has beaten Doge2048.
Matthew Greenberg 
Junior economics major Matthew Greenberg is running for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) on a platform of making the budgeting process more efficient through a two-step plan.
As SBVPF, Greenberg would first implement a key performance indicator (KPI) to evaluate the impact that an organization has on the campus community, according to his platform. 
Greenberg said the KPI would be indicative of the organization’s performance during the current and previous academic year. 
At present, organizations are evaluated by the JFC during the budgeting process mainly by their performance in the previous academic year and the word of organization members.
“The biggest problem with the funding committee as of right now is that you can’t judge an organization on what they’re doing this year and how they’re improving or not improving,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg said he would require JFC representatives to go to the biggest events — and possibly a few minor ones — for organizations that they represent, in order to more directly see the impact the organizations have on the campus during the current year.
Greenberg is also proposing to reform the JFC representative selection process so there are two selection periods — one in the spring and one in the fall. 
According to his platform, Greenberg would establish an early-decision type process to choose JFC representatives. 
During the spring, “[Representatives] who have a good reputation and who didn’t do a bad job would have the option to retake their seat the next year,” Greenberg said. Students who were not previously representatives would also be able to apply for positions at the same time, according to Greenberg.
If positions remained open after the spring selection, Greenberg said there would be a fall selection similar to the selection that occurs now. “That way the best [representatives] will still be there, will be trained, and will have the ability to use this KPI to judge performance and to judge impact of the organizations and ... be able to teach the new [representatives] how to do that,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg is the CEO of his own company, Greenberg & Bao Portfolio Strategies, LLC, which identifies market inefficiencies. 
He is a brother of Pi Kappa Alpha and was the chair of the fourth annual Matthew Tembo Memorial Soccer Tournament. According to a university news release, Pi Kappa Alpha hosts this soccer tournament each year to be “a positive force in the prevention, treatment, education, and research of substance abuse and alcoholism.” Greenberg is also a member of the Undergraduate Finance Association.
When asked what he hopes to accomplish for himself through the position, Greenberg said, “I think it will help me to fine-tune my skills both as a CEO and just generally dealing with money on a daily basis.” 
He said that the position would also give him good experience in leading a group of people to develop an efficient budget. Greenberg stressed the influence that the SBVPF has to improve student life. 
“Especially at a school where everyone’s working so hard, it’s important that you get the best quality of life that you can have here ... and the VPF certainly has the ability to impact that,” Greenberg said.
Fun Facts: 
Greenberg been to 18 different countries and all five Disney theme parks, and was in Spain for the World Cup when they won in 2010. 
Greenberg is also a die-hard fan of New York sports teams, especially the Rangers and the Yankees. 
Divya Kothandapani 
Sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani is running for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) on a platform of improving the transparency of the JFC and the advising resources for student organizations.
Kothandapani wrote in an email, “I would like to make [organizations] more aware of the SBVPF and make myself approachable so [organizations] can contact me any time throughout the year if they are confused with how campus finances work and need advice to be successful.”
Kothandapani wrote that the JFC currently only meets at the end of the academic year to determine what the following academic year’s budget will be, but that organizations must manage their budgets themselves throughout the year. 
She wrote that a lack of financial advising resources causes confusion and is a source of debt for many organizations.
She wrote that she would work to engage JFC representatives with organizations to familiarize them with the budgeting process and to understand why certain decisions are made. “The JFC exists to support [organizations] and it wants to help your [organization] succeed,” Kothandapani wrote. 
“I want to create a better, ‘friendlier’ image for this committee so the students are more comfortable and understand the importance of the resources it can provide.” Kothandapani hopes to work closely with the SBVPO to more actively help organizations with fundraising, ideas, support, and promotion.
When asked what she hopes to accomplish for herself in the position, Kothandapani wrote, “By helping [organizations] with something as important as finances, I would be proud of myself for reaching out to help them achieve their success and improving our student activities would make me even more excited to come to school everyday and be a part of this community.”
She wrote that she hopes ot reach the student body even further as SBVPF to help a larger group — over 200 student organizations — to succeed. Kothandapani joined Student Senate during her first year at Carnegie Mellon as a member at large, and later, a CIT senator. 
She has served on the Business Affairs and Finance committees and is now the business affairs chair. She is also involved with the Executive Committee of Student Senate. 
Kothandapani is currently a JFC representative as well, a position which she wrote has helped her learn the pros and cons of the SBVPF position, including the strengths and weaknesses of the current system. The SBVPF chairs the JFC. Kothandapani’s other involvement on campus includes treasurer for Hindu spirituality and culture organization OM, captain of classical Indian dance team Payal, a member of the CIT Community Building Commitee, and a Donner mentor.
Fun Facts: 
Kothandapani loves dancing and has been a part of the bhangra team.
Kothandapani started a classical Indian dance team this year.
Kothandapani used to be shy and reserved when she first came to Carnegie Mellon; now loves making new friends and being 
involved on campus..

2014-03-31,CMU,India,"It’s the end of March, the time of year when there are fewer than 12 games left for each team in the NBA regular season. Playoff seeding is more or less decided, barring any major upsets, and teams have generally settled into a rhythm and developed an identity for the season, one that they will carry through the playoffs. We know who the real contenders are and who the pretenders are. With the conclusion of the season close by, this time is as good as any to hand out the major regular season awards to those who deserve them.
Sixth Man of the Year
Rather than starting with the big ones first like the MVP, we begin from the other side of the popularity spectrum. The Sixth Man of the Year award rewards those players whose contributions coming off the bench have propelled teams forward and significantly improved them. Who is this year’s best sixth man?
Perennial contender and 2010 Sixth Man of the Year Los Angeles Clippers shooting guard Jamal Crawford has made a case again for himself. He is averaging an essential 18.6 PPG for the Clippers and their fast running offense, ensuring that the team always has reliable scoring off the bench. Crawford has unquestionably been the Clippers’ best player and deserves recognition for it.
Another perennial contender and 2008 Sixth Man of the Year, San Antonio Spurs shooting guard Manu Ginóbili is having a renaissance year. Part of the Spurs’ aging Big Three (also including forward-center Tim Duncan and point guard Tony Parker), it was speculated that Ginóbili would retire at the end of last season after having probably the worst season of his career and being upstaged by the likes of Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard in the Spurs’ rotation. He’s back to being himself; despite lower playing time, Ginóbili has been incredibly efficient and keeps rolling on to potentially the best record in the NBA.
A surprise contender from a pleasantly surprising team is Phoenix Suns forward Markieff Morris. Part of a whole roster of improved players, Morris stands out for his contributions from the bench. Along with his twin brother power forward Marcus Morris, Markieff has carried his team’s second unit time and again, and has stepped up to the cause on several 
occasions.
Winner:
Manu Ginóbili. He’s unquestionably the best player in this conversation, and when the Spurs are rolling like this, no one else deserves it more.
Most Improved Player
The first major contender for this award is Phoenix Suns guard Goran Dragic. Dragic has been nothing short of sensational this season. He has carried a Phoenix team projected to be at the bottom of the Western Conference to legitimate playoff contenders. 
With the help of star acquisition point guard Eric Bledsoe (who mind you, has missed nearly three months of action) and coach Jeff Hornacek, the Suns have been playing thrilling basketball, resembling the Houston Rockets of last season. Much of it is down to Dragic though, who was snubbed from the All-Star Game despite having a career year. 
The second contender is New Orleans Pelicans forward-center Anthony Davis. Such has been Davis’s rise this season that he is being seen by most coaches to be an MVP candidate in the coming years. 
Sporting an absurd PER of 27.10 in just his second year in the league and at only 21 years old, Davis is a star in the making. He leads the league in blocks and currently averages over 20 PPG and over 10 RPG. His PER is also the fourth highest in the league behind only LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kevin Love. Davis is a monster in the making, and the Pelicans have a franchise player on their hands.
Winner
Dragic, only because his rise is more surprising. Davis is also destined for bigger awards.
Defensive Player of the Year
For a while it seemed like absolutely no one could stop Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert from taking this award home. For the first half of the season, Indiana’s defense was one of the most suffocating seen in years and even Tom Thibodeau’s Chicago Bulls weren’t keeping up. His rim protection is impeccable and has been key to Indiana only allowing 91.7 PPG this season.
However, a new contender has emerged over the recent months. Forward-center Joakim Noah has carried the Bulls on his sleeve like no one thought he could. 
Indiana’s PPG allowed was lower than 90 for a while, and the Bulls’s PPG allowed higher than 93. Its now down to 91.9, just 0.2 more than the Pacers. Noah has also brought this number down pretty much alone, as he leads the team in rebounding, assists, and blocks. And all these statistics do not even begin to measure the heart with which Noah plays.
Winner
 Noah. The Pacers have fallen in performance while the Bulls have only become better, and Noah is the reason for that, especially without any other star on the team.
Rookie of the Year
In a draft class being compared to the disastrous 2001 draft, it wouldn’t be too hard to stand out with some high numbers. And yet there is only one player who has shown any true potential of becoming a superstar: Philadelphia 76ers guard Michael Carter-Williams (MCW).
 MCW has been very good on a 76ers team that just tied for the longest losing streak in the history of the NBA. But even he has his flaws, notably his shooting and high turnover rate. But he is averaging 16.7 PPG, 6.0 RPG and 6.3 RPG while being sixth in the league in steals at 1.92 per game. He has major talent, but needs a better supporting cast and coaching.
Honorable mentions go to Orlando Magic shooting guard Victor Oladipo and Utah Jazz point guard Trey Burke.
Winner
MCW. Those numbers might be inflated by pace, but are excellent nevertheless.
Coach of the Year
As the Spurs cruise toward a potential No. 1 overall seed (yet again), Gregg Popovich’s name is being thrown around as possible coach of the year (again). There isn’t much that isn’t known about him, and he is certainly the best coach in the league and in the conversation for one of the greatest ever. He’s also remaining steadfast in performance despite the fact that each of the Spurs’ Big Three have missed rather significant time.
The first surprise contender is Portland Trailblazers coach Terry Stotts. The Trailblazers were not even expected to be in the conversation for the playoffs this year, but after their 24–5 start, they were labeled as potential contenders. While they have fallen off their torrid pace since, they still are in the fifth seed, and Stotts has been doing all he can to squeeze the maximum out of role players like forwards Thomas Robinson and Joel Freeland.
The biggest surprise is from the most surprising team. Jeff Hornacek has coached the Suns, which was expected to be one of the worst teams, but is now one of the most exciting teams. 
Nearly every Suns player is having a career year and the Desert Cinderellas have made a case for themselves to be in the contender picture in the next few years.
Winner
Hornacek. As good as Stotts has been, the Suns are just two-and-a-half games behind the Trailblazers, despite having a significantly poorer roster.
Most Valuable Player
The last two years the MVP trophy has been contended between Miami Heat small forward LeBron James and Oklahoma City Thunder small forward Kevin Durant. Both times Durant has come second, with James taking home the hardware and taking his MVP tally to four. He has begun to establish himself in the Greatest NBA Players of all Time conversation. However, this year may be the one when Durant finally gets his due.
His defense, frequently criticized over the last few years, has improved by leaps and bounds, Durant has been nothing short of sensational.
The race to win this trophy is so close, because James has been no slouch either. He’s averaging 27 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 6.4 APG. 
While these might be lower than his career averages, its because he’s also playing less.
Also, all of this has been with shooting guard Dwyane Wade in and out of the lineup and the Heat having to use seldom-used players like small forward James Jones and guard Toney Douglas in place to start. James is carrying the Heat yet again.
Winner
Durant. It has to be him. But the race is so close, James could still win it if he goes on a tear over the next 10 games or so..

2014-04-07,CMU,India,"It’s almost been a month since the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was declared lost, and almost two weeks since it was officially declared to have crashed in the South Indian Ocean. 
As numerous planes scour the seas for any sign of wreckage or debris, we — the onlookers — have followed the news story from the start. We have seen the countless theories surrounding the flight, including everything from the pilot and his co-pilot, stolen passports, hijackings, and the Illuminati.
It is important to follow current events, yes. They make us well-informed citizens and enable us to participate in a public dialogue with our friends, professors, and whomever else we meet. But there comes a point when we are overloaded with information from the press. The press has reached maximum capacity when it comes to Flight 370.
In the past month, I have received more than 10 mobile pings that have said, “Potential debris spotted in Indian (or South China Sea) Ocean” or some other variant. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, CNN reporter Martin Savidge has spent the past month or so in a flight simulator testing Flight 370 theories, inspiring the Twitter trending hashtag #freemartinsavidge.
Despite the extensive media coverage, there have been few significant developments in the past month regarding the flight. These developments have included, first, that the flight had disappeared; second, that it has been declared lost in an area in the South Indian Ocean using satellite data, complex calculations, and the Doppler effect; and last, that there have been possible debris sightings close to the area where the plane is believed to have passed through.
But as each day passes without confirmed sighting of the wreckage, the media — CNN in particular because of its wide, expansive coverage — has resorted to excruciatingly aggravating extrapolation. In fact, one headline on CNN even read “Was Flight 370 a Zombie Plane?” There have been theories — none of which are substantiated in any way — regarding terror plots, hijackings, and a secret message from the plane before it vanished. Not only is CNN covering the story this way, but the other “Big Two” — Fox and NBC — have joined in, perhaps in an effort to boost television ratings in an era where news is more mobile and Internet-based.
I’m not saying that the CNN or news outlets should not be covering Flight 370. In fact, there are some fascinating stories behind it. For example, Malaysia’s public relations and general management of the flight’s disappearance have been criticized internationally. Therein lies the potential for a story with concrete facts and credible sources, one that would not be an extrapolation.
However, on the other side of the TV are viewers obsessed with finding this flight. Something within our human subconscious is drawn to such tragedies, and the surrealism of a plane crash contributes to our fascination. Flights, which used to be considered a luxury, are now considered to be essential. Air travel has connected the world by making it so much easier to traverse.
As a result of this accessibility, there is a sense of security, ease, and comfort, even, to be traveling in a metal bird thousands of miles above the ground. Then, an incident like Flight 370 comes along and disrupts our confidence in such a sense. As a result, we are compelled to understand what went wrong, and how Flight 370 differed from the millions of others. 
That being said, there are several issues with the way the “Big Three” — CNN, NBC, and Fox — have been capitalizing on this innate public interest in the doomed flight. The outlets, by throwing speculations and extrapolations, have left us confused and lead us to question their authority and integrity on such relatable, high-profile incidents..

2014-04-14,CMU,India,"Today, smartphones can be used to triangulate a person’s position within a few meters from almost anywhere on the Earth. Despite having this advanced technology, the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished on March 8, 2014, is still ongoing, and there have been no traces of the plane. Much of the world has been shocked at how a Boeing 777-200 jetliner carrying  239 people on board can simply disappear without a trace.
After the plane’s communications were disabled, the only data from the plane were a series of pings to Inmarsat 4-F1, a communications satellite that sits perfectly stationary above the equator at the Indian Ocean.
Unfortunately, three satellites are required to determine an object’s location on the earth. A single satellite can only measure distance based on the time it takes for radio waves to go from the object to the satellite. A sphere can be generated with this distance, as the radius and the object can be anywhere on this sphere. By having two satellites and two distance measurements, the object is confined to anywhere on the intersection of the two spheres. A third sphere can be used to find the intersection of all three and, thus, the location of the object.
Based on the single Inmarsat data, searchers identified two possible paths for the plane on the one sphere they generated. The Guardian reported that engineers working for Inmarsat used a clever approach that involves the Doppler effect to determine the plane’s final path.
The Doppler effect is when sound, light, or radio waves are emitted from a source and the observer receives a changed frequency of waves. If the source is moving toward the listener, the distance between successive waves decreases so they bunch together, increasing the frequency. Conversely, if the source is moving away from the listener, the distance increases between waves and frequency received drops.
Analysts identified slight changes in the frequency of the radio waves that the satellite received from the plane and deduced that the plane was traveling south away from the satellite at the equator. The plane’s last ping was then deduced to be about 1,500 miles away from the coast of Australia.
Now that the general location of the plane is known, the task of searching through the southern Indian Ocean remains. Search teams are listening for a black box flight recorded, which sends pings for about 30 days a distance of two miles. They must identify a ping that lasts 9.3 milliseconds, a tenth of the time of a blink of the human eye that is repeated every 1.08 seconds in a vast ocean that is filled with many other noises.
CNN reported that a Chinese and Australian search vessel heard pings at the right frequency on April 5 but have not heard them since. An official close to the search is now reporting that the batteries on the black box are most likely dead. 
After one month of searching, MH370 has eluded the whole world, seeming to simply disappear into thin air..

2014-04-14,CMU,India,"We are witnessing the rise of the cities, according to this week's Freakonomics podcast. Massive metropolises dot the globe. Supercities attract talent and ambition. Extraordinary power, fame, and wealth are the spoils of success in these urban arenas. The inhabitants of these cities are not so much American as they are New Yorkers, not so much British as they are Londoners, not so much French as they are Parisian, not so much Indian as they are Mumbaikars, not so much Chinese as they are Beijingers. The modern man is a uniquely urban animal.
In the United States, the 100 largest metropolitan areas are home to two-thirds of the national population and generate three-fourths of this nation’s annual gross domestic product. They house this many millions and produce this much economic output while occupying only 12 percent of the country’s land mass.
In an era of extreme partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. and in state capitols all across the country, the city hall is emerging as an energetic and innovative forum for tackling pressing political issues. Mayors across the country are amassing greater political prominence at the expense of the esteem once commanded by state governors, federal legislators, and the American president. City governments are proving far more nimble than state or federal institutions in addressing a variety of public policy questions.
Mayors are institutionally pragmatic. They are charged with solving problems, not stoking partisan fires. They get things done because they must, unlike our increasingly sclerotic national government. As legendary 99th New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia once put it, “There is no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage.” Such urban pragmatism extends to policing the streets, educating our children, and building next-generation modes of transportation. Pragmatism trumps the reflexively ideological nature of our national politics. Cosmopolitan cooperation between cities will one day trump parochial nationalism. Entrepreneurial mayors, whose constituencies are more united and less ideological than those of state governors, federal legislators, or the president, are the most potent force for new ideas in American politics.
Unlike state governors and federal legislators, mayors are fiscally and legally constrained in serious ways. Their zeal to make a deep impact on national issues is contained by the limited scope of their regional offices. The limited size of the revenue streams they control limits the scope of their policy platforms. However, these limitations must be kept in mind only so that mayors can efficiently marshal their time and efforts. Public-private partnerships, facilitated by City Hall, can greatly expand the range of options available to an entrepreneurial mayor trying to resolve long-term and deep-seated political problems in his or her city. Purposive cooperation with other cities can develop regional norms of governance that could produce visionary public policy without abusing the geographic boundaries of a mayor’s constituency.
Political power is devolving to the site of the real action — the city. Political energy is gathering in these cities, where social change must necessarily happen. They are replacing the nation-state as the engines of political progress. They are the newest stars on the political stage. The polis gave birth to democracy, and the cosmopolis will renew it. We are living in the Age of the City..

2014-04-21,CMU,India,"The regular season has officially ended and the playoff seedings have been decided. This year’s playoffs have thrown some interesting matchups and are bound to ignite some long standing rivalries. So what do each team’s playoff hopes look like?
Indiana Pacers
We start at the very top of the East with the stumbling Pacers. One of the best teams before the All-Star break, Indiana has tailed off miserably since they traded forward Danny Granger for guard Evan Turner and forward Lavoy Allen. They lost a veteran and a defensively-sound player for an erratic sieve coming from the pathetic Philadelphia 76ers. They nearly lost the first-round seed to the Miami Heat, but gained it back through the Heat’s own struggles. Their offense, long their weakest point, has been second worst only after the 76ers. Their much vaunted defense has served some cracks. The conference finals seemed a lock at a time, but the Chicago Bulls seem capable of taking that away from them. Players like All-Stars small forward and shooting guard Paul George and center Roy Hibbert need to step up, else they face a failed season overall.
Miami Heat
No one should be too worried about the Heat at this point. Their objective from the regular season was not the No. 1 seed, but more importantly, the health of all their veterans, especially superstar guard Dwyane Wade. They are well-rested and have Wade clicking into gear again for the playoffs, something that is very important for this team. They also happen to be two-time defending champions, and have an easy first round match against the Charlotte Bobcats. However, the Brooklyn Nets might pose a serious challenge in the second round. Anything but a championship will be a failure for them, but it’s hard to bet against a team with the best player in the world, four-time MVP forward LeBron James.
Toronto Raptors
The surprise package from the East and the third-seeded Atlantic Division champions, the Raptors, are looking to make a name for themselves in the playoffs. They have their stars in guards Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, but it’s unlikely they will be able to cross the Brooklyn Nets in the first round. The Raptors have been nothing short of sensational since the trade of forward Rudy Gay to the Sacramento Kings, but one wonders if that will be enough against a team full of playoff veterans. Their next matchup is also against the Miami Heat, so the conference semifinals are definitely the ceiling for them.
Chicago Bulls
The injury to star guard Derrick Rose and the trade of key forward Luol Deng meant the Bulls were supposed to tank for a high lottery pick this season. All-Star center Joakim Noah and coach Tom Thibodeau apparently didn’t get the message. The Bulls were threatening for the third seed after the All-Star break, and Noah is likely coming in third in the MVP ballots after having a career year. Much rests on the shoulders of their point center for their hopes in the playoffs, and he needs to be ably flanked by sixth man of the year favorite forward Taj Gibson and defensive wing Jimmy Butler. The conference finals seem like a real possibility.
Washington Wizards
This team is good, but almost certainly not good enough to progress even in the East. They got an unfavorable matchup against the Bulls, where All-Star point guard John Wall is likely to be hounded by several defensive stalwarts. It would be a surprise to see them make it any further, but congratulations must go out to the Wizards for ending with a higher than 0.500 record for the first time in five years.
Brooklyn Nets
The team with the highest payroll in the league is the team no one wants to play in the playoffs. Miami tried dodging them by avoiding the first seed, but got them anyway. The Nets discovered their identity under rookie coach Jason Kidd, following a disastrous 10–21 start, and currently possess matchup nightmares for any team. They are full of playoff veterans like Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Joe Johnson, Deron Williams and Andrei Kirilenko. If the team stays healthy, watch out for them as dark horses to make the conference finals.
Charlotte Bobcats
The Bobcats are another surprise story, as coach Steve Clifford instilled a defensive resilience in the team and elevated center Al Jefferson’s game to make a playoff team. The Bobcats are not a great team, but, in the future years, we see them here more often than not. They will lose to Miami in the first round, but could have reached the second had they got the sixth seed against the Raptors, who they beat three times in the regular season.
Atlanta Hawks
They have made the playoffs for seven straight seasons now and, this year, they made the playoffs without star center Al Horford too. They beat the New York Knicks to the eighth seed and hardly present a dead rubber matchup for Indiana. In All-Star forward Paul Millsap, they have one of the most underrated forwards in the league, a deadly sharpshooter in Kyle Korver and a blossoming rookie center in Pero Antic. Their series against Indiana should be an exciting one, as it ended 2–2 in the regular season.
We move to the West, which had one of the deepest fields seen in years and presents some of the most exciting playoff matchups in recent history.
San Antonio Spurs
As All-Star guard Tony Parker recently said, anything but a championship will be a failure for them. Legendary coach and coach-of-the-year favorite Gregg Popovich has led this team to the best record in the league again, and this time without any player playing even 30 MPG. The first round against Dallas should be easy, but after that no one knows what’s going to happen in this conference. Will forward Tim Duncan get his much-coveted fifth ring to put an icing on one of the greatest careers in basketball?
Oklahoma City Thunder
A healthy Russell Westbrook going into the playoffs means the Thunder have a great shot at making the conference finals again. This team is defensively sound and offensively explosive. Forward Kevin Durant is having a career year (again) and this time seems a lock to win the MVP over LeBron James. If they can overcome their reliance on Durant for their scoring, they could be dark horses to become the champions. But first a grueling first round series against the Memphis Grizzlies looms, who beat them in the second round last year.
Los Angeles Clippers
Gone are those days when the Lakers would be in this spot. Enter the other team from LA, currently sporting two of the top 10 players in the NBA and a top five coach in Doc Rivers. All-stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul will carry this team on their back and with Doc’s coaching it wouldn’t be a surprise to see them reaching the very top. But important role players such as sixth man of the year contender Jamal Crawford and sharpshooter JJ Reddick must step up to the cause and help out the stars, else the first round matchup against Golden State Warriors itself may not be overcome.
Houston Rockets
The addition of All-Star center Dwight Howard has propelled this team into the NBA elite, and it’s no surprise. With superstar guard James Harden leading the way, this team has played some of the most exciting basketball this season and have greatly improved their defense thanks to Howard. However, the Rockets remain an excessively turnover-prone team, and in the playoffs, that can really doom you. Players like forwards Chandler Parsons and Terrence Jones and backup guard Jeremy Lin need to have a substantial impact, and they need point guard and defensive stalwart Patrick Beverly to be healthy to make progress.
Portland Trailblazers
One of the most surprising teams this season, the Trailblazers have certainly cooled off after the blistering 24–5 start. But in All-Stars Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldrige, they have two offensive weapons that can give any team nightmares. It’s hard to see where this team will go though, as their defense remains very susceptible and its hard to imagine them overcoming Harden and the Rockets to make it any further. Let’s hope their Cinderella story continues.
Golden State Warriors
It’s a testament to the Western Conference that even the sixth seed is being labeled as a potential dark horse contender. The Warriors at their best have been sensational. All-Star Stephen Curry has established himself as probably the best point guard after Chris Paul, center Andrew Bogut and wing Andre Iguodala have made this team one of the most defensively sound in the NBA, and sharpshooter Klay Thompson has made huge strides from last season. It remains to be seen whether they can find their consistency though and rediscover their home form. Will the splash brothers create a huge wave in the west?
Memphis Grizzlies
They were fighting for their playoff lives until the penultimate game of the season and now they are the seventh seed, avoiding San Antonio in the first round. The Grizzlies are one of the best defensive teams in the league and have several underrated players in center Marc Gasol, point guard Mike Conley, and forward Zach Randolph. Their unity drives them forward and one should watch out for them to make some noise in the playoffs. They are the team no one wants to face and could be the ones making sure that Durant cannot add a ring to his probable MVP anytime soon.
Dallas Mavericks
All-star forward Dirk Nowitzki is back where he belongs — in the West elite. After a horrible year where Dallas struggled to even get to 0.500, they have made it back with an explosive offense carried by Dirk and star guard Monta Ellis. They have been consistent but are unfortunate to face the Spurs in the first round, as they lost the season series 4–0 to them. But no one really counted them in the race during the 2011 title run either. It’ll be hard, and head coach Rick Carlisle will have to pull a rabbit out of the hat again, but let’s hope the Mavericks put up a fight and show everyone why they belong..

2014-04-21,CMU,India,"India, the world’s largest democracy, is at the polls right now.
The sheer size of India’s democracy is mindboggling. Its national election, held every five years, has nine phases and occurs over five weeks. It will be the largest election in the history of the world, according to bloomberg.com. Nearly 815 million Indians are eligible to vote in this election, a number equal to the combined populations of America and the European Union. By May 16, when election results are announced, India will have spent roughly $5 billion on this election, according to TIME magazine, second only to the $7 billion Americans spent on the 2012 presidential election.
India’s National Congress party has wielded political power since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1947. But deepening concern about rising prices and rampant political corruption has led Indian voters to look twice at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead. In an era of tepid economic growth, the right-wing BJP is running its candidates on a savvy pro-business campaign. But this party’s ideological grounding in Hindu nationalism — emphasized by the checkered political past of Narendra Modi, its candidate for prime minister of India — demands our scrutiny.
Pre-election polls indicate that Modi will likely become India’s next prime minister. He has served as chief minister of Gujarat since 2001. Gujarat, unlike other Indian states, boasted a brisk 10 percent annual growth rate during these years. Today, it is one of the richest states in India. Many of its residents credit Modi’s pro-business economic policies for their prosperity. They eagerly anticipate his election to the prime ministership of India so that all of India may enjoy such economic growth.
However, Modi’s tenure as chief minister of Gujarat is not without blemish. On February 27, 2002, a train carrying several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, in Gujarat. Fifty-eight passengers, mostly Hindu pilgrims and many of them women and children, died in the fire. Rumors that Muslim arsonists were responsible for this accident triggered a rash of anti-Muslim violence throughout Gujarat. The Indian government estimated that 800 Muslims were killed in the violence. Unofficial figures estimate the number of Muslims killed was closer to 2,000.
I ask the reader to excuse me for cataloging some of these atrocities, but it is morally incumbent upon us to consider them now, when the world’s largest democracy is about to elect Modi to its highest political office. In the days following the burning of the train in Gujarat, Muslim children were forced to drink gasoline and then set on fire. Muslim infants were speared, held aloft, and thrown into bonfires. Muslim women and girls were gang-raped. The bellies of pregnant Muslim women were slit open and their fetuses thrown into the streets. Hindu mobs barricaded and flooded Muslim homes and electrocuted the families inside. 
While this violence was convulsing Gujarat, Modi was, at best, doing nothing to stop it. Less charitable critics, such as Human Rights Watch, have asserted that Gujarat’s police officers participated in this carnage.
Arundhati Roy, India’s leading woman of letters and a fierce critic of its capitalistic policies, recently described Modi in an interview with Democracy Now! as “an extremely hard and cold-blooded chief minister best known for having presided over a pogrom against Muslims in Gujarat.” 
While her politics necessarily predispose her against Modi’s candidacy, she correctly stated that Modi has never directly expressed his regret for the 2002 Gujarat violence. In fact, the closest Modi has come to such an expression was in a Reuters interview in 2013, in which he compared his feelings to those of a driver involved in an accident: “...if a puppy comes under the wheel, will it be painful or not? Of course it is.” Such a statement is needlessly callous, if not darkly revealing of the smallness of Modi’s politics.
India is going to the polls right now, and there is nothing we can do to prevent Modi’s election to the post of prime minister. But perhaps it is not too little to keep before us this shameful political history of the man who will preside over the largest democracy in the world. Such insistent memory may prove the strongest bulwark against the recurrence of state-sanctioned violence in India during Modi’s likely tenure as prime minister, and our only way of redeeming the unprecedented act of democracy currently underway in India..

2014-04-21,CMU,India,"Last week, India’s Supreme Court ruled to accept transgender individuals as a third gender, a massive step forward in gender recognition. Now transgendered people have the option to identify as this third gender, eliminating the traditional binary gender system still used by most developed nations. This ruling seems like a natural political progression for India, whose Election Commission ruled in 2009 that voters could register with “other” as their gender. In addition to India, Bangladesh and Nepal have also officially recognized a third gender, while nations such as the United States have not.
It is important to provide a third gender option other than the “male” or “female” identity. This binary decision forces transgender individuals to align themselves with one of two identities which they may not feel comfortable characterizing themselves as. 
Other nations should adopt this system based on the simple notion of inclusion. Forcing someone to adopt a label they feel does not describe them is an unfair constraint placed on members of a group, which, unfortunately are often subject to societal marginalization as it is. 
That being said, India must still revise various laws that are holding it back from universal acceptance of its citizens. In 2013, Indian courts reinstated a law, that had previously been struck down in 2009, criminalizing homosexual actions, meaning that homosexual acts currently are punishable by a 10-year prison sentence.
India’s Supreme Court has made an excellent step toward creating greater acceptance of transgender people within their nation. It can only be hoped that many other nations will follow in the near future. However, there is still room for improvement in accepting different kinds of people, and promoting tolerance should be an important consideration for all nations.
Last week, India’s Supreme Court ruled to accept transgender individuals as a third gender, a massive step forward in gender recognition. .

2014-04-28,CMU,India,"One Night in Beijing, the annual Chinese cultural performance show held by ARCC (Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture), was held on Saturday night.
This year, the theme of the show was “Pig Tales,” which featured an overarching skit billed as “an original sequel to the famous Journey to the West.” Journey to the West, of course, is one of the most well-known stories in Chinese literature, featuring the adventures of Sun WuKong, the Monkey King, and the other disciples of a Buddhist monk, who travel from China to India on a pilgrimage. The skit follows the story of Zhu Bajie, the comical pig-man disciple known for his laziness and gluttony, who must serve time tending to a temple after he commits a number of misdeeds.
While at the temple, Zhu Bajie, played by sophomore information systems major Daniel Song, forms a friendship with a taciturn girl named Huan Meiling,  played by senior international relations and politics and Chinese studies double major Sandra Yeh, who is being hounded by literal demons. Bajie must also face harsh rebukes from the deified Chinese general Guan Yu, played by junior mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Calvin Chan. The Monkey King also makes an appearance as a comically adorable version played by junior computer science major Joy Lin.
The skit had a number of humorous touches, including the use of “oh my Buddha” instead of “oh my God,” as well as a subplot about the Bandit Queen, who finds the Monkey King sexy, much to the dismay of her husband.
The skit also segued into the performances well, with each performance complementing a portion of the skit. The performances themselves surveyed the landscape of Chinese culture, from its ancient roots to modern times.
One of the best performances of the night included “You Know You Love Me, I’m Your Bad Boy,” a performance led by the Bandit King as he tried to impress his wife into loving him again. A dance to the song “Moonwalk” by Taiwanese boyband JPM, “I’m Your Bad Boy” was a smooth but energetic dance performance that showcased effects such as silhouette lighting. The dancing was choreographed well enough to be a music video for the actual song.
Its companion performance “Fragile Falling Flowers and Breakups,” was a graceful fan dance that touched on the same themes as “I’m Your Bad Boy.” Together, the two songs offered female and male perspectives on love and breakups. 
Also notable was the showing of Carnegie Mellon alumnus David Hsu’s (CIT ‘06) short film, “Fate,” about a girl who loses her boyfriend in a freak automobile accident, but gets a chance to reverse the death — at a price. The film features many Carnegie Mellon-centric locales and references. At one point, Hsu worked in a reference to The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch.
Many other performances also featured fan dancing, Chinese folk songs, and C-pop. The Ballroom Dance Club made an appearance in the performance “Toxic Tango,” a dance to the Britney Spears hit. At one part of the show, Princess Anna from Frozen teamed up with a sea deity to sing “Let Part of Your World Go,” a mashup of the hit songs from Frozen and The Little Mermaid.
The show also featured performances with uniquely Chinese instruments and objects, such as the Chinese yo-yo, the Chinese qin (a traditional stringed instrument), and lion dancing — dances in lion costumes traditionally performed during Chinese festivals.
One Night in Beijing was a show that brought together a multitude of talented performers from the Carnegie Mellon community and a variety of influences from Chinese culture. It was a great show for anyone with a connection to, or interest in, China..

2014-04-28,CMU,India,"Warning: This article contains spoilers for the Parks and Recreaton _season six finale, “Moving Up.”
Pawnee, Ind. is far from perfect. The people are rude and morbidly obese; the infrastructure is crumbling and prone to raccoon infestations. But despite all its flaws, former City Councilwoman and Deputy Director of the Pawnee City Department of Parks and Recreation Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) loves Pawnee with a fierce passion.
What would Pawnee be without her? More importantly, who would Leslie be without Pawnee? Last Thursday, Parks and Recreation played with those questions in its season six finale, “Moving Up.”
There were a lot of storylines going into this finale, which could have made even the extra 20 minutes feel crammed with content, but the writers managed to merge them into one cohesive storyline.
The NBC comedy saw Leslie tackle all sorts of new obstacles this season: the recall election, the pregnancy and subsequent exit of her best friend Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), and the merger between Pawnee and its neighbor and rival city, Eagleton.
The last few episodes took the show to a new level, as it was revealed that Leslie and husband Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) are expecting triplets — the always-overachieving Leslie had even managed to overachieve a family.
To top it off, Leslie was still mulling over a major job offer from the National Parks Service that would require a move to Chicago. It was only halfway through the episode that Leslie decided to take the job, which left about 20 minutes for viewers to wonder how the show was going to progress next season.
In fact, much of the episode felt like a series, rather than a season, finale, as all the characters examined their own lives and voiced their appreciation of them. This show depends heavily on its supporting cast for humor and actual storylines, so any major decisions made by Leslie need to be examined in terms of everyone else.
Set against the Pawnee-Eagleton Unity Concert, “Moving Up” saw Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) reaffirm his commitment to family life, while April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) reaffirm their status as the most perfectly dysfunctional couple on TV.
Meanwhile, former Parks employee Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) finally opens  his newest business venture, Tom’s Bistro, with some help from his friends, some Pawnee celebrities, and some actual celebrities. After a few hiccups, the restaurant actually turns out to be a success.
Parks and Recreation has always been an underappreciated comedy. Despite continuous threat of cancelation, the whole team manages to turn out quality, heartfelt episodes every week.
This week was no exception. It was nice after a season that sometimes felt like a downer to see everyone legitimately happy in their lives.
Even moves that could seem like cop-outs, such as Leslie convincing her new boss to move the Chicago operation to Pawnee, manage to come off as the most natural thing in the world. Of course Leslie would manage to move up in the world without ever having to move out of Pawnee.
And despite the episode’s overarching tone of finality, the final two minutes firmly close out this season and simultaneously push the show into the next, and possibly final, season.
A three-year time jump gives the writers room to jump head first into Leslie’s new roles, both personal and professional, without having to deal with all the transitions.
It’s nice to see a show grow and develop while still maintaining everything that makes it great. Parks and Recreation is consistently funny and entertaining, but continues to find new ways to make a small town in Indiana seem like the best place in the world..

2014-08-25,CMU,India,"With the NFL season quickly approaching, a busy offseason and a deep and talented draft class have altered the landscape of the league. Football’s restrictive salary cap and high rate of player turnover means there are often huge surprises in the standings from year to year. These teams were under .500 last season but, due to a combination of statistical indicators, offseason moves, and a couple of hunches, could flip expectations on their heads and improve this year.
Houston Texans
It won’t be easy, but it isn’t hard to imagine the Houston Texans being the third consecutive team to launch all the way from the first overall pick to the playoffs in the following season. This may sound like a reach, but the Texans were much better than 2–14 last year. Houston lost nine of their eleven one-score games, which is often an indicator that bad luck drove their record down far more than a lack of talent. The team's late leads over the Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts, and New England Patriots, as well as lost nail biters against the Kansas City Chiefs and St. Louis Cardinals, magnifies their bad luck even more. The Cardinals were the only team in that group to not make the playoffs, and they won 10 games last season in the loaded NFC West. That alone shows that this Texans team was probably closer to an average 6–10 team than a 2–14 team last year.
Further, quarterback Matt Schaub played so badly in the beginning of the season that he was benched for undrafted free agent quarterback, Case Keenum. The duo combined for a monstrous number of interceptions returned for scores and overall terrible play from the quarterback position. While this problem will likely not be solved next year with journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick taking the reins on offense, the offense will still likely take a huge step forward.  
Defensive scores are not a consistent stat from year to year, and are largely determined by randomness. This team will not throw pick sixes in five consecutive games. Further, running back Arian Foster is healthy after never really being at full strength last year, which will add another dimension to this offense and open up more room for the passing game to grow. Even with a subpar quarterback situation, the wide receiving corps of this team more than makes up for it.  Andre Johnson will continue to be a star, and opposite him, DeAndre Hopkins showed flashes of brilliance last year and should continue to improve. Tight end Owen Daniels may have moved on but his replacement, Garrett Graham, showed competence both blocking and receiving. Tackle Tyson Clabo could bolster the Texans protection and give Fitzpatrick more time to get passes away to the talented receivers. This offense has the potential to be significantly better than it was a year ago.
The Texans defense also has the chance to improve in several ways.  The first and most visible is the addition of first overall draft pick, jack linebacker Jadeveon Clowney.  Paired with defensive end JJ Watt, this tandem could wreak havoc upon opposing offensive lines, disrupting passes and producing sacks. If Clowney lives up to his potential, the Texans pass rush could be devastating. Brian Cushing could be returning, but he is no longer a safe bet to play close to 16 games in a season. 
However, the Texans defense wasn’t that bad last year. Watt is still the best defensive end in the league; the secondary, while not great, is not awful; and the Texans have been making due with mediocre inside linebackers for years, and last year was the first time in three seasons they missed the playoffs.   There is a little bit of the plexiglass principle involved as well. This team was dominant two years ago and only returned to average last year. If they improve to somewhere between those two extremes, they will likely improve massively on last year’s nightmare season.
Buffalo Bills
Another cellar dweller primed to make a leap is the Buffalo Bills. Behind the second-best defensive line in the league and rookie middle linebacker Kiko Alonso, this team quietly had a dominant defense last year. While Alonso is out for the season with an injury and safety Jairus Byrd has left for the New Orleans Saints, Brandon Spikes and Da’Norris Searcy are competent replacements, respectively. Although the defense was good last year, the Bills were still awful. The big upgrades will come on the offensive side of the ball.
The Bills’ offense last year was a disaster. Quarterback EJ Manuel was okay when he wasn’t hurt, but his replacements were bad. Running back CJ Spiller had a letdown season and produced nothing for most of the season. Very little on this offense worked last season, but that will likely change next year.
First, the line should improve this season. Left tackle Cordy Glenn should continue to improve in his third season. Eric Wood will still be a helpful player at center for the Bills. Rookie right tackle, Cyrus Kouandjio, could be a major addition for the Bills. He projects as a great run blocker for a run-first team.
This improvement in the line could help open up more space for Spiller. Spiller’s season last year was a disappointment, but it’s probably not permanent. Spiller is not old enough, even for a running back, to already be on the downslope of his career, and he still has the speed and agility that made him great in 2012. The extra gaps created by the line could boost Spiller’s performance next season.
The team’s passing game might improve as well. Manuel missed time last year and was turnover-prone, but both of these things could diminish as he gets more comfortable with the Bills’ system. Furthermore, rookie wide receiver Sammy Watkins might be the best player in this year’s draft class. Whole highlight reels have already been dedicated to Watkins’ one-handed catches and moves with the ball. He could open up space for the running game and launch the Bills into the upper half of the AFC East. It might not be enough to warrant a playoff appearance, but in a weak division, it might be enough.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
In the NFC, the Buccaneers could deliver on some of their 2013 promise. Head coach Greg Schiano and quarterback Josh Freeman had a lockerroom dispute that went public, and Freeman was abysmal on the field. Murphy’s Law held, and the season was lost after a 0–7 start. The team only slightly improved down the stretch, going 4–5 in their last nine games.
The roster is talented enough to think they might improve. Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and outside linebacker Lavonte David are two of the best defensive players in the league. Former Titans cornerback Alterraun Verner was a solid addition to shore up the secondary and cannot possibly be as bad as former cornerback Darrelle Revis was last year. Free safety Dashon Goldson is also likely to be a productive player this season. With some stars and few true weaknesses on the defense, this unit should play well. They were already the eighth best defense by DVOA last season, according to Football Outsiders, and that number should stay the same or improve this year.
Offensively, this team should improve as well. As stated before, Freeman was awful and was traded to the Vikings midseason. Backup quarterback, and rookie Mike Glennon was raw and, despite improving over the course of the season, not very good. Quarterback Josh McCown was a smart offseason addition. Coming off a fantastic year with the Chicago Bears, he should be a solid stopgap before Glennon is ready to take the reins. Running back Doug Martin will probably miss fewer games this year. Rookie wide receiver Mike Evans is a great complement to wide receiver Vincent Jackson in the passing game. This offense may not be dominant, but if it clicks, this team has the potential to be very good. Either way, this team is much better than 4–12.
None of these improvements even touch upon the most important change made to this year’s Bucs. Last year, the team clearly hated head coach Schiano. Schiano was more of a disciplinarian than a coach, and the team consistently came out in predictable sets and looked uninterested.
Lovie Smith was an excellent hire, with a proven track record of winning and likability among players. This will be a good team that will be on the same page with a competent head coach. The AFC South is historically erratic — no team has won the division in consecutive years. The Bucs will probably not win it, with the New Orleans Saints set to have a great team, but this team could end up in the playoff discussion by season’s end.
Detroit Lions
Lastly, this should be the year the Detroit Lions finally deliver on the team’s ability and promise and make the playoffs for the second time in 15 years. This team finished only two games off pace last year after the Green Bay Packers lost Aaron Rodgers for an extended stretch. The Lions appeared to have the division won with several games to go, but went on an ice cold streak, losing six of their last seven. The team went 0–4 in games decided by three points or less over that time frame, and they lost to several bad teams.  The criticism heaped that quarterback Matt Stafford can’t win the big game and that this team suffered from a rash of intangible failures that prevented them from winning down the stretch.
It’s far more likely that this losing streak could be attributed to a number of factors that point toward a better record this season. 
First, as the games became more important, this team became more predictable, sticking to head coach Jim Schwartz’s game plan under any circumstance, which prevented a very talented offense from being effective late in the season, as late game drives continually resulted in interceptions. Of course, some of this was Stafford’s fault, but there were a number of other things at play. 
According to an article run by Grantland, Stafford’s stats as a passer deteriorated the longer he waited in the pocket. This makes no sense, because it means he had more time to throw the ball, but it was a significant enough decrease to imply that another factor was at play. From watching clips of those last seven games, it appeared that Stafford continually had no one open to throw to on those types of plays, leading to a large number of interceptions, which falls on the offensive scheme and Schwartz’s lackluster coaching. Jim Caldwell will not necessarily be a major improvement, but any improvement could cause a significant increase in this team’s offensive output.
In addition to the coaching change, wide receiver Golden Tate is the talented, possession wide receiver this team has been looking for since they added Calvin Johnson.  Kris Durham was terrible last year, dropping almost every pass thrown at him, and was clearly unable to cope with how hard Stafford throws the ball. Tate has always been extremely sure-handed and was an excellent addition to this roster. Further, draft pick Eric Ebron should be very effective at providing a huge red zone target and a third option after Johnson and Tate. With running backs Reggie Bush and Joique Bell coming off productive seasons, this could be a very good offense.
This team’s defense, on the other hand, is not great, but it has good enough pieces. The defensive line could be unstoppable.  Defensive tackles Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley are two of the best defensive linemen in the league, and defensive end Ziggy Ansah was solid last year and should continue to improve. This team has no need to rush with more than four, meaning it could make up for the team’s lackluster secondary. The linebackers on this team are solid, and rookie addition Kyle Van Noy could continue to move this team in the right direction. This team was middle of the pack last year, and while it could improve marginally, that is all this team needs considering their offensive firepower.
This season could prove to be an exciting one, and these four teams should turn in better campaigns than last season. While certainly not locks, all of these teams should be playoff contenders after being something closer to doormats a year ago.  With a small 16-game sample to judge an entire season, no one can be sure, but these teams appear to be headed in the right direction..

2014-09-09,CMU,India,"Carnegie Mellon is looking to find out how the brain affects human behavior through its latest initiative, BrainHub.
On Aug. 26, the university announced the launch of BrainHub during a discussion with faculty and research partners. The university stated in a press release that it will work with a variety of home and international partners to create tools to study how the brain and human behavior are linked.
The initiative aims to bring insight into a variety of areas related to the brain, including cognition, learning and perception, and brain disorders like Parkinson’s disease, according to the release.
“As an initiative, [BrainHub] seeks to link people who are connected with different parts of campus who may or may not in some cases have been previously engaged in research related to neuroscience, brain science — to try and bring their expertise to bear on questions that are relevant to brain function,” said Nathan Urban, interim provost and Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz distinguished professor of life sciences.
For example, a person interested in engineering may be applying a data analysis process in an electrical engineering context, but may be able to apply that process to answer questions about the brain, Urban said.
Key first steps of the initiative will be to develop better tools for recording neuron activity and properties, as well as computational tools and approaches for better analyzing and understanding the link between what the brain is doing at a specific time as it yields various behaviors, according to the release.
“The belief is that there are people at Carnegie Mellon who have developed these kinds of technologies in one application area, and we want to understand how they can be leveraged in another application area,” Urban said.
As part of the initiative, Carnegie Mellon said university deans plan to recruit 10 or more new faculty members specializing in the brain sciences in various departments and “establish new sources of ongoing support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,” according to the release.
To jumpstart the new initiative, Carnegie Mellon has secured $75 million of initial commitments over the next five years from various funders, including the Hillman Foundation, RK Mellon Foundation, Dietrich Foundation, and Kris Gopalakrishnan, the co-founder of business consulting company Infosys, among others. 
The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation also represent a large portion of the funding, according to Urban.
Notable partnerships for the BrainHub initiative include Sun Yat-sen Univesrity in Guangzhou, China for its work with Alzheimer’s and autism, the University of Warwick in Coventry, England for its specialty in digital health, Oxford University’s International Brain Mechanics and Trauma Lab and the Indian Institute of Science, which has a brain institute initiative of its own, according to the Carnegie Mellon release. Carnegie Mellon will also work with long-time collaborators at the University of Pittsburgh.
In 2011, Carnegie Mellon partnered with Sun-Yat-sen University to create a joint graduate and engineering program, the Joint Institute of Engineering in China. Carnegie Mellon and Sun Yat-sen celebrated the launch of the program in late 2012. In July, Carnegie Mellon signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Warwick for a $10 million collaboration in data collection, analysis, and processing.
Urban said the short-term goals of the partnerships are to identify common areas of interest to develop further.
“There was a strong desire to have mechanisms for establishing these kinds of [connections among universities] and creating these kinds of joint projects, and we want to let the faculty who are engaged in this, drive that in terms of what directions they take,” Urban said.
Carnegie Mellon’s move to create new tools and methods to further study the brain is part of a larger trend of university research regarding the brain. In April 2013, President Barack Obama unveiled the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, a government initiative to better understand the mind and uncover new ways to cure, prevent, and treat brain disorders.
As part of the initiative, the government said it would provide approximately $100 million in investments through various government organizations for scientists to acquire needed tools for research.
In response to the initiative, many universities have begun their own brain research initiatives. 
For example, the University of California, San Diego in May 2013 introduced the Center for Brain Activity Mapping to develop new tools for recording the activities of neurons in the brain and to conduct brain-mapping experiments. In June, the state of California provided $2 million in funding from its $156 million 2014-15 state budget to jumpstart the university’s research in brain-mapping. The funding was California’s first allocation from a statewide research grant program known as the California Blueprint for Research to Advance Innovations in Neuroscience (Cal-BRAIN). Cal-BRAIN is a direct response by the state of California to President Obama’s initiative.
Urban said that Carnegie Mellon’s BrainHub initiative is unique from other university initiatives because of Carnegie Mellon’s international partnerships and its focus on drawing upon people in various disciplines.
“There’s a lot of focus for us in trying to bring in people who are from, say, computer science or engineering into the fold. We really think ... there’s a lot of opportunity for pushing the field forward rapidly by bringing new approaches, new technologies, [and] new tools to bear, Urban said..

2014-09-29,CMU,India,"India becomes first Asian nation to reach Mars
Although it is not the first nation in the world to do so, India has managed to launch an orbiter to Mars, a task that only the United States, the Soviet Union, and the European Space Agency have accomplished thus far. 
But unlike these entities, India has done so with a relatively small budget of $74 million. NASA, for example, spent $671 million in order for the Maven mission to succeed. In addition, the mission succeeded on the first try, a feat unmatched by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
The project was part of the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) in the Indian Space Research Organisation. Named Mangalyaan (or “Mars Craft” in Hindi), it will stay in elliptical orbit of Mars in order to map its surface and study its atmosphere. It was first announced in Aug. 12, and a little over two years later, the Mangalyaan had begun to orbit the red planet.

Scientists discover origin of water in our solar system
The origin of water has always been a mystery, but scientists have recently discovered that most of the water in the solar system probably existed as ice that was formed in space. In order to learn where the water came from, scientists focused their study on the water molecules themselves. By looking at the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with about double the mass of hydrogen, they were able to determine under which conditions the water molecules formed. 
In the study, the researchers produced models with no external ice and tried to determine the amount of deuterium in ice that would be created over a million years. However, the models could not produce the same ratios of hydrogen to deuterium, which led scientists to conclude that a significant portion of the solar system’s water had come from outside the solar system, making it older than the sun.

Telomerase can be controlled to turn cells on and off
Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, in La Jolla, Calif., have found a switch in cells that may contain the secret to aging in cells. This switch could possibly turn a cell’s aging on and off at any time. This could promote healthy aging and cause healthy cells to keep dividing indefinitely.
Most cells contain telomeres, a sequence of repeated nucleotides that protect the ends of chromosomes and act as a timekeeper of cells that shortens every time the cell splits. The telomere can be rebuilt by telomerase, which some cells possess. In the study, telomerase was found to be controllable — it could be turned off at any time. While the duplication of a cell goes on, telomerase disassembles, then reassembles in the off state. This switch can help regulate cell growth, which has applications in cancer research.

Facebook to start testing Wi-Fi drones next year
As the tech giants are starting to consider bringing Internet to locations all over the world, Facebook is backing a drone-based project that could put Internet drones in the sky. The drone would beam Internet access to people through a variety of methods. 
One method involves satellite or free-space optical communication (FSO) technology, which allows data to be transmitted via invisible, infrared laser beams. 
The drones would be able to stay afloat for months on end, even with the large design. The drones are currently as large as a Boeing 747, but much lighter. According to Facebook, the drones would have the weight of around four tires while being as long as five cars. 
The solar powered drones would operate between 60,000 and 90,000 feet. In addition, the drones can be either unmanned or have an operator.

Nanothreads made from benzene are thin, yet strong
Scientists have recently discovered how to create extremely thin wires made of diamond that are stronger and stiffer than any other existing nanotube or polymer.
To create the diamond nanothreads, extremely high pressures were applied to benzene, a chemical compound which consists of six carbon atoms in a ring with a hydrogen bonded to each carbon. Using a slow decrease in pressure over time, a six millimeter-wide mass of benzene can be compressed into carbon tetrahedrons, which form the diamond nanothreads. The problem with this method, however, is the high pressures that are required for the reaction to occur. Currently, such pressures are only limited to a few cubic millimeters, so these nanothreads are unfeasible for mass production. Even so, these incredibly thin yet strong nanothreads would make the space elevator a possibility.

U.S. carbon emissions continue to increase
Although the Obama administration has been attempting to curb the growth of global warming, emissions of carbon dioxide have increased six percent over the last two years. This increase is a problem for President Obama, who touted the United States’ progress in reducing emissions earlier this year. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, proposed a 30-percent national cut on carbon emissions. Solar and wind energy are also used. However, coal use has fallen in favor of natural gas, which also traps heat and could contribute to global warming. Crude oil production has also increased 31 percent, causing many greenhouse gases to be formed. At this rate, scientists estimate that temperatures could increase 5.8 to 9.7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.

2014-10-06,CMU,India,"Last week, the university announced that Henry Hillman donated $5 million to Carnegie Mellon’s nascent BrainHub initiative.
Hillman, referred to in a campus-wide email as a “renowned Pittsburgh philanthropist,” has donated funds to Carnegie Mellon in the past to support the construction of the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies.
“The Hillman gift will provide new endowment funds to help support presidential graduate fellowships in areas broadly connected to brain research,” the email said. “It will also provide seed grants, through CMU’s ProSEED program, for innovative research projects that will connect faculty from disciplines across CMU.”
The Henry L. Hillman Foundation, according to its website, is “dedicated to improving the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania.” Hillman inherited much of his money from his grandfather, a Pittsburgh steel tycoon and the founder of the Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical Company, according to Business Insider.
“Understanding how the brain works is among the great challenges of the 21st century, with results that promise to improve human health and well-being in dramatic ways,” said President Subra Suresh in a press release. “Carnegie Mellon can make a unique and distinctive contribution to this global effort by bringing together our strengths in neurobiology, computation, data sciences, human learning and behavioral science to create urgently needed research frameworks, tools and technologies, and by working in close concert with the network of BrainHub universities around the world.”
Carnegie Mellon launched the BrainHub initiative in late August; the initiative includes plans to expand Carnegie Mellon’s brain research in several different ways.
As part of the initiative, according to the initial press release on the subject, the university plans to hire 10 or more faculty specializing in brain research across various departments and fields. 
BrainHub will focus on developing better tools to measure neuron activity in the brain and computational methods for analyzing brain activity to understand the link between activity in the brain and the body’s behavior. Hillman is one of many sources of funding for BrainHub. According to the press release on BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon has secured $75 million in initial commitments from organizations like the R.K. Mellon Foundation; Dietrich Foundation;  Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of business consulting company Infosys; and others.
“The gift will help support the training of the next generation of brain researchers on a global scale,” the university press release says. “As part of BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon scientists will work with university partners from China, India and the United Kingdom, and the Hillman gift will be matched with other sources of support for BrainHub.”
BrainHub is meant to pave the way for new methods of measuring and analyzing brain activity, as Carnegie Mellon scientists work with other top brain researchers.
Some of BrainHub’s global partners include the University of Warwick, which has expertise in the field of digital health; Sun Yat-sen University, whose medical school is clinically experienced with autism and Alzheimer’s; Oxford University and its International Brain Mechanics and Trauma Lab; and the Indian Institute of Science, which has its own brain research center..

2014-10-13,CMU,India,"This past week, plans were announced to build an oil pipeline of massive scale that would connect Alberta’s energy-rich oil sands to the Canadian Atlantic coast just northeast of Maine. This pipeline is in response to a frustrating lack of a decision from President Obama regarding the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would take the same oil through the United States to Louisiana and Kentucky refineries. The new pipeline, called Energy East, is more than twice as long as Keystone, carries a third more oil, and is a great example of how the desires of the market always come to fruition, regardless of legal impediments.
Obama hasn’t made a decision on Keystone because he’s been battling environmental criticisms from the left, while also facing flak from the right about letting those concerns prevent Keystone’s construction and all the jobs that it would create. Additionally, Keystone supporters tout that having a consistent source of energy from our friendly northern neighbor would reduce America’s energy dependence on the increasingly unstable Middle East. As a result of these competing concerns, Obama has deferred making a decision on Keystone for six years while oil demand, especially from the emerging markets of India and China, continues to skyrocket.
Oil companies aren’t going to forgo a significant market opportunity because of political challenges and, as a result, we now have Energy East, which is worse for the environment and creates a number of Canadian jobs, but no American jobs. In essence, Obama’s indecision has created a situation that is, by all measures, much worse than if Keystone XL was approved.
This type of situation is inevitable if politicians attempt to thwart significant market demand. Another example is the current state of the drug market in the United States. Because drugs are illegal, drug users are pushed into increasingly dangerous situations. Often, they don’t get the drugs they want and experience adverse effects. Cartels in Mexico have created significant challenges for the Mexican government and raised a multitude of humanitarian issues for the United States with the recent immigration crisis. If drugs were legal, these problems would disappear.
Another well-publicized example happened in Ireland, when the Irish government attempted to reduce the amount of trash that Irish citizens generated by making people pay a tax on collection of more than two bags of trash. Instead of curbing their consumption, the Irish simply started burning their trash, which was worse for the environment and led to a lot of fire-related deaths and accidents. The environment was worse off, and Irish hospitals were overwhelmed with burn victims, which increased healthcare costs, and diverted medical resources away from people with other problems.
Instead of trying to alter the most convenient way for market demand to be met, countries looking to generate positive outcomes from this market demand should seek to work within the system, rather than thwart it altogether. If drugs were legal but heavily regulated, not only could drug users get safe drugs, but organizations like Narcotics Anonymous could find a way to reach drug users and guide them out of addiction. Instead of penalizing trash creation, rewarding recycling has been much more fruitful for countries looking to promote sustainability.
With this oil pipeline, a similar tactic should be implemented. Oil is already very heavily regulated and taxed. Maybe Keystone XL should be approved, but an additional tax could be levied on the associated oil refineries and the money could be used to purchase carbon offsets to assuage environmental concerns. That’s just one idea, and it’s definitely not perfect, but that outcome would be far more desirable to all parties than the Energy East solution. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so it’s better to work within the system than against it..

2014-10-27,CMU,India,"“We’re going to play a little game tonight. We’re going to pretend this is Monday night football, and I’m the quarterback,” Jodi Picoult, author of many well-known books including My Sister’s Keeper, said as she took the stage to applause at the Carnegie Music Hall as part of the Literary Evenings’s Monday Night Lecture series.
Picoult, addressing a sold out auditorium on the heels of the release of her new book Leaving Time, spoke to the audience about the research she does for her works of fiction. Doesn’t fiction mean that a story is made up?
While Picoult writes stories that come from the inner machinations of her brain, she often bases them around real-world things that need to be experienced to be properly explained to readers. And boy, were her experiences eye-opening. Although I’ve never read a book by Picoult, she has convinced me to try one out this winter break.
Picoult first related the research she performed for her book Second Glance, published in 2003. In the book, the narrator, Ross Wakeman, comes to Comtosook, Vt. when Abenaki Indian tribe land is being eyed for a shopping mall. If the tribe proves it was a burial ground, the mall cannot be built. Ross, a ghost hunter, comes to the town as its people are being haunted and finds out that the ghost is someone he is falling head over heels for.
To write this book, Picoult not only had to research the Abenaki tribe, but also the Vermont eugenics program, a program in which the Abenaki were forced to disband or go underground as the government sterilized them so that they could not reproduce.
Additionally, Picoult spent some time with real ghost hunters, the Atlantic Paranormal Society in Rhode Island. “If some of you have seen the TV show on the Syfy channel, Ghost Hunters, it was those guys. I knew them before they were famous. They were just ... plumbers doing this on the side,” Picoult said.
“So at the time I was going ghost hunting, my oldest son was about eight/nine years old, and he was terrified of ghosts,” Picoult continued. “So here I am going, ‘Honey, there’s no such thing as a ghost,’ and then packing my bag to go ghost hunting.”
Picoult next related the research she performed for The Storyteller, a book about a woman who is confided in by a former Nazi commander living in America who wants her to help him die.
To understand what she was writing about, Picoult talked to numerous Holocaust survivors, including survivors of concentration camps, death marches, and the ghettos. In one story Picoult told, a boy named Bernie pried a mezuzah from his doorway as he was taken from his home.
Last but not least, Picoult explained the research that went into her latest book, Leaving Time.
The book touches upon elephants’ expression of grief, which the protagonist’s mother studied before she disappeared. “Ultimately, this is a book about how the people who leave us never really do,” Picoult said. “And I began to dive into the world of elephants, knowing I was going to use it as a metaphor, so tonight what I’m going to be telling you about is everything you wanted to know about elephants and more.”
Picoult explained that she worked with a neurobiologist to understand the human brain and then learned how it was similar to and different from elephant brains. She then went to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, as well as Botswana, to work with researchers who track elephant migration patterns. Picoult said that elephants are recognizable by voice, tusks, hair, and ears. No two elephants have the same ears. She also explained that elephants have complex brains capable of remembering, feeling pain and loss, and learning. Elephants also won’t leave each other behind, according to Picoult. Picoult culminated her talk about elephants by relating the importance of ending poaching.
Picoult doesn’t just live in the world; she experiences it. From her talk, it is apparent that she’s not afraid to ask someone for help in order to understand what they are an expert on. What better way is there to learn than to ask someone who is itching to share what they know? Picoult seems to have mastered the art of delving wholeheartedly into another person’s story to understand where they come from or why what they do is so important to them. And what better outlet to relate what she learns from her ability to immerse herself than in a book?
But why does Picoult write fiction about such controversial issues when she could write nonfiction to give her readers the cold, hard facts about a topic she has researched? Certainly, nonfiction wouldn’t mesh the facts with fiction by its very nature. Picoult explained as she finished her lecture:
“There’s something that fiction can do that nonfiction cannot,” Picoult said. “A lot people will not address a controversial subject in nonfiction, but they pick up a novel, and they think they’re being entertained, and almost by accident, by the time they close that last page, they realize they are being forced to re-evaluate whatever opinions they have when they started the book.... Where I believe that nonfiction has the obligation to chronicle the past and what has happened, fiction has the opportunity to change minds, change the future, and change the course of what will happen.”

2014-11-03,CMU,India,"Since we are now caught between two major fall holidays, let’s take time to reflect on their cultural significance.
As children, costumes and candy are the most exciting parts of Halloween. As we get older, Halloween costumes become vehicles for showcasing our “wild side” to friends and cohorts. The costumes get darker, the themes more mature, and, sometimes, they cross a line. In particular, racism and sexism creep into the picture.
Commercial Halloween costumes are primarily marketed to white people — see the models in any Halloween catalog — and often represent minorities offensively. Major Halloween outlets like Spirit Halloween and Party City have costume categories like “Cowboys & Indians” and “Geishas & Ninjas” (yes, grouped together) marketed to adults. The catch-all label “International Costumes” displays varying degrees of exoticism, in which each item falls into a funny-or-sexy dichotomy. 
This nonmutual expression of objectification amounts to fetishization and cultural appropriation because it does not recognize someone’s individuality or acknowledge any historical implications.
Racist costumes, whether inadvertent or intentional, are typically meant to be funny or sexy. Funny costumes are generally marketed to men, while sexy costumes are marketed to women as “exotic” alternatives to other hypersexualized costume choices. Sexualization of women on Halloween is its own issue; women should be free to choose sexy costumes if they wish, but sexy should not be the only socially acceptable option.
College women in particular are encouraged to “let loose” on Halloween. Culturally specific costumes for women are usually tight or scanty, and they promote an “exotic,” sexually alluring figure of femininity. This sexualization acts at the intersection of sexism and racism because it objectifies both women and cultures.
Otherness, in the sense of simplifying someone’s sociocultural identity, has its roots in imperialism and cultural appropriation. Aren’t Halloween costumes meant to be fun and entertaining? Racial stereotypes are inappropriate and offensive, especially when they are taken so lightheartedly. When you dress up as a cultural representation, you reduce that culture to a few negative, inaccurate elements. This is why Native American and Blackface costumes are so offensive — they exploit historical oppression without recognizing the suffering of the people being represented.
Though less visible, Thanksgiving celebrations are also rooted in racism. The Pilgrim narrative, in which Americans identify the long-suffering Pilgrim as the hero, demotes the Native American population to helpers who allowed the white Pilgrims to succeed.
The history of Native American genocide in our country is a harsh reality. Some Native Americans today do not participate in Thanksgiving, and instead recognize a National Day of Mourning. The Wampanoag people, among others, are calling attention to the misremembrance of this history and criticizing the fact that Thanksgiving has become a celebration of the Pilgrim narrative instead of honoring the Harvest Festival.
It is important to recognize the racism surrounding our celebrations. Too often we brush off cultural appropriation as “honoring” a custom we do not understand. Respect for another culture is not the same as wearing “foreign” garb or eating “ethnic” food. Even these phrases are part of the problem. When we celebrate Halloween and Thanksgiving, we need to be mindful of our behavior so as not to distort the true nature of these holidays..

2014-11-10,CMU,India,"It’s a 12-hour flight from the Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv to New York City, and from there, it’s at least a seven-hour car ride until you see the sun rise over the three rivers and 90 neighborhoods that make up the city of Pittsburgh. Nearly 6,000 miles away from the lands of their parents and grandparents, it is here that Chay Machluf and Hadeel Salameh are students on the campuses of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, respectively.
They go about their days just as you do: studying, sitting through hours of class, relaxing with their friends, and participating in campus culture. Nothing sets them apart from anyone else — nothing, that is, except for their unique perspectives that make the news that we read every morning much more real.
I wanted to seek out voices that know firsthand what this polarizing Palestinian-Israeli conflict looks like, especially given that it has received so much attention in Pittsburgh after Conflict Kitchen sparked controversy with its Palestinian menu. I wanted to seek out student voices to describe the view from the ground. Israeli and Palestinian respectively, Machluf and Salameh sat down with The Tartan to give us a glimpse into their worlds and how their experiences can inform a campus.
Chay Machluf
Machluf is a junior exchange student from Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel, studying electrical engineering and physics at Carnegie Mellon University for a semester. He’s tall, with thick dark hair, glasses, and a sense of intense intelligence.
At age 25, he’s older than most juniors, whether they’re from India, Japan, or the United States.
He’s not 20 going on 21 like the rest of us because when he graduated from high school, he spent the next three years in the Israeli Defense Force, like every other man over the age of 18 living in Israel. He worked with engineers during his term, and through that experience, was exposed to what would become his passion: electrical engineering.
“I love the concept of engineering as an idea: to acknowledge a product and turn it into something useful,” Machluf said. “I didn’t want to do mechanical engineering because it’s literally just the reinvention of the wheel. I want to be in unexplored territory.”
Machluf was drawn to Carnegie Mellon from Jerusalem, his hometown, which he calls “a very diverse place with lots of people from all over the world.” It’s hard for him to live in the present moment here in Pittsburgh, though, knowing that back in Jerusalem, his family remains in the midst of the conflict. “I know that the situation back home, in Jerusalem, isn’t the best. It makes me sad to know that my little sister is hesitant to use public transportation because of the fact that rocks are being thrown at it. It’s difficult not to be there for my family, to be unsure as to whether or not everyone is safe and out of harm’s way,” Machluf said.
Though he was initially worried about the culture shock that he would experience as an Israeli living in the United States for an extended period of time, Machluf has found that life isn’t that different at an American university compared to an Israeli one, despite what consumers of the sensationalized media coverage of his home country might think.
“I have a similar mindset to many of the people here. I’ve been able to connect with people who are as passionate as I am. The professors speak the same language as me: science.”
Part of what’s made the transition easy for him, he says, is the incredible Jewish community in Pittsburgh. “It’s been refreshing to be away from the tension and stress. It’s one of those things you don’t realize you deal with every day until you’re removed from them. I miss home, but Pittsburgh has been wonderful to me —  I really feel like I’ve been welcomed by the community and the people,” he said.
But, all the same, there are still stark, noticeable differences.
“The media here is very different from in Israel, which is understandable. Sometimes, I feel like information about foreign events is shut out and all the information isn’t given, and everyone just reacts in the way that they do based on what they believe and their opinions,” Machluf said.
He stressed that despite the heresy, he “doesn’t necessarily agree with the actions of my government. 
“No one agrees with them all the time regardless of where in the world, but the one thing I do know is that violence only leads to more violence — it hardly ever gets you the result you want. Just last week, a man was killed and several others were hurt when a terrorist ran them over with his car. Some of the papers only reported that the police shot and killed an Arab man, disregarding the reason for the action — neutralizing a terrorist.... There are so many versions of what’s going on. I don’t really think these [Americanized media versions] can be accurate, really. You can’t, really. It’s always more complicated than it seems.”
Hadeel Salameh
There is a small but flourishing town in Palestine, near the Jordanian border called Bidya. It’s more of a village than a town, with a population of about 8,000 people.
But among those people are the grandparents and countless cousins of University of Pittsburgh senior creative writing major Hadeel Salameh. Salameh travels to Palestine every summer to visit her family, but returns to Somerset, Pa. where she and her family make their home.
“For me, Palestine is the definition of beauty,” she said. “It’s so beautiful because although the people there are so economically poor and living such challenging lives, they’re always so happy, always smiling. The attitude of the people is so upbeat, so resilient all the time.”
Salameh says that when she returns from her trips to Palestine, she takes advantage of her privilege to make a difference. “I always come back, and I’m inspired to make a difference here. There are a lot of people, adults and young adults, there trying to do something about their conditions, but they can’t. They’re too restricted, she said.”
Her eyes light up and her hands gesture swiftly as she describes the plight of her family and friends in Palestine: fighting unreasonable laws that allow a two-year-old to be jailed for 20 years for throwing a rock, protecting a historic and religious landmark, and figuring out how to go to school on a campus that is riddled with rubber bullet attacks and tear gas canisters.
She stresses, however, that this conflict is just a small part of her identity as a Palestinian-American. “For years, I’ve struggled with my identity and my culture, what it means for me to be a Palestinian-American one generation removed. But it gives me a nice perspective,” Salameh said.
On campus, she serves as the president of Pitt Students for Justice in Palestine, an organization that promotes awareness of the disparity of justice in that area of the world. They work to hold events on campus that focus not on from where someone comes, but rather how people of different backgrounds can work together to achieve peace.
“People are always asking me what I think of Israelis. And I tell them that what I think of them is what I think of Americans, of Palestinians. They’re all people,” Salameh said. “It has nothing to do with people.... Palestinians and Israelis, for the most part, do not hate each other. It’s a political fight about land and expansion.”
Salameh is working on a novel about Palestine, and says that she wants to stress to the world that Palestinians are just people who want what everyone wants: security, happiness, and opportunity. “Sometimes, politics get in the way of us realizing that.”
Editor’s note: These two stories are part of a series focusing on members of the campus and the community who have a unique perspective on current events..

2014-11-10,CMU,India,"While America went right, Pennsylvania went left.
A frustrated America booted Democrats from both the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments during midterm elections last week, with Republicans now controlling the House and Senate for the last two years of President Barack Obama’s final term.
Yet this past Tuesday, Pennsylvanians chose Democrat Tom Wolf as the state’s new governor. Wolf ousted Republican Governor Tom Corbett in a historic election, making Corbett the first governor not re-elected in the history of the Keystone State since Pennsylvania allowed governors to run for consecutive terms. The Carnegie Mellon community contributed a respectable amount of votes in the midterm elections, joining Pennsylvania’s higher-than-expected voter turnout.
“We need to reestablish education as the priority,” stated Wolf at his victory rally in York, Pa.
A businessman from central Pennsylvania, Wolf defeated Corbett as approval ratings for the incumbent governor continued to drop.
For Wolf, the state’s public education system demands the most attention. Since the start of Corbett’s term as governor, the highly contested state education budget cuts incited a bold backlash from voters across the state. As stated by the University of Pittsburgh’s website, the state’s handling of the education budget has been a challenge for the school: “Pitt trustees have approved a $1.97 billion operating budget for the fiscal year that began on July 1, 2014. The University’s state funding remains at the same level as it was in 1995, in absolute dollars unadjusted for inflation. If inflationary adjustments are made, state support now is at its lowest level since Pitt became a public university in the mid-1960s.”
Corbett’s loss is a sharp contrast to the overwhelmingly successful elections of Republicans in state and federal governments in this midterm election. Corbett’s miscommunications with the public concerning the education budget cuts, among other issues, are recognized as the main reasons for his loss. Perhaps Corbett will be best remembered for permitting the legalization of gay marriage in Pennsylvania.
Wolf has never held public office before now. Previously, he directed his family’s building supplies company outside of Harrisburg for three decades. He received a doctorate in political science from MIT, and served with the Peace Corps in India. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Wolf spent $10 million dollars of his own money on his campaign, a significantly higher amount than that spent by his far more politically-experienced rivals. Wolf’s most aggressive campaigns against Corbett concerned the controversial education budget cuts.
Although Carnegie Mellon does not have a large number of enrolled students from Pennsylvania, voting turnout at the school proved solid. Four voting booths were set up on Tuesday in the CUC’s alumni lounge under the supervision of the Center and Allegheny County. 241 persons voted in the Pennsylvania elections at Carnegie Mellon. Another seven absentee ballots were counted, meaning seven persons voted in the elections from outside of the state.
According to Marcia Gerwig, the Director of the Cohon University Center, the voting system at Carnegie Mellon underwent changes to become more convenient for the community. Originally polling booths were positioned at the former Skibo building, with the booths relocated to the nearby city golf course during construction of the CUC. In 2008, student body requests for closer voting locations moved the booths back to campus.
The majority of Carnegie Mellon students hail from outside of the state, and 20 percent of students come from places outside of the United States. Still, Wolf’s administration will have an effect on Carnegie Mellon. His goals, he said after he was elected, are “to fund a world-class public education system, create family-sustaining jobs ... build safe communities, and keep Pennsylvania beautiful.”
Sophomore Casey Devine, a global studies major and Pittsburgh native, shared her thoughts on the race: “I followed the election and I did vote.... I think [Wolf] has a lot to offer. He is truly progressive in terms of women’s issues, the environment, and marriage equality and education, but I do think that he will be very challenged by the fact that he is facing a heavily Republican legislature.”
Also an undergraduate from Pittsburgh, sophomore computer science and English major Steve Epple voiced his concerns about the election. “You caught me. I didn’t vote. It is my eternal shame,” joked Epple. “That is not to say that I found Tom Wolf to be a particularly strong candidate. I was disappointed that he did not address the elephant in the room, the UPMC/Highmark split, during his campaign. I am also concerned about how he is going to handle education in Pennsylvania. While I believe investing in education to be of utmost importance, I am concerned by Wolf’s eagerness to reinstate Corbett’s cuts to the education system. I think the education system needs to be drastically reorganized before risking more money in an already struggling system... I appreciated his environmental platform and support his position on taxing natural gas manufacturing.”.

While working in an Indian coal mine, Johns Hopkins University researchers have determined the origins of the biological group Perissodactyla, a group including odd-toed animals with distinctive digestive systems like horses and rhinos. Ken Rose, a professor of functional anatomy and evolution at Johns Hopkins, originally led the team to explore Eocene sediments in Western India due to the proposal that Perissodactyla may have originated there. The team uncovered 54.5 million-year-old bones in an open-pit coal mine northeast of Mumbai, and determined the bones belonged to Cambaytherium thewissi, an animal intermediate between Perissodactyla and more primitive animals. This discovery may also provide clues about India’s geological separation from Madagascar and collision with Asia, according to Rose.

New blood test could provide early Alzheimer’s diagnosis
New research published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal suggests that a blood test detecting Alzheimer’s disease a decade before diagnosis might be possible. Researchers found a way to measure insulin resistance in the brain, which is a symptom indicative of Alzheimer’s disease. Although the sample size was small, researchers examined the blood of living Alzheimer’s patients and their blood samples taken up to ten years before their diagnosis. Based on an insulin receptor called IRS-1, researchers could tell which samples came from Alzheimer’s patients. Researchers hope to replicate these findings with a larger sample size. Commercial tests are not yet available.
The results of this research were presented at the Society for Neuroscience in Washington, D.C.

Scientists compare genomes of mice and humans
An international group of researchers has found strong evidence as to why certain processes in a mouse, such as its immune system, metabolism, and stress response, are different from those in humans while other processes are extremely similar. In a report published Nov. 19, the group detailed their findings, examining the genetics and biochemistry involved in regulating human and mouse genomes. The researchers compared gene transcription (how the genes are read) and chromatin (a protein that controls access to DNA) modification in both mice and humans. They found that there were differences in specific tissue and cell types. Now that they know which genes are conserved between mice and humans, geneticists say that a mouse is an excellent model for certain aspects of human biology.

Stanford and Brown students create biodegradable drone
Students primarily from Stanford University and Brown University teamed up with NASA to create a biodegradable drone made out of fungi. Made from mycelium, which is the vegetative part of a fungus, the body of the drone takes a week to grow in a special mold in the lab before being outfitted with motors and a circuit board. Currently, only the Styrofoam-like body is biodegradable, eventually turning into a gooey substance. However, the team is in the process of building a fully biodegradable circuit board with biodegradable motors and propellers. The hope is that these drones can be piloted into areas unsafe for humans — such as fire sites and nuclear reactors — and collect data. If the drone crashed, it would not create any waste since it is biodegradable, therefore leaving the environment unaffected.

CERN discovers two new subatomic particles
This week, CERN physicists announced the discovery of two new subatomic particles, labeled Xi_b’- and Xi_b*-, containing three quarks bound together by the strong force, making them a part of the baryon family. The particles were discovered thanks to roughly 750 scientists from around the world and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been running proton collisions since 2008. Previously, the quark model predicted the existence of these particles, but this is the first physical evidence of their existence. This discovery can help scientists further confirm the Standard Model of particle physics, which has become the indisputable model since the discovery of the Higgs boson.

2014-11-24,CMU,India,"There are perhaps few days greater in the life of a Carnegie Mellon student than the first one free from the shackles of Red 9. No longer confined to the boundaries of campus eateries, a student’s tongue is allowed to wander free amongst the tasty fields of the Pittsburgh food scene. While this sovereignty will initially manifest itself in piles of Dominos boxes and a fridge half-full of spoiled food, eventually one’s leash will be gently yoked by the call of the Margaret Morrison food trucks.
Considered by some to be the best-kept secret of Carnegie Mellon student life, the Margaret Morrison food trucks are a staple of many upperclassman and graduate student diets. Serving a wide variety of eastern foods — including Indian, Thai, Chinese, and Middle Eastern — the food trucks are an embodiment of Carnegie Mellon’s international atmosphere and diverse cultural spectrum. Now, with the Nov. 17 opening of Camión Mexicana Universidad (CMU), Margaret Morrison Street has welcomed the Western hemisphere and a delicious offering of burritos to its ever-faithful stomachs.
Walking down the line of trucks, you’ll know you’ve reached Camión Mexicana Universidad when you hear the salsa music. Covered in “authentic” Mexican decorations — including red pepper lights, a picture of Consuela from Family Guy and assorted stock photographs of Mexican food — the truck is as inviting as a food truck can be. A woman behind me in line one day mentioned that she felt like she was at a party. It was 18°F outside that day, so any positive emotion was certainly difficult to elicit from a customer. A testament to the power of salsa, perhaps?
Serving a simple menu of burritos, rice bowls, and hard-shell tacos, Camión Mexicana Unversidad is the perfect option for those looking to avoid the long trek to Chipotle in Oakland. Patrons have the option of a chicken, pork, ground beef, or vegetable/tofu burrito or rice bowl for $6.50. They can add grilled steak for an extra dollar. Pinto beans, salsa, rice, and cheese come in the burrito; sour cream and hot sauce are available upon request. One taco costs $2, two cost $4, and three cost $5 and come in either ground beef or veggie.
While there are tacos and bowls, everyone knows that there’s only one choice when burritos are on the menu: burritos. And man, Camión Mexicana Universidad has some good burritos. I’ve eaten food from the truck every day since the opening and have sampled a good portion of the burrito meat offerings. The ground beef burrito is your average ground beef burrito — nothing out of this world, but certainly tasty. The chicken is much of the same.
The pork, though, is something to talk about.
I don’t know if it’s possible for one’s life to truly be changed by a burrito, but the thought had never even entered my mind before I had this pork burrito. The pork is an interesting mix of sweet and tangy, and when you throw the hot sauce in there, things just get crazy. The fact that I live just across the street from this food truck will likely be the end of my checking account. (Guess what? They accept cards!)
For those with extra dollars to burn, the grilled steak is worth the upgrade. While it does not offer the same symphony of flavor as the pork, it holds up. The steak is good quality ­­— not too tough or laden with those “mysterious” qualities that street food patrons know all too well.
There is perhaps no other food as universally loved as the burrito. Who doesn’t love a good burrito? No one, that’s who.
Until last Monday, however, there was no way that students could indulge in the people’s food. 
Until last Monday, the only way one could procure “authentic” Mexican cuisine on campus was to trudge their way to either El Gallo de Oro in the Cohen University Center or Take Comfort in the Resnik House one day a week. The introduction of Camión Mexicana Universidad has brought the Carnegie Mellon culinary scene into a new era, one where everyone is happier because they can grab a burrito before class. Carnegie Mellon should perhaps take a lesson from the food trucks instead of stealing business from them with its own food truck, the Tartan Express. Camión Mexicana Universidad has done more in a week to make this campus a happier place than a million Mindfulness Rooms ever could, and that’s a fact.
Seriously, you should go out and try this pork burrito..

2015-01-26,CMU,India,"“Like my grandmothers, I refuse to be the ink that gives the white page a meaning,” wrote Allderdice High School senior Amma Ababio.
On the other side of the racial divide, “I sob because I can’t let the world treat everyone / as it will treat me,” wrote Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School student Isaac Monroe in his second-place poem, “I Have it Hard (That’s a Lie).”
Creative writing senior Michael Mingo described clandestine racism in a homogeneous town in first-place poem “Rural Vandalism.” In her second-place poem “To Lebanon,” junior psychology and French double major Siriana Abboud reflected on the memory of her native country: “You, my land, have raised me.” In his third-place poem, first-year creative and technical writing double major Joshua Brown wrangled with a different brand of difference and discrimination, writing, “When I was born, I came out swinging, / Prepared to beat back the savage stinging / Of this world’s brutal preoccupation / With my private passions.”
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, students, faculty, families, and community members convened in Rangos Ballroom for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Writing Awards, an annual event launched by Thomas Stockham Baker University Professor of English Jim Daniels in 1999, which encourages both local college and high school students to write about their experiences of racial discrimination or difference in memory of Dr. King, according to the call for submissions. First, second, and third place awards were given in four categories: college prose, high school prose, college poetry, and high school poetry.
Not only written word was featured at the ceremony: The event launched with powerful musical performances by students in the School of Drama, whose vocal talent, it seems, we so rarely get to hear. Their performances ranged from spirited to somber, from a pounding rendition of black spiritual anthem “Down by the Riverside” to a sobering spoken word poem that held the audience rapt: “This feels a lot like Selma,” the poem lamented about recent events in Ferguson and New York. “2015 feels like 1965.”
Following the performances, the winners commenced reading from their work, moving from college poetry to college prose categories. In third-place “Fair and Lovely,” junior psychology and creative writing double major Michelle Mathew spoke about discrimination against darker skin in her native India. In second-place “On Language,” first-year undeclared Dietrich College student Ellie Liu described losing her native Mandarin and watching her mother’s “attempts at accent-eradication.”
Junior chemistry and creative writing double major Sophie Zucker took to the podium last to read from her first place-winning essay, “The Washing.” Her hook, a description of a chemically extreme hair-straightening process called the Blowout — of which her mother is a devotee — seems, at surface level, unrelated to issues of race. The connection is subtle but significant, and becomes more overt as the piece goes on.
“It’s about how hair is racialized,” Zucker said in an interview. “Straight hair is seen as professional and socially acceptable; curly hair is seen as deviant.” Because it’s associated with people of color, curly hair is construed as exotic and low class — prompting many black women to straighten, weave, or otherwise alter their hair, from a “desire to emulate whiteness.”
Zucker said she started researching the natural hair movement in earnest during her senior year of high school, when one of her friends decided to go natural — and when Zucker herself was “trying to write about my identity in a more nuanced way.” While simultaneously learning about antisemitism and modern-day Judaism, Zucker watched Chris Rock’s documentary Good Hair  and read Malcolm X’s autobiographical descriptions of hair straightening in the African American community.
“ ‘We’re all just trying to look whiter,’ ” Zucker quoted her mother in her essay. “...‘Why do you think black women get weaves? Why do you think I straighten my hair? It’s not because it’s cheap or easy.’ ”
With the most emotionally resonant piece appropriately saved for last, first-place high school prose winner Ababio took the stage. Though her voice was firm, Ababio apologized in advance for her emotional delivery, and told the audience about her incredible struggle being thrust into American racial beauty standards as a young Ghanaian immigrant.
Ababio choked and came to tears while reading from her work. “I was disgusted by the coarseness of my hair, the hand-me-down clothes I wore, and especially the color of my skin,” wrote Ababio, who resorted to harsh skin lightening formula and baby powder in an attempt to whiten her skin. At this point in the reading, Ababio paused in earnest distress.
“It’s okay, baby,” a woman called from the audience.
As Ababio left the podium to the loudest applause yet, Daniels took the mic to propose they end the night in song. A single School of Drama student came to the stage to sing from the black national anthem, a ringing rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” It was slowed and powerful for its lack of instrumental company, and after the last belted note hit the ceiling, a few moments passed before anyone spoke..

2015-02-02,CMU,India,"See CON side of this debate here.
President Obama made history in India last week by becoming the first United States president to attend India’s Republic Day Parade as its chief guest. Held every year on the 26th of January since 1950, Republic Day commemorates India adopting its constitution to become a democratic republic.
Traditionally, the chief guests at these parades have been the heads of India’s old allies. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took on the role in 2014, French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007. As such, President Obama’s attendance signals a new era of strong alliance between India and the United States that will be highly beneficial to both countries.
Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed to enjoy each other’s company. From joking about how little sleep they get as heads of state to hosting a joint radio broadcast, they reveled in the attention of the Indian media circus, providing sound bite after sound bite. Modi referred to Obama as “Barack,” and spoke expressively about how he and Obama shared a personal chemistry. Obama, not to be outdone, greeted his audiences with a “Namaskaar” and found the time to try his hand at a famous Bollywood movie dialogue. As such, both Obama and Modi pulled out all the stops to create an image of intense personal camaraderie.
Grand gestures aside, the visit also included measurable progress. Both nations have similar concerns — from China’s assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region to terrorism in the Middle East and the threat of Climate Change — that were finally addressed as a team.
Several of these issues were addressed through a Joint Statement. In an oblique reference to China, the statement “affirmed the importance of safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over flight throughout the region, especially in the South China Sea.” The United States needs a strong regional partner to contain China to effect its  ""rebalance to Asia"" policy. For India to stake a credible regional claim of its own, it needs an ally as powerful as the United States.
On the topic of terrorism, Obama and Modi “stressed the need for joint and concerted efforts, including the dismantling of safe havens for terrorist and criminal networks, to disrupt all financial and tactical support for networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis.” India and the United States have both been victims of horrendous attacks from these organizations. Any kind of cooperation — from the sharing of intelligence to co-ordination of troops and equipment — is mutually beneficial.
The most substantial progress, however, was in clean energy. Massive hurdles in a dormant Indo-U.S. civil nuclear deal, signed in 2008, were cleared. An overreaching nuclear accident liability law in India was worked around through the establishment of a multimillion-dollar insurance pool.
A United States requirement that all nuclear exports to India be tracked in real time was waived since it was considered intrusive. This clears the way for Indian and United States companies to work together to set up nuclear power plants throughout India. This is very good news for energy-starved India, large parts of which receive electricity for less than the whole day, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is also very good news for the United States, now well positioned to become the primary supplier of India’s massive energy modernization drive. Finally, reducing India’s dependence on coal-fired plants is great for the environment and thereby beneficial to both countries.
Significant progress was also made in the field of defense exports and imports. The US is the world’s largest exporter of defense equipment, and India is the world’s largest importer of defense equipment, according to the International Business Times. Even so, historically, defense trade between the two countries has been depressingly anemic.
However, this past week agreements have been signed between the United States and India that allow for the coproduction of weapons, as well as the transfer of technology to India that allow weapons designed in the US to be manufactured in India. Besides being another massive boost to trade, the export of manufacturing capability of defense equipment to India is particularly significant as it implies a trust that extends beyond the civilian realm and into the highly sensitive realm of defense.
Obama’s visit to India represents the final realization of a relationship that seems only natural. Both countries have been stable democracies since their inception. Both countries are home to people from a multitude of ethnicities and religions. As such, both countries have a deep respect for secular thought and are home to a wide swathe of often oppositional views. Finally, people in both countries enjoy freedom of speech, and can openly and publicly speak out for or against those in power without fear of retribution. Culturally and ideologically, there could hardly be two closer large countries than India and the United States, and these new, stronger Indo-U.S. ties will prove highly beneficial to both nations..

2015-02-02,CMU,India,"See the PRO side of this debate here.
I’ve been wary of Narendera Modi ever since he came into office as the prime minister of India, and Obama’s recent visit to India and the blossoming relationship between the two countries just confirmed my uneasiness.
Modi is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party in India. Before running for prime minister, he was the chief minister of a state called Gujarat, which is equivalent to a governor of a state here. While in charge of Gujarat, he made great progress with infrastructure within the state, getting electricity and water to more people than ever before. But when riots broke out between religious Hindu nationalists and Muslims following the destruction of a Muslim tinderbox, Gujarat soon gained international recognition for another reason. After the burning of a train that was filled with Hindu pilgrims, the riots soon turned into an almost all-out massacre of thousands of Muslims.
Modi did not do anything to stop the violence while in power. He ordered officials to take no action against rioters, and was complicit in the dismissal of many police and court cases against Hindu rioters, according to The New York Times. On top of all of this, there are also allegations that Modi was actually actively perpetuating the violence against Muslims. The United States actually imposed travel restrictions on Modi during this time for his role in the riots. Even so, he was eventually re-elected as chief minister on a platform of uniting Hindus, largely around a fear of Muslims.
With the United States’ own shaky history with Islam and the Middle East, this closer relationship between the United States and India is incredibly worrisome. It might be great for both countries individually, but not for the international Muslim community as a whole or other countries, especially Pakistan and China.
India and Pakistan have had a long and violent history, starting and ending with the conflict over the border in the Kashmir region. U.S.–Pakistan relations have been shaky ever since 9/11, and have increasingly worsened after the death of Osama Bin Laden. On one hand, we found him in their country, which brings into question their commitment to eradicating terrorism in the region, but on the other hand we stepped all over Pakistan’s sovereignty as a nation by sending in a SEAL team and killing someone on their soil without even consulting them.
Pakistan’s foreign policy chief Sartaj Aziz warned of “India’s dangerous desire to create a space for war,” while Sherry Rahman, a former Pakistani information minister added, “Relations between India and Pakistan are in tatters,” according to The Wall Street Journal. Ever since Modi came to power, this has definitely been the norm. Peace talks have been called off and Pakistan’s attempts to revive dialogue have been rebuffed, all while Modi continues to accuse Islamabad of not taking enough action against terrorists. Meanwhile, there is growing aggravation that Obama has now visited India twice during his presidency but has not visited Pakistan even once. China, however, has been reaching out to Pakistan more and more.
While Modi and Obama were hugging in New Delhi, Pakistan’s army chief was on an official visit to Beijing. China is also regarding the U.S.–India relationship with vague suspicion, according to The New York Times. During Modi’s talks with Obama, the security quadrilateral he proposed included the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, which was worrying to China.
The South China Sea conflict, and China’s recent inflammatory moves in the region, were other topics of the talks. At Obama’s urging, Modi signed a statement criticizing China for how it handled the situation. There is also the threat that will result from the United States increasing sales of military technology to India. This development comes right after China lost its hold as India’s number one trade partner, a huge blow to China and worrisome for the nation on the security front.
Improving Indo–U.S. relations are great for both nations, and as an Indian-American, I’m happy to see the countries’ relations growing and forming in a new direction, but I’m still very wary of the public and overt way that this is happening, especially because both countries have had many issues regarding Islamaphobia in the very recent past, and both countries are now in the position to be extremely influential on the international stage. I just hope their influence is a good one..

2015-02-09,CMU,India,"If you’re searching for a warm, exotic haven from Pittsburgh winter, look no further: This past weekend, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens said goodbye to its exhibit featuring Indian flora, and welcomed in its place the tropical forests of the Congo. Though the plants were truly phenomenal, they are not the number one highlight. The true star of the show is really the ingenious display of humans’ interactions with nature in the Congo. The signs explaining the surroundings that line the pathways through the exhibit highlight all the ways that the plants of the Congo are necessary for the survival of the indigenous people. They emphasize that to these tribes; trees, bushes, and flowers are not just decoration; they are food, shelter, medicine, and tools. Educational stations along the way offer hands-on demonstrations showing how useful these plants can be. A market full of coffee, peanuts, plums, and other goods explains how their diets are almost entirely dependent on what grows around them. Further down the path, visitors find an interactive exhibit showcasing two examples of typical shelters built from plants by the indigenous people. There, a volunteer points to a vine looped around the plant canopy. She explains that the people of the Baka tribe crush up the vine so that when they dip it in the water, it releases a chemical then prevents fish from absorbing any oxygen. They float to the top and dinner is served.
The volunteer also explained that the entire exhibit — the product of years of research — came together in just a week. This room in Phipps Conservatory rotates exhibits only once every four years so that the rest of the time can be spent preparing for the next one. Years of studying both people and plants led up to a trip to Cameroon where Curator of Horticulture Ben Dunigan and Exhibit Coordinator Jordyn Melino spent time learning about the area. It was important for the accuracy of the exhibit that both Dunigan and Melino developed an intimate understanding of the region’s plant life and people. They then amassed seeds and plants from nurseries all over the country, and even some from Nigeria, to complete the collection of plants to display. Finally, teams spent the past week bringing it all together.
Phipps celebrated the opening with an array of activities and shows that accommodated visitors of all ages and interests. There were children in strollers, older people using walkers, and every age group in between. Every hour brought new fun including a drum show, a discussion on herbal medicine, and dance performances. Some attractions were available all throughout the day. There were masks to decorate, plants to pot, and food to sample, including some citrus water, coffee, bites of pineapple, and — the star — an authentic African Jambalaya. But you don’t need all the activities to appreciate the beauty of the exhibit. The next time you’re desperate to escape the tundra that is Pittsburgh in the winter, take a trip to Phipps — admission is free for Carnegie Mellon students — and treat yourself to an afternoon in the Congo. .

2015-02-16,CMU,India,"As each season comes to a close, NFL coaches fly around the league’s sidelines as teams attempt to find a new face to manage their personnel. This year was no different, as seven teams will begin the 2015 season with a new head coach. The various hires are listed here from worst hire to best.
Denver Broncos: Gary Kubiak
Most recent job: Offensive Coordinator (OC), Baltimore Ravens; Career wins-losses as a head coach: 61–64
This hire is somewhat confusing. The Broncos might be preparing for a future without quarterback Peyton Manning as we once knew him, but none of the Bronco’s personnel is proven in Kubiak’s zone blocking scheme, and the team was built to pass anyways. The Broncos’ success waned rapidly as they shifted to a running-focused attack at the end of last season, culminating in a playoff loss to the vastly inferior Indianapolis Colts. Now they hired a coach who is known for his running strategy and not much else. This hire is just confusing.
Chicago Bears: John Fox
Head Coach (HC), Denver Broncos; 118–89
John Fox clearly has a knack for developing defensive talent, which makes him quite a good fit with Chicago’s barren roster in a vacuum. The Panthers and Broncos teams both improved vastly on defense every season with him at the helm. The problem here is with John Fox on the sideline: he is absolutely atrocious as a game manager. He consistently makes needlessly conservative play calls that have cost his teams high profile games (re-watch the Broncos vs. Ravens playoff game from 2013 and try not to cringe as Fox attempts to run the clock out rather than have Peyton Manning try for the win). He is a mess with the timeouts, often burning them to do things like ice kickers rather than strategically stop the clock or substitute players on the field. Fox also tends to challenge at horrible moments, seemingly throwing his challenge flag the first two times he disagrees with a call rather than waiting for high leverage moments with lots of yards involved where winning the challenge might actually matter. Given this Bears’ team’s defensive woes, John Fox was probably a decent hire, but not a good one.
San Francisco 49ers: Adam Tomsula
Defensive Coordinator (DC), San Francisco 49ers
This is a sensible hire. It is unfortunate that we don’t get to see Jim Harbaugh’s creativity and exquisite abilities for player development in the NFL anymore, but his relationship with the front office broke down so publicly and uncomfortably that a change was probably necessary. 
Tomsula is a solid defensive coordinator, consistently developing talent and putting together a string of successful seasons. Many of the players who leave the 49ers defense, such as Buccaneers safety Dashon Goldson and Browns safety Donte Whitner, go flame out on lesser teams, so he seems to understand how to maximize a player’s talent. We know nothing about his offensive acumen, and historically there is a learning curve for coordinators in their first head coaching job. However, hiring in-house means there will be some continuity and there’s certainly potential for this decision to look very good very quickly.
Atlanta Falcons: Dan Quinn
DC, Seattle Seahawks
There are certainly things to like about Quinn’s head coaching potential. He is a fantastic play caller, and has a plethora of signature games to point to if one questions his defensive strategies, including Super Bowl XLVIII. This has the potential to be a great coaching hire, since the Falcons have some defensive talent in players like cornerback Desmond Trufant, just not enough to build a functional NFL defense. The Falcons will improve vastly if Dan Quinn is merely a bad coach, as former head coach Mike Smith had to be the worst tactician in the NFL, constantly blowing every single opportunity he had to change the game from the sidelines. The problem here is that Quinn succeeded with a very specific team building style in Seattle. Atlanta does not have close to a similar roster. Quinn will presumably continue to be excellent from the sidelines, but it’s possible that his schemes may be an awkward fit for a year or two.
New York Jets: Todd Bowles
DC, Arizona Cardinals
Todd Bowles just turned in a season for the ages with Arizona. Defensive talent dropped like flies, as the Cardinals were probably at less than 50 percent strength for most of the season. However, for the first ten weeks of the year, Bowles ran one of the three best defenses in the league. This shows schematic flexibility and a keen eye for reaction. While the Jets have not had a functional offense since quarterback Brett Favre spent a year in green, the defense was actually a bigger problem last year. There is absolutely no talent on the roster defensively outside of defensive linemen Sheldon Richardson and Mohammed Wilkerson. Bowles’s success with unfamiliar faces could help rebuild the defense, making it much easier to create an offense.
Oakland Raiders: Jack Del Rio
DC, Denver Broncos; 68–71
The future in Oakland is… bright? Jack Del Rio does not get enough credit for how great of a job he did in Jacksonville. If it weren’t for an unfortunate injury in week 17 to quarterback David Garrard, Del Rio would have reached the playoffs in three consecutive years with the moribund franchise. 
Del Rio managed to build top ten defenses nearly every year there, and the offenses were functional if not great. People forget how great those 2007 Jaguars were, and that at halftime it felt like they might topple the mighty and undefeated Patriots. The 2005 Jaguars were a great team as well, and these squads always seemed as if they were teetering on the precipice of something great while producing tons of productive players including players with very little pedigree before entering the NFL.  This bodes well for Oakland, which has a fairly young core of talent.
Now, Del Rio, who is particularly good at coaching linebackers, will have young linebackers Khalil Mack and Sio Moore under his tutelage. Both are among the NFL’s most productive linebackers despite being very unpolished. There’s no reason to believe Del Rio can’t turn that raw talent into superstardom. Add in his success at turning mediocre talents like Garrard into decent contributors, and there is potential that Del Rio can turn quarterback Derek Carr, who was better than most give him credit for in a bumpy rookie season, into something special.
Del Rio could take this franchise in the right direction for the first time in over a decade.
Buffalo Bills: Rex Ryan
HC, New York Jets; 46–50
Ryan really got the short end of the stick at the Meadowlands. He was scapegoated as a reason for the Jets’ offensive woes, and his boisterousness with the media got him publicly labeled as a distraction. Of course, neither of these things make sense. Ryan was largely frozen out of personnel decisions, and he never even had an average team. The two Jets teams he dragged to the AFC Championship Game were mediocre squads at best, optimized by Ryan’s defensive schemes. 
Ryan catches lots of flak for not being able to develop a Jets’ franchise quarterback, but it is hard to see his options approaching that label. For what it’s worth, quarterback Mark Sanchez was slightly more productive in New York than he was under supposed quarterback guru Chip Kelly in Philadelphia. Don’t let Ryan’s record fool you: an average coach would probably top out at six wins per year rather than eight with the talent Ryan was given, and this year’s Jets team might’ve been one of the least talented in league history. This Bills team in particular, however, is a much better version of the 2010 Jets Rex Ryan coached so successfully. 
A more talented run game and defense will help disguise the lack of a solid quarterback, as will wide receiver Sammy Watkins, who is very talented. Ryan’s hire is exciting for an improving Bills team..

2015-02-16,CMU,India,"Earliest fossils of ancestral mammals discovered
Two newly discovered fossils of ancestral mammals help demonstrate the possibility of a wide range of ecological diversity in early mammals. The two fossils, Agilodocodon scansorius and Docofossor brachydactylus, were discovered in northeastern China and belong to creatures called docodonts, an evolutionary group that diverged from the mammalian branch and became extinct. 
Agilodocodon, which lived around 165 million years ago, had curved claws on its hands and feet to climb trees, and its limb proportions are similar to those of modern-day animals that live in trees. Paleontologists have found that its teeth are most suited for a diet of tree gum and sap. 
Docofossor, which lived around 160 million years ago, had shovel-like fingers for digging and teeth that suggested it foraged underground. Its proportions are strikingly similar to the modern African golden mole. 
The dating on the fossils suggests they coexisted with the dinosaurs.
Papers regarding the fossils were published independently in Science on Feb. 13 by international teams of scientists from the University of Chicago and Beijing Museum of Natural History.

The notes of Alan Turing, a mathematician who played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II, were found in Bletchley Park, Britain’s code-breaking center. The papers were found stuffed inside holes in the ceiling of Hut 6, Turing’s workplace; Turing and his team appeared to be using them as draught excluders.
The notes were discovered in 2013 during a multimillion-dollar restoration project of Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and they were recently released to the public. 
Amongst the notes were “Banbury sheets,” long sheets of paper with holes punched in them to compare different ciphers. Turing used these Banbury sheets to speed up the decryption of Nazi messages.
“Discovering these pieces of code-breaking ephemera is incredibly exciting and provides yet more insight into how codebreakers worked,” Bletchley Park Trust chief executive, Iain Stander, said in a statement. 
The notes, along with other artifacts found at Bletchley Park, will be displayed in a new exhibition called “The Restoration of Historic Bletchley Park” in Hut 12.

Late-night screen time alters body’s natural clock
A new study from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts shows that individuals who read off of a screen such as an iPad before sleeping have a more difficult time going to sleep and wake up feeling groggier than individuals who don’t.
The study consisted of six male and six female volunteers in their mid 20s who, for a two-week period, alternated between reading off of iPads and printed books four hours before a bedtime of 10 p.m. each night. The researchers found that subjects took nearly ten minutes more to fall asleep, and spent less time in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, after reading on iPads than they did when they were reading printed books. They also took longer to become alert in the morning, which could result in negative effects in the real world.
Exposure to light at night disrupts the body’s internal clock by suppressing melatonin, a hormone used as a sleep aid, so the study’s results are consistent with what experts would expect. Some experts did note that using a bright light while reading a paper book could have the same effect.  The researchers reported their findings January 27th in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Eight million tons of plastic dumped in ocean yearly
A groundbreaking study published in Science this week quantifies how much garbage flows into the world’s oceans every year. Previously, scientists estimated how much garbage was in the ocean by taking sample counts of plastic on the surfaces of large garbage patches in each of the world’s oceans. A study last year estimated the amount of floating trash to be 245,000 tons at most.
This study, lead by Jenna Jambeck, an Environmental Engineer from the University of Georgia, combines population and economic data from 192 coastal countries bordering the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans in addition to the Black and Mediterranean Seas to show that, of the 245 million tons of garbage accumulated by these countries annually, 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastic flows into the oceans. 
The study also names the top twenty countries generating the most ocean-bound trash; China is first, and the United States is twentieth.
Since the gap between plastic floating on the ocean’s surface and plastic flowing into the ocean is so wide, scientists now have to figure out where else it is collecting and in what amounts in order to close the gap.

First stars in the universe born later than thought
New maps from the European Space Agency’s satellite, Planck, revealed “polarized” light from the early Universe.
Previously, scientists determined how old the Universe was by examining the Cosmic Microwave Backgroud (CMB) fossil light remaining from a time when the Universe was hot and dense after the Big Bang. Planck studied this light in great detail between the years 2009 and 2013.
“After the CMB was released, the Universe was still very different from the one we live in today, and it took a long time until the first stars were able to form,” explains Marco Bersanelli of Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy. “Planck’s observations of the CMB polarisation now tell us that these ‘Dark Ages’ ended some 550 million years after the Big Bang – more than 100 million years later than previously thought.” While 100 million years seems negligible compared to the Universe’s age of almost 14 billion years, it makes a significant difference when it comes to the formation of the first stars.
This new data has many effects besides an understanding of when the first stars were formed. It could lead to discoveries regarding dark matter, neutrinos and the stucture of the Galactic magnetic field.

Protein treatment fights Alzheimer’s symptoms
A recent paper published in the Journal of Neuroscienceby lead author Dena Dubal discusses how manipulating the protein levels associated with memory can delay Alzheimer’s symptoms. Dubal, Assistant Professor of Neurology from the University of California, San Fransisco, and her team work with klotho, a transmembrane protein associated with longevity.
Previous research indicated that increasing klotho levels in the brains of healthy mice also increased cognitive function. Dubal’s team then increased klotho levels in the brains of mice who also expressed large amounts of amyloid-beta and tau, proteins associated with the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Her team found that, even with these toxic proteins, the mice with elevated klotho levels were able to retain cognitive function.
The team says that they would need to further investigate the mechanism behind this cognitive preservation before it is possible to treat humans in the future.
The next stages of this research involves identifying and testing drugs that affect klotho levels or are able to simulate klothos effects.

2015-02-23,CMU,India,"Tuesday marks the series finale of Parks and Recreation on NBC, and I’ll be very sorry to say goodbye to Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). While Parks and Rec has a strong ensemble cast and witty writing, it is Leslie’s strength that drives the show. The town of Pawnee, Indiana is flawed and absurd, but Leslie shows us what a feminist can look like in 21st Century middle America.
Initial reviews of the show construed Leslie as ditzy, but show writers quickly corrected that perception. By the third season, Leslie had earned our respect as a smart, talented, impressive woman. The show has continued to grow in popularity, with icons like Ron Swanson. While I adore Ron, you can’t talk about Parks and Recreation without talking about Leslie Knope. While Ron advises to “never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing,” Leslie “whole-asses” everything she does.
Leslie is unapologetic in her pursuits. She typifies servant leadership as a member of the local parks department, then as a city councilor, and eventually as the head of the National Parks Service in the Midwest. Her progression is met with adversity and small defeats, but she deals with obstacles as they appear. She perseveres in the face of workplace sexism. The show doesn’t shy away from difficult topics, like the racist murals on the walls of city hall that were some of my favorite recurring items in its first two seasons.
This final season takes place in 2017, a 3-year jump from the end of season six. Leslie has had triplets in the meantime (named after Supreme Court justices!), but the season is not about Leslie’s struggle balancing family with her career. She acknowledges it, but the season arc is more about Leslie’s work and friends. Motherhood becomes a part of who she is, and not a definition of what she is. When Ben launches a campaign for Congress, the pair recognizes the ridiculous cultural expectations related to the “campaign wife” image, and instead maintains their egalitarian relationship dynamic.
As a human being, Leslie is flawed. Over the course of the series, we learn that her home is a “scary hoarder’s nest” and that she has neurotic tendencies about binders. Sometimes her insanely high standards are unfairly projected onto others. What makes Leslie admirable is that she attains professional success while maintaining her status a real person. She is unashamed of her love for breakfast food and has a wall of inspirational women in her office. These hidden passions make Leslie’s enthusiasm seem a little less exhausting and a lot more believable.
Leslie supports her lady friends, and not just on Galentine’s Day. She fights for their happiness in a way that television shows rarely display, instead preferring the jealousy narrative or putting women into stereotyped supporting roles. In my own life, female best friends have been irreplaceable bastions of support. It is reassuring that Leslie is never self-conscious about showing her affection for her best friend or hoping that it is reciprocated. The devotion between Leslie and Ann (Rashida Jones) is immensely validating.
Other women on the show demonstrate that empowerment can mean something unique for everyone. Donna (Retta) pursues business ownership while recognizing the importance of taking time to “treat yo’ self.” April’s (Aubrey Plaza) façade of hating the world actually demonstrates how fiercely she feels about those she loves. Just as importantly, the men on the show recognize the power of the women in their lives. They support them as individuals, not as objects or inferiors.
Most importantly, Leslie Knope exemplifies the modern feminist. She is aggressive and passionate, but as a #bossbitch and not a #bitchboss (to use Donna’s turn of phrase). She is an actual boss — people report to her and respect her ideas. She surrounds herself with a team that respects her as a human being. She is the hardest worker in Pawnee and loves what she does. Still, she asks us to remember what’s important in life: “Friends, waffles, work. Or waffles, friends, work. But work is third.” Goodbye, Leslie. Ovaries before brovaries..

2015-03-01,CMU,India,"Junior tennis player Yuvraj Kumar has come a long way from his beginnings as a player, both figuratively and literally. 
The decision science and policy management major from New Delhi, India is a force to be reckoned with both on and off the courts.
Kumar first became interested in tennis when he was around five years old. “My dad used to play competitively, so his drive sort of passed down onto me,” Kumar said. 
While he played a variety of sports — including cricket, basketball, and soccer — tennis was the sport he went into with a competitive mindset. 
His prowess with the sport only grew with time, taking him to competitions around and outside of the country. 
His proudest moment during this time came when he participated in the Junior Asia Cup as a member of the Indian men’s team.
When the time came to choose a school, he said he wanted a place where he was more than just an athlete: “Academics were in the backseat when I was younger, but they became very important to me by the time I got older.”
Kumar knew he wanted to go to school in the U.S., but he didn’t know exactly where. 
Kumar looked at various Division I schools but quickly decided that they would be too one-sided. 
As he expanded his search, he found in Carnegie Mellon a place where he believed he could get a multi-dimensional experience. 
He welcomed the opportunity for rigorous academic challenges, a motivated team atmosphere, and a wealth of extracurricular activities.
Kumar started playing with the tennis team a week after stepping on campus for the first time as a freshman. 
He remembered how thrilling winning his first big match against Amherst College was. “From the start, we were a tight-knit team,” Kumar said.
From then on, he found himself improving in both singles and in doubles. His current singles record of 20-13 is only getting better, and his doubles record stands at 23-16. His chemistry with his teammates has grown considerably. 
“The team has gotten a lot more dedicated, driven, and passionate,” Kumar said, citing the strong team-oriented focus all the members have.
He has done particularly well with senior mechanical and biomedical engineering major Bryce Beisswanger; they earned spots on the All-UAA Second Team for the 2012-2013 year and were ranked eighth regionally in doubles for the 2013-2014 year.
Off the courts, Kumar has dedicated time for both the full Carnegie Mellon academic workload and various other commitments.
He is a proud member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, and he’s spent a good amount of time involved in the Lunar Gala. “I just wanted to embrace the full college experience,” he said. 
He believes that coming to Carnegie Mellon has been one of the best decisions he has made, considering it to be a great privilege to be at a renowned university with so many dedicated people.
Even though he still has a good amount of time left at Carnegie Mellon, Kumar has already set his eyes towards the future.
He wants to work in the finance industry to gain corporate experience. 
Afterwards, he wants to be able to start and run his own company, a dream that is coming closer to becoming a reality with each passing day. 
However, he certainly won’t let his professional dreams keep him away from his favorite sport. “Tennis will be a part of my life no matter where I go.”.

2015-03-23,CMU,India,"Before starting Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, I was ready to jump on another comedy show. Each time I opened Netflix over break, the front page screamed at me with the show’s aggressively bright promo, tagged with the line “Created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock.” I suppose that’s what got me to watch the show in the first place — Tina freaking Fey, star of 30 Rock and cast member and writer for Saturday Night Live. It was going to be amazing.
But then I actually watched it. For background, the show follows Kimmy Schmidt, one of the “Indiana Mole Women,” a group of women who were kept locked in a bunker by a cult leader. The women are rescued one day, a bystander’s testimony gets auto-tuned and goes viral, and the women become celebrities in their hometown and across America. Deprived of her formative teen years, Kimmy decides to stay in New York on a whim, fending for herself with little knowledge of current culture.
Only one season is available on Netflix right now with a total of 13 episodes less than half an hour each. I breezed through it within a day (which says a lot about my binge-watching habits, I guess), and while there were some laughs here and there, my reaction for most of the season was basically, “Haha! ... what?”
While the show has numerous funny moments and one-liners, there are other situations and setups that are borderline insensitive. I say borderline because, to be honest, I’m not sure whether they cross the line into offensive territory, even if the show’s writers tried to make light of murkier topics. The fact that the show pokes fun at women who were kidnapped and detained for 15 years and forced to believe that the world had ended by a charismatic cult leader is pretty dark (the situation is vaguely reminiscent of the Ariel Castro kidnappings that made national headlines back in 2013).
The show also sometimes successfully and comedically addresses race issues, but other times doesn’t. Kimmy’s best friend Titus, a gay black man who’s trying to make it in New York’s show business, gets harassed by a construction worker and notes, “Oh, I’m not even gonna know which box to check on the hate crime form.” I laughed a lot at Titus’s remarks, and his weird, random music video “Pinot Noir.” Titus is unapologetically funny, and is quick to call out others on wrongdoing. When the women who were kidnapped are discovered, a news screen can be seen with large, bold words “white women found” at the bottom of the screen, followed by a much smaller line of text reading “Hispanic woman also found,” referring to Donna Marie Nuñez (played by Sol Miranda). On the other hand, another character, Jacqueline Voorhees (played by Jane Krakowski) hides her Native American heritage by dying her hair blond and wearing blue contacts. While this pokes some fun at white privilege, since Jacqueline actively seeks to live a wealthy lifestyle in New York, the fact that the actress who plays her is blatantly white doesn’t make each scene with her any less awkward. In the season finale, Jacqueline attacks a marching band mascot after realizing she can’t hide from her past. She crushes the head of the costume — a Native American head — and proceeds to howl to the sky. It’s a bizarre situation, and ultimately a bizarre, distastefully done subplot.
That being said, the cast actors embody each character so well that I couldn’t imagine anyone else playing their parts. Ellie Kemper (from The Office) plays the naive and overly excited Kimmy Schmidt effortlessly. Tituss Burgess (Titus) and Jane Krakowski (Jacqueline) depict a level of shallowness and self-absorption that only they could pull off. And of course, Jon Hamm plays the gorgeous and frustratingly charismatic cult leader Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has received an overwhelmingly positive response from critics and audience members alike, but it has some unforgivable shortcomings. The show still has a lot of potential, and I hope that it improves in its second season so that viewers don’t have to think, “Is it okay to laugh at this?” throughout each episode..

2015-03-23,CMU,India,"Evan Wineland and Connie Yang
Junior information systems major Evan Wineland is running for Student Body President with sophomore math major Connie Yang as his Student Body Vice President running mate.
The pair is running on a platform of raising student wages, improving student-faculty connections, and providing more opportunities to experience Pittsburgh.
Wineland and Yang propose to increase the current campus minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $11 per hour by 2020, citing current hourly rates of $12 at Yale University, $13.25 at Stanford University, and $10 at Harvard University, among others. They argue that raising the wage will allow students to work fewer hours to become more involved elsewhere.
They also propose instituting student-faculty lunch programs, in which students can engage with faculty outside of the classroom. They hope to connect students better to the faculty who teach them by following models similar to those offered at Dartmouth College and Duke University.
Finally, they are pushing to give students more access to Pittsburgh with proposed events like a Craig Street Crawl, similar to the first Senate Strip District Crawl at the start of the school year, as well as routine discounts at various businesses for Carnegie Mellon Students.
“We are the only ticket that can claim that it has made tangible progress on every single item in our platform,” Wineland said via email. “Connie and I have been meeting with students, Warner Hall administrators, and city officials about our ideas since January.... We were pleased that in the debates last Friday, our platform stood out as the only one with clear ideas and concrete plans for execution.”
Wineland is currently the chair of Student Senate and a resident assistant in West Wing. He is involved with the Student Government Executive Committee, the President’s Student Advisory Council, and Highland Ambassadors. He is also a member of the Survivor Support Network and a brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Yang is involved in the current SBP’s cabinet, the CMU math team, Women in Science, the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, CMU in Haiti, and Kappa Alpha Theta. She is also a GroupX instructor, chair of the university’s Proud to be Plaid committee, and a webpage designer for the Econobite project.
“My experience in Senate and in [Student Government] was perfectly complemented by [Connie’s] background working in the current Student Body President’s cabinet,” Wineland said in the email. “Having very different extra-curricular backgrounds means we’ve connected with a wide diversity of students on campus.”
Fun Facts
Wineland has been to the Middle East twice this year, most recently on the IMPAQT Spring Break trip to the CMUQ campus in Doha, Qatar.
Yang likes webpage and app development, math competitions, and did seven years of Tae Kwon Do before coming to Carnegie Mellon.
Divya Kothandapani and Mark Whiting
Junior electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani is running for Student Body President with third year Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering Mark Whiting as her Student Body Vice President running mate.
Kothandapani and Whiting are running on a platform of creating more transparency between administration and the student body, connecting students across majors, years, and clubs, and improving the student experience.
The pair proposes to increase transparency between administrators and the student body by instituting newsletters from Carnegie Mellon governing bodies illustrating such things as renovations, tuition increases, and transportation options. They also plan to publicize initiatives frequently and provide listening opportunities through resources like surveys, town halls, and individual conversations.
To increase connections between students and improve school spirit, the pair proposes improved phone apps and digital calendars for campus events. They also suggest more activities to bring together the entire campus community and more ways for graduate students and undergraduates to have the same opportunities for campus activities.
To improve the student experience and make campus safer, Kothandapani and Whiting, among a number of initiatives, want to begin recognizing non-academic achievements, streamlining student organization and activities processes, and providing more ways for college spirit to permeate across the student body. 
They also want all major committees to be focused on both the undergraduate and graduate experience.
“We represent the two largest groups on campus: undergraduates and graduates,” Kothandapani said. “With the varying range of needs and concerns from the graduate population, it is difficult to truly understand the graduate perspective unless you are a graduate student yourself. As a [graduate student], Mark will properly advocate on behalf of this group.”
Kothandapani is currently the student body vice president for finance and contributes to the current student body president’s advisory council and board of directors. 
She was previously chair of Senate’s business affairs committee, and is a Mudge House mentor. She is a member of the CIT Community Building Committee.
Whiting is the Graduate Student Assembly’s vice president for finance and the chief financial officer for the National Association of Graduate and Professional Students. He was previously an officer in the Explorers Club and an executive consultant for Public Communication for Researchers.
“We also both have extensive background and knowledge about campus finances and operations at both the undergrad and grad levels,” Kothandapani said. “Understanding how CMU’s finances work, where money can be pulled from, and how to best request funding resources puts us at an incredible advantage.”
Fun Facts
Kothandapani owns a farm in India with over 1,200 coconut trees. Fresh coconut water is her favorite drink.
Whiting has traveled to more countries than years the average Carnegie Mellon student has lived. He was born in France, but is Australian. However, he has lived in Korea longer than France or Australia.
JR Marshall and Jibby Ayo-Ani
Junior policy and management and Chinese studies double major JR Marshall is running for Student Body President (SBP) with running mate Jibby Ayo-Ani, a junior information systems major who hopes to become the Student Body Vice President. 
They are running on a platform focused on creating a more inclusive campus culture to represent all 13,000 students on campus, and help set the school on the path to being widely considered equal to other large name universities both inside and outside of the Ivy League.
“Our platform is also long term and short term. We believe the university is at ... a turning point in its history,” Marshall said. “It could become a household name. This is a focal year — this is a year where Student Government and the student body are going to determine if we get on that path.”
“We really centered our platform around where we believe this campus can go,” Ayo-Ani said of their goals. “We really want to provide a very deliverable platform.”
Based on the phrase “Reorient, Empower, Serve,” their goals include creating a “Reorientation Day” where students would take a day off from classes toward the middle of the semester. The day would be used to promote mindfulness and allow students to reflect on their time at the school. 
Other key planks of their platform include an increase in the frequency of the school’s shuttles and more routes taking students to more regions of the city. 
They also want to expand the number of businesses that accept DineX, and emphasize the need for more collaboration and student representation, as well as mental health awareness and measures to combat sexual assault and relationship violence.
Marshall led the founding of Carnegie Mellon’s Phi Delta Theta fraternity and served as president, which he says has given him leadership experience: “I worked with a bevy of people, students, advisors, professors, and some members of the larger Pittsburgh community. And I was able to get a real sense for the pulse of the campus. Every college is represented in my fraternity — international students from all over the world. I think that’s the most important portion of leadership.”
He has also served as chief of staff for the SBP for the past two years, which he says has given him first hand knowledge of what the position can and can’t do.
Ayo-Ani’s experience stems from being both a resident assistant and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority, serving as the vice president of the Pan-Hellenic council. She said “I’ve been practicing [listening to students] for the past two years.”
When asked why they felt they should run, Marshall said, “For me, it was a culmination of two and a half years of Carnegie Mellon, of being somebody who is a multidisciplinary student…. I’m really invested in this community and it would be a great omission to not put myself forward to make this happen.”
“This university has given us the world and we intend to do nothing less than give back to this community,” Ayo-Ani added.
Fun Facts
Ayo-Ani used to be on a National Champion jump rope team, and will be offering a StuCo on it in the future.
Marshall is a lifelong Pittsburgh Pirates fan and secretly a tap dancer.
Saif Jedidi and Ben Debebe
Senior statistics and economics double major Saif Jedidi is running for Student Body President (SBP) with sophomore computer science major Ben Debebe as the ticket’s Student Body Vice President (SBVP) candidate. They are running on a platform of “Decimating Opposition,” which parodies Evan Wineland and Connie Yang’s campaign. Wineland and Yang’s slogan is “Breaking Barriers.”
According to the pair’s website, which is stylistically almost identical to Wineland and Yang’s, the opposition that Jedidi and Debebe intend to decimate comes from wild life, student-faculty connections, and corruption. According to their website, they hope to hire 38 poachers to protect students from campus wildlife, create a program for students and faculty to have lunch, and make it easier for students to bribe professors and administrators.
When asked what sets them apart, Jedidi said via email, “I am by far the most qualified candidate for this position. For one, I am a graduating senior, whereas the other candidates are all juniors or younger. Vis-à-vis, furthermore, concordantly, I am older than them.”
“I think we care about how students feel,” Debebe said. “We’re not looking to make monumental changes in the Student Government. We’re looking to look out for our fellow students.”
Debebe made an earnest case for the platform, saying that one of the largest barriers on campus is the connection between students and faculty: “At the moment, it’s very difficult to reach out on a personal level. If we could give students a means of meeting up with teachers in a social setting — getting lunches, meeting at events — I think that would contribute to breaking down some of those barriers.”
Debebe indicated that student safety — and not just from bears — is at the moment a major issue: “I don’t think a lot of students feel safe on campus. You hear a lot of things about sexual assault and suicide, and I think in general people in Pittsburgh don’t feel safe. Saif and I are people who can really make students feel safe.”
He also believes that one of the largest issues with the current Student Government is a lack of transparency and accessibility for students: “I for one don’t really know about what happens on a case-by-case basis. If I got into office, addressing that would be something at the forefront of my agenda.”
While it is unclear what will happen if a graduating senior is elected, the current election rules allow any graduate or undergraduate student currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon to run for elected positions. Jedidi’s senior status, as well as the campaign website, have led to speculation that their campaign is not a serious one. Their platform promotes poaching and bribery, and their campaign staff includes such members as Helga G. Pataki from the cartoon Hey Arnold!, Al Gore, and “All Sea Creatures.”
Jedidi emphasized being a senior in an email when asked what sets him apart from other candidates: “I would just like to emphasize again that my experience extends all the way to my senior year of college,” he wrote. “I am essentially done with my degree at this point, and will be leaving CMU in just a few months to become a real person, whereas all the other candidates will still be students next year. Does CMU really want someone who is still a student to be the Student Body President?”
Fun Fact
Jedidi and Debebe have the exact same cadence and number of syllables in their names, so they’re easy to beatbox together, like in the recording on their website..

2015-03-30,CMU,India,"Australian bowler Mitchell Starc bowled the fifth ball of the day and clean bowled wicket keeper Brendon McCullum, the New Zealand captain, for a zero. The record crowd of 93,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground roared as Australia got their first wicket in the first over, leaving New Zealand one for one.
Over the last month and half, 14 nations have played 48 matches at the 11th Cricket World Cup, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand for the second time (last time being in 1992). The 2015 World Cup marked the first time Afghanistan’s cricket team qualified for the tournament. Three associate nations — Ireland, Scotland, and United Arab Emirates — will play with the full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC): England, South Africa, India, Australia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Zimbabwe.
Despite a valiant effort by associate nations, the expected full member teams led Group Stage matches and qualified for the quarter final. After the close, nerve-wracking first semifinal match, the New Zealand cricket team defeated South Africa, continued their perfect World Cup winning streak and secured their place in the final for the first time. Australia had only lost to New Zealand in a very close, yet thrilling match in the Group Stage. But they pulled out a dominant win over India, previous World Cup winner and one of the fan favorites, in the semifinal and claimed their spot in the final for the seventh time.
Once again, the co-hosts of the World Cup were the contenders for the final match this Sunday. New Zealand was the team in best form without any doubts this World Cup. The team played aggressive, attacking games. With excellent leadership by McCullum, batsman Martin Guptil’s high scores, all-rounder Daniel Vettori’s good form, and opening bowler Trent Boult taking the most wickets in the tournament, New Zealand had good chances for their first World Cup victory. Meanwhile, Australia was no lesser of a team. Having a strong home-field advantage — winning 24 matches of its last 26 matches at home — the Australian team has a penchant for attacking and winning World Cups, having won four out of the six finals. Australian captain and batsman Michael Clarke set beautifully crafted fields to get the wickets and changed his batting order to score the most runs possible. Along with the strong top batting order including batsmen David Warner and Steve Smith, the Australians would definitely give New Zealand bowlers a challenge. Though their only shortcoming is the lack of a quality spinner, the Australian bowling side gets along fine with both Mitchell Starc — the highest wicket taker so far in the tournament — and Mitchell Johnson in great shape.
The Melbourne pitch was expected to be bouncy, but also batsman-friendly as most of the pitches have been throughout the tournament for record-breaking scores. With no rain forecasted, the final match of the 2015 World Cup began on a bright, sunny Australian afternoon. Starc started the bowling attack with fast and full bowling. With McCullum gone for a duck in the first over, the day of the bowlers started. With the first opener gone, New Zealand continued to play safely and was struck down by high-quality pace bowling from Starc, bowler Josh Hazelwood, and Johnson. At the end of the first ten overs New Zealand stood 31 for one, its lowest 10-over score this World Cup. Luck was not on New Zealand’s side as it lost Guptill soon afterwards for 15 and Williamson for 12. Standing 41 for three for at end of the 14th over, Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor gave some hope to the Black Caps as they scored 111 in their partnership. However, a determined Australia got the breakthrough they needed at the start of the power play, getting Taylor out through an appeal. Soon two more wickets fell down and New Zealand was at 165 for six at the end of the 40th over with Elliott still standing, but playing more cautiously. This did not last long as Johnson took another wicket and Australian bowler James Faulkner soon took the final big wicket of Elliott. Twelve runs were scored afterwards as New Zealand collapsed at 183 all out with Johnson and Faulkner both taking three wickets each and Starc helping with two wickets and very tight bowling. Despite losing the toss, the Australians had a good chance of the winning another World Cup title as they went into the lunch break.
New Zealand began with a similarly impressive opening over by claiming the wicket of Aaron Finch and leaving the Aussies with two for one. However, batsman DA Warner carried the next ten overs by hitting seven fours and giving the edge to the Australians despite being two down for 63 at the end of 12th over. Now Clarke came in and played a captain’s innings. Along with Smith, the duo scored the highest partnership of the day with 112 runs. Clarke hit ten fours and one six before finally getting bowled out for 74 by New Zealand bowler Matt Henry. He did not get to hit the winning runs, but his half century got Australia close to a easy win with just short of nine runs. As Clarke left the MCG, he deserved a standing ovation for playing a true captain’s innings and for this final being his last One Day International Match. Only twelve more balls were needed, as Smith whirled an unorthodox hit for four and Australia won the World Cup final by seven wickets.
The Aussies rushed onto the field and got into a group hug for a deserving win. Closing ceremonies soon followed with Clarke feeling “over the moon” and said that New Zealand are always a tough team to beat in any sport. McCullum felt that though 183 was too short, it was still an approachable dream.
However, he and the New Zealand team were in high spirits as McCullum ended saying “[we] didn’t lift the trophy but no regrets [about] the brand of cricket we’ve played and we walk away with our heads held high.”
Faulkner picked up the Man of the Match for his 36 for three finish. Starc received the Man of the Tournament award for amassing reverse-swinging yorkers and 22 wickets throughout the tournament. As the Australian team picked up the trophy, they became the first team to have won the World Cup on all five continents in which cricket is played. They went for the victory lap around the stadium as the fans were still roaring from the win.  The team appropriately dedicated their win to batsman Phillip Hughes, who had died after being struck on the neck by a ball in Sydney in November..

2015-03-30,CMU,India,"This past Saturday, residents of the Carnegie Mellon community braved the cold to attend the inaugural Margaret Morrison Food Truck Block Party. There were several different food trucks present, including some old Carnegie Mellon favorites like Joe’s Doghouse, Tartans’ Express, and India on Wheels, as well as some new and exciting options from businesses in the Pittsburgh area. The event kicked off promptly at noon with live performances from groups including East End Mile, Ethan Bence, Arts Greenhouse, and The Treblemakers. In addition to the food and live performances, there were a variety of games available to the partygoers, such as “Pin-the-Tie on Suresh!” 
These performances, games, and exciting new food trucks were sure to present students with a promising afternoon. However, in addition to these events, there were also long lines. Though slightly overwhelming at first, it took more than these long lines and cold winds to keep everyone away from the food. 
First up on our food truck journey was Mac and Gold, Pittsburgh’s Original Mac ‘n’ Cheesery.  Although the line seemed quite long at first glance, we moved along at an impressive pace. We opted for the Barbeque Beef Brisket Mac n’ Cheese. Simply put, it was delicious. The perfectly cheesy mac and cheese was topped with barbeque brisket and crispy French fried onions. The other options, including the roasted butternut squash mac and cheese and the prosciutto and pea mac and cheese, also received positive reviews. The short wait time coupled with the great food made Mac and Gold a true crowd pleaser. 
Despite the cold weather, we were still greeted with happy and friendly faces by those working in the Bella Christie and Lil Z’s Sweet Boutique food truck. Bella Christie’s offered a variety of tasty treats, including cookies, cupcakes, cake pops, and all things chocolate-covered. The treats were very inexpensive, beautifully decorated, and quite delicious. We chose the chocolate covered Oreos, and were not in any way disappointed. The best part was the food truck’s lack of any line whatsoever. The Sweet Boutique quickly became a block party favorite.
Franktuary, which offered up classic hot dogs and fries, also became one of our favorites — taste wise, that is. The food was great, but getting to the food was a different story. The line, which appeared to be fairly short, looked promising at first. We were 30 minutes into waiting when we realized it might take slightly longer than previously estimated to acquire one of Franktuary’s grass-fed all-beef hotdogs. The bitter cold got the best of some of those waiting in line, but 45 minutes into waiting, we decided we had gone too far to back out now. We envied those in the fast-moving Mac and Gold queue as we waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually our order was placed after a wait time totaling one hour and 45 minutes. However, after receiving our food, we finally understood why so many others had waited this long for hot dogs and French fries — they were delicious. Although the wait was not ideal, it turned out to be a small price to pay.
Judging by the exceptionally long line at Taco Cho’s, which offered Korean Mexican Fusion style tacos, one might have assumed that it was a crowd favorite. But when we asked a fellow student, first-year materials science and engineering major Indorica Sutradhar, about her experience at Taco Cho’s, she described her tacos as “kind of cold” and “just okay.” Unfortunately, we heard similar responses from several others, as many found the tacos lackluster and not worth the wait. Perhaps the tent setup, as opposed to the standard food truck option, caused a few problems with cooking time and food quality. Although we were not able to personally attend Taco Cho’s because of the long queue, we were able to visit several others.
All in all, most of food offered at the Margaret Morrison Food Truck Block Party was pleasing, but the extremely long lines ended up leaving a sour taste in some mouths..

2015-03-30,CMU,India,"Braille-teaching technology wins prize
A device developed within the Robotics Institute won $20,000 as the winner of the 2014 Louis Braille Touch of Genius Prize for Innovation.
The device teaches students how to write Braille with a slate and stylus, according to a university press release. It was developed by research group TechBridgeWorld. Students began working on the device, called the Braille Writing Tutor, in 2006. It has been tested in such countries as Bangladesh, India, and Tanzania.
The device has the potential to service areas of the world where Braille typewriters are not easily accessible.
The hardware specifications and software can be downloaded online for others wishing to build similar devices, according to the release.
Members of TechBridgeWorld also developed a version of the device that relies on batteries for areas that do not have access to reliable power sources.
“The Braille Writing Tutor has been one of our most successful projects to date,” said M. Bernardine Dias, director and founder of TechBridgeWorld, in the release. “We’ve seen the profound impact it has on blind and visually impaired students and their teachers in communities where we have been fortunate to test the tutor.”
Dias is also an associate research professor of robotics.
TechBridgeWorld’s mission includes implementing technology to meet development needs across the globe. The group aims to leverage relationships with others in developing areas to understand technology’s global influence. The group lists two main principles on its website: “sharing expertise to create innovative and locally suitable solutions, and empowerment of indigenous populations to create sustainable solutions.”
Former post-doc visits British Parliament to present research
Euan Wielewski is a former post-doctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon. He worked with professor of physics Robert Suter and professor of materials science and engineering Marc De Graef on research regarding X-ray and electron diffraction, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Now he is a faculty member at the University of Glasgow and one of 210 researchers who presented to the British Parliament for a poster competition hosted by SET for Britain. SET for Britain aims to promote the country’s “early-stage and early-career research scientists, engineers, technologists, and mathematicians,” according to its website.
“This annual competition is an important date in the parliamentary calendar because it gives [members of Parliament] an opportunity to speak to a wide range of the country’s best young researchers,” said Andrew Miller, chairman of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee in a university press release.
Wielewski presented research from his time at Carnegie Mellon, as well as from his time at Cornell University. Wielewski’s research focused on determining the reliability of certain materials used to make jet engine parts.
“Presenting our research at the House of Parliament was a real honor and a great experience,” said Wielewski in the release. “It’s rare that early career researchers get the opportunity to talk to politicians about their work.”.

2015-04-06,CMU,India,"TechBridgeWorld, a research group under Carnegie Mellon University’s Field Robotics Institute, received the Louis Braille Touch of Genius Price for Innovation for the year of 2014. The $20,000 prize is distributed to multiple organizations and individuals every year in hopes of honoring those who implement innovative technologies to help improve the field of tactile literacy. The Automated Braille Tutor, developed by students and researchers in TechBridgeWorld, was awarded $15,000 out of the $20,000 for its developments and impact on partnering institutes from around the world.
TechBridgeWorld was founded in 2004 by M. Bernardine Dias, an associate research professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. The goal of this research group aims to blend together advancements in technology and their implementations in lesser known communities. In particular, TechBridgeWorld focuses on helping people who live in developing countries and people with disabilities in the areas of education and assistance. 
The Automated Braille Tutor exemplifies a blend of these two fields by providing assistive technology to those who are blind to help improve literacy. Other projects that TechBridgeWorld has been involved with include NavPal, a mobile application aimed to help aid indoor navigation for blind and deafblind users, and Assistive Robots for Blind Travelers.
The Automated Braille Tutor project was started in 2006 by two robotics Ph.D. students, Nidhi Kalra and Tom Lauwers. Initially, the two students were invested in this project as an independent study through TechBridgeWorld. Kalra and Lauwers contacted and tested the tutor on students in the Mathru School for the Blind, in Bengaluru, India. Teachers and students had positive feedback toward the proejct at the time. Over the years, due to its success, the study has been kept alive and continues to live through the support of students at Carnegie Mellon.
The first tutor device developed connects to a USB port on a laptop. The board has typical buttons that allow users to navigate through menu options, an enlarged center Braille cell, and a bottom slate portion with multiple Braille cells that mimic the typical Braille slates that are used with a stylus. Once the device is turned on, students hear instructions from the device teaching them about topics such as the alphabet, spelling, and numbers. The tutor’s software also implements the built-in voice of a Mathru teacher, who provides feedback to the actions of the student. For example, if the device was running through the alphabet, the automated voice would direct the student to press particular cells to spell out the respective letters. 
An important aspect to keep in mind is that in order for blind people to write, the construction of Braille writings need to be punched in from right to left with each letter’s mirror image. Once the writing is complete, the paper can then be turned over so that the tactile feedback can be read from left to right.
The use of the Braille Tutor not only benefits blind students by improving their literacy, but also entertains them. For example, the “Animal Game” plays an audio clip of the noise an animal makes, and in response, the student spells out the name of the animal that made the noise. Project manager of the Automated Braille Tutor, Ermine Teves, states that, hopefully, “giving them the means to enhance their literacy will allow them to become active members of society.” 
With a better understanding of reading and writing, blind people can pursue higher education, help teach others who are blind, and hold industrial and technical positions similar to those without disabilities. In general, the device has been received well by both students and teachers. For teachers, “the idea here is not to replace them,” Teves said. “We want to make their lives easier.”
Most teachers in Mathru are blind themselves, often making the process of teaching literacy difficult without any technical assistance. The need for a teacher to provide feedback to every student would not only be very time consuming, but would also cost a lot in terms of the financial investment in Braille paper.
Over the years, teachers and students have provided TechBridgeWorld with feedback on how to improve the design of the tutor. The most demanded request was a device that worked independently from a laptop. Since then, progress has been made with Stand Alone Automated Braille Tutors. A functional beginner’s device has been implemented and serves as a prototype, whereas intermediate and advanced tutors will be explored in the future. These standalone devices are powered by batteries and connect to mobile speakers to allow for mobility and ease of access.
Both undergraduate- and graduate-level students are involved with TechBridgeWorld. Innovative Student Technology Experience (iSTEP) is a 10-week summer internship program for TechBridgeWorld that heavily involves technology’s impacts on outside connections. 
Although 2015 will be the last year that iSTEP will be offered, the group of four students participating in the internship will work on furthering the research for the Automated Braille Tutor. The upcoming iSTEP team will pursue comparative user studies this summer to continue to enhance the new devices in Mathru..

2015-04-06,CMU,India,"The Wednesday before last I attended an open town hall, the last of three, that the university held to discuss the 2015 Strategic Plan. I also had the privilege of attending a discussion on Carnegie Mellon culture and community at President Subra Suresh’s house the next day with a host of university administrators and about 35 other students.
The Strategic Plan is built on three main pillars: Transformative Teaching and Learning; Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship; and The Transformative CMU Experience. Although the details of the plan haven’t been finalized, at the town hall the leaders of each respective branch of the plan presented some of the possible strategies for addressing their focus. 
It is refreshing to see the administration actively working to change the Carnegie Mellon community for the better. Too often the university’s plans focus on abstractions and buzzwords more than implementing strategies that create tangible effects for the student body. At the town hall there were plenty of buzzwords — innovation, entrepreneurship, and metacurricular, for example — but also lots of solid plans for action. Administrators talked about, for instance, the possibility to take more classes as pass/fail and ensuring that the number of units assigned to a class accurately reflects the workload of the class.
The town hall also provided an open forum for students, faculty, and administrators to discuss the Strategic Plan. Although the town hall was not particularly well attended, it is in line with Dr. Suresh’s emphasis on hearing the ideas of the student body, one of the main tenets of his presidency so far.
Suresh’s presidency has also focused on improving the university’s reputation. One thing that affects the university’s reputation — measured mostly by how it’s ranked — more than anything, Suresh says, is current student and alumni giving. The 2015 Strategic Plan aims to create a “Transformative CMU Experience,” one that can be measured by how many current seniors and recent alumni donate to the university.
It’s obviously frustrating when the university asks for more money when many students are already struggling to cover ever-increasing tuition costs. For me, however, it’s more frustrating that the university seems to care about some alumni and students more than others. 
Carnegie Mellon, harkening back to its roots as Carnegie Tech, pioneering advancements in computer science and artificial intelligence in the ’60s and onwards, has always been a school focused on technology. When the university chose Dr. Suresh as its president — former director of the National Science Foundation and an alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Technology — it was no surprise.
However, Carnegie Mellon will never rise to the ranks of our so-called “peer institutions” — which, according to the administration include schools such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford — unless it rounds out its humanities offerings and stops measuring success with metrics that cater to students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Although all of these peer institutions boast impressive donation rates and even more impressive endowments, they also have humanities departments with reputations to match their STEM departments, something that Carnegie Mellon glaringly lacks.
At Carnegie Mellon, success upon graduation is measured by salary. Departments of our university, from our Office of Admission to our Career and Professional Development Center, use money as a benchmark of success. For many, Carnegie Mellon is essentially a pre-professional school: You major in chemical engineering to become a chemical engineer, architecture to become an architect, and so on. Carnegie Mellon’s admissions process reinforces this by forcing prospective students to choose a college and intended degree when they apply. 
You can be undecided up to a point. You can, for example, know that you want to be an engineer, but not exactly which type of engineer. If you’re completely undecided, however, you’re part of Dietrich College, which emphasizes a broad “liberal arts” education but, at the same time, makes it difficult for students to experiment with classes across disciplines. The university does not encourage students to pursue educational passions that don't have an immediate professional application. 
As far as salary as a metric goes, Dietrich College is in relatively good standing. Dietrich College's post-graduation salary averages are high, but they are skewed by students in the college's more interdisciplinary programs, like information systems and decision science, which tend to churn out high-earning employees. 
While this is part of a larger, national discussion on the role of the humanities and liberal arts in America, it’s particularly relevant at Carnegie Mellon, a school founded by technical innovators and with a strong focus on technology that it can’t seem to move beyond. 
The university acknowledges the many arguments that have been made for the humanities, at least implicitly. Last October, former Supreme Court Justice David Souter visited Carnegie Mellon to give a lecture full of such arguments. In his lecture, “The Heart of the Matter: The Humanities and Social Sciences for a Vibrant, Competitive, and Secure Nation,"" Souter reminded students that an education in the humanities teaches students to embrace multiple perspectives both when looking at a problem and defining a solution. 
Carnegie Mellon also sponsors Odyssey, a Winter Break program in which selected sophomores learn to write a personal essay. Carnegie Mellon recognizes the significance of education in the humanities, so why won't it devote resources to improving and bringing prominence to its offerings in Dietrich College? 
The university did take a step in the right direction last week, when it announced the creation of the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS). The IPS, according to a university press release, will ""serve as a center for research, undergraduate and graduate education, and university-wide initiatives in the fields of political science, international relations, national security policy and grand strategy."" Initiatives like this one are encouraging signs that Carnegie Mellon is willing to lay the groundwork for a future that focuses on and recognizes the significance of the humanities. However, they don't go far enough to correct a 100-year-old imbalance. 
The nascent Strategic Plan includes several strong points and proposed initiatives, from what I’ve seen and heard so far. If Dr. Suresh and the rest of the administration want to significantly improve the university’s international stature, however, they need to focus on metrics past money. Instead of deemphasizing the humanities and social sciences disciplines behind a screen of STEM, the university should push their offerings in the humanities and social sciences to the forefront, and devote the same resources given to its other programs to Dietrich College. .

2015-04-06,CMU,India,"Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) into law this week. Critics of the bill point out that the RFRA gives businesses a legal defense to discriminate against consumers for religious reasons. For instance, a Christian caterer could refuse to cater a same-sex wedding, or a Christian coffee shop owner could deny service to a gay customer. 
Of course, anyone can be discriminated against under this law, but LGBTQ people are far more likely to face discrimination ""for religious reasons"" than most groups of people. Considering the wave of marriage equality and tolerance sweeping through states like Indiana, lawmakers clearly feel a present need to protect discrimination against LGBTQ people.
Defenders of the bill argue that it does not give a “license to discriminate.” Most claim that the bill is no different from the RFRAs of nearly 20 other states. There’s even a federal RFRA, which was signed into law by President Clinton in 1993 with bipartisan support. For liberals to support the RFRAs in other states and protest the Indiana bill, defenders say, is nothing but hypocrisy and politicking.
They’re wrong. The Indiana bill is significantly different from the RFRAs of other states, and the Indiana bill gives businesses a license to discriminate, whereas other RFRAs do not. 
I can understand the confusion. The bills have the same name! Surely they must be exactly the same in every single way, right? Wrong. 
I face this struggle daily. My name is Emmett Eldred, and my grandfather’s name is also Emmett Eldred. I have to remind myself all the time that I am not the exact same person as my grandfather. It gets rather existential. And just imagine how confusing it can get for other people. It seems like at least once a week an elderly stranger from Vermont sends me a friend request on Facebook, and I have to explain to them in excruciating detail why I am not the person they are looking for. 
So I understand your confusion, thinly veiled bigots, I really do. And I’m here to help. The difference between Indiana’s RFRA and other RFRAs is not blatant. In fact, it’s pretty subtle, which I think is exactly the problem. We all know how poorly homophobic people handle subtlety. 
Take a look at the federal RFRA, the model bill for pretty much every other RFRA. According to Section 2000bb, Subsection B, Item 2, the purpose of the federal RFRA is “to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.” This sentiment is echoed in Section 2000bb-1, Subsection A, which says, “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” except in instances of “compelling government interest.” 
This intent is shared by every other RFRA. The bills are designed to do one thing: protect citizens from the government infringing on their religious freedom. That’s a protection granted to us by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, so we don’t really need an extra law to say the same thing, but whatever.
To be fair, the Indiana bill does provide the same protection. It is clear throughout the text that an objective of the bill is to protect the people of Indiana from the state government infringing on their religious liberties. If that’s all the bill did, there would be no controversy. But that’s not all the bill does. 
According to Section 9 of the Indiana RFRA, a person or business can use the religious freedom defense in court “regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.” In other words, this bill doesn’t just apply to instances in which the government impedes religious freedom, it applies to any instance in which interacting with any person impedes religious freedom. 
Neither the Federal RFRA nor any of the other state RFRAs include similar language. So when people protest the law, they are not being hypocritical, the laws are genuinely different in a substantial way. And that difference does give businesses the “license to discriminate,” as long as they can argue that they are adhering to their religious beliefs.
So how do we fix this? The Indiana State Legislature must remove section 9 from the bill, clarify in the bill that it does not give businesses a license to discriminate, and expand their nondiscrimination laws to protect LGBTQ people. 
Governor Mike Pence has said repeatedly that Hoosiers are good and decent people who would never discriminate against anyone. This may be true on the whole, but there will always be people filled with hate. A feel-good statement about the decency of your state is no excuse to not protect people from discrimination.
If Hoosiers truly are good, decent people, then they should have no problem with laws protecting fellow Indiana citizens from discrimination. It’s a shame, then, that Gov. Pence has for decades been consistent in opposing nondiscrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people. .

2015-04-13,CMU,India,"Saturday night marked the end of the almost month-long run of Carnegie Mellon’s student-run International Film Festival: Faces of Work.
The small audience in McConomy Auditorium listened to the kind words of thanks from Festival Director Jolanta Lion gave to students who helped her and individuals who supported the film festival. Lauralei Kraski, assistant to the director, also expressed her appreciation to those who put so much time into the festival’s construction, as well as audience members, many of whom went to multiple film festival showings.
Prior to the screening of the evening’s feature film, the audience was shown a documentary short by the late Professor Paul S. Goodman, to whom the festival was dedicated. In addition to being a professor of organizational psychology at Carnegie Mellon, Goodman was the director of the Institute for Strategic Development and the director of the Center for the Management of Technology. Much beloved by the university community, Goodman was also an avid filmmaker responsible for numerous short documentaries chronicling individuals in the workplace and detailing how work was and is defined in America.
The short showed at the film festival was called Waitress. It consisted of narration by Goodman, and extensive interviews with Toni, a waitress with 23 years of experience at Scotty’s Diner here in Pittsburgh. Though a little campy, the film was satisfying and, dare I say it, adorably dated, having been filmed in 1996. The ten minutes or so of the film included very ‘90s hairstyles in addition to some interesting reflections on being a waitress from Toni. It was gratifying to witness the work of a Carnegie Mellon professor be so appreciated.
The final film in the Festival, an Indian film from 2014, Court, dealt with so many themes that it was a little difficult to understand the film’s message. Though that might have been a part of the film’s artistic point, Director Chaitanya Tamhane’s first feature production dealt with issues of bureaucracy, artistic expression, classism, and racism throughout. The film follows the incarceration and court dates of self-proclaimed “folk musician” Narayan Kamble, who is brought into court on the transparently flawed charge of “abetting suicide.” The prosecution claims that Kamble incited a sewer worker to commit suicide after allegedly encouraging all sewer workers to kill themselves. What follows is an understated and honest portrayal of India’s flawed justice system. Kamble’s trial is postponed multiple times, the investigating officer collaborates with a witness who is the only witness for the prosecution, and all the while Kamble’s health deteriorates in a prison cell.
Kamble’s devoted lawyer Vinay Vora seems resigned whenever they postpone the trial to a date, often a month or more in the future even after just a few minutes of procedure. There is no outcry for court reform in the movie. Once, prosecutor Nutan complains about the duration of this trial, but she does not frame it explicitly as a fault of the system. In this particular conversation she discusses the speed with which judges can get through cases that come to court. This sort of conversation, skirting around the edge of the issue at hand, is largely what makes the film’s critiques so powerful.
The private lives of Vora and Nutan bring to light a fascinating dichotomy. Vora comes from a family of great wealth. His position as a lawyer is not the most frugal or the most natural for a man of his status. There exists tension, but also extreme luxury. One scene shows Vora hanging out with friends in an upscale bar with live, Western-style music, in comparison to Kamble’s folk music. In another scene he picks up a plethora of very fancy cheeses in a nice grocery store. Even though he comes from a place of elevated status, Vora still wishes to help those less fortunate than himself. He feels a moral responsibility for his clients that are victims of the system, such as Kamble.
On the other hand, public defender Nutan comes from a social strata more similar to those who are facing court charges. Though she is not an evil character, Nutan does not feel the same level of social responsibility.
Chock-a-block full of thought-provoking contradictions, Court is a nuanced exploration of various social issues in India. Though I think it would have been useful to enter the film knowing a little bit more about the Indian legal system, and social issues present in the area, the film managed to convey many important points I understood, despite my personal ignorance.
Most importantly, Court closed Carnegie Mellon’s Film Festival powerfully. The fact that Carnegie Mellon is the home of the only student-run international film festival in the country is truly amazing. Movies have the power to transcend cultures, religions, and ideologies, making film a powerful tool for educating people around the globe. I sincerely hope to see next year’s attendance to this spectacular month of thoughtful art increase..

2015-04-20,CMU,India,"The Carnegie Mellon women’s lacrosse team has had a tough season, but its growing strength is something their competitors in the Women’s Collegiate Lacrosse League (WCLL) should be noticing. The Tartans finished 4–4 this year, up from 3–5 last year. The team even qualified for the playoffs, although it was unable to compete because of Carnival. What should be noted is that the team has managed to do this well despite trying circumstances that have tested its tenacity off the field.
Sophomore midfielder and team captain Melyssa Eigen chronicled some of the challenges the team faced during the season. One of the biggest problems had also affected the men’s lacrosse team: a very condensed schedule due to the snowfall over the course of the winter. Over the course of two and a half weeks, the team had to play all eight of its games with limited practice. “It was a lot of work and everyone was pretty tired, but despite all that, we all played pretty well,” the mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major said. In addition, Head Coach Emily Patterson moved to Germany near the end of the season, creating a leadership void. “Not having a coach during that time was pretty difficult.” To fill the leadership void, Eigen said everyone stepped up to support each other. “Mostly, we were equals on the team, and we worked together to coach ourselves.”
Despite these circumstances, the Tartans continued to forge ahead against their competition. In their fourth game of the season, the team blew out Marshall University 15–1. Their rematch against Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) was a particular high point for the team. When the Tartans opened up their season against IUP, they lost 10–4. However, the Tartans got their revenge in their second matchup, defeating the Crimson Hawks 9–4. “Playing them is always a good challenge for our team, but this year it was a big win and gave our team momentum again,” sophomore center Sarah Duncan said. 
Eigen cited Duncan along with centers Amelia Jones and Julie Wu, as some of the top contributors of the team. Though their final game of the season was a 17–5 loss against the University of Pittsburgh, the Tartans considered this year quite a success, especially considering the outside circumstances.
Even though they couldn’t attend the playoffs this year, the team feels optimistic that they can do well next year. First-year attacker Jessica Jackson in particular is a cause for optimism. She contributed a lot to the offensive scores and ended up as the team’s MVP. “As a team, we were better collectively,” Eigen said. She cautioned, however, that there is still a lot of work for the team to get to the next level. “We have to get more time to practice before the actual season starts.” While she feels the pieces are there for a strong run next year, she knows that the team will need to be firing on all cylinders to do so. Still, it’s pretty clear that this team will become dangerous contenders in the WCLL..

2015-04-20,CMU,India,"From nasty colds to the chickenpox, we all have to face infections from viruses at some point in our lifetime. But did you know that there is a virus that infects organisms many times smaller than you? In the early 1900s, scientists started to notice a group of viruses that infect and lyse bacteria, the billions of microorganisms that are prevalent virtually everywhere on Earth. Coined as bacteriophages, or “phages” for short, these bacterial viruses were named for their “bacteria eating” ability.
Like all viruses, bacteriophages carry nucleic acid that is encased within a capsid, or coat, of protein. The capsid can be thought of as the head of a bacteriophage. The nucleic acid of the phage can either be most commonly in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or ribonucleic acid (RNA). In either case, the nucleic acid serves as the genetic material of the bacteriophage. Genetic material is important as it gives the essential instructions necessary for the phages to be able to function and propagate.
Bacteriophages come in three different structural forms. A bacteriophage can have an icosahedral — twenty-sided — head with a tail. During infection, the tail serves as a hollow tube that serves as a passageway for nucleic acid during infection. Another type of bacteriophage has an icosahedral head, but no tail. Additionally, a bacteriophage can come in a filamentous, rod-like, form.
So how did scientists come across these creatures that cannot be seen even under the most powerful light microscope? According to a review in the Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, the first bacteriophage activity was found in river water, reported in a paper published in a French journal in 1896. In this paper, Ernest Hanbury Hankin, a British bacteriologist, noticed that the river water was effective in preventing the spread of cholera, a severe bacterial disease that had frequent outbreaks in India. However, it took 20 more years before the existence of bacteriophages was actually confirmed by American scientist Frederick Twort and French scientist Felixe d’Herelle.
The discovery was followed by many studies that showed the potential of bacteriophages in curing bacterial infections. For instance, in 1919, d’Herelle prepared bacteriophages that were administered to patients at a hospital in Paris. The phage preparation was made to treat patients with bacterial dysentery. Patients were then reported to have recovered within 24 hours of treatment.
With their ability to eliminate symptoms of bacterial infection, you might be wondering how these bacteriophages work. In order to survive as a group of viruses, the bacteriophages must find a way to replicate themselves. This is accomplished through a series of reactions during the infection cycle.
During the first step of the infection process, the phage settles on a bacterial cell by attaching to specific receptors present on the surface. Fibers allow for the hollow tail to push through the bacterial envelope, which is partly digested by enzymes from the phage. Once the tail penetrates the surface, DNA from the head is now able to pass through the hollow tube and into the cell. After the injection, the remaining bacteriophage, still located on the outside of the bacterium, is void of genetic material.
From there, the next steps taken in the cycles differ, depending on whether the phage is lytic or lysogenic. For lytic phages, only one path is followed after the injection of the phage DNA. As the injected phage DNA multiplies during the lytic cycle, phage capsids are also being produced within the host bacterium. The phage DNA, along with the host DNA, is then packaged into the capsids. In turn, new phages are created within the bacterium.
Afterwards, the bacterium undergoes lysis, or the disintegration of a cell through the breakdown of the bacterial cell membrane. Consequently, this process causes the release of mature phages. While many of the newly made phages possess the DNA of the original phage, a couple of them contain DNA fragments of the previously occupied host bacterium. The newly released phages then go on to repeat the cycle, which involves the infection and destruction of more bacteria.
In contrast with lytic phages, lysogenic phages can either proceed to replicate within the lytic cycle, or they can enter a dormant state within the cell. During the dormant state, the phage DNA usually becomes incorporated into the host DNA. As a result, the bacterial cell may acquire new properties from the added genes of the phage, such as the ability to produce toxins. Prophage is the term for the phage in this integrated state.
Despite their seeming inactivity, lysogenic phages have been proven to be valuable in scientific studies, as they are able to manipulate some of the properties of a bacterial cell.
In addition, the lysogenic phages have the ability to enter the lytic cycle at any time. Such transition is usually triggered by the exposure of the bacterium to harsh environmental conditions, including exposure to ultraviolet rays or mutation-causing chemicals.
Even with the medical promise found within bacteriophages, phage therapy is still relatively uncommon. This is mainly due to the fact that critics attacked d’Herelle’s early studies and were unable to replicate them, which cast suspicion on the results. While phage therapy is still practiced in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, this practice has long ceased in the Western world. The controversy  about d’Herelle’s work, combined with the rise of antibiotics, eventually led to a rejection of phage therapy.
Often prescribed by doctors to treat bacterial infections, antibiotics have become a household staple in the medical cabinet since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. However, the overuse of antibiotics has led to their decreasing efficacy in treating bacterial infections, as the elimination of a large population of bacteria has led to the emergence of stronger and more resistant bacteria.
As antibiotic resistance becomes a growing threat to public health, there has been a renewed interest in phage therapy. Phages are highly specific and are easy to modify when they attack bacterial targets. The extensive use of phage therapy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has been proven safe to patients as well as commercially viable. With increasing knowledge of bacteriophages’ abilities, phage therapy may be an answer to the woes of many Western scientists, doctors and patients in the fight against bacterial diseases..

2015-04-20,CMU,India,"In only its third year, the Shot for Shot student film festival is still young enough that each year the program gets notably better. This year, the event nearly filled the Cohon University Center’s McConomy Auditorium to capacity with students, faculty, family, and community, and delivered quality short films. Some relied on overplayed subject matter, but many were fresh and entertaining.
These films aren’t your sixth-grade movie projects shot with a Best Buy-bought video camera. They’re professional creations, made with professional equipment by near-professionals themselves. It’s clear these student filmmakers take themselves, and their work, very seriously.
The film Steel Town won the Audience Award, determined by viewer-submitted paper ballots after the program, while Milkman took home the Grand Jury Prize and Marcus Sunshine snagged the Special Jury Prize.
All Sight
Directed by Talia Levin
The festival opener asks, “What happens when our desire to live in the past overwhelms our motivation to live in the present?” A grieving widower spends his time in a virtual video game reality in which his wife is still alive, meanwhile neglecting his young daughter. Though it ends sweetly, it’s a heartbreaking story that, despite the science fiction, isn’t too far from reality.
The Colourful Mind
Directed by Bethany Barich
Young painter Gracie Winters lives in a literally black-and-white world, chased by an oppressive government determined to quash individual expression. It’s beautifully shot, the black-and-white lens creating a story in light and shadows. But the trope of expression-versus-government, complete with a central artist martyr, has been done before, and this film’s arc is hard to distinguish from all the rest.
Table For Two
Directed by Connor Yoho
Three masked men break into a Pittsburgh home. Meanwhile, a couple bickers in a nearby park, their relationship on the verge of breakup. The stories seem entirely disparate until they’re not. What looks like a crime in progress isn’t what we expect. While other films trudge through serious material, this one had the audience laughing throughout, in anticipation of the hilarious ending twist.
Diamonds in the Rough
Directed by Dominique Carino
A little-known secret of downtown Pittsburgh, the Helfer family sets diamonds and toils over custom rings at their private jewelry shop. But life isn’t all gemstones and sparkles — far from it, especially for heir apparent David Helfer, who struggles to follow his father Ira’s footsteps. Diamonds seems to stray too far down the family dynamics track, leaving us there at the end, without rounding out the narrative. Still, it’s a poignant interview-based story, coarse and grounded like the city it’s set in.
Muted
Directed by Lex Truss
A frustrated young woman crumples up her written work, tossing the pages in a dingy dumpster in a rainy alley. Meanwhile, a ragged, bearded man digs up the pages, piecing them back together. When they meet, we see a touching exchange between two disparate characters. The effect is sweet, but the situation seems a bit contrived.
Milkman
Directed by Garrett Kennell
Milkman is a standout for its sheer whimsicality, both in photography and plot development. The titular character is also a jolly caricature of himself, in a pristinely suburban neighborhood that is a caricature of itself. When a tragic accident occurs, the milkman springs into action, triggering a hysterical series of events. Spotted with fanciful humor, this film is probably the most perfectly executed.
Pick Your Poison
Directed by Ashley Czernienski-Hagan
Constant miscommunication plagues star-crossed students Parker and Julie. The story is convoluted, with the poison metaphor somewhat lost on the audience — but on a scene-by-scene level, the writing is strong. Spiced with lines like, “ ‘How do you feel about sushi?’ ‘Not as strongly as I feel about Indian,’ ” the script adds clever punches of color. 
Rust Belt
Directed by Daniel Kusbit
Devoid of characters, dialogue, or plot, this three-minute film is primarily an aesthetic experience, pairing shots of rusting Pittsburgh bridges with free-flowing instrumental music. It experiments with geometry and movement, layering frames atop each other in dogged search of beauty, transforming these mundane, decaying structures into things of loveliness.
Marcus Sunshine
Directed by Marlee M. Schneider
A reformed drug dealer turned stripper gets a compassionate portrait in this award-winning film. The treatment is gritty — it’s probably the least polished of all the films — but respectful, humanizing our hero Marcus Sunshine in tender scenes with his twin sister. The filmmakers include a moment of graphic nudity, but it’s an important decision to trade comfort for relevance, and thanks to beautiful filmmaking, the scene lends an odd majesty to Marcus’s work. Perhaps the best film overall.
Steel Town
Directed by Nicolas Hurt
In 1892 Homestead, a power struggle arises between underpaid steel mill workers and the robber-baron mill owners. Based on real events, this film condenses a historical epic into 20 minutes. Though impressive on many levels — detailed, period-appropriate costumes and a large cast — Steel Town takes itself a bit too seriously. It’s difficult to present a classic trope — hardworking, struggling laborers against wealthy Gilded Age tyrants — as new, and In only its third year, the Shot for Shot student film festival is still young enough that each year the program gets notably better Steel Town almost gets there..

2015-04-27,CMU,India,"As April comes to a close, nearly every bit of information we have about baseball is useless. Over the course of a 162-game season, it’s a fool’s errand to try to make long-term predictions based on early season trends. However, early season madness can sometimes change the picture of a season in a meaningful way. This year, two crowded races — the battle for the American League (AL) Central crown and the struggle for the National League (NL) Wild Card — could have seen the favorites change due to some early season surprises.
Early season swings cause changes in close races. Say a team would normally be expected to win 81 games in a season. This would mean it wins 50 percent of its games. If that team wins its first ten games, their talent level did not change, but those games count. Now, instead of 81 games, that team is expected to win 86.
That random hot streak has an impact on the playoff position of that team.
Saying the hot streak will level out in the long run is true, but the season is not long enough to render those ten games irrelevant. Further, the team is not more likely to experience a random cold streak because they had a random hot streak. This is the gambler’s fallacy. The early season successes of two teams, the Detroit Tigers and the New York Mets, have massively improved those teams’ chances to get in on the MLB playoffs.
In the AL Central, four teams — the Tigers, Kansas City Royals, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox — all had their sights set on a division crown. While projection systems were less kind to the Royals despite their AL pennant from last season, the Tigers, Indians, and White Sox were all projected by Baseball Prospectus’ PECOTA, Clay Davenport, and Vegas lines to finish with only a couple games between them. The Royals were projected to find themselves a bit back of the pack. However, with a fast start, the Tigers have pulled five games ahead of both the Indians and White Sox. The Royals, who have matched the Tigers so far, may have been underrated by the preseason projections.
Even if they were not, this random hot streak has put them in position to finish about level with the Indians and White Sox, putting them back in contention for the Wild Card race in the AL. This is not a big upset considering expectations, as the White Sox and Indians were relying on younger players taking a step forward. This doesn’t always happen, and it means that both teams are likely to improve as the season goes along. However, if both teams finish with the same record as the Tigers in a vacuum, that five game league is likely to hold over the remaining 145 or so games.
A stacked field featuring the San Diego Padres, Chicago Cubs, Miami Marlins, and whoever between the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals misses out on the NL Central crown was supposed to have a season-long scrum for the two spots in the NL Wild Card playoff game. The Cardinals and Pirates were expected to finish with somewhere between 89 and 93 wins, but one of them would win the NL Central. That means that one spot would be left for the rest of the field, all of whom were often projected to finish in the 83 to 85 win range.
Just behind those four teams was supposed to be the Mets, a .500 team with some great pitching but little else better than average. The Mets had other ideas, however, as they burst out of the gate with a 13–3 start. Considering their projections, prorated to a whole season, the Mets would then be expected to follow that start with .500 baseball and finish with 86 wins.
With none of the other wild card teams performing according to expectations so far, the Mets’ 86 expected wins seems to have launched them not only into the conversation, but maybe even the pole position. The Marlins have been horrible out of the gate, and in a crowded race a cold streak can be death. Slow starts have left the Cubs and Pirates hovering around .500, so considering preseason expectations, the Cubs are likely an 83-win team and the Pirates an 87-win team. The Padres have been good to begin the season, but they did not project more than two games better than the Mets coming in and sit three games back right now. The Mets are being tested early with injuries to third baseman David Wright and catcher Travis D’Arnaud, but starters Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, and Bartolo Colon can help the team go a long way, and highly rated prospect, starter Noah Syndergaard, is waiting in the wings. These Mets might be able to put a playoff run together this season.
Of course, it’s only April, and small sample size wonkiness happens during every small sample over the course of a season. Injuries might derail the Mets, or all of those teams might go on even more impressive runs. Either way, what seemed like an exciting and close MLB season looks even closer one month in..

2015-04-27,CMU,India,"Town in Indiana experiences growth in HIV outbreak
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there has been a severe increase in the rate of outbreak of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections within a rural county in Indiana. 
The increased rates have been occuring since mid-December. In March, the outbreak was declared a public emergency within that county. As of Friday, 142 people were shown to test positive for HIV, a significant amount for an area with a population of a few thousand people. The CDC and state health officials believe that IV drug use, which is common in the rural area, is the culprit behind the outbreak. Drug users often share needles, which increases the risk of spreading new HIV infections. 
In order to combat the problem, the Indiana governor has signed a mandate to make sterile needle syringes more available to the public. In addition, health volunteers from Indiana University are being deployed to test and treat HIV cases, as well as to educate the public about the danger of sharing needles.

Scientists debate ethics of genetically modifying embryos
For the first time, human embryos have been genetically modified by a team of Chinese scientists. In order to alleviate ethical concerns, the researchers worked with nonviable embryos, which are incapable of producing live births. The embryos were obtained from nearby fertility clinics.
Using a gene editing method, the CRISP/Cas9 system, the team altered the gene associated with β-thalassaemia, a fatal blood disorder. During experimentation, only a fraction of the genetically tested embryos were successfully modified. Furthermore, the researchers found that there were many “off target” mutations that are believe to be caused by the gene editing technique acting upon other parts of the embryo genome. In turn, these results have brought up doubts about the safety of germ line manipulation, which could affect the welfare of future generations if it becomes a more prominent practice.
Currently, germ line manipulation has not been approved in the U.S., among other countries.

Large cosmic tsunami revives comatose galaxies
An international team of astronomers has discovered that dormant galaxies, which have ceased to form stars in the distant past, are, at times, capable of revival. In a recent publication of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the scientists reported their observations of the merging galaxy cluster J2242.8+5301. 
Nicknamed the “Sausage,” the merging galaxy cluster is 2.3 billion light years away in the direction of a constellation situated in the northern hemisphere of the sky. Watching from various large telescopes in La Palma and Hawaii, the scientists were able to observe the creation of a shock wave from the merging galaxies. The scientists then discovered that the shock wave formed dense, cold gas clouds that triggered the birth of new stars. However, once those galaxies run out of fuel, the cluster mergers will eventually make the galaxies dormant again, with an even lower chance of a second resurrection. 
In the future, the scientists hope to study a larger sample of galaxies in order to further understand how stars are formed.

Pocket shark seen for the second time in the Gulf of Mexico
Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had recently identified a rare, juvenile male pocket shark. The small shark, although only recently identified, was found dead in an assortment of catch obtained from the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The Gulf shark is 14 centimeters in length and 14.6 grams in weight. The scientists also compared the Gulf shark to the only other specimen of pocket shark that was reported to be found, Mollisquama parini.
Results from the genetic analysis of tissue sample allow scientists to categorize the pocket shark as belonging to the Mollisquama genus. However, the scientists found a cluster of light-emitting organs on the belly of the Gulf shark, a physical feature that was not seen in the Mollisquama parini. Such differences have made the scientists uncertain about the species of the Gulf shark.
The shark is now part of the Royal D. Suttkus Fish Collection at Tulane University’s Biodiveristy Research Institute in Louisiana.

Electromaterials scientists create a 4-D printer
At the University of Wollongong, Australian scientists have engineered a 4-D printer. The 4-D printer is a machine that allows for 3-D printed materials to morph into new structures in response to external stimuli, such as pressure or heat. 
During one continuous process, the printers build objects using layers of filaments that are sensitive to heat and pressure. The filaments can also have the ability to move over time. These printers are able to print the customary plastic, but they can also work with substances such as sugar or cellular material. The 4-D printer was designed for ease of use. The printer outputs devices that can be immediately picked up and require no assembly.
The Australian scientists believe that the printers will lead to a new age of “soft” robotics, a field that aims to develop robots that mimic the movements found in biological systems. 
It is thought that these 4-D printers will also have an impact on other fields such as medicine, construction, and automation.

Near-death experiences caused by lack of oxygen
Recently, researchers at the University of Michigan Medical School have studied the phenomenon of near-death experiences (NDEs), which have lead to claims of out-of-body or spiritual experiences. Scientists believe NDEs to be a result of anoxia, or a lack of oxygen delivery to the brain. This research supports previous work on this topic published in 2013.
In the study, researchers looked at the effects of inducing anoxia on the brain and heart activity within rats. Results showed that anoxia triggered greater brain activity during the dying process than in the waking state, creating visions that are similar to those experienced by survivors of cardiac arrest.
In addition, a release of neurotransmitter chemicals is thought to be the cause of the hallucinations that have been reported from near-death experiences. The findings of the study were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

2015-08-24,CMU,India,"“Defense wins championships.”
Despite the effects of player safety rules that have allowed offenses to gain more yardage and score more points than ever before, defense remains the top priority for any team that wants a shot at Super Bowl glory. This was proven more than convincingly when the Seattle Seahawks decimated the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII.
Defense has always been the key to success in the AFC North, and the Pittsburgh Steelers have known it since the days of the Steel Curtain in the 1970s. Competition on the defensive front, however, has been very tough. The Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, and Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh’s rivals in the AFC North, all sported top-10 defenses at some point in the 2014 season.
Although Cleveland is hardly a threat with an offense that doesn’t know what to expect from new quarterback Johnny Manziel after letting go of quarterback Brian Hoyer, the Bengals and the Ravens will certainly stand as enormous obstacles to Pittsburgh’s return to the playoffs, and the Ravens almost certainly pose a substantial threat if both teams face each other in January.
What stands out for the 2015 Steelers is the number of question marks on the defense following a very weak performance last year by the Steelers’ lofty standards. While the Steelers’ run defense was sixth in the league last year, their pass rush was markedly weaker, ranking only 26th in sacks. The linebacker corps, however, are undeniably ready to pressure opposing quarterbacks.
Veterans like linebackers James Harrison and Lawrence Timmons provide the team with tremendous leadership and production, and the young talents like linebackers Ryan Shazier and Bud Dupree are ready to become a part of the long legacy of Steeler greats. Their secondary though, will have to quickly establish a new identity with the loss of longtime strong safety Troy Polamalu and cornerbacks Ike Taylor and Brice McCain.
After the Steelers finished 27th in the league in passing yards allowed and making only 11 interceptions all season, someone will have to step up in order to revitalize the team’s defense. Rookie cornerbacks Senquez Golson and Doran Grant are both promising talents to shore up the Steelers secondary, but veteran players like cornerbacks William Gay and Cortez Allen will have to lead the secondary to traditional Steelers expectations. Taking on the offensive juggernauts in the league will prove to be a challenge for this unit, and only time will tell whether or not they are ready for this task.
The offense, on the other hand, stands ready to take on any defense in the league, something Pittsburgh hasn’t been known for until last year. Offensive coordinator Todd Haley managed to turn the Steelers offense into a dynamic unit last year that saw quarterback Ben Roethlisberger have his best statistical season in the league.
Running back Le’Veon Bell proved to be made for more than just the Steelers’ traditional run-heavy offense with his ability to make big plays from dump-off passes, and he offered a much needed rushing threat to allow Roethlisberger some room from defenses that had to honor Bell’s talent.
The receiving corps are certainly some of the most talented Pittsburgh has ever had. Wide receiver Antonio Brown challenged Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson for the title of best wide receiver in the league; though Johnson was rated higher on NFL Network’s annual Top 100 Players list, Brown certainly came close for his dynamic contributions last season.
Receivers Markus Wheaton and Martavis Bryant both capitalized on the attention defenses had to give to Brown, combining for almost 1,200 yards and scoring plenty of touchdowns. Tight end Heath Miller remains a steady commodity for the offense, catching passes and blocking for others with almost equal ease.
Most importantly, the offensive line, long considered a weakness for the Steelers given how often opposing defenses had managed to get to Roethlisberger even if the line did not take him down, has undergone a remarkable boost over the past few years. With the support of offensive line coach Mike Munchak, the offensive linemen have formed an elite unit, particularly with young talent like center Maurkice Pouncey and right guard David DeCastro.
Overall, the Steelers seem poised to make a serious playoff run, though exactly how long it will last will likely depend on their success in the regular season. Pittsburgh certainly has the talent to win the AFC North, but Cincinnati and Baltimore will undoubtedly make strong challenges for that title. Among the elite teams in the AFC, the Steelers defense will surely be tested when they face the likes of the Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Indianapolis Colts; however, armed with an offense that can match every point their foes score, the Pittsburgh Steelers have every reason to believe that they can bring home yet another Super Bowl victory ..

2015-08-24,CMU,India,"Today, more than 3 billion people are connected to the World Wide Web, making the digital realm an ideal place for marketers and advertisers to promote their products, services, and opinions. Ever since the first clickable web ad was sold in 1993 by Global Network Navigator to a San Francisco law firm, online advertising has been advancing, to the point where online ads can be customized to fit a user’s interests and needs. ​But as online ads have become more specifically tailored to each user, researchers suggest that advertisers unfairly target users of a particular demographic.
A recent study conducted by a team of researchers including Anupam Datta, an associate professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, focused on Google ads shown to users with different ad settings. Datta’s study of Google online ads is part of an overarching goal to learn more about the scientific foundations of security and privacy. Datta started the project with Amit Datta, a doctoral student in Carnegie Mellon’s electrical and computer engineering department, and Michael Tschantz, a former doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University who is currently a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.
​In their study, the research group used AdFisher, a tool they designed to run automated experiments on customized ad settings. The tool runs 1000 browsers, simulating 500 female users and 500 male users. The gender of each simulated user was marked on Google’s Ad setting page, which is meant to provide users some control over the ads they receive online. Before the experiment, the researchers ensured that gender was the only difference between the two groups.
The browsers were then directed to top 100 websites for employment that were listed on Alexa, an Amazon-owned company that provides web traffic data services. A built-in feature of AdFisher enables the browsers to collect ads on any of the visited websites. www.TimesofIndia.com, the website of a popular newspaper, was chosen for most of the experiments as it provided the most Google ads per page reload.
“AdFisher then used machine learning and statistical analysis to identify the differences among the ads served to the males and females,” Anupam Datta explained in an email interview with The Tartan.
The results showed that an ad from a career coaching service, with the promise of high-paying executive level jobs, was targeted significantly more towards men than women. The study determined that male users were shown the ad 1816 times, while women were only shown the add 311 times.
“We were surprised and concerned by this finding,” Anupam Datta said.
While the results from AdFisher detect discrimination in Google’s ad targeting, it does not provide a full picture as to why this is happening. Datta and his colleagues have several theories as to what caused the phenomenon. Google’s targeting algorithm may have learned that males are more likely to click on a particular ad than females, and therefore used that information to promote more relevant ad targeting. It is also possible that the advertisers themselves chose to target males over females, a request that could easily be carried out by Google’s massive, automated advertising system. The researchers believe that it is unlikely that Google programmed their advertising ecosystem to show a bias toward male users over female users.
The researchers also noted the possibility that the results were influenced by Google’s security measures to detect robots. “Indeed, it is possible that Google suspected that the browser activities were conducted by bots rather than humans in our experiments and therefore treated them differently,” Datta said. “However, we consider it unlikely that they decided to serve ads in a discriminatory manner after making such a determination.”
The root of the issue lies within what are called “black boxes,” algorithms or other programs whose inner workings are unknown.
“In today’s society, important decisions in many sectors are being made by a combination of algorithms and humans who act from within black boxes,” Datta stated. “Their operation is not transparent to the people who are subjected to these decisions, making it difficult to hold them accountable for undesirable outcomes.”
To study the lack of transparency in Google’s ad system, the researchers had a group of simulated users visit top websites for substance abuse, while another group of simulated users was idle. The substance abuse visitors were exposed to more ads for alcohol and drug rehabilitation centers, but Datta and his colleagues noticed that the control group did not receive any of those ads.
Furthermore, the search for substance abuse had no effect on the Google Ad Settings page, perhaps for the same reasons that targeted ads seemed to produce gender discrimination. However, the researchers suspect that the results may be due to remarketing, in which an advertisement from a visited website continues to follow the user on the Internet.
While Google did not officially address these findings, the company has recently reworded its ad settings page to indicate the limits of users’ control over what is targeted to them.
Even as Google utilizes personal data to produce more relevant advertising, its lack of transparency may set up systems for unintentional abuse, such as helping to maintain the gender gap in salaries. “Online advertisements and recommendations are a gateway to opportunities, and this form of differential treatment based on gender can unfairly limit opportunities,” Datta explained.
Currently, the researchers are working with Microsoft to develop tools that can offer more internal oversight of information processing ecosystems, particularly the ad ecosystem. 
Datta expects that there will be more work done in making companies more accountable when concerning behaviors, including discrimination, arise from their information systems. His group believes that using AdFisher will help identify violations in black box information systems during future studies.
“Our research findings provide the first proof of existence of discrimination in online behavioral advertising,” stated Datta. “Thus demonstrating that the problem exists in practice, not just in theory.”.

2015-08-31,CMU,India,"The university announced a $35 million donation earlier this week from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the fifth-largest donation in the university’s history and one of a string of recent gifts.
TCS is a worldwide technology services and consulting company, operating in 46 countries and generating billions of dollars in revenue. TCS is a household name in India, where it is headquartered, and has a growing brand both in the United States and worldwide. TCS is among the largest Indian corporations, as measured by its $80 billion market capitalization, and is the largest Indian IT company.
Natarajan Chandrasekaran, CEO and managing director of TCS, hopes that the donation and ensuing partnership between the company and Carnegie Mellon will make TCS well-known to college students at Carnegie Mellon and across the country. “In the future we’re looking to see some CMU graduates and undergraduates joining TCS as the place to be,” Chandrasekaran said. “Because we’re going to be focusing on creating a future which will solve not only industry problems, but create great breakthroughs in solving some of the societal problems.”
The donation was announced on Tuesday by a campus-wide email from University President Subra Suresh, along with a panel discussion and meeting of members of the Innovators’ Forum. According to the email, “The contribution will fully fund construction of a new building along Forbes Avenue, and support the Presidential Fellowships and Scholarships program.”
This expansion, one of many campus improvements coming in the next few years, will transform Forbes Avenue into what Suresh calls an “innovation corridor.”
The partnership between TCS and Carnegie Mellon, Suresh says in the email, will “play an important role in improving our ability to meet the needs of students, faculty and staff in an increasingly global environment.”
At the event, Suresh spoke about how the donation would be used to further Carnegie Mellon’s expansion. Suresh further explained the role the partnership with TCS will play in the university’s global reputation as a technological innovator. Suresh and Chandrasekaran met about a year ago. The two leaders, Suresh said, discovered immediately that they had the same overarching ideas about the future of global innovation, and have been working together since then to form a mutually beneficial partnership between Carnegie Mellon and TCS.
“We can connect with a company that has the capacity to engage a certain percentage of the globe,” Suresh said at the event. “Carnegie Mellon, as a global university, can also play a significant role in taking its talents outside of Pittsburgh.”
Chandrasekaran, who traveled from Mumbai for the event, also spoke hopefully of a bright future of collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and TCS. “I am very, very happy and proud that we have this wonderful partnership developing between TCS and Carnegie Mellon,” he said. “As Subra mentioned, I’ve known him only for less than a year, but we’ve developed a very good alignment of thought in terms of what the possibilities are [for the future].”
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf also spoke at the event, emphasizing Carnegie Mellon’s role in attracting money, research, and innovation to the state of Pennsylvania. “[This partnership] shows what we can do when a world-class company and a world-class university partner up,” Wolf said. “This is gonna be really amazing for this place. The spirit of innovation we so rightly attribute to the market — to the free market — is actually magnified by this kind of marriage.”
After the speakers, Dean of Dietrich College and professor of philosophy Richard Scheines moderated a panel discussion on “Industry-Academic Partnerships: A New Global Era.” the panelists took questions from the audience, and discussed how TCS could work with Carnegie Mellon for mutual benefit.
The panel consisted of Chandrasekaran, Head of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and professor of biomedical engineering Jelena Kovacevicć, and professor of materials science and engineering and engineering and public policy Jay Whitacre. The panelists discussed their own experiences working between corporations and universities, and how the two can best work together.
The panelists spoke on how the partnership could benefit both TCS and Carnegie Mellon. “This combination can really create a powerful impact. The companies have access to top talent, and we, in turn, get access to companies to place our students,” Kovacevicć said. 
“And finally, there is the education and learning part of it. By placing our students into internships, they get to see what the real world looks like, and they get a gradual ascent from their work being only about education to their work just being work.”.

2015-09-14,CMU,India,"Usually, the Super Bowl is won by one of the two or three teams that everyone expects to win the Super Bowl. Occasionally, however, an underdog breaks through that ceiling, like the Ravens in 2013 or the Giants in 2012.
This article takes two teams who are not part of the triumvirate of Super Bowl favorites (the Packers, Seahawks, and Patriots) and makes the case for why they might be the surprise team hoisting the Lombardi this February in Santa Clara.
Indianapolis Colts
While many people see the Colts as a close second to the Patriots or even a favorite to win the AFC, betting markets still see the Patriots and even the likely declining Broncos as surer bets to reach Super Bowl Sunday. This underestimation is misguided.
The main reason is the Colts’ offseason. To start this offseason, the Colts had four problem spots. First, the running back group was an absolute disaster, with Trent Richardson serving as the symbol of a group that failed to ever do much of anything. Second, the defensive line was weak, as outside linebacker Bjoern Werner failed to justify his second round draft slot. Third, Reggie Wayne’s departure left a huge hole for a receiver across from T.Y. Hilton. Finally, the offensive line was a mess, with tackle Gosder Cherlius simply not living up to his billing.
Other spots such as the secondary weren’t great Vontae Davis proved he was one of the league’s best cornerbacks last year, but one cornerback doesn’t make a secondary. General manager Ryan Grigson took those into account as well in free agency even though they weren’t disasters.
The Colts fixed all of these problems. Former San Francisco running back Frank Gore, though no longer a star, is a competent running back who can add yards to the end of a play with his patience and cutting ability. Former Philadelphia outside linebacker Trent Cole continued to play very well last year and will add a much needed extra weapon to replace the Colts’ long time star Robert Mathis. Former Texans wide receiver Andre Johnson brings Reggie Wayne’s experience and possession receiving style while arguably being an improvement talent wise. Former Philadelphia guard Todd Herremans has been great every year he has not been injured (as he was last season). He’ll help shore up the interior of a line that, for years, has looked like it was hired by the rest of the AFC South to get quarterback Andrew Luck killed. Safety Mike Adams and cornerback Darius Butler could help shore up the secondary.
All of the offseason changes are reasons to think the team will improve, while not even mentioning that Luck is entering his fourth year. He still has plenty of room to grow, and he has gotten tangibly better with both his accuracy and decision making through each of his first three seasons. 
It seems extremely likely that the Colts will waltz through their division. However, with the Broncos weakened and the Patriots losing their secondary and starting three rookies on the offensive line, the Colts might face weak competition all the way to the Super Bowl. There’s no reason to exclude them from the discussion of who can take home the prize.
Dallas Cowboys
Last year the Cowboys had an incredible offense, driven by a powerful and skilled offensive line. In their positions, Quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant were among the league’s best. While this team may miss running back DeMarco Murray, running backs rely on their offensive lines to break open holes. 
Murray was not considered a particularly good back until the Dallas offensive line went supernova two years ago. Replacing Murray with running backs Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden will likely work fine.
The defensive side is more questionable, but it lacked talent last year, too. Rookie defensive end Randy Gregory almost certainly would have been a high first round pick if he wasn’t caught committing the apparently unforgivable crime of smoking pot. The return of linebacker Sean Lee adds more talent, and Defensive Coordinator Rod Marinelli has his sterling reputation for a reason. The Cowboys’ troubled defense last season was only slightly below average, and still made it within one play of the NFC Championship game.
With an improvement on the defense and the offense continuing to hum, it’s possible the Cowboys can finally shed the endless ridicule of the last six seasons and grab Super Bowl 50..

2015-09-14,CMU,India,"Two weeks ago, Carnegie Mellon announced a $35 million dollar donation from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a tech services firm based in Mumbai, India. The gift is the fifth-largest in the university’s history, the largest donation from outside of the United States, and the largest gift that the university has ever received from a corporation.
Securing funds and donations for Carnegie Mellon has been one of University President Subra Suresh’s most prominent agenda items since he took office in November 2013. Suresh has procured deals and gifts from a variety of sources, including Uber — a five-year-old ride-sharing company already worth more than $50 billion — and Legendary Entertainment, a production company founded and chaired by Carnegie Mellon trustee Thomas Tull. 
Many of these donations are providing funding for the upcoming Tepper Quadrangle, an ongoing project that will turn what is now the Morewood Gardens parking lot into a brand-new space for university-wide learning and collaboration. The project was kicked off by a $67 million donation from David Tepper (GSIA ’82), announced the same day as Suresh’s inauguration ceremony. 
All of these donations are good for Carnegie Mellon’s national and international reputation, gradually bringing it closer to Ivy League schools like Harvard University, which received a $400 million donation this summer — its largest ever. More money is rarely a bad thing: Carnegie Mellon, like many United States institutions of higher education in recent years, is chronically underfunded. 
Many of the gifts that Carnegie Mellon has received since Suresh took office, however, have come from financially powerful corporations built on ethically shaky foundations. TCS, for example, has recently come under fire for exploiting U.S. Department of Labor policies to replace American workers with foreign-born employees on temporary H-1B visas. 
While this is a nuanced and contentious issue, TCS is playing into a flawed system by exploiting foreign-born workers — many of them from India — as part of lucrative deals with American companies who lay off thousands of American employees so that they can be replaced with relatively low-wage foreign workers. The recently laid-off employees are often forced to train their replacements, who in turn are underpaid and overworked. The system benefits no one but the companies responsible for the new contracts — companies like TCS.
Likewise, Uber has made a name for itself in its short history by strong-arming local and national governments to assert its dominance. Whether or not you support the so-called “sharing economy,” it’s undeniable that Uber’s business practices have been questionable at best. 
Although Uber was officially legalized in Pittsburgh six months ago, the company had continued to operate after a cease-and-desist order from the city’s Department of Transportation. Uber has also aggressively infringed upon the business of its largest competitor, Lyft, and was recently embroiled in a controversy after being faced with a class-action lawsuit from its drivers over their status as contractors, not employees. 
It should have come as no surprise, then, when Uber immediately poached around 40 of Carnegie Mellon’s top roboticists from the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) after entering into a partnership with the university in February. 
Last week, Uber announced a $5.5 million donation to the university, which many see as belated compensation for the brain drain caused by the partnership. Although the Uber-Carnegie Mellon partnership was ostensibly for the purpose of furthering research on self-driving vehicles, it sometimes feels like even the architects of the deal aren’t sure what the terms are. 
Carnegie Mellon has marketed the recent partnership with TCS as an opportunity for students to work with the internationally known tech company and create a ""lasting impact."" 
“As global leaders, Carnegie Mellon and TCS have the intellectual power, creativity, institutional nimbleness, and global reach to capitalize on new opportunities and have a lasting impact on society and industry through cutting-edge digital research and a long-term commitment to education,” TCS CEO and Managing Director Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in a university press release on the subject.
Still, it’s hard to see how the partnership will directly benefit students. The university’s lack of fiscal transparency makes it difficult to follow the money, and even more difficult to see how these donations improve the lives of Carnegie Mellon students. Suresh said,  for example, at the university event announcing the donation, that the money will go toward the creation of the Forbes Avenue “innovation corridor,” part of the university’s planned expansion that remains wrapped in abstraction and hyperbole. 
Although some of the money is going toward more immediate goals, like the endowment of presidential scholarships and building the new facilities of the Tepper Quadrangle, few of these projects have immediate, tangible impacts on student life. Often, Carnegie Mellon focuses more on using high-minded, empty rhetoric to please corporate sponsors than on the heart of the university — its students.
The university is also facing the problems inherent in corporate-academic partnerships and the clashing ideologies of free market-driven, globalized companies and the (theoretically) purely research-driven university. Can anyone really blame Uber, for example, for acting in its own best interest by offering higher salaries to Carnegie Mellon roboticists, many of whom are world-renowned leaders in their fields? 
Corporations have a vested interest in doing what’s best for their bottom line, while universities work toward intellectual goals, regardless of profit. These lines are becoming blurred, however, as Carnegie Mellon begins more and more to resemble the corporations that it feeds off of. 
The size and frequency of donations to the university are an important metric on many best-of lists — notably the U.S. News and World Report’s well-respected university rankings — but it’s frustrating that Carnegie Mellon is focusing on garnering donations from companies, rather than focusing on the welfare of its constituents. Carnegie Mellon needs to build its reputation from the ground up by strengthening its academic programs and catering to those who pay to attend the university: the students..

2015-09-21,CMU,India,"Last Tuesday saw the return of The Mindy Project not to our TVs, but to our computers. The show premiered its fourth season on the online streaming service Hulu.
In a perfect world, our favorite TV shows would run continuously, forever. We would never have to say goodbye to our beloved characters, or be left hanging with an unsatisfactory, last minute series wrap-up. Unfortunately, this isn’t a perfect world, and sometimes bad things happen to good shows.
Just a few years ago, low ratings and a cancellation meant the absolute end to a show. In today’s new world full of on-demand streaming sites, a network cancellation isn’t the goodbye it once was.
At FOX, The Mindy Project suffered from low ratings and an apparent lack of network support. This funny, offbeat show was often overshadowed by more prominent ones, leaving it in the dreaded cycle of low ratings, low support, and even lower ratings. Finally, after three seasons on the air and perpetual bubble status, Mindy was cancelled by FOX, and fans were left dejected.
In swoops Hulu with the save! After a few weeks of teasing and assurances that all hope was not lost, creator and star Mindy Kaling announced a partnership with Hulu that would bring the show back for a 26-episode fourth season. Episodes are to be released on a weekly basis, without the conflicts of sports or other programming that throw off schedules on network television.
The other big change is in terms of content. Kaling and the show’s team of writers are no longer bound by the same rules that officially (and unofficially) govern network television. She can be more vulgar, more direct, and more controversial and still have those aspects of the writing make it to air. But the show won’t go too far off the deep end, fellow writer and star Ike Barinholtz told the LA Times. “I think if we really changed the show too much and made it more risqué and put it more on a tilt of stuff you might find on HBO or Showtime, I think we would turn off our core viewers.”
This new freedom was apparent in season four’s first episode, ""While I Was Sleeping."" The episode makes a more direct homage to romantic comedies than usual, mirroring such classics as 1998’s Sliding Doors. Picking up after the season-ending fight with Danny (Chris Messina) about marriage, Mindy dreams up an alternate reality where they don’t share that titillating kiss on the plane in season two.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt guest stars as her husband in this alternate reality, where she discovers that without Danny in her life, she’s stuck in an open marriage and managing a business venture marketing “slutty girdles for the obese” — a far cry from her fertility clinic. Meanwhile, Danny has flown to India to come clean about their situation to her parents, where he ends up changing his mind about marriage as an institution. It’s a fairly formulaic plot line, with the predictable ending that has both of them reversing their positions — but winding up engaged anyways.
Along the way we get snapshots of what this new venture may look like. Characters have the freedom to be a little more direct in their crudeness, such as when Morgan (Barinholtz) claims he went to Pakistan first in his search for Danny, and that the Taliban attempted to recruit him. Not really offensive, but not-PC enough to be noticeable.
This week’s episode also went a step further than it had in the past about sexuality, making more overt references to sexual positions and acts than would have been allowed on a network. The question left in viewers’ minds is whether this is the new normal or if Kaling is just beginning to flex her new muscle.
Change is good, and Kaling deserves to have her writing and style be supported by her “network,” but going too far off the map could alienate viewers. For instance, this episode also featured a very heavy voiceover by Kaling’s character. At times, this was helpful since she didn’t have her normal people to bounce her thoughts off of. Here, the viewer replaced someone like Morgan or Danny, becoming the sounding board for her reactions.
At times though, the voiceover was just annoying and felt like a way for Kaling to push the envelope — even if she didn’t necessarily have to. At a few points, she even did so to the point of alienating her character, wondering to herself why Levitt’s character would want to “marry [her] fat ass.”
Kaling’s character has consistently toed the line of being self-confident, but also aware of her body issues. Throughout the show’s run, she’s made it clear that while she has insecurities about her weight, she also firmly believes that she is smoking hot and any guy would be lucky to have her.
So the idea that she would suddenly wonder why an attractive, wealthy man would want to be with her, simply because she thinks she’s fat, is unsettling to the viewer. Maybe, hopefully, this is a byproduct of what’s intended to be an internal monologue, which won’t be present for the rest of the season.
Change is good, and changing the content of the show’s writing could be great. But changing the tone and radically changing characters would be a disappointment..

2015-09-21,CMU,India,"Being a CEO in the modern business climate is a daunting challenge. The global economy is constantly transforming, forcing businesses to change and adapt in an unstable market. 
In the current period of economic instability and decreased growth, many stress that change is the ultimate way to save the organization — otherwise companies face dying out.
This is exactly what David Farr, chairman and chair executive officer of Emerson Electric Company, believes. Farr visited the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon this past week to discuss business strategy reform, his successes, and his work as the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Emerson’s original business model to sustain growth functioned very well from the year 2000 to the year 2012, but in 2012, the company experienced a significant decrease in sales growth. 
As a result, Farr changed the structure of the company and adjusted his business model to better suit a world of shrinking global fixed income.
Farr focused the new strategy on delivering better growth, broader customer solutions, more robust profitability, and higher returns. “Without growth, no company can make an earning in the long run,” Farr said.
The foundation of Emerson’s new business strategy is made up of the management process, the talent within the company, the technology, and the investments. 
The management process must be reworked every year to ensure the company’s growth. The talent in the company must be reallocated to its most optimal position; Emerson needs “the right people, in the right places, with the right resources,” Farr said.
In addition, global technology must be carefully monitored and updated to suit customers’ needs and to maintain the company’s leadership in the market. Some new technologies may be disruptive to older companies, so Emerson must understand new technological developments and be willing to adapt to the changing world. “Emerson is utilizing the key disruptive technologies of the 21st century to unlock new opportunities for growth,” Farr said.
Lastly, investments in Emerson help the company establish presence and strengthen its position in new markets. Historically, this was not a problem, as Emerson surpassed the S&P 500 in terms of economic growth, but the company has been shrinking significantly since 2014. Farr was therefore forced to change his business strategy and worked with his board to adjust the company. 
Adjusting the structure was complicated, because Farr could not base Emerson’s business model on global economic growth. 
Currently, global fixed income and worldwide economic growth is decreasing. Farr therefore strategically shrunk his company to better suit the market. He cut the company down from a $24.5 billion franchise to one of $16.3 billion, and Emerson consequently experienced a 2.4 percent increase in sales growth. Today, as a result of his strategic actions, Emerson is showing excellent growth. Farr went on to explain other strategic changes he implemented in his business model to ensure growth, and how the management held the company’s high position in the market. Mid-tier markets in Russia and India offer profitable opportunities for Emerson, Farr said. Emerson was once a very strong company in China, but other competing local companies started to form and take over some of the market. 
Therefore, Farr was forced to change Emerson’s market strategies or disappear completely from China’s market. He employed new strategies that would tie down the company’s upper tier and grow in the mid tier, thus keeping their position in the high tier and enabling Emerson to compete with other mid tiers.
Farr believes that to be a CEO, you must demonstrate that you can indeed be a leader and induce positive changes for a company. Before he became Emerson’s CEO, Farr urged the company to expand to Asia given the global economic changes that were occurring at this time. Now, Emerson still holds a strong position in the Asian market.
“To be a CEO, you have to make an impact, you need to demonstrate that you can make something big happen, not just sit behind a desk,” Farr said. Farr himself exhibits strong leadership and willingness to better his company for the future, concluding by saying, “I was given the keys to make this a better company for the next CEO.”.

2015-09-28,CMU,India,"TechBridgeWorld, a Carnegie Mellon research group, recently announced the creation of open-source software that assists educators of children with hearing and speaking disabilities create sign language video dictionaries and voice-activated games, titled Sign Book and Speak Up! respectively. The software was produced in collaboration with the Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind in Bangalore, India.
TechBridgeWorld is “spearheading the innovation and implementation of technological solutions relevant and accessible to developing communities,” according to the group’s website www.techbridgeworld.org. The website explains that by increasing the accessibility of technology in developing countries, they hope to “enhance not only the development process, but also the creativity and diversity of technological innovations accessible to all.”
Over the summer, TechBridgeWorld offered internships in their Innovative Student Technology ExPerience (iSTEP) program, which allowed students to participate in the development of the new software by conducting technology research abroad in Bangalore. The team of students included Erik Pintar, a fifth-year senior in human-computer interaction and electrical and computer engineering; Amal Nanavati, a sophomore computer science major; Maya Lassiter, a junior electrical and computer engineering major; and Minnar Xie, a fifth-year senior in humanities and arts and human-computer interaction.
The team helped launch the Sign Book project because teachers at Mathru’s School for the Deaf lacked proper sign language dictionaries in local languages. Although there are many references to teach American Sign Language, there are over 300 sign languages with unique grammar and signs, and Sign Book helps teachers create a video sign language dictionary with custom signs of the local language.
In a similar fashion, Speak Up! was developed to help educators teach hearing-impaired students, especially those who are unable to work with a speech therapist, to vocalize.
The team constructed a series of games to motivate students and give them feedback as to the type of sounds they were making. Games include causing birds to fly at different altitudes or fish to swim up and down depending on the pitch the student makes at a certain volume. There are ten games in total, and the package is designed for teachers to easily set up and adapt to their curriculum and local culture.
“Sign Book and Speak Up! were developed in such a way to empower teachers and enhance their teaching experience,” M. Bernardine Dias, associate research professor of robotics and TechBridgeWorld founder and director, said in a press release. “By providing teachers with the tools to create their own signs and come up with their own games, these solutions have the potential to be relevant for different communities and their unique needs. By releasing the software open source, our hope is that other educators will find our tools useful and that the open source community will build on the work we started.”
Both Sign Book and Speak Up! are available for download under the MIT Open Source license, keeping with TechBridgeWorld’s vision of a future in which technology is used to build bridges across communities instead of exacerbate divides..

2015-09-28,CMU,India,"The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust knows how to throw a good party, and their formula is simple: free food, free wine, and art with a purpose. In the Cultural District last Friday, artists and art-lovers communed over local and international creative works from the Cultural Trust’s Gallery Crawl and India in Focus showcase.
The Crawl was hosted by various galleries and nonprofits primarily residing on the parallel streets of Liberty and Penn Ave. Participants included bars and restaurants such as Olive or Twist, on Penn Ave, who displayed the work of Art Institute students in their second floor while serving drinks on the ground floor. Additionally, much of the Market Square businesses such as Gaby et Jules, the French bakery, remained open late into the night, serving specialties for hungry and thirsty “crawlers.”
The Crawl also served to kick off the India in Focus showcase, in which for six weeks, dozens of arts experiences paying homage to Indian traditions and culture will be displayed throughout the Cultural District. The kick off was held primarily at the outdoor stage where shows of music and dancing such as Bhangra were held continuously throughout the evening. Wood Street Gallery and SPACE gallery also participated in the kick off by opening new exhibits curated specifically for the showcase.
Wood Street Gallery served as a pseudo-entrance to the Crawl due to its prominent location on the Wood/6th St. triangular block. Perched above the Wood Street subway station were two floors of warmly lit, white-washed walls where the works of artists Nandini Valli Muthiah and Hetain Patel were displayed.
The second floor is home to the photographic series, “Eva,” as well as three standalone video works by artist Hetain Patel. The series is broken up into diptychs and triptychs, each of a different moment. Hetain’s wife is the subject of these photos. She is photographed from the back, showing only her head and torso. There is a drawing on her otherwise naked back in each of the moments. In one series, a man joins her in a silent conversation through the writings on both of their backs. Each moment is composed of two or three images which create a disjointed, schizophrenic feeling for the viewer and is particularly consistent with the stream of consciousness text displayed on the skin of the subject. The videos convey Hetain’s compulsion for exactitude as he reconstructs scenes from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and from footage of his father giving a tour of his factory.
Nandini Valli Muthiah’s photographic prints from her series “Definitive Incarnate” cover most of the third floor space. The work is supernatural in subject and cinematic in method. There is a certain canniness to her images ­— you may even feel as though you have seen the image before. But although the lighting, background and positioning of extras feels reminiscent of the way many modern films are shot, the subject is new. An Indian god named Krishna is presented plainly, at the focal point of the image, creating a new reality that is both familiar and unusual.
The contemporary gallery, SPACE, presented another exhibit called “PLUS ONE” as part of India in Focus, which included various mediums including installation, sound works, prints, and video. Separated only by temporary walls, the works of artists Shilpa Gupta, Sumakshi Singh, Surabhi Saraf, and Avinash Veeraraghavan manage to live in the space harmoniously. Each work contributes to the common theme of invoking the tradition of repetition and pattern-making in Indian visual culture. It is beautiful to see all the different ways in which this motif could be expressed. Saraf’s video of deconstructed dance and the rhythmic clapping of Gupta’s flap board piece “24:00:01” both served as interesting compliments to the music and dancing seen on the stage just several yards from the gallery doors. Saraf’s ”FOLD,” a large video installation, stitches together a mosaic of videos where a woman folds clothing, from shirts to saris, in a methodical and mesmerizing fashion. Singh’s projected stop-motion animation on silk with embroidery called “Light Threads” shows the birth of a pattern from nothing.
The Crawl had even more to offer than the experiential art exhibitions. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Arts Education Center presented a design exhibition where Young Architects and 2015 Design Competition entries displayed their visions for the future of architectural design in a lively and collaborative space. This location also invited guests to draw what design means to them amidst the inspiring and innovative work of the competitive entries.
Overall, the Cultural Trust’s Gallery Crawl was an upbeat scene where locals and visitors could commune over local and international artwork and experience the Cultural District at its very best..

2015-09-28,CMU,India,"U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Rahul Verma visited Carnegie Mellon University’s campus last Wednesday. 
The ambassador spoke about his personal connection to Pittsburgh and its Indian community, the growing relationship between America and India, and how India will grow and thrive in the future. It was, in essence — “Why India Matters.” The Indian population in America has been steadily increasing in recent years. 
There are more than three million Indian Americans in the U.S. alone, and, according to University President Subra Suresh, “This is the group with the highest family income in the US.”
The same increase in the Indian-American population reflected at Carnegie Mellon. Founded by Andrew Carnegie, a native of Scotland, Carnegie Mellon values the importance of diverse international contributions.
Verma traces his roots just up north; the ambassador was born in Edmonton, Canada. His father taught English at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in Indian Literature. 
Verma knows the Pittsburgh area well and calls himself a lifelong Steelers fan. When reflecting on his times in western Pennsylvania, Ambassador Verma described his family first arriving here broke in a station wagon, but still feeling welcomed with open arms. “I really do think there is something special about this area, and what immigrants in particular have done in this area,” Verma said.
Verma stressed that education is a vital part to the immigrant story. For many immigrants, education is their motivation behind leaving their homelands and undergoing the arduous task of starting over in a new country. Because of this, many immigrant children value education from an early age.
Ambassador Verma reflected on his time growing up with his parents and grandmother, who were teachers. He invited the audience to picture just how strongly the importance of education was imposed on him at a young age.
“You can imagine growing up in a house with two Indian teachers as your parents,” Verma said.
He then recounted a particular memory of him coming home in ninth grade with his report card. It reported five A’s and one A−. For the next three days he was plagued with questions of concern from his parents over the dreaded A−.
“ 'What could have happened? Was there a problem with the teacher? Did you not study?’ ” they asked.
“No matter where you come from, access to education can be the ladder that helps you climb from one social class to another and is the ultimate key to achieving the American dream,” Verma said, citing values already familiar to many Carnegie Mellon students.
Verma also talked about the importance of personal connections — it is not only what you know, but who you know. India and America have formed a close bond that has flourished for many years. Ambassador Verma talked about how the “shared values, the bonds between our [Indian and American] people, our cultures … the shared commitment to learning, innovation, and our democratic ideals” are what made the connection between the two countries a strong one with much potential and a sturdy grounding for sustainability. The strong bilateral relationship between Carnegie Mellon and India has had a noticeable impact on the university community. One such example of this is Carnegie Mellon University’s agreement with the Indian government. 
The agreement provides $2.4 million in fellowships so students from India can pursue more advanced studies in math, science, and engineering at Carnegie Mellon. 
Another example is the donation the university recently received from Tata Consultancy Services, which gave $35 million to build a state-of-the-art 40,000 square foot research facility. Relationships like these make a Carnegie Mellon education more accessible. India has seen its share of hardships; currently India has 300 million people without access to electricity, 650 million people that still live in villages, and 500 million people without flushable toilets. However, India has experienced rapid urbanization and shown many other signs of progress. 
Ambassador Verma discussed the growth that he expects India to have in the coming years; he expects India to have the most young people, the highest number of college graduates, and the most millionaires of any country in the world..

2015-09-28,CMU,India,"It has been almost a week since Nepal passed its first federal constitution, and tensions continue to escalate. As of Friday morning, 45 people — half of them police officers — have died in anti-constitution protests. Nepal’s southern neighbor India looms large over the conflict. While the crisis itself is worth of attention, it also points to bigger questions about the role of regional leaders. 
The new constitution, which was enacted on Sept. 20, has been in the works for seven years. Nepal has been functioning under an interim constitution since its monarchy was abolished in 2007. In less than a decade, Nepal has gone from being a theocratic Hindu Kingdom to a secular federal republic. These rapid changes have inflamed ethnic tensions.
Nepal is made up of several ethnic groups, and these minority groups experienced years of marginalization under the former monarchy. The two largest of these groups, the Madhesis and the Tharus, comprise 40 percent of Nepal’s population, and they live mostly in the southern plains region along the Indian border. In the last week, the south has erupted with protests against what many Madhesis view as their underrepresentation under the new constitution. 
Most recently, Madhesis protestors have barricaded the two main borders between India and Nepal, shutting down vital imports and applying pressure to the government in Kathmandu. The new constitution divides the country into seven provinces and distributes representatives based on both geography and population. 
Each of the 75 districts in the nation will receive a seat on the Legislative-Parliament, while the rest of the regionally elected seats will be distributed based on population. This is helpful for the rural, mountainous regions of Nepal, where population is sparse, but it also leads to an under-representation of the south, which is much more densely populated. 
India, as the regional leader of Southeast Asia, has had much to say about the week’s unrest in Nepal. After the constitution was ratified by the Constitutional Assembly, Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar rushed to Nepal to request a delay in its implementation. When that failed, the Indian government in New Delhi recommended seven amendments to the Nepalese constitution. These amendments sided heavily with the southern protesters and pushed for more population-based representation. 
India certainly has a vested interest in keeping Nepal stable. The two countries share an open border, and instability in Nepal would increase smuggling and terrorist traffic across it. Also, the Indian government fears that violence in Nepal’s south will spill over into the already unstable Indian state of Bihar. 
While these concerns are legitimate, India is overstepping its bounds. A constitution is meant to reflect the voice of a nation’s people, not that of its allies or neighbors. While support and advice during the writing process can be constructive, proposing amendments and trying to delay a constitution that was ratified by a democratically elected Constitutional Assembly is patronizing. Nepal is a sovereign nation, and its government deserves to be respected. 
The violence in Nepal is certainly troubling, and the 45 deaths are a tragic loss. However, when viewing this crisis, it is important to remember that state-building is rarely a peaceful or linear process. 
Although everyone wishes there was a peaceful path to representational democracy, we have yet to find one. By aggressively enforcing its will, India is stifling Nepal’s progress towards democracy and turning it into a puppet state. 
Rajeshwar Acharya, Nepal’s former ambassador to China, summed it up best when he said: ""Domestic issues of any country are corrected by the political actors and authorities of the same country and there is no need for any other country to issue instructions. It doesn't mean that Nepal can't work independently just because it is a small nation. All of our friendly nations are requested not to interfere into our domestic affairs,"" according to Republica. 
The entire political system of democracy rests on faith. A nation’s people need to have faith that their vote matters. When more powerful nations step in, they undermine that trust — no matter how good their intentions..

2015-09-28,CMU,India,"We’ve had a busy week here at Carnegie Mellon. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan visited last Friday, the Indian Ambassador to the United States Arun Singh arrived on Saturday, and his counterpart, the United States Ambassador to India Richard Verma, showed up on Wednesday. All of their talks had one thing in common: none mentioned the real problems of the issues they brought up.
This is a huge problem in policy, where high-level policy makers seem to be having different conversations than the grassroots activists and the people on the ground. At Carnegie Mellon, this culminated in a week of policy makers talking about absolutely none of the problems we actually have, and waxing poetic about the solutions they’ve found to problems we don’t have.
Duncan was on a panel along with other education professionals in Pittsburgh, including Carnegie Mellon faculty and the superintendent of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. One thing they kept coming back to in their discussions was education technology, or ""ed-tech"" — the idea of creating apps and programs to help students or teachers. 
Though ed-tech obviously has much potential, people are so busy building these apps that no one is testing whether they are actually doing what they’re supposed to be doing: helping students learn. But Duncan and the other panelists kept talking about how wonderful it was that Carnegie Mellon was partnering with different organizations in order to continue producing ed-tech, instead of actually researching how ed-tech should be used most effectively.
A similar thing happened with both of the ambassadors that visited this week. University President Subra Suresh started off his opening remarks for the Indian Ambassador with flowery language about how wonderful Carnegie Mellon is and how many doors we could open for Indian-Americans and Indian-born students. Suresh made this speech on the same day that the The New York Times released its ""Top colleges doing the most for low-income students"" list. We were ranked 154th, which we should frankly be ashamed of. 
I asked both ambassadors about an issue that I’ve discussed in the Tartan before: the worrying rise of Islamophobia and Hindu supremacy in India, specifically after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appointment to office. Both ambassadors waved me off and gave me very well-thought-out non-answers, which, to be fair, I expected.
What I didn’t expect was the outright arrogant nature of Indian Ambassador Arun Singh. He prefaced his answer by saying that normally, he prefers to speak only about India-U.S. relations, despite having just answered a question about centralization of government in India. Singh proceeded to tell me about India’s relationship with various religions, mentioning Islam exactly zero times. 
Meanwhile, the United States Ambassador Richard Verma simply told me that if I looked at Modi’s speeches, I would see that he was actually an asset to combating Islamophobia in India. Neither of the ambassadors even touched on the issue that’s been dividing the country recently: the massive protests against the use of quotas for lower-caste people applying to educational institutions and government jobs.
I think this erasure of the real issues is especially hard to combat at a place like Carnegie Mellon, where most of the student body is highly apolitical. If the Secretary of Education tells students about how great ed-tech is, they’ll believe him. If the ambassador to India and his counterpart say that Modi is combating Islamophobia, students will believe them. 
I urge anyone curious about these problems to do their own research, form their own opinions, and come up with their own solutions. Because, sometimes, politicians and policy makers simply don’t know or talk about the actual issues..

2015-10-05,CMU,India,"A leader on the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team, senior Abishek Alla feels that playing for the tennis team gives him an outlet for competition outside of the class. The civil and environmental engineering major from Hyderabad, India has showcased dominant play over the last couple years, competed as the Tartan’s number one singles player for the past two seasons, and been named an All-American in singles both years.
When discussing his choice to participate with the team, he called attention to the break tennis provides from a day full of academic activities. Alla embraces his participation in tennis for the sheer enjoyment of being on top of the sport’s competition.
“I’m playing more seriously only because that’s a release from academics and it’s more to fun to be on the court than to be somewhere else,” said Alla.
In high school, Alla competed at a sports academy where athletics was a focus. Coming to Carnegie Mellon was a big change, but luckily he made the adjustment successfully.
“I came in prepared for [school] to be harder and then I guess it started going off well the first few weeks, and then it just kept going that way.”
Entering school at Carnegie Mellon poses challenges for many first-year students unfamiliar with the workload, and Alla noted that this makes it especially difficult for athletes at the university to balance their time well.
Late in the season, he pointed out, there is importance in “staying on top of all the academics so it doesn’t affect the playing in UAAs [the University Athletics Association Conference Championships]”.
However, he also observed that the impact of sports can be a great positive force on the athletes in season. When in season, athletes learn to do work efficiently for their classes, using time outside of practice better while operating under the added time pressure.
“I couldn’t see myself not playing. If I wasn’t playing tennis I feel like I’d have a lot of free time,” Alla said. Alla explained that since tennis teaches the players about “unconsciously finishing work,” when they aren’t playing; there is a lot of free time.
This makes a good lesson for the younger athletes, since, Alla said, the younger members of the team are still learning to manage the different academic load and find balance with other activities. Alla sees losing sleep as the big pitfall to a student athlete looking to succeed in school and in tennis.
He advises that “if you’re spending too much time on a problem you should just go to the TA [teaching assistant] and ask for help or just email someone instead of staying up for 12 hours doing it on your own.”
Successfully adjusting to the academic workload will be key for the tennis team this season, with a strong first-year presence on the team that’s sure to be large part of the winning formula.
Alla explains that a strong work ethic from the first-years on the team this season is making up for the loss of three of last years seniors from the varsity team and giving the team a chance to “make history.”
Alla views this weekend’s upcoming ITA regional tournament in Fredericksburg Virginia as a good test of how both he and the team stack up competitively against the competition. In the singles tournament, he expects strong competition, both with rival tennis players, like a strong player from John’s Hopkins University who Alla believes is likely to take the top seed in the draw, and with teammates. He anticipates many of the tough matches to come against other strong Carnegie Mellon tennis players who will also play in the tournament.
In addition to being able to cope with added academic responsibility, Alla explains the significance of the coaching staff in allowing the tennis players from both the men’s and women’s teams to train efficiently through the season. The tennis coaching staff must deal with limited court openings throughout the day, needing to organize times for all athletes on both tennis teams to take advantage of the courts closed to public use during the day.
On the whole, Alla’s experience handling tennis along with a typical student workload helps him succeed both on and off the court..

2015-10-19,CMU,India,"Diwali, or the Festival of Lights, is an ancient Hindu festival celebrated in the Fall. Having the same connotation in India that New Year’s Day does in Western cultures, the festival celebrates the brightness and color in life. 
While Diwali’s official celebration is only in a few weeks, the student organization OM organized it the past week between Oct. 13 and 17. OM grouped Diwali festivities together with the celebration of Navarathri, because it is a well-liked festivity among all students on campus.
Navarathri, a festival dedicated to the Hindu deity Durga, is celebrated over nine nights with each day being represented by a different color — usually expressed through colorful outfits — depending on what events are happening on a certain day and how auspicious it is.
The club organizes this week-long celebration at Carnegie Mellon every year by putting together a series of events where the main focus is light. 
Some of the events organized this year included a Pujan (a traditional praying ceremony in the school chapel), the lighting of candles in front of the Jared L. Cohon University Center, and a Garba dance workshop. These events are directed not only at the Indian community at Carnegie Mellon, but also at the whole student body. According to Vice President of Communications of OM and junior economics and statistics major Srishti Jain, these events attract large crowds. The praying ceremony on Tuesday was comprised of twenty students. The students sang a common Indian prayer song and took a moment of silence to pray for good things to come.
For Jain, this is an important moment, especially because students are far away from their families at school. Thus, the organizers hoped to convey a homey feeling to those that are present. An event on Wednesday titled “Lights will guide you hOMe” gathered students on the Merson courtyard to light diyas — a kind of oil lamp — symbolizing lighting up one’s life and the world. The culmination of Diwali Week was Saturday in an event called Diwali Garba. In a combination of all that was celebrated during the week, this is the club’s biggest event. Diwali Garba took place in the CUC’s Wiegand Gymnasium, decorated with saris and lights, and it usually gathers three hundred to four hundred people in a family-style celebration that includes dinner followed by several performances of students such as the Raas dance team, folklore dances, and a cappella singing. It is also a good time to have fun with friends and dress up, as Srishti recalls sharing some of her traditional clothes with girls on her floor during her first year.
In order to sell tickets, OM has tried something different by posting the event on Carnegie Mellon’s new online ticket office to facilitate the process and broaden the spectrum of guests able to attend.
OM is one of the most prominent organizations on campus for Hindu, Sikh, and Jain spirituality and culture. The club organizes events throughout the year which focus not only on religious aspects of these groups but also on their cultural significance. Some events to look forward to are the Lohri in the Winter — a Sikh event where people gather around a giant bonfire while enjoying music, performances, s’mores and Indian-style corn — and Holi in the Spring, known as the festival of color, where people sing and dance, while chasing and coloring each other. 
Around 1000 people went to OM’s Holi celebration last year..

2015-11-02,CMU,India,"Popular comedian Aziz Ansari will release ten episodes of his new television series, Master of None, to Netflix on Friday, Nov. 6. Ansari gained fame and popularity with his portrayal of Tom Haverford on Amy Poehler’s comedy Parks & Recreation, in which Haverford navigated the politics of small government with loose morals and bizarre antics. Since then, Ansari has entertained his fans with various comedy specials, most notably Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening, and has, most recently, charmed America with his book Modern Romance. But beside his achievements in the world of comedy as it pertains to appearances and specials, Ansari has claimed a place in the lives of twenty-somethings as a sort of love guru.
Ansari speaks a lot to what relationships mean in the current day and how the process of dating has changed since he himself was in college. Ansari, now 32, discusses dating in the modern era with self deprecation, confusion, and with the goal of illustrating the challenges and changes presented to those who are trying to find love.
In Modern Romance, Ansari introduces the term “emerging adulthood” to describe the period in a person’s twenties in which they are exploring romantic options, while still developing as an individual. Ansari juxtaposes this period with the way the twenties were perceived back in the early to mid twentieth century, when marriage happened soon after high school and, more often than not, to an individual in the same neighborhood. Nowadays, people are bombarded with options with no clear life trajectory set up. Now, people often sift through a huge amount of people in their attempt to find their soulmate, instead of marrying a person they like for the opportunity and lifestyle it presents, and growing to love them more later.
While romantic comedies often portray a miracle ending to love, Ansari’s take on relationships deals with figuring out when to stop looking, or how to communicate through the noise of having too many options. This is why Master of None is set to be such an interesting, sentimental, and surely hilarious examination of love. As a person more than a little obsessed with love, and also social psychology, Ansari’s insights totally interest me and also scare me.
In the new trailer released last week, Ansari and a cast of characters, played by actors ranging from Noel Wells to Ansari’s own parents, all participate in the humor surrounding Ansari’s quest to figure out what he wants and then find it. The trailer includes a trip to a drugstore to buy some Plan B, discussions surrounding the difference in Instagram comments between genders, Ansari going to an audition where he is asked to demonstrate his talent with an Indian accent à la Ben Kingsley, and conversations about racism. One of the funniest parts of the trailer is Ansari’s conversation with his father, who talks about the problem he had with the first woman he considered romantically who he found too tall.
At one point, a friend asks Ansari’s character Dev to close his eyes and try to determine if he can see a future with a certain woman. Closing his eyes, Ansari answers “All I can see is black.” This seems to demonstrate that the show will take some light comic material and then reflect more deeply on it.
I often put people into two camps: those who embrace modern technology as wildly improving their lives but refuse to acknowledge the complications that it presents, and those who reject modern technology completely and don’t attempt to make it work for them. Ansari falls in the middle. He embraces the new technology that has made swiping through 50 potential matches in an hour possible, but is also quick to point out the way this is both great and terrible. His mission is to figure out how to make it less painstaking to use technology to find what you are looking for. Hopefully, with this awareness, those who find themselves in the “emerging adulthood” period can feel less lonely and understand the boat that they are in.
So far, Master of None has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from those who have seen the series ahead of its release. Both deadline.com and Entertainment Weekly have sung the show’s praises.
For anyone who has not watched Ansari’s ruminations on modern romance, I recommend watching some of his clips on Youtube. His stand up bits about explicit and uncalled for sexual text messages and his story about 50 Cent’s first grapefruit experience are great places to start. As a warning, Ansari does not deliver answers to the people. He does not have a secret recipe for success in love. But his theories and his observations and his sheer comedic talent make watching anything he does totally worth it.
Hopefully, this Friday, everyone will gain a little bit of wisdom while laughing uproariously at this semi-autobiographical Netflix Original..

2015-11-16,CMU,India,"Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns came to Carnegie Mellon to talk about “The Future of America’s National Security” last Tuesday.
Having played a leadership role in U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East and Asia and becoming one of the nation’s top career diplomats as undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2005–2008, R. Nicholas Burns offered a big-picture perspective of the country’s position on the world stage. Burns, former Ambassador to Greece and NATO, “reflects the intellectual culture we seek to create in the Institute for Politics and Strategy. In his many years in the state department’s Foreign Service and now as a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Ambassador Burns had become one of our nation’s top experts both in politics and strategy,” said Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences.
The Ambassador’s lifelong trajectory supports the notion that one may start as an intern, following their passions in school, and through dedication and hard work, eventually be called upon to negotiate some of the most challenging issues in the world today. “Carnegie Mellon has such an incredible reputation as one of our leading schools for engineering and computer science, being on the cutting edge of our 21st century economy, but it does have to be balanced by an understanding of global policy and global affairs,” Burns said.
A great part of Burns’ message focused on international cooperation and the United States’ role as a global leader, in any metric devised. He drew attention to the United States having the greatest economy in the world, an incredibly innovative student population, and an insurmountable amount of political influence. All of this combined highlights the country’s responsibility to maintain the safety and security of its own borders, but also the rest of the world — “in a global age, if we’re not engaged as the leader of a coalition, if we’re nor helping other people, then we injure our own security as well as theirs” Burns said.
The elimination of boundaries brought on by globalization has not only stimulated the global economy, but has also transformed the way nations look at predicaments. Climate change is one of those. The future of clean energy jobs and high tech jobs will be born in universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Carnegie Mellon, Burns said, and it is that kind of forward thinking that makes the United States an indispensable and exceptional power when it comes to leading change. Transnational alliances are key to solving this problem. Reaching out to countries such as China or India, some of the world’s largest carbon emitters, and redacting a climate agreement are believed to be some of the most important things President Obama will do during his mandate. By mid-December, the first global contract on climate change will most likely emerge, where every country in the world agrees to a mandated level of diminished carbon emissions, on a schedule that will take us forward during the next 30 or 40 years.
Other important issues that cross oceans and physical barriers are the trafficking of women and children as well as organized crime rings and drug cartels. There are so many elements involved in finding solutions to these issues, all of which require an enormous amount of cooperation.
“Part of it is getting to the source of the issue beyond America, but the most important part is getting to the root of the problem in our own country, in the hearts and minds and insecurities of our own kids, who are dependent on drugs,” R. Nicholas Burns said in an effort to highlight the role education plays in the mitigation of several global problems. Nonetheless, the magnitude of these issues requires the support of not only several nations, but also several resources such as the military, every level of government, and also businesses in America.
“Think about what is at stake in the transnational domain,” Burns said. “We have to be out there, engaging other countries as a leader and fight these problems before they can assault us.”
The lecture marked the introduction of Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences’ new academic unit which will focus on the study of political science, international relations and national security. Under the direction of Kiron K. Skinner, who brings an enormous amount of scholarship, energy, and dedication to the enterprise, the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) will serve as a center for research, undergraduate and graduate education, and university-wide initiatives..

2015-12-07,CMU,India,"Just before the season, I picked out four teams I thought might have surprising seasons – two teams whose fortunes might turn from the previous season and two who might make a surprise trip to the Super Bowl. Exactly none of the four predictions panned out. Here I’ll look into what I had wrong and why these predictions didn’t work.
Minnesota Vikings
I had the Minnesota Vikings improving dramatically from last season. However, almost immediately after the writing of that article, the Vikings lost right tackle Phil Loadholdt for the season, making the right side of the offensive line a major weak point heading into the season. Add in quarterback Teddy Bridgewater’s struggles in his second season trying to get the ball downfield combined with a series of receivers who are at their best 15 or more yards down the field, and it’s clear that this offense is a work in progress.
It’s possible the Viking’s defense has also been a key factor in its improvement in record this season, but they’ve struggled against the run and cornerbacks Terrance Newman and Trae Waynes have struggled to lock down number two receivers. Due to cornerback Xavier Rhodes eliminating most number one receivers, that pair has been picked on a lot. The linebacking corps has been excellent, but passes and runs to the outside have caused significant struggles for the second level of this defense. If they can find a cornerback-safety combination on the roster to complement Rhodes and safety Harrison Smith, this could be a top level defense, but in its current form it is definitely beatable.
The Vikings are 8–3 with a surprising lead in the NFC North, but they really have not been close to as good as their record this season. They continuously look unable to move the football and simply eke by bad teams. They were blown out in week one by the San Francisco 49ers, who are football’s worst team. The Vikings should look to use the rest of the season to build an offense more conducive to their quarterback’s talents — namely his pinpoint midrange accuracy and his stunning poise under pressure — to improve down the stretch.
Denver Broncos
This team, like the Vikings, is nowhere near as good as its 9–2 record might suggest. They slipped by in each of their first 6 games, winning by an average of six points and winning only one game by more than seven. They really should have come out of that stretch 3–3 and not 6–0, but those wins are banked. After surprisingly dominating the Packers (who have seen their own struggles since that game), the Broncos offense has ticked up to match their dominant defense. The reasons for the struggles of the offense were largely the scenario laid out in my predictions. The offensive line has meshed terribly and quarterback Peyton Manning is finally too old to play football. However, that defense led by linebacker Von Miller has been so good, they picked up the slack. The Broncos have also replaced Manning with quarterback Brock Osweiler who has been mediocre — a huge improvement over Manning’s disastrous performance. After a referee-provided win against New England, the Broncos now have four wins they have banked despite being thoroughly outplayed by their opposition. However, as the offense improves and the defense continues to destroy hopeless opposing quarterbacks, this team could be a scary sight come the playoffs.
Dallas Cowboys
It’s not too hard to figure out why Dallas went from possible Super Bowl contention to bottom feeder. The prediction was based on the idea that running back DeMarco Murray was not actually that important to this team and the success was due to his offensive line. That turned out to be true as running back Joseph Randle found plenty of success before losing his job to running back Darren McFadden, who also has played very well. However, quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant — both of whom are top three players at their position — have been injured for basically the entire season. Romo clearly had not healed from his broken collarbone before he came back, and now it’s broken again and he is out for the season, while Bryant does not have his usual burst. Without them, the offense has been helpless. The defense has improved, but their improvement from bad to subpar does not make up for the loss of their two best players. Even with a weak NFC East, this depleted Dallas roster won’t sniff the Super Bowl this season.
Indianapolis Colts
The Colts will make the playoffs this year based on their bad division, but they don’t deserve to. Quarterback Andrew Luck has missed lots of time with lacerations to his kidney, but the Colts looked horrible with him on the field. Backup quarterback Matt Hasselback has been okay in Luck’s place, but that’s all. The defensive moves general manager Ryan Grigson made actually worked, and the Colts defense has improved from disastrous last year to being pretty much league average this year.
On the other hand, the offense has been absolutely unable to do anything. The offensive line has been a nightmare and running back Frank Gore subsequently has holes to hit on offense.
Neither Luck nor Hasselback has had any time to throw and have struggled to hit any receivers. With the offense failing completely, an average defense has managed to keep this team hovering at .500, but winning the AFC South is not what the Colts had in mind before this season. 
At 6–5, there is still time for the Colts to right the ship. They have the talent to succeed offensively and make a deep playoff run. However, a season that began with Super Bowl aspirations is likely to end in divisional round as the Colts are steamrolled by a team that actually earned a playoff spot..

2015-12-07,CMU,India,"Universal Studios in talks with Tom Cruise for The Mummy reboot
On Nov. 23, it was reported that Universal Studios’ upcoming “Monsters Universe” was putting its pieces on the board with a selection of writers developing production strategy for reboots of the studio’s classic films. A reboot of The Mummy will be the first to emerge from the pack, and the studio is eyeing A-list action star Tom Cruise to play a leading role. Though this does not come as a shock, casting Cruise would be a home run choice for Universal. Cruise is one of the few true “action stars” remaining (along with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Vin Diesel, and Jason Statham) but he brings an additional level of acting talent that most others attempt to imitate. Cruise has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has been cranking out action hit after action hit in the past few years. The Mission: Impossible series just saw another success with Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Edge Of Tomorrow was one of 2014’s most pleasant surprises, and Cruise is currently filming the sequel to Jack Reacher, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. The deal between Cruise and Universal is not finalized yet (at least, not publicly) but adding his caliber of talent would only increase the value of the new shared “Monsters Universe.” The Mummy is set for release in March 2017.
Steven Spielberg comments on recasting Indiana Jones
Recasting roles is not a new phenomenon in Hollywood, especially iconic roles. Seven different actors have played James Bond since the early 1960s. We are about to meet our third Spider-Man since 2002 with Tom Holland. The first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was released in 1982 and was quickly followed by two more films and a third in 2008. Steven Spielberg, director of all four Indiana Jones films, has been hearing all the chatter about recasting the role with the likes of Chris Pratt or Bradley Cooper. As far as Spielberg is concerned, Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford and Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones.
“I don’t think anyone could replace Harrison as Jones, I don’t think that’s ever going to happen,” Spielberg said in an interview with Screen International. “It’s certainly not my intention to ever have another actor step into his shoes in the way there have been many actors that have played Spider-Man or Batman. There is only going to be one actor playing Indiana Jones and that’s Harrison Ford.”
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm and producing partner with Spielberg, has confirmed a fifth film is on their radar, but has no timetable for production or release. There is no denying Spielberg’s power in Hollywood, and the exponential growth of that power when discussing a film series he is synonymous with building into the cinematic juggernaut it became. Personally, I think recasting the character would offer more opportunities for the survival of Indy. Obviously, should Harrison Ford return to the character, I would be first in line at the theater, but considering Ford is entering his mid-70s, I am willing to put the character and the story in front of the man. Harrison Ford brought Indy to life and I’ll always be able to go back and watch The Temple of Doom whenever I need a dose of Harrison charm, but recasting the character would give Lucasfilm the freedom to think long-term about the franchise and develop any of the numerous stories that have been formed around the character. The creative team behind Indy is the same team behind Star Wars, but the franchises are very different. Indiana Jones needs a refreshing start to attract new audiences, especially in international markets, and attaching a new face may be just what the doctor ordered.
Universal Studios eyeing Ryan Gosling for Neil Armstrong biopic
Based on the James Hansen novel “First Man: A Life of Neil A. Armstrong” Universal Studios is looking to secure The Notebook star Ryan Gosling to star as the famous astronaut in the upcoming biopic aptly titled First Man. Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) is attached to direct, and this would not be the first time Gosling and Chazelle would work together. The two are currently filming La La Land, a musical starring Gosling as a jazz pianist who falls in love with an aspiring actress played by Emma Stone. Chazelle made his directorial feature film debut with Whiplash and directed J.K. Simmons to an Academy Award win, so his ability to draw out amazing performances is tested and proven.
The “Space Race,” as it was called, is an extraordinary time in American history and Armstrong made world history in 1969. Nearing the 50th anniversary would be a real treat to learn about the man’s story and re-experience the magic that space travel offers. As far as Gosling is concerned, La La Land is still shooting, and he is slated to star in the sequel to Blade Runner. That film begins production next summer, and First Man would likely follow. Gosling can be seen in The Big Short, hitting theaters December 11, 2015, and in La La Land, which is set for release on July 16, 2016..

2016-01-25,CMU,India,"“Hydrogen Jukebox,” a 1990 musical collaboration between Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg and the latest operatic production from the School of Music, is a very fitting title for the collaboration between two titans of American 20th century culture: a fusion of thought and music in a single atomically explosive package.
On one side of the collaboration we have composer Philip Glass, one of the pioneers of minimalist music, best known for his breakthrough piece Einstein on the Beach. On the other side we have Allen Ginsberg, a poet of the Beat Generation, best known for the 1956 poem “Howl Part II,” a critique of American post-war capitalist culture and sexual repression. A chance meeting between the two in a New York book store in 1988 led to “Hydrogen Jukebox,” an opera intended to form a portrait of America in the years between 1950 and 1980.
The opera has no narrative structure, but is more of a compilation of different pieces. The show starts off with low bass notes emulating ominous rumbles of thunder and flashes of light to mimic the blue lightning mentioned in the first song “Iron Horse,” a reflection on the Vietnam War and the state of war in America.
The School of Music’s production features a minimalist, industrial stage. There is a wall of ridged metal in the background, and a giant billboard in the foreground that displays the lyrics being sung. The billboard at times also shows visual annotations of some of the content in the lyrics, which is quite helpful in instances where the poems make period-specific references.
Different props are also introduced and taken off stage for each different piece. While most of the time these props are innocuous, sometimes they can be ridiculous. For instance, during “Iron Horse” a giant grenade floats down from ceiling in a not-so-subtle allusion to war. During a song about atomic warfare where one of the lines is “there were people starving and crawling…” a giant hamburger appears on the left side of the stage and a shirtless man slowly crawls on the ground towards it.
While Ginsberg is mostly known for his highly political, Beatnik-era critiques of American society, many poems featured in Hydrogen Jukebox also let us see more of Ginsberg’s more intimate and reflective sides. These pieces greatly help to break up some of the more politically heavy pieces, whose enjoyment may vary depending on someone’s political beliefs or how much knowledge they have of the time era.
“Consulting — Ching” is a contemplative song about the passing of time while slowly getting high on pot and drifting off to “the deserted city which lies below consciousness.” “Cabin in the Woods” is a haiku-like composition about watching the sun rise with a cup of tea while sitting on a tree stump in the mountains that Glass transforms into an ethereal aria. In “to P.O.” Ginsberg describes a hot summer night in Calcutta with his lover. The warm yellow lighting and the staging, a single bare yellow light bulb hanging above a rocking chair, seems to transport one into the hot hotel room where Ginsberg was staying. The music, tinged with the soft rattle of maracas and the ringing of Indian bells, has a mesmerizing, ritualistic feel. “From The Green Automobile” is an imagined road trip with an old friend; the musical composition is bright and free — woodwinds and electric tones resonate with the child-like excitement and wistful imagination of the poem. A projection of hand-drawn stars appears during the verse with “forestlike unnatural radiance illuminating the mountaintop.”
The highlight of the show, however, is “Wichita Vortex Sutra,” a poem that reconciles Ginsberg’s political and personal sides. The poem, first composed by Ginsberg on a tape recording made while traveling to Kansas on a bus, is a call for healing after the brutality of the Vietnam War. Glass’s warm yet minimal piano accompaniment flows fluidly alongside with Ginsberg’s poetry and subtly but powerfully emphasizes its emotional undertones. Junior Linguistics major Dante Horvath does an excellent, impassioned reading of the Ginsberg poem.
“Wichita Vortex Sutra,” which is performed spoken, does leaves one questioning why Glass decided to convert Ginsberg’s free verse poetry into, of all forms, opera. Much of the poetry’s original musicality in terms of the rhythm of the syllables in each verse is lost in the transition into operatic song. Verses are often stretched out or condensed at places where they normally would not be if spoken. A prime example of this is in “To Aunt Rose” where the verse “limping down the long hall in Newark on the running carpet” becomes “limmping down the long halllllllll – in Newwwwwark – on the ruuuuunning caaaaaarpet” when sung.
That is not to say all of the pieces don’t work with the format. Some poems, especially those with a more lyrical or hymn-like structure to begin with, work surprisingly well. For instance, “Howl Part II,” a condemnation of war and capitalism, features a screeching, howling sax line while harsh neon pink and red lights frame the singers. Altogether, it sounds like Satanic hymn. Similarily, the closing piece “Father Death Blues,” a poem about accepting death whose structure was also originally more lyrical, uses a wide range of voices to create a contemplative lullaby.
For those interested in the works of Glass or Ginsberg, “Hydrogen Jukebox” is a good introduction to both their styles and composition. Even for those uninterested in either artist, their collaboration on “Wichita Vortex Sutra” is an experience that must be heard; it is truly a merging of their work, a piece that brings together the best aspects of both artists..

2016-01-25,CMU,India,"The culture of Youtube beauty gurus has exploded and surpasses the viewership of many forms of traditional media. These gurus are generally entrepreneurial women in their twenties trying to get in on the oversaturated beauty genre of new media. As role models in a platform that allows for greater diversity, they ideally offer the potential for expanding the concept of beauty, but also the potential to reinforce negative values from the beauty industry in a space where the audience tends to be especially vulnerable. Leading content creators, despite their limited diversity, appear to be attempting to change the culture of fashion and beauty to be about having fun and as expressions of self confidence, rather than making them the source of self esteem.
The women who do stand out owe their fame in part to luck and good timing, but also because they were able to differentiate themselves through what they call “lifestyle vlogging.” What that means is that as much as the videos are about the quality of product reviews and tutorials, they build the fame of the beauty gurus around a cult of personality. Branding themselves as a friend or big sister who gives you beauty tips, relationship advice, and encouragement creates trust and loyalty within their fans. 
The success of this branding is evident in the amount of press these young women get. Ingrid Nilsen recently met with President Barack Obama to discuss issues important to her fan base; Zoella broke sale records with her new line of beauty products; Tanya Burr was on the cover of Glamour magazine; their meet and greets bring together young people from all over the world; and the list of high-profile achievements goes on and on.
Given the influence of the beauty gurus, a lot of people are beginning to question what kind of impact they have on young girls. The beauty industry is notoriously toxic for young girls, given that their marketing strategy involves establishing insecurity by displaying unattainable standards of beauty as the norm. Photoshopped bikini bodies and poreless skin create a false need for diet pills and makeup, conflating beauty with success, self worth, and likeability. The world basically tells young girls that you have to look like Karlie Kloss to be worthy of relationships and friends, and if you don’t look like her, then you’d better start investing in products to make yourself look conventionally attractive. And while our media and society also promote ridiculous standards of masculinity as well, in general they aren’t specifically targeted by the beauty industry in the same way. Part of the industry’s marketing is creating a rigid gender divide that expects women to be more concerned about fixing their appearance. 
Growing concern of the effect this has on young girls’ self images has led to a slew of studies on media and self-objectification — the tendency for women to view themselves based on what others would see and be attracted to — which generally conclude that these influences are strongly correlated with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. The problems with beauty, fashion, and diet industries are pretty well known and established, so the question that needs to be answered now is to what degree does the beauty guru culture subvert the more traditional culture of beauty.
Where YouTube and other forms of new media appear to have power is in their democratic approach to media. Anyone can publish anything that they want, as long as they use a Taylor Swift song. And this illusion that anyone can make it as a YouTube star is interesting because on one hand it does allow, in theory, for greater diversity in terms of representation, but it can also be an illusion. 
In reality, the vast majority of the biggest beauty gurus are young, thin, white, cisgender, heterosexual women. So when you watch lifestyle advice or “A Day in My Life” on YouTube, what you get is repetition of a lifestyle that is predicated on being conventionally pretty and wealthy enough to buy organic foods and mountains of lip gloss. It means that if a person of color goes online to watch a haul video (videos where people show and tell about their recent shopping purchases), chances are they’ll be watching someone expound on the trendiness of “tribal prints” and kimonos. Tribal prints, by the way, generally refer to fabric prints inspired from South American designs, African fabric, and Indian woodblock printed fabric. 
The fascination with the Bohemian and ignorance of other cultures is concerning, and at times genuinely confusing, but it is a reflection of the way that fashion in the Western world is being marketed. Similarly, the values presented in boyfriend advice videos and workout tutorials and “What I Eat in a Day” videos display the same cultural expectations of normal that old media presented, just in a more personalized, and insidious, way. In general, these videos tend to be well intentioned, but it is concerning that there is a message that these videos are about real people keeping it real. People think the lives and values portrayed in these videos are the norm, when they are often unattainable. 
On the other hand, in comparison to traditional media, there is actually some diversity in the representation of beauty, gender expression, and health. Michelle Phan is probably the queen of beauty gurus, but in the traditional fashion and beauty industry she may not have been able to have her career because of her race. 
Estée Lalonde and SprinkleofGlitter  (also known as Louise Pentland), for example, talk about their own struggles with body image while also showing their audiences that they love their body and feel good in it. Louise Pentland especially fills the need to talk about body image and beauty, as she has released a line of beautiful plus sized clothing and several fun, glamorous lookbooks to counter the perception that being plus sized should mean that you can’t be beautiful. SunKissAlba's channel talks about sustainability and organic products, but also describes a beauty regime that would be more specific to people of color. 
Kaushal Beauty makes makeup tutorials for both Indian and Western events, which is helpful because she uses colors that are more flattering on brown people.
Ingrid Nilsen is a huge lifestyle vlogger who not only is biracial, but also publicly came out last year. This was huge for a lot of people because it was a way for a lot of people to see that identifying as a lesbian while also being feminine, fashionable, not white, beautiful, and ultimately the same person is okay and even normal. You see this a lot with new media representation of LGBTQA+ individuals; often the most powerful way of breaking down stereotypes and building self acceptance in marginalized groups is showing people just living their life and being happy.
All of these YouTubers have huge audiences, and although it is generally not the case that people of marginalized groups have as large of a fan base, their ability to reach a lot of people with their identity is important. It is no less important that anyone can find small YouTubers who put out messages about diversity in self love and beauty that more or less align with their own identity — and that is something that is special about YouTube, vlogging, and specifically lifestyle videos.
Beyond increased representation, what distinguishes the beauty guru platform from traditional media is how personal the content is. To a lot of young girls, these women are like big sisters or best friends who they ask for advice on fashion, boys, cooking, confidence, and how to be healthy. Whether you look at the love that came in response to Zoella’s videos about her panic disorder and managing anxiety, Ingrid Nilsen’s videos about periods, or Tanya Burr’s daily vlogs, you see these women building a really strong relationship with their fans. 
This turns out to be a really good thing because it allows these women to give advice on topics that are generally taboo or ignored, but are really important for young women to talk about. But while their popularity is built in part on their charisma and caring, their channels are also built on a trust for the products they use and review. And that’s actually how most of the beauty gurus make money — companies pay to have their products in their video. The top three beauty guru’s make an average of $33,000 a month.
In a best case scenario, that means that these women will work out deals that will allow them to be paid to show only the products they actually want to recommend, and their audiences will be more loyal because of that. But the biggest issue people have with the beauty guru culture is the idea of these young fans who unquestioningly trust these women who are on some level making videos to advertise for a variety of brands. With that kind of adoration and influence, there is a possibility that they are teaching young girls consumerism and superficiality. 
These videos are a replacement for fashion magazines, and it’s questionable whether young women take away a different message. The increased representation does mean that there are certain messages —especially about what a woman’s body should look like — that become less popularized. But these videos are still supporting consumerism in an idyllic setting, with twinkly lights and floral bedspreads. 
A lifestyle vlogger, in theory, should also be talking about fiscal responsibility, sustainability, and what a relationship with material possession should look like as well as what a makeup routine and outfit should be. In the same way that a lot of white beauty bloggers disregard the roots of the clothing they wear and the cultural context of their outfits, a lot of these women are not considering the environmental impact or ethical responsibility of the clothing they buy. Considering that most drugstore brands test on animals, and many factories that make the hot new thing in fashion barely pay their employees, it is hard to separate the problems from the potential good these beauty bloggers can do. 
There is also the question of what this teaches people who may not feel conventionally attractive, but also don’t have the money to buy beauty products and new clothes. It does appear to tell people that you can be confident, and having all this stuff is a really easy way to feel good about yourself. Telling people to buy products — even if they are actually good — for the advertising dollars just seems like an oversight on the part of YouTubers of the culture that they are creating.
Hauls, for example, are a particularly controversial form of lifestyle vlog. In hauls, users go shopping and earn a few million views showing everyone what they bought for themselves. And when successful YouTubers get paid to do haul promotions or advertorials, it can come across as showing off or narcissistic or, at the very least, far removed from most people’s financial reality. Depending on the way a channel is branded, haul videos  can frankly appear shallow. It is important to not need to be validated by what you own and how you look, and that’s sometimes difficult because these things are tied in with likeability and social status.
What’s most important here is that we keep having conversations about how we view makeup and fashion’s role in society. In feminist circles, the question remains: can makeup and fashion be empowering? Is there something negative in cultivating a love for sparkly eyeshadows and flowy dresses? It is worth noting that the idea of cultivating a love for beauty products out of self love rather than insecurity is hugely important, and a wonderful side effect of beauty guru culture on YouTube. 
You’d be hard pressed to find a lifestyle vlogger that hasn’t talked about self confidence, body image, or how makeup is more decoration than substance. In most cases, these videos are actually about how women appropriate something that might be seen as oppressive as a way to express themselves and make themselves feel good, regardless of what that boy or anyone else thinks.
If young girls and women are modeling their lifestyles after what is presented in their videos, the hope is that they pick up these messages as well. The genre is new and open enough that people are talking about these things, about living with less and what life is outside of the framework of beauty.
If the last few years of YouTube culture have shown us anything, it’s that a smart, thoughtful content creator is more than the brands they work for or promote. It may not be obvious to a casual viewer or to someone who isn’t part of the beauty guru audience, but ultimately what sells is this relationship they have with their viewers who look up to them, but also hold them accountable. On the one hand, the toxicity of the beauty industry didn’t magically disappear because Zoella went on camera and went through her day without makeup. On the other, though, there is now this experience where girls process breakups by watching Kayley Melissa’s  tutorials and braiding each other’s hair, wind down from a long work day by watching pamper routines, or just feel a little more validated in their own expressions of beauty..

2016-02-01,CMU,India,"A leader on the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team, singles player Abhishek Alla, said that playing for the tennis team gives him an outlet for competition outside of the classroom. The civil and environmental engineering senior from Hyderabad, India has showcased dominant play over the last couple years, competing as the Tartan’s No. 1 singles player for the past two seasons and being named an All-American in singles both years.
When discussing his choice to participate in the team, he called attention to the break that tennis provides from a day full of academic activities. Alla embraces his participation in tennis for the sheer enjoyment of playing the game, alongside the competition. “I’m playing more seriously only because that’s a release from academics, and its more to fun to be on the court than to be somewhere else.”
In high school, Alla competed at a sports academy where all students were involved in athletics. Coming to Carnegie Mellon was a big change, but luckily he made the adjustment successfully. “I came in prepared for [school] to be harder, and then I guess it started off going well the first few weeks and then it just kept going that way.”
Entering school at Carnegie Mellon can definitely pose a challenge because of the amount of work for classes, and Alla noted that this creates an additional difficulty for athletes balancing time with sports. He points out that late in the season there is importance in “staying on top of all the academics so it doesn’t affect playing in the UAAs.” However, Alla also observed that the impact of sports can be a great positive force for the athletes in season. When in season, athletes learn to work efficiently for their classes, and use time outside of practice more effectively in order to operate under the added time pressure. Alla explained that since tennis teaches the players about “unconsciously finishing work” when they aren’t playing, there is a lot of free time. “I couldn’t see myself not playing.... Without tennis you have so much more free time.” 
This makes a good lesson for the younger athletes, since Alla said that the younger members of the team are still learning to manage the heavy academic load and find balance with other activities. Alla sees losing sleep as the big pitfall to an student athlete looking to succeed in school and in tennis. He advised that “if you’re spending too much time on a problem you should just go to the TA and ask for help or just email someone instead of staying up for 12 hours doing it on your own.”
Successfully adjusting to the academic workload will be key for the tennis team this season. With a strong first-year presence on the team that is sure to be large part of the winning formula. Alla explained that a strong first-year work ethic this season is helping the new players make up for the loss of three of last years seniors from the varsity team.
Alla views this weekend’s upcoming competition against Walsh University as a good test of how both he and the team stack up competitively against the competition. In the tournament, he expects strong competition from both friendly and rival tennis players, including a strong players from both school whom Alla believes are likely to take the top seed in the match.
In addition to being able to cope with added academic responsibility, Alla explained the significance of the coaching staff in allowing the tennis players from both the men’s and women’s teams to train efficiently through the season. The tennis coaching staff must deal with limited court openings throughout the day, organizing times for all athletes on both tennis teams to take advantage of the courts while they are closed to public use during the day.On the whole, Alla’s experience handling tennis along with a typical student workload helps him succeed both on and off the court..

2016-02-08,CMU,India,"Chinese food is one of those types of cuisine that tastes different in every country you go to. In India, where I live, it’s loaded with spices to excite the palette and full of vegetarian renditions of common Chinese fast food classics such as “Gobi Manchurian” (made with cauliflower), in lieu of chicken manchurian of course. In America, I’ve found that Chinese food takes the names of what I assume are historical figures (General Tso’s Chicken, anyone?) and is mellowed down to better suit the taste of the typical American customer. Because of this, when I eat Chinese food in Pittsburgh, I find myself scanning the menu for different versions of the generic dishes that I’ve indulged in countless times. It was this routine I had gotten into that pushed me into a state of uneasiness when looking at the menu at Everyday Noodles.
The restaurant sits on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill, walking distance from the Cold Stone and Rite Aid on the intersection of Murray and Forbes. Inside, the lights are bright and the tables are usually packed with vibrant, chatty customers of all age groups. I highly recommend — if possible — sitting at the bench seat, which is positioned right in front of the glass window that looks into the kitchen. Through the glass you can see the dumplings and noodles being prepared from scratch. The way the chefs kneed the dough and carefully pull it to craft the noodles and dumplings served hot to customers is mesmerizing. Of course, most of the seats in the restaurant have a view of the signature glass pane, to add to the authentic feel that the food carries with it, so if you can’t get the bench seat, don’t feel too discouraged.
The decor of the restaurant is simple and fits the atmosphere well. A cushioned bench lines one wall and has thin bamboo-like structures lining it from the top of the back-rest to the interface between the wall and the ceiling. There are tables scattered about, and the staff does a great job of making sure they can fit in as many people as possible. If you go on a particularly busy night, you might have to wait for a while before you get a seat, so do plan ahead if you happen to be in a rush.
I cannot count how many times I’ve been to this restaurant, but I can count the number of dishes I’ve had. I’m usually not one for repetition, but after finding my share of favorites at Everyday Noodles, I find myself craving the signature tastes that my mind has come to associate with the establishment. Here are some personal favorites:
Pork Soup Dumplings: This is one food item that I cannot visit Everyday Noodles without eating. Eight of these steaming hot, delicately crafted bundles of flavor come with every order, ready to eat. The dumplings look relatively simple on the outside, but on the inside contain a small piece of pork and soup for it to float around in. The dumplings are made fresh and are therefore very hot, so here’s a little trick my friend taught me to eat them if you can’t wait for them to cool down:
Step 1: The dumplings come with large soup spoons, and they do much more than catch any soup that might leak out of ruptured dumplings. The first thing you do here, is carefully lift one dumpling out of the steamer basket and place it on your spoon.
Step 2: Poke a tiny hole in the dumpling. You can do this either with a chopstick or if you trust yourself, by biting a small piece of the dumpling off. 
Step 3: Using your chopstick, press down on the dumpling from the top and let the soup seep into the spoon out of the dumpling to surround it. Now that it’s out of the inside, it’ll be able to cool down faster. Go ahead and sip.
Step 4: Now that the dumpling’s got a good amount of soup squeezed out of it, and a hole to cool off the insides, it should be ready to pop into your mouth after sitting for a little longer.
By the time you’ve eaten a few like this, the rest should have cooled down amply enough for you to eat them whole and let the soupy, doughy, meaty concoction explode in your mouth. It’s heavenly.
Minced Pork Rice Bowl: I’m a teriyaki addict, so I’m usually a little weary of savory rice bowls that air on the saltier side, but this dish is definitely an exception. It consists of what it promises: minced pork and rice, along with some vegetables and a boiled egg. What I enjoy so much about this bowl is the fact that it can be eaten deconstructed, or heavily mixed together and still taste phenomenal. Each of the individual elements is cooked and flavored very specifically, which results in great individual flavors as well as great integrated flavors. It’s filling, it’s warm and it’s a great dish to share with friends.
Egg Yolk Bun: At first glance, this doesn’t seem like a dessert item. The lovely, round, fluffy bun comes with an egg yolk filling that is sweetened up just enough not to be overwhelming. Again, this arrives hot, and is an unusual flavor, but is something that has so far agreed with the palettes of all whom I’ve taken out for a bite. It’s an easy dare for the blossoming food experimentalist.
Bok Choy in Vegetable Oyster Sauce: All meals require some sort of balance, and here I’ve found some rich greens in a tangy sauce to be perfect. The restaurant has a variety of greens to choose from, but the bok choy is by far my favorite. It’s leafy enough not to be overwhelming, and soft enough to munch on between mouthfuls of rice or noodles. The vegetables can also come with minced pork sauce, but I’ve found it helpful to have something vegetarian and neutral for the table, especially when with a group.
Jasmine Green Tea: I love tea with my food, whether at home or at a restaurant, and at this restaurant the green tea comes in the form of what looks like a sapling. The triangular prism bag is topped with a green wire with a small plastic leaf attached to it, that pokes out of the heartily sized tea cup, infusing tea steadily. Free hot water refills are available, and the intensity of the bag, if rationed out carefully, can last a good 2–3 cups. It’s light, and washes down the heavy food items effectively.
If you’re more of a noodle bowl lover and are inclined to see how the namesake dishes live up to your expectations, there are quite a few noodle bowls to choose from. The soup noodles bowls are quite large and very filling, while the dry noodles bowls are more realistic in terms of one-sitting consumption goals.
There are also some dishes on the menu that are unfamiliar to the typical Americanized Chinese menu, such as the House Oxtail Soup. I’ve only had the pleasure to taste a handful of these, and was particularly intrigued by the cool, refreshing, jellyfish salad.
The restaurant also happens to have a broad selection of delicious bubble tea, if that’s the way your taste buds want to go.
Heads up:
Cha-ching: The restaurant takes cards and cash and is great with splitting checks for large groups.
Veggie stuff: There are NOT a whole lot of vegetarian mains here, but those that are present have been tried and tested by friends of mine. For vegetarians I would highly recommend the vegetable dumplings, which are made with a similar level of finesse as the pork soup dumplings. I would argue, in fact, that the dumplings are what most sing praise for. Other vegetarian options are marked on the menu with an encircled “v,” and the waiters have been very helpful in the past with pointing out vegetarian options and vegetarian versions of some dishes.
Are we there yet?: All of the 61 buses will get you to Forbes and Murray from campus, where you can easily walk to your final destination. Taking an Uber is also not a bad option, although taking the bus to Squirrel Hill is definitely simpler than it is for other locations. Here’s a location to punch into your Uber app for the destination, or Google Maps if you’re in the area and headed over by foot: 5875 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh PA 15217
Click, click: The website for this restaurant has improved significantly since I first used it, and includes a menu, an about page, some pictures of the restaurant, and other features. Do check it out: http://www.everydaynoodles.net
For those stay-at-home days: This place has a great FREE home delivery service, with a $15 minimum for the order to be delivered, that lasts through restaurant kitchen operation hours. I’ve found ordering straight from the restaurant (as opposed to grubhub, for example) to be very effective, as they are careful to keep the food hot for when it arrives at your doorstep. This is especially great for the pork soup dumplings, which reach their optimal “eat-in-one-bite” temperature once they arrive. Here are their numbers: (412) 421-6668 and (412) 421-6669

21+: As far as I am aware, they do not serve alcohol, and do not have an established policy on bringing in one’s own alcohol.
Rash Alert: Gluten, nuts, dairy, soy, eggs, shellfish — there are a lot of common allergies that can be triggered here, so be sure to ask the waiter what is in your dish before you try it, especially if you are particularly sensitive to any of the ingredients I mentioned, or any other ingredients in typical Chinese cuisine.
Ambience: Lively, friendly, relaxed.
College student friendly?: Very much so. It’s a hot spot for families, college students, couples of all ages and — on occasion — some high schoolers looking for a quick bite before heading home. Given it’s location, it gets attention from a wide variety of audiences.
Overall rating: 4 melons.

2016-02-08,CMU,India,"Last Friday starting at 6:30 p.m., students from around campus met in the backyard of Stever House to celebrate Lohri. Native to the region of Punjab in India and Pakistan, Lohri is a festival with ancient roots.
Typically coinciding with the end of winter and the passing of the solstice, Lohri brings together members of the community for a night of lively festivities. Punjab, the only region that straddles India and Pakistan, is known as the “breadbasket” of India because of its fertile soil. Farming has been an integral part of life in the region for millennia, and the festival celebrates the beginning of the winter wheat harvest. Lohri is a cultural event celebrated by Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims, who share a common heritage despite the political and religious divisions prevalent today.
Geographically, Punjab sits at the northwestern corner of the Indian subcontinent and has borne the brunt of homeland invasions from the time of Alexander the Great. A popular legend associated with Lohri is that of Dulla Bhatti. This Punjabi version of Robin Hood lived in the middle ages, rescuing girls from being sold into slavery during times of turmoil. Many of the traditional Lohri songs commemorate Dulla Bhatti. Punjab is also the birthplace of the Sikh religion, which blends together philosophies of Hinduism and Islam. The region is very culturally diverse, and Punjabi food, dance, and people have come to represent the whole of India abroad.
In Punjab, Lohri festivities take on many different manifestations. In some parts, children go from house to house singing traditional songs. As a reward, they are given jaggery or solidified sugarcane extract. Bonfires are a significant part of Lohri celebrations and serve as the focal point for the activities once the sun begins to set. Bhangra, a traditional Punjabi folk dance, is usually performed around the fire during Lohri. Traditional snacks include fire-cooked corn and sesame seeds.
Carnegie Mellon’s version of Lohri featured performances by the school’s Bhangra team and Deewane, the South Asian a cappella group. True to tradition, the celebrations centered around a large bonfire, with people huddling close for warmth on the chilly evening. A table was decked with snacks and refreshments. Corn was cooked by the fire according to ancient tradition, while s’mores added a more modern flair. Many felt as though Friday’s celebration was an improvement over last year’s event, when there was snow on the ground, and the temperature was well below freezing.
In the weeks leading up to the event, a Facebook campaign called “Pics with Punjabis” was used as a lighthearted way to advertise the holiday, with people taking selfies with participating Punjabis. Contests were held for the most creative picture and the most pictures overall, with winners receiving Chipotle gift cards. The event overall was very successful, bringing together members of the Carnegie Mellon community in much the same way as Lohri celebrations in Punjab. People socialized, enjoyed the food and drink, and got to learn a little bit about Punjabi culture.
The event was organized by CMU OM, a multi-faith Indian cultural and spiritual organization, which is responsible for other popular events on campus, like Diwali Garba and Holi. .

2016-02-15,CMU,India,"Cultural appropriation is a very complicated topic, despite what many seem to think. There is no clear black and white distinction between right and wrong here — it is all a gray area. The gray is something that I think gets lost in a lot of the debates surrounding the issue. You cannot clearly define lines between what is correct and what is not when it comes to taking things from another culture. When is it appropriative, and when is it just exchange?
One of the most recent controversies about this issue was the new Coldplay and Beyoncé video: For some reason, Beyoncé got all of the flak for something that was mostly Coldplay’s doing.
The video for their new song, “Hymn for the Weekend,” is set in India, with all of the stereotypes of India and Indians that the Western world likes to place on us. Chris Martin and his band run through colored powder in a ready-made Holi festival, past Hindu gurus in their orange attire, and past children dressed up as Hindu gods. It features Beyoncé as a Bollywood heroine, singing on the big screen in front of throngs of Indian people, covered with more Western ideas of what Indian fashion and headwear look like. As soon as the video came out, hordes of people, both Indian and non-Indian, condemned Beyoncé for her culturally appropriative fashion choices, but there was much less of a backlash against the video itself.
The thing to consider, however, is that cultural appropriation is about power — it’s not just people wearing things from other cultures. Cultural appropriation is what happens when people are lionized and profiting from donning a part of another race’s culture, while members of the race or culture are ostracized and othered for doing the same things. This is especially evident in Iggy Azalea’s video ""Bounce"" and Selena Gomez’s ""Come and Get It."" There are also everyday examples of white girls wearing henna and bindis who get praised for being hip and trendy while Indian girls and woman wearing henna and bindi’s are not.
This power dynamic does not exist here — Beyoncé, as a black person, has no structural power over South Asians in America. She was invited to participate in the video, she made none of the artistic design choices, and had none of the power there either. The issue with this video is more Chris Martin and his band white-girling their way through India and upholding all of the tired, old stereotypes of my country, than it is Beyoncé in the vaguely Indian headgear and fashion.
South Asians are very frequently extremely anti-black as a culture as well, and this is incredibly evident in the way that I’ve seen the backlash against Beyoncé go so far beyond the backlash for the video in its entirety, which was much more harmful than Beyoncé’s attire.
The way that Chris Martin and Coldplay aestheticized hundreds of years of Indian culture and history is significantly more damaging to the way that South Asians are portrayed in the Western mind than Beyoncé participating in this video while wearing vaguely Indian attire. The only things that the Western world knows about India or its culture are fun colors, dark-skinned orphans, and caricatures of Hindu gods and goddesses, and this video does nothing to subvert that. In fact, it encouraged those ideas. The salt in the wound is that the song itself had absolutely nothing to do with India — there was absolutely no reason for this video to be set in that country or have any of the scenes of India that it did.
The controversy surrounding the cultural appropriation of this video is not taking into account the real issue of cultural appropriation, which is the question of who has the power in this situation. It’s not Beyoncé, and it’s not South Asians. It’s Coldplay. That’s the conversation we should be having, not discussing whether or not Beyoncé’s attire — that, again, she didn’t choose herself — was or wasn’t appropriative..

2016-02-15,CMU,India,"This past Tuesday, Feb. 9, people flocked from far and wide to New Orleans in search of plastic beads among other, more decadent indulgences to celebrate the beginning of the Lenten season. But did you know the first American Mardi Gras was celebrated in Mobile, Alabama?
No. Of course you didn’t. Alabama lives mostly in a Lynyrd Skynyrd song. In FX’s You’re the Worst, Lindsay even refers to Jimmy’s less than pleasant family as “Alabama English people.” In our cultural consciousness, Alabama is basically a stand in for gun-toting hicks.
It’s time for that to change.
The state of Alabama has been the centerpiece of many societies throughout its history. Mobile was the home of the first Mardi Gras because it was the capital of French Louisiana from 1702 to 1720 due to its strategic positioning as a saltwater port on the Gulf Coast. While Alabama has not always housed the capital of the societies it was part of, it has always stood out in the American south as a vital home to many social movements, becoming a capital to all of them in its own way.
Alabama was ceded from France to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, at which point Britain allowed Jewish people to enter the territory for the first time since it was colonized by France. Communities of Sephardic Jews were able to establish trading posts and the largest antebellum Jewish settlement in America was located in Mobile, Alabama. The most famous settler is Abraham Mordecai, who came in 1785. Mordecai believed the Native Americans were members of the lost tribe of Israel, so he felt a connection to them and preferred to negotiate on their terms rather than trying to forcibly expand Alabaman territory. During the Civil War, Jews largely migrated north — an order from General Ulysses S. Grant for all Jewish people to evacuate his military district was a large reason for the mass migration. However, that settlement in Mobile was one of the first instances of America’s Jewish community, one that continues to thrive.
Nearly one hundred years after the Civil War and only 61 years ago, Alabama became one of the most prominent battlegrounds in the Civil Rights Movement. These events are all well-known and incredibly important historical moments, but don’t seem to resonate when people talk about Alabama. Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger occurred in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955 along with the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote the Letter from Birmingham Jail in 1963 and led the Selma to Montgomery marches with James Bevel, Hosea Williams, and John Lewis.
Even before the Civil Rights Movement hit its peak, Alabama was home to large-scale racial activism. Julius Rosenwald’s schools, which were funded in part by donations from Andrew Carnegie, attempted to remedy the stark disparities between opportunities of black and white students in the early 1900s.
All of this is without even mentioning the Native American tribes who occupied the land before France and have reason to call the state home, even if their families have been separated from the land for generations.
Of course, Alabama has had its demons in the past. Montgomery was the first Confederate capital; racial terrorism ran rampant for much of the state’s history; former governor George Wallace campaigned for president based on expanding segregation as recently as 1968; and President Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act devastated Native American tribes living in the state. The centuries of violence and strife are important to a meaningful examination of the state’s history. This article is not a meaningful examination of anything, just a call to attention for a state that provided some of the most visible front lines for this nation’s deepest and most violent existential crises since the Civil War.
Given its past, it is frustrating that the history of the Yellowhammer State often gets condensed into being a breeding ground for stereotypes of bible-belt rednecks (Then again I said New Hampshire only had one demographic in this same issue, so I’m a hypocrite). The ties Mardi Gras has to Alabama offers an opportunity to examine the state with one of the most complicated legacies in a nation that is itself wrapped in a complicated legacy..

2016-02-22,CMU,India,"‘Twas Valentines’ Eve, and just off South Craig,
There was no food in the fridge, not even an egg,
Two ladies were pondering what they should have,
And with a quick search, they were off to Central Ave.
In the spirit of Parks and Rec’s beloved Leslie Knope, my roommate and I decided to have a great Galentine’s Day dinner together. The restaurant that caught my eye was an Ethiopian restaurant, entitled “Tana.” Immediately intrigued by the idea of trying of what the website promised to be “authentic cuisine” with “herbs and spices imported directly from Ethiopia,” I called and made a reservation for two.
Because it was well below freezing that night, we decided to take an Uber, and had little trouble finding the place. The restaurant is set up very simply. Tables with simple white tablecloths are positioned to line the plain white walls. There were some intriguing pieces of Ethiopian folk art put up, placed tastefully to cater to the minimalist feel of the establishment.
Ordering our meal was an interesting experience. Much to our surprise, we were told that we had the option of ordering two sides per dish, and the waiter suggested some vegetarian sides to go with our meaty mains. The distinct spices were very new to my South Asian palette. 
They were rich, loud, and well-complemented by the cooling sides. Like Indian food, Ethiopian food is meant to be eaten by hand, by using the carby component of the dish to make small pockets and scoop up the meat and vegetable components. Here’s a rundown of what we tried:
Denich Selata (Potato Salad): This was more mashed down than your typical potato salad, and was bursting with lively acidity from the vinegar and lime added to it. It refreshed the palate in between bites of the flavor-heavy mains, and was a great asset to the meal.
Kay Sir Selata (Beet Salad): I was very excited about this salad and very pleased with what arrived. It was cool, cleansing, and very well flavored. Simple, and delicious. Interestingly, the beets were crunchier than I expected, which added a some much needed texture to the otherwise very soft collection of food items.
Shiro Wat: This dish was an entree that was served to us in a smaller portion as a side. It consisted of roasted chickpeas that were ground up and seasoned. It too was simple, and balanced out the complexity of the other dishes.
Fossolia: The menu describes this as “green beans and carrots in Tana’s special tomato-based garlic and herb sauce.” The beans and carrots were cooked to a lovely softness, and the overall taste was sweet and garlicky all at once. My roommate loved this side the most out of all those we tried that night.
Doro Wat (Chicken): This dish had two sauce options: the Kay Wot (hot) in Berbere Sauce and Alicia Wot (mild) in Turmeric Sauce. We went for the hot sauce which turned out to be milder than expected. Nevertheless, the flavors were rich. 
There was quite a bit of salt in the dish, so if you’re not down with the sodium chloride scene, beware. The chicken arrives on the bone as a drumstick, and is covered in the dark sauce. It was a very unique taste experience.
Tana Tibs (Lamb): This dish was the hero of the night. The flavor of the lamb and the intensity of the Ethiopian spices came together harmoniously. The lamb, like the chicken, was cooked incredibly tenderly, and the flavor from the sauce had seeped into the meat, so no piece felt too dry or too bland. A must try.
Hot spiced tea: With my neverending quest to try all tea that I come across, seeing this on the menu made my heart sing. The tea seemed to be made from a mix of spices, of which clove was the most dominant. It complemented the food well, both because of its heat and its components. A sweeter tea would have broken the flow of flavor that all of the dishes contributed to. I would definitely order it again if given the chance.
Cha-ching: Tana takes both cash and card, and is good with splitting the check for groups.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores, lend me your ears: Ethiopian food has great, healthy, protein-rich options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
Are we there yet?: Tana is within walking distance from Target in East Liberty, and Market District on Centre Ave, so if you’re in the area, you won’t have to go too far. From campus, I would either take an Uber (given how cold it is outside), or if you’re willing to time your trip, the 71B from Fifth and Morewood, the 71C from Craig Street at Park Plaza, or the 75 from Ellsworth Ave at Morewood Ave. Here’s the address: 5929 Baum Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.
Click, click: Tana has a great website, with its menu, an about page, it’s location, catering information, and much more. Check it out: https://tanaethiopiancuisine.com/site/restaurants/tana-ethiopian-cuisine/
For those stay-at-home days: Tana has a takeout option, and you can order what you’d like online from their website. You do have to login and make an account to do this though. There is no home delivery option, unless, of course, you go through a third party delivery service.
Hours: 
Sun–Thu: 5–10 p.m.
Fri –  Sat: 11:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. – 11 p.m. for dinner
Here’s a number if you have any questions in regard to reservations, hours, the menu, etc: (412) 665-2770
21+: Tana offers a variety of Ethiopian beer and wine (not seen on the website), although their authentic Ethiopian coffee is much more famous.
Ambience: Relaxed, homely, very friendly. The waiters were very kind and happy to explain how to order the food, and gave great recommendations.
College student friendly?: I was surprised to see many college students, some who even looked like grad students. Most of the people seated in Tana came as fairly large groups, which was understandable after I realized how much food it took to fill me up. The portions are pretty big, so feel free to take the pack out for a feast.
Overall rating: 3.5 Melons.

2016-02-29,CMU,India,"At some point, you’ve probably used Google Maps to figure out how to get somewhere. If you went to menu and clicked “Satellite,” you were able to see physically what your surroundings look like, so you could look for key landmarks. In fact, the concept of satellite imaging was so popular that Google created a whole new application dedicated to it: Google Earth.
Google Earth emerged from Earth Viewer 3-D, a program created by Keyhole Corp., a digital mapping company based in Mountain View, California. Keyhole Corp. was also funded in part by the Central Intelligence Agency. According to a Google press release, Google acquired Keyhole Corp. back in 2004, and thereafter released Google Earth in 2005. 
The present application highlights 3-D images that allow the user to explore cities, buildings, bridges, monuments — you name it. Distant galaxies can be explored using Google Sky, a feature introduced in Google Earth 4.2 in August 2007, and the ocean can be explored using Google Ocean, a feature introduced in Google Earth 5.0 in February 2009. 
Google Earth images are so detailed that you can clearly see your house, objects in your yard, all pretty accurately. But how does Google Earth get all of these high-resolution graphics? The answer lies in satellite and aerial imaging. We’ll focus on satellite imaging here. 
Satellite imaging is a process that uses satellites to scan the Earth and gain information about it. Satellites use different sensors to collect electromagnetic radiation reflected from objects on the Earth — passive sensors collect radiation from the Sun reflected on the Earth, while active sensors send out radiation themselves and analyze it after it has been reflected off of the Earth. The difference in reflectivity allows us to identify objects using remote sensing. 
Water, for example, reflects little infrared or visible light, while vegetation absorbs visible light, but strongly reflects infrared light. 
Satellite images are the result of thousands of pixels that the satellite scanned into rows and columns. The satellite gathers these pixels into a computer file, and the area the file covers is called a scene. Scene sizes vary depending on the type and size of the sensor. 
Satellite imaging has many applications — personal, environmental, militaristic.  It can be used for weather predictions; it can also help map out enemy terrain. 
Google Earth gets their images from satellites like TeleAtlas and EarthSat, which compile photographs and maps into digital form for commercial use. Google Earth images differ from images collected by major satellites in many ways. 
With Google Earth images, the image is sharpest in the center and becomes increasingly blurry towards the edges. There is also no timestamp on Google Earth images, so although they are one to three years old, it is impossible to tell the exact time and date the images were taken, which is essential with images from major satellites. 
While compiling images is a major feature of Google Earth, the most challenging thing is transferring those images to your computer quickly and efficiently. One way Google Earth cuts down transfer time is by using your computer’s disk cache to store images for places you’ve already looked at so that when you look at them again, Google Earth doesn’t need to re-download the images. 
Google also has a patent called Universal Texture, which uses two methods for getting large amounts of information to your computer — mipmapping and clip stacking. 
Mipmaps are collections of bitmap images that create the illusion of depth by working within a texture in an inverted pyramid structure. These images stack onto one another in layers, with each layer having twice the resolution of the layer below it. Clip stacks are portions of giant mipmaps that are clipped to a specified maximum size, which speeds up the process since Google Earth relies on the fact that a user only wants to see a portion of the mipmap at a time. 
Since the data comes from different sources, it is provided at different resolutions, which is why your town may appear really crisp, while a town in, say, Mexico, is blurry. Google Earth has several countries including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom mapped out clearly to the street level, and there is a good amount of information on other regions like Western Europe, India, and Japan, but everything else is hit or miss. While you can zoom in to look at the Egyptian Pyramids in great detail, for example, you can’t see where the local grocery is. 
There is also controversy that it may provide unwanted information, whether in regard to personal privacy or national and international security. Google has blocked Google Earth in Iran and Sudan since 2007 due to U.S. government export restrictions, and Maroc Telecom, a major service provider in Morocco, has also blocked the application since 2006 for unknown reasons. Other countries such as India, South Korea, and Israel have expressed concern that Google Earth made highly classified locations visible to terrorist organizations, some of which have since been censored and pixelated by Google. 
Regardless of how you use it, the images were brought to you through the use of satellite imaging..

2016-02-29,CMU,India,"The hall was packed. Children were squirming with excitement, running up to the front of the auditorium to buy pre-signed editions of the newest book of the Timmy Failure series. In the audience was a mix of adults who had come with their children, and adults holding bags with a stack of their favorite Pearls Before Swine collections, ready to be signed later on. Those outside were scrambling for tickets, praying that they weren’t sold out. This was the bustling state of Carnegie Lecture Hall last Sunday, Feb. 21.
As the clock struck two, Stephanie Flom, the Executive Director of the Carnegie Library walked over to the podium, and hushed the hall to a lulled silence. With murmurs of excitement still resonating throughout the room, Flom began by speaking about the lecture series, the sponsors of the event, and finally about Stephan Pastis. “I’ve just spent the last few minutes backstage speaking to Stephan,” she chuckled, “and he’s a very funny guy.”
Pastis arrived at Carnegie Library’s Lecture Hall as the sixth installment of their children’s author lecture series. Pastis has been touring the world, talking about both his children’s book series, Timmy Failure, and his award-winning newspaper comic series Pearls Before Swine. Although he has been drawing from a very early age, Pastis was a lawyer for almost ten years, which he later explained was boring beyond comprehension. In 2003, he dropped it all to pursue his passion, and has been thriving ever since. He used the lecture as an opportunity to talk about how he got where he is today, the origins of his ideas, his thought processes, and what he believes good writing really is.
The highlight of the lecture was definitely the portion where Pastis described his writing technique. Aside from this lecture, I’ve also had the pleasure of sitting in on lectures given by Lois Lowry and Margaret Atwood. Both of these incredibly distinguished authors spoke about the roots of their ideas, how they wrote while building off of past experiences, and conducting thorough research. Pastis, in this sense, is a little unconventional. He spoke of a four-step thought process that he goes through, while brainstorming ideas for his comic strip.
“When you write for a newspaper, you have to make a lot of comic strips,” he sighed. “365, to be precise.” His technique consists of the following steps:
1. Listen to really loud music
2. Drink a lot of coffee
3. Draw all over the walls
4. Dance
“Listening to loud music distracts that part of your brain that wants to think logically,” Pastis said. “If you have to think too much about what you’re writing, it’s not going to be funny.” He complemented this explanation with some examples of strips that came out of it. He went on to say that working in this manner has made his work “unintentionally autobiographical.” He confessed that most of his ideas seemed very random to him when they first popped into his head, but when he’d go back to read some of his work, he’d see snippets of his life breathe through his work.
Pastis admitted, however, that not all of his ideas stem from this four-step plan. Rat, his cynical, and arguably most popular comic character, gets a lot of his thoughts and opinions from Pastis himself, and irritating encounters that he experiences on a day to day life. “I’d like people to know, that you if do something stupid near me, chances are that the whole world is going to know about it, because I will include it in a strip with Rat,” he joked, with the loudest laugh in response being from a squirming third grader in the front row.
Pastis continued his lecture with some interesting anecdotes about the controversies he’s been involved in and some legendary comic-artists that he has encountered. We learned that Pastis has been banned from entering Turkey after unintentionally insulting the revered first president of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. 
He also spoke of meeting the rarely seen, reclusive Bill Watterson (the creator of Calvin and Hobbes) and the legendary Charles M. Schulz, who not only created the Peanuts comics, but also was one of Pastis’ biggest inspirations. “I read in an article somewhere, that every Sunday morning he would go to this specific cafe and order an english muffin, so I decided to give it a shot and I went and sat there for hours.” Pastis joked that he must’ve looked very suspicious as he was the only one in the shop looking around nervously and not eating anything, but at long last, while taking a final scan of the room, there sat Schulz. 
Pastis, who was a lawyer at the time, worked up the nerves to speak to his idol and greeted him with what he believes to be the worst way to introduce yourself to someone: “Hello Mr. Schulz, my name is Stephan Pastis, and I’m a lawyer.” Pastis said Schulz’s eyes widened with terror until he explained his passion for comics and Schulz offered to look through his work and give him some advice. “It was so amazing, we sat for a couple of hours just skimming through my work. I was so lucky to have had it with me in the car. It was the best day of my life.”
After speaking for around 20 minutes, Pastis left the rest of the hour for questions, which he took from children and adults alike. He concluded his session by drawing some of his characters on large pieces of paper which were given away to very lucky fans, and then walked over to the children’s library for book signing.
What I’m usually disappointed with when attending the lectures at the Carnegie Library, is the book signing segment. The lines are typically ridiculously long, and the time with the author is fleeting and impersonal. Pastis, however, insisted on taking the time to speak to each of his fans, signing their books as personally as possible with quick sketches of their favorite characters and even offered to take pictures. 
Unfortunately, I had left all of my Pearls Before Swine collections back in India, but I did manage to pick up a record by the psychedelic folk band Pearls Before Swine from Caliban for Pastis to sign, much to his amusement. “I’ve seen this record online, and I’ve always wanted to hold it. I just want to draw all over it,” he laughed, and signed both the front and back of the vinyl cover. When I told Pastis I was from Bangalore, he excitedly informed me of his recent visit to India and how he’d love to go back and check out Bangalore in the near future. All in all, it was a great day.

2016-02-29,CMU,India,"On Saturday evening, students gathered in Rangos Auditorium to watch the annual Mayur Show. This year’s theme was “Meet the Kapoors,” and featured various dance and vocal performances. The show was arranged by Mayur, the South Asian Student Association. The “hosts” of the show were the imaginary Kapoor family and Simran Patel, portrayed as a stereotypical Indian family and their soon-to-be daughter-in-law.
Simran is completely ignorant of her Indian roots, having grown up in the United States. She falls in love with and gets engaged to Ranjeet Kapoor, who has recently moved to the U.S. from India. He wants Simran to appreciate his culture and he invites her to visit India to meet his parents. Ranjeet and Simran then and go on a journey through their home country, beginning in South India. The first was a performance was by CMU Payal. The traditional South Indian dance featured a skit depicting scenes from the Hindu holy scripture, Ramayana.
Some of the teams that participated were from outside Carnegie Mellon. Notable groups included Pitt Avaaz and Pitt Zisha, vocal performance and dance teams, respectively, run by South Asian students from the University of Pittsburgh. One of the highlights of the first half of the show was a solo called “Gaurav and his Ukuleke,” in which first-year engineering major Gaurav Balakrishnan expertly played his instrument while singing in both Hindi and English. A brief intermission was bookended by two fashion shows, one featuring Western styles and the other, Indian. All the while, the Kapoors were making light on the differences between Indian and American culture, coming on stage to introduce acts.
CMU Bhangra brought a flavor of North India to the show in the second half, as the Kapoors shared their Punjabi heritage with Simran. The loud, celebratory dance is native to the Punjab region, and one of the biggest dance activities on campus. Vocal performances by the Saans, Avaaz, and Deewane a capella groups blended American and Indian music. Singers started off with American pop songs and transitioned back and forth with traditional and contemporary Indian songs. After Simran performs in Sahara, Carnegie Mellon’s newest Indian dance team, the Kapoors conclude that she is suitable to marry their son. Simran learns the virtues of Indian culture, while at the same time preserving her American upbringing, a sentiment shared by many Indian-Americans who live in between two unique cultures. Ranjeet also takes in Simran’s culture by learning how to rap, (though not up to Simran’s standards). The couple lives happily ever after.
The performances were wrapped up by local Indian-American singer/songwriter Jai Matt. The crowd went wild when the singer pulled event-goers up on stage to dance. Next, the long-awaited meal was an opportunity for the audience to interact with the performers. The food was catered by various Pittsburgh-area South Asian restaurants — Silk Elephant, Tamarind, and Ali Baba.
Mayur, in particular, celebrates all South Asian cultures, across all religious and linguistic bounds. It is responsible for events like the Diwali-Eid Gala, which celebrates both Hindu and Islamic holidays. As the largest South Asian organization on campus, one of Mayur’s goals is to promote interest in South Asian culture by reaching out to “students of other nations and cultures.” This theme was evident not only in the diversity of the audience, but by that of the performers as well.
All of the proceeds of this year’s Mayur show will be donated to relief efforts for the Chennai Floods. Chennai and other parts of South India were inundated after record rainfall in November and December last year. The floods killed at least 500 people, and inflicted severe damage on the region’s infrastructure. Recovery is an ongoing process.
Overall, the event was successful in bringing together a diverse audience and exposing them to different South Asian performances both on and off campus. Following the main show was an after-party at the Loft in Shadyside, with more performances by Jai Matt.
Students of Indian background make up a large percentage of both the undergraduate and graduate population here at Carnegie Mellon. Many clubs, including Mayur, are dedicated to celebrating Indian culture and, for many Indian Americans, they are a good way to stay attuned to their heritage..

2016-03-21,CMU,India,"This Wednesday, March 16, Carnegie Mellon’s Student Senate hosted the second part of the three part First Lectures Series. Each part features two current seniors who give a roughly half hour speech to current students on the lessons they have learned over the four years they have spent at Carnegie Mellon University. The First Lectures Series is based on Randy Pausch’s lecture and the book he later published titled “The Last Lecture,” which much of the student body became familiarized with before starting their time here. Mirroring how Pausch imparted his final words of wisdom to the Carnegie Mellon community before his passing in 2008, these groups of seniors hope to impart their own wisdom and reflect on their experiences here at Carnegie Mellon in order to have a lasting effect on current students before they venture off onto their distinct life paths.
Students of all grade levels, majors, and interests gathered in Porter Hall 100 to hear student speakers Rubini Naidu, a psychology major and photography minor, and Nitsan Shai, an electrical and computer engineering major with minors in computers science and music, give their first lectures.
Rubini Naidu’s Story
Naidu began her lecture by reflecting on her familial Indian roots. Although she was born and raised in Michigan, Naidu was very much influenced by the values instilled in her by her family. She talked about the high value that education had in her household. This began with her grandfather’s decision for his son (her dad) to receive an education rather than helping the family put food on the table. “Hearing something like that from my father has instilled in me gratitude for the opportunity of education,” Naidu said, also mentioning that Carnegie Mellon is a rare opportunity that we should take full advantage of.
Honing in on her knowledge of psychology, Naidu began to explain the concept of multiple intelligences to the audience. This idea theorizes that rather than ranking one person as more intelligent than another based on one type of assessment, we actually have nine different types of intelligences. This proposes that while we are all intelligent, how this intelligence is measured depends on the individual. Naidu invited audience members to think about which of the nine intelligence factors they believe they fall into.
Naidu said she feels that based on her interest in psychology and the passion she has for working with people, she falls in line with interpersonal intelligence — the ability to sense people’s feelings and motives — and intrapersonal intelligence — the ability to understand one’s self and one’s wants and needs. It is then no surprise that she sought to become an academic coach for academic development. Through this job, she has been able to put her skills in action by helping those struggling with school work or simply in need of extra help.
Naidu has been able to spend her time at Carnegie Mellon doing what she loves and working to build a future career from it. She even cites the incredulity of her minoring in photography. During her lecture she shared beautiful photos of the sights she saw during a trip to India, ranging from large buildings to flowers. The pride she had in her work was made evident by her expression.
She also told a story that was told to her on one of these trips to India by the mother of a then six-year-old daughter. The woman was struggling with money problems and was unable to sustain music lessons for her daughter. This taught Naidu that while we are concerned with our classes and making certain grades, there are many people around the world that are struggling with the simplest of life’s troubles such as health and money. Naidu states “we not only have the opportunity for an education, but we have the opportunity to be able to make a living doing something we’re passionate about, and that is so rare.” We should not fail to be grateful for the opportunities we have as Carnegie Mellon students, and even as Naidu is about to say farewell to this university, she hopes that current students will be able to move forward with the rest of their academic journey keeping this message in mind.
Nitsan Shai’s Story
Shai chose to focus his lecture on “The Importance of Smiling” even during life’s toughest moments. Shai stated, in response to the notion that he is always smiling, “I don’t particularly notice that I smile a lot … I think what makes me happy is making other people happy.”
Shai portrayed himself as someone that is generally happy and always takes the initiative to become involved in his many passions. Though majoring in electrical and computer engineering, Shai also has a love of the arts, which is evident from his roles in Scotch ‘n’ Soda and Carnegie Mellon’s The Originals a cappella group. Shai is also the student supervisor for academic development.
When asked about how he is able to take part in all these activities, Shai stated “often times, I don’t,” noting that this is a weird answer. While it is important to be aware of your passions and seek this out, it is also important to be able to balance it all. If he is unable to participate in something, he makes sure that someone has got him covered.
Looking at Shai’s history, however, and the hardships he and those around him had to endure, further highlights his amazing ability to see the positive in life. Shai is Jewish and was born and raised in Israel for the first five years of his life. His grandfather and his family, then living in Austria, were sent to different concentration camps. His grandfather and his sister “didn’t meet for another 20 to 30 years afterwards,” Shai said.
Shai stated that the reason his grandfather survived in those conditions was because his uncle took care of him when he got sick after escaping. Shai believes that his family history shows that “helping others, whether they’re your family or just in your nearby community and caring for other people is really the reason I’m here. I wouldn’t be alive if that wasn’t the case.”
Although his family faced many struggles as evidenced by their history, Shai himself was also affected by hardships during his time at Gunn High School, known for “The Silicon Valley Suicides” as titled in The Atlantic magazine. 
In response to this, Shai stated “I’ve been dealing with stress culture issues since my freshman year.” What kept him motivated through this period of time was the activities he partook in during his free time. He participated in musicals, tutored kids, programmed projects he thought were interesting — basically anything that he found interesting that made him happy. “Through doing the things I loved, I continued to smile.”
Shai noted that one of the distinct differences between his high school and Carnegie Mellon is the resources available here. Though Shai thought he was headed for a fresh start once enrolled at Carnegie Mellon, during his first year here there was a campus suicide. Shai questioned “Did I go to the right place? Is this problem following me?”
One of the main things that Shai wanted audience members to take away from his lecture was the amazing resources that Carnegie Mellon has to offer. This is what kept him moving forward during his time here and assured him that he had indeed made the right decision. He wants students to know that we should not be afraid to ask for help when needed, whether that be during our time here at Carnegie Mellon or after our lives here at the university.
The final lecture will take place on April 13 at 4:30 p.m. with electrical and computer engineering and human-computer interaction double major Erik Pintar, and electrical and computer engineering major Wole Idowu. These lectures will take place in Porter Hall 100..

2016-03-21,CMU,India,"As graduate student leaders, we want to break the silence about what is going on outside of our school. In particular, we want to address all communities of color at Carnegie Mellon, Muslim students, international students, and the LGBTQ community:
The violence at Trump rallies, which recently occured in Illinois, Florida, and neighboring Ohio highlight the extremist views of a very small minority of this country. It is, however, a violent part of America that has just been given a clear national mainstream platform. A lot of us find it difficult to believe that it is happening in our country, and feel overwhelmed by it.
Some of you may need to hear this, so we want to take a moment away from work to say:
No matter who you are, where you come from, or who you pray to, your lives and your voices are valuable in this country.
At Carnegie Mellon, we see and value the diversity that each and every one of you bring to the table day in and day out. Our school and our community are better places because you are here, adding your voice to the discussion and life we see every day. Please remember this as you use your voice and your intelligence to stand up against those who would you treat you as scapegoats. Please support each other in and out of the lab. Remind yourselves of your value.
We would like to also say do not dismiss what is happening regardless of your race and ethnicity. Get involved.
Speak out as loudly and as clearly as you are able to. Even Pittsburgh, despite what it might feel like at times and despite what your windowless office might seem like, is very much part of this.
With love and solidarity,

2016-03-21,CMU,India,"One of the most common advertisements on Indian television is for a fairness cream, very creatively called Fair and Lovely, that supposedly lightens one’s skin color by two shades. Since 1975, these advertisements have featured a young girl with the lack of something, be it confidence, a job, or a husband. Then, a female figure helps this poor, poor girl by handing her the tube of Fair and Lovely, and after using it she becomes radiant, gorgeous, and the object of everyone else’s envy after all her dreams come true. 
Gender-swapped and introduced after 2005, new advertisements aimed towards the male population introduced Fair and Handsome — the fairness cream for men. In India, this obsession with fairness starts as early as childhood. It is a common practice for children to be scrubbed with turmeric paste, milk, and honey to lighten their skin color. In a culture where arranged marriages are the norm, being fair is often used as selling point for a prospective bride or groom. Throughout one’s life, the idea of being fair is tied to beauty.
Not only is this an unreasonable beauty standard, but it also promotes a kind of societal segregation on the basis of skin color, often called colorism. Darker women end up perceiving themselves as inadequate, not beautiful, and incapable. A society that perpetuates colorism often withholds opportunities from women of darker skin, with Indian cinema being the greatest testament to the bias that “fair is beautiful.” This attitude is as harmful as body shaming. No one should have to deal with such an unreasonable point of view.
In response to this illogical demand of society to be fair skinned, Pax Jones along with sisters Mirusha and Yanusha Yogarajah, all students from University of Texas, have launched a campaign on social media called #unfairandlovely, which brings to light this stigma. By allowing all women to publicly accept themselves by posting selfies with the hashtag, such forms of social change are rapidly gaining popularity among Indian youth. While this movement is a step forward towards rationality, inclusion, and feminism, I still think that it should be more inclusive of men and people in the non-binary gender spectrum. Although I will also say that women face greater pressure to adhere to beauty standards than men. It’s high time all people of color “celebrated the melanin” in their skin.
While colorism is definitely an issue, it is also interesting to question how such beauty standards came into place in India. One might say that, with its history of colonization by the British, having whiter skin came to be associated with beauty. It also could be due to the fact that staying indoors came to be associated with wealth and a higher class status.
However, Hindu mythology often speaks of dark-skinned gods, goddesses and royalty, venerating such figures, and speaking of the beauty of their dark skin. While this is not representative of all of India, it does represent a portion of it, where colorism is dominant. Were these stories created at the time to fight against colorism or did somehow, with the passage of time, the perception of dark skin shift?
It’s not just India that needs to face the injustice of its beauty standards, but also the rest of the world. Beauty standards are a threat to diversity and self-expression. It doesn’t matter if a person has dark skin, a curvy body, or curly hair. It is unhealthy for a society to push its people to model one frame of beauty. Now, this may be obvious, but people have a right to their own body and they have a right to not be judged for it. If you’ve read Scott Westerfeld’s book, Uglies, you will see the world where everyone has the same beauty standards as nothing short of a dystopia..

2016-03-28,CMU,India,"Gateway to India, hosted by CMU OM, was held in Cohon Center Wean Commons on Friday evening. The event showcased the diversity of the different states that comprise India. Ten states (out of twenty-nine) were represented from the culturally distinct northern and southern regions of the country. The modern nation of India did not exist until 1947. For most of its history, the subcontinent was divided into several polities based on religion, culture, ethnicity, and language. Even current political boundaries do not account for the vast heterogeneity present in each and every state. Common themes at the event across the displays included famous Bollywood celebrities from the state, major cities, geography, and examples of writing and customs. Overall, the event was very successful, with a lively atmosphere, bright colors, and scents reminiscent of the typical bustling street in India. .

2016-03-28,CMU,India,"A CMU sophomore wins a Critical Language Scholarship to study Punjabi in India this summer, and Professor Manuela Veloso is appointed as the new head of the Machine Learning Department.
CMU sophomore Ian Asenjo wins Critical Language Scholarship from State Dept.
This week, Ian Asenjo, a sophomore global studies major with an additional major in ethics, history, and public policy, was awarded the Critical Language Scholarship from the U.S. State Department, which will give him the opportunity to spend his summer in Chandigarh, India studying Punjabi.
This cultural and linguistic immersion program is intended to encourage students to study languages that are drastically different from English. Many American language learners do not choose to master these languages due to the drastic differences, and we do not have enough native speakers. With supply low, demand is high for speakers of these critical languages, such as Arabic, Swahili, Urdu, Turkish, and Punjabi.
Asenjo discovered his passion for this region of India and this language through his involvement with the Carnegie Mellon Bhangra team and through Associate Professor of History Nico Slate’s course “India through Film.” At this point in time, Asenjo’s only exposure to Punjabi has been through weekly attendance at a Sikh temple in Monroeville. His choice of Punjabi comes from an appreciation of the culture surrounding it, which he has only experienced secondhand to this point. He looks forward to learning the language and absorbing the traditions for himself this summer.
Professor Manuela Veloso appointed as head of Machine Learning Department
Dean of the School of Computer Science Andrew Moore announced on Wednesday March 23 that Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Computer Science Manuela Veloso would become the new head of the the Machine Learning Department. Stepping down from the position is E. Fredkin University Professor Tom Mitchell, who was the department’s founding head.
Veloso has been a member of the Carnegie Mellon community since she earned her Ph.D. in computer science here in 1992. Since then she has led the Carnegie Mellon robot soccer team to five world championships in its league and has also developed the Cobot service robots. Her research has challenged her to continually improve robots’ ability to independently plan and execute tasks, and learn and cooperate with a team under challenging circumstances.
She co-founded the International RoboCup Federation and until 2014, Veloso was the president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Also in 2014, she was given the distinction of University Professor, the highest honor the university can give its faculty. She has also long advocated for women in computer science. Last fall in Houston, Texas she presented the keynote address at the annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.
Dean Moore expressed his utmost confidence in Veloso for the position in a press release on Wednesday: “Her knowledge of all aspects of AI and her dedication make her the perfect person to lead MLD now that machine learning has emerged as a major component of the world’s economy.”.

2016-04-04,CMU,India,"By night one way, by day another.
Pittsburgh is one of those cities that’s evolving from what it was in its heyday. The steel mills and iconic musty air are transforming into a modern urban hub, with a mix of an old-time and rustic-chic aesthetic.
The issue that seems to exist at the moment is that this city seems to fall asleep a little too early for the average college student to appreciate. It’s often looked down at because it’s compared to cities like New York, Boston, and Chicago, when in reality, we’re a whole different type of East Coast city. But I would almost say that it is the sleepiness that currently lingers about our city that makes it accessible, and beautiful.
Our weather is unpredictable, our neighbourhoods are eclectic and distinct, and in and around Oakland we’ve got a lovely college-town atmosphere that has settled in. On a lovely sunny day we bask in the sun on picnic blankets, sipping bubble tea and scarfing down waffles and hotdogs down in Schenley. In the rain we huddle around warm bowls of ramen in establishments up and down Murray and Forbes. In the winter we keep warm with warm drinks both from the likes of big names like Starbucks and local cafes and in the spring we warily continue drinking the same beverages lest the winter snow decides to make a comeback. At night, we often find ourselves confined to our rooms finishing up assignments, or catching up on movies and tv alone or with friends. We order in pizza, wings, Indian food, and all sorts of guilty pleasures and take solace in the meaningful late night conversations we have with those wandering around dorms late at night. 
While some of the most memorable moments of my life at Carnegie Mellon have been created through such experiences, I’ve been lucky enough to be pushed out of my comfort zone this past semester by writing for this paper. I took writing about food to be a fun, easy task, until I realized that I only had so many restaurants that I knew well enough to casually sit in on and experience. Now, I actively seek out new dining opportunities, and consequently have been able to have a taste — not just of the food — but of the raw and transforming culture that Pittsburgh has to offer. So, when our very own Pillbox editor offered to accompany me for a night on the town photo session and dining extravaganza, there was no way I could have refused.
21:00
Our night began at Station Square, which is built around the late 19th century Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE). When we told our Uber driver where we were going, he immediately asked us “which bar?”, and appropriately so. The area is now known for its many restaurants and bars, as well as its quirky mom-and-pop shops housed inside of the Freight House, which sell everything from toys to cigars.
The Freight House’s facade is something right out of what I would imagine a classic entrance for a circus to look like. Bright lights and tastefully painted bold letters that accompany a sign that proclaims the old train shed’s lifespan. “1897-1979” made this building hard to resist entering. Because we arrived a little later than anticipated, most of the stores were closed and in the unexpected emptiness, we were free to explore the charming corridors that lead us around the structure. The closed shops gave off a heavily nostalgic air of the past, which was further brought to life with a small arcade nestled off in a corner of the House. Gum ball machines and brick walls, jewellery stores and buzzing incandescent bulbs came together to yield a surreal sense of the past colliding with the present. 
21:45
With my camera filling up every extra second we spent in the Freight House, we began a short, but scenic stroll over to the Monongahela Incline at Mount Washington. I would like to note here, that admission to both the Monongahela Incline and the Duquesne Incline are free with your Carnegie Mellon ID and both lines run until 12:30 a.m. It’s a great place for some good conversation and contemplation, and once you reach the top you’ll get one of the best views in Pittsburgh.
It was from this dramatic height, perched on a concrete platform that I looked out at the yellow-lit Steel City and the clustered buildings and majestic rivers that make it up. The waters of the Monongahela river reflected the lights from the towering buildings with a long, distorted rendering, and sparkled under the illuminations from the Smithfield St. Bridge. 
We were joined by some visiting families who eagerly looked out over the city and breathed heavy sighs of satisfaction. The view stretches quite far, and includes the Carnegie Science Center, Point State Park, Heinz Field, Station Square, and much more. To the left was the hauntingly radiant St. Mary of the Mount Church, brightly lit up with an intense yellow glow. An adjacent large American flag waved in the wind, contributing the echoes of history that had been following us over the past hour as we encountered structure after structure that have been a part of Pittsburgh just a little longer than our own university has.
22:10
We would have stayed at the incline longer, but the restaurant we were planning to visit closed at 11 p.m., and we were getting hungry. Mount Washington boasts a pretty wide variety of restaurants, most within walking distance of each other, as well as some ice cream parlors and candy shops that are open during the day time. By night, the area changes from a more family friendly scene to one of laid-back nightlife, with restaurants and bars welcoming both their regulars and curious visitors.
Shiloh Grill is just a couple minutes’ walk from the top of the Monongahela Incline, and from a good distance looks like an over-decorated wooden deck. Rest assured, the restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating, the latter of which is an ode to the aforementioned rustic-chic atmosphere that I’m beginning to pin on Pittsburgh. 
From the fiery sign to the simple, yet comfortable deck furniture that occupied to outdoor seating portion, Shiloh Grill really was something else. The railings of the deck were lining with more incandescent light bulbs and the waiters were lively and more than happy to help me with my indecisiveness. 
All-in-all, it was a fun night, and it has given me the urge to go back and see what other interesting places there are nearby. 
Pittsburgh is blossoming everywhere, and I urge you to get out there and take it by storm. Our campus is lovely, but at times it can be a little self-contained, and taking a step out is a breath of fresh air that I’ve found to be both fulfilling and refreshing. 
Now, in the spirit of my regular column, here’s a quick rundown of what we tried over at The Shiloh Grill:
Spa day: By the waiter’s recommendation, I ordered this mocktail to mellow out the intense flavors of the food to come. Flavored with lemon and cucumber, this drink was delightfully light and incredibly refreshing. I appreciated that it wasn’t as sweet as your run of the mill virgin mojito, but still had a cool quality, brought in more by cucumber slices than mint leaves.
Macaronis Et Fromage De Langoustine: LOBSTER MACARONI AND CHEESE!? Yes, and it was as glorious as it sounds. The cheese was gooey and rich, the macaroni was cooked just right, and an absolutely stunning crunchy baked crust topped the dish. The lobster flavor was also a perfect complement to the sharpness of the cheese. It was wholesome and hearty, and had me reaching back for more long after I was full.
Cookies-N-Cream: A skillet-baked cookie topped with whipped and ice cream. It was warm and cold, soft and chewy all at once. Truly a great conclusion to the evening.
Cha-ching: Cards and cash are both welcome.
Meat, glorious meat: A pretty good spread of options, although the food airs more on the meaty side.
Are we there yet?: Right across the street from the Upper Monongahela Incline Station. I’d recommend taking an Uber.

21+: The place is very famous for their quirky and innovative cocktails. They’ve also got a pretty solid wine and beer collection.
Ambience: Like I said before, rustic chic. This is a great place for dinner, and the atmosphere is incredibly, for lack of a better word, chill. The waiters were very friendly, the food was delicious, and the weather was nice (although I can’t promise that for any given night). 
College student friendly?: I didn’t see a lot of other college students around, but they’re definitely used to a young crowd and I didn’t feel out of place in any respect.

2016-04-04,CMU,India,"This Wednesday, March 30, the Carnegie Mellon community was shaken by the news that two students, Elliott Glasgow and Rajat Patra, had passed away.
19-year-old   Elliott  Glasgow was a first-year undergraduate student in the College of Engineering and a New York City native. Rajat Patra was a 25-year-old student in the Heinz College Master of Information Systems Management Program from Bangalore, India.
Students noted a tangible change in the atmosphere of the campus in response to this heartbreaking and unexpected news. Many teachers cancelled classes the following day or postponed class activities in order to allow students to talk through their emotions. Students also took to social media to express the loss they felt or to express how this news impacted them strongly, even if they did not know either student personally.
In response to the passing of these two men, the horizontal bars of the fence were painted red with the integration of a lone heart. The vertical stands displayed lines in the colors of Tartan plaid to signify the integral roles Glasgow and Patra played as part of the Carnegie Mellon community.
In an email to the Carnegie Mellon community, University President Subra Suresh, Provost Farnam Jahanian, and Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno said that Glasgow “was a vital member of his residential community and a brother of Phi Delta Theta, known by his many friends for his wit and sense of humor,” and Patra was “a passionate student who had earned a prestigious internship for the summer and was planning to create his own IT consultancy after graduation. He was also an avid guitar player and proud member of the Heinz community.”
On Friday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., students, faculty, staff, and passing visitors who shared in our sorrow gathered together at the fence to reflect on the lives of Glasgow and Patra and on how this news affected us as individuals and a community.
“Their passing was an enormous loss for their families, for their friends, for their classmates and professors, and for all of the Carnegie Mellon community and beyond. Along with all of you I feel this loss very deeply,” stated President Suresh on Friday. He went on to acknowledge the strength and compassion that the Carnegie Mellon community has shown throughout this time.
Casalegno spoke to the demonstration of care and support she has witnessed from members of the Carnegie Mellon community: “I have been with some of you and with the families and students, faculty, and staff who are mourning this loss deeply. I have seen this support manifest itself in many ways.” One example that Casalegno noted was the “simple but profound expression of compassion” of painting  The Fence Thursday night.
Casalegno encouraged students to seek their own method of coping, including talking to counselors, turning to religion, exercising, taking long walks, or simply finding a quiet reflective space. She also emphasized the importance of seeking out people to lean on during this time, as well as the importance of being available for others.
“One of the hallmarks of Carnegie Mellon University is that we are passionate about our work … but that passion does not have to mean that we work at the expense of our own well-being,” Casalegno said. She stressed that we must look out for ourselves when we are struggling in order to slow down and reflect on our lives.
Provost Farnam Jahanian provides the same message as Casalegno on the importance of looking out for ourselves in an email sent to the Carnegie Mellon community the day prior. He states “We are all passionate about our work and our studies, and sometimes that passion pushes us onward, even when we need a break, or encounter unexpected challenges in our lives. We encourage you to stop and take some time for yourself, and to turn to faculty, staff, and one another when you need support. You are not alone.”
After the gathering, members of the community lingered on The Cut to be together, to share in an embrace with friends and strangers alike, and simply to be there for one another during this emotional time. 
One student at the event, who chose to remain anonymous, states “let’s stay together and make each other strong ... I love this campus. I hope I can let it know somehow.” 
Another student added  “when going through a painful situation, one may feel like a burden ... so please, if you can, reach out!” The student further added “The few seconds it takes to say ‘what’s up’ or ‘how are you doing’ or ‘let’s hang out’ could mean the world to them...Please everyone, take care of yourselves. I love all of you!”
Though this news has sparked thoughtful conversations from members of the community, we should not forget the lives that Elliott Glasgow and Rajat Patra led prior to their passing..

2016-04-11,CMU,India,"On Wednesday March 6, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held a campaign rally in Skibo Gymnasium. The space was filled to full capacity, holding over 1,500 people in the gym with many others left outside in a line stretching well around the block. Clinton addressed the large crowd that was stuck outside before giving her speech. Meanwhile, inside Skibo, a selection of songs, including Kelly Clarkson’s “I’m a Survivor,” played in the background for the waiting crowd.
The event started with Julia Eddy, Chair of the Carnegie Mellon Graduate Senate. Eddy spoke about Carnegie Mellon’s potential for excellence, which she highlighted by asking students to help find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease by 2025. She additionally spoke about the success of the democratic process based on the turnout of so many students at the rally.
There were several other highlights from Carnegie Mellon students, including performances by senior drama major Avery Smith who sang the national anthem and the a cappella group Soundbytes which performed two pieces. Two campaign organizers, a second generation immigrant and a woman, made brief comments about their support for Clinton before Clinton herself took the stage.
Cheers of “I’m with her!” filled the gymnasium as Clinton made her way to the stage with the mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto. Peduto gave several remarks praising Clinton, saying that “others talk of building walls, but Pittsburgh is a city of bridges.” He stated that many progressive mayors like him around the country are endorsing Clinton as a unifying candidate to create an “America for all.”
Clinton began her speech by talking about Pittsburgh as a “great American city,” praising its ability to adapt into the future, and stating that one can have “resilience if you are resourceful.” She also subtly criticized Republican front-runner Donald Trump saying that “diversity is an asset” and, referring to his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border, stated that she wants to “knock down every barrier preventing [all American citizens] from achieving their God-given potential.”
She organized a large portion of her speech around three tests a president should be ready to face, tests that she claimed prove her to be a progressive who has and will continue to make progress. These tests were “Who have you helped?”, “Have you kept us safe?”, and “Can you unify us?”
For her first test, she discussed her plans to help the working class, including creating a national infrastructure bank to fix our infrastructure. Additionally, she called for $10 billion to invest in research for new technologies to begin exporting from the United States. She took the opportunity to share how the Carnegie Mellon Robotics team is a leading example of how America can bring its manufacturing industry into the new century.
Clinton went on to discuss her plans to combat climate change, such as bringing half a billion more solar panels into the United States by 2020, and by overseeing a North American climate agreement. “I actually listen to the scientists,” she said, adding that Carnegie Mellon could help teach Republican climate change deniers. Discussing her experience as a fighter for climate agreements in the past, she relayed an anecdote about her and President Obama’s mission to “stalk the Chinese and the Indians” at the 2009 Climate Conference in Copenhagen. According to Clinton, she and Obama successfully snuck past bodyguards and joined the “secret” meeting of the Chinese and Indian officials who had been avoiding them. Clinton also hailed the results of the most recent Paris Climate Conference in 2015. Although some have criticized the conference as not taking enough action, Clinton said “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Clinton then spoke about her economic platform, proclaiming her support for a livable minimum wage, equal pay for women, and small businesses of the type that often begin at Carnegie Mellon. “The economy does better with a Democrat in office,” she said, calling back to the federal government’s balanced budget and surplus under her husband Bill Clinton’s presidency as well as President Obama’s accomplishments while in office. “[Obama] doesn’t get the credit he deserves,” she said, to widespread applause, while Republicans continue “peddling the same economic snake oil.”
Although Clinton did not specify her position on how much the minimum wage should be raised, The Tartan asked Mayor Bill Peduto after the rally to address the possibility of a higher minimum wage in Pittsburgh and nationwide. According to Peduto, Pittsburgh is “on the path” to phasing in a $15 minimum wage over several years until 2019, with UPMC recently joining a two-year discussion. He has focused his efforts to raise the minimum wage on the local middle class and service workers. “Pittsburgh built the middle class,” said Peduto, and the city can “look at the same model again” as “part of a new economy.” Peduto expressed his support for a national minimum wage of $15 if it can be comfortably phased in over several years.
Clinton pledged to fight against the privatization of social security, to fix the Veteran’s Administration, and expand the Affordable Care Act. She also said she would “end Citizens United” and its attempt to make “more money equal more speech” in the federal government.
She promised to work toward universal pre-kindergarten and debt-free college education through refinancing and complete debt forgiveness after 20 years. We must “end the government making money off lending money,” she said.
She asserted her commitment to the pro-choice movement, marriage equality, equal voting rights, “common sense” gun regulations, and immigration reform with a “path to citizenship.”
To answer her second qualification of security, she called on her experience as Secretary of State. Clinton said that as president she would ensure that national security was “not an afterthought.” She mentioned her role in the military operation that killed terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden, as well as her successful nuclear arms negotiations with Russia that lessened the “biggest immediate threat” to national security.
Clinton expressed her discontent with her Republican contenders, saying that she was running an “issue-oriented” rather than an “insult-oriented” campaign. 
With a Republican in the presidential office, she said, “we will not recognize our country.” Trump in particular she called “deeply disturbing” in his attempts to “incite prejudice and paranoia.”
Finally, she portrayed herself as a uniter of the party. She contrasted herself with obstructionist Republicans in the commitment she has demonstrated in her career to “go anywhere to meet common ground.” For her entire adult life, Clinton said, she has stayed “in the trenches” and has done the “boring but necessary kind of work.” Thanking the crowd once again and urging them to vote, Clinton exited the stage to the sound of “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten.
At a booth across the street from the rally, several supporters of fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders were less enthusiastic about Clinton. One young man said that there are “lots of people who are undecided” in the primary race, and they “don’t know they have a better option.” While attendees for the Clinton rally waited in line, the Sanders supporters campaigned for their own candidate and solicited volunteers for his campaign. They described their efforts as “really successful,” claiming that they answered people’s “legitimate concerns” about their candidate and that many attendees “turned to Bernie on the spot.”
Attendees of the rally called it “surreal” and “wonderful,” and described Clinton as a “down to earth” woman who has “made a real difference in people’s lives.” One college student said that it was his first rally and he was “happy to get in” for an event that “really did touch [him].”

2016-04-18,CMU,India,"Holi was celebrated on campus this Saturday as hundreds of people took to Hamerschlag Hall lawn (The Mall) to participate in the seasonal tradition. This year’s event brought in over a thousand people from all corners of the diverse Carnegie Mellon community. The celebration was organized by OM, the South Asian spiritual club. OM has coordinated Holi celebrations on campus in previous years. Each year a different tag line is used to keep the event current and trendy. This year the event was promoted as 1-800-HOLIBLING: CMU Holi 2016, a play on the popular Drake song, Hotline Bling. 
Holi has exploded across college campuses and other venues in the United States within the last several years. Much of Holi’s success and spread can be attributed to social media, popular entertainment, media, and the pure and simple fun of it. The tradition of throwing colored powder has been adapted to color runs, music festivals, and other outdoor springtime activities around the nation.
The main part of the celebration involves smearing colored powder on participant’s faces in a spontaneous, lively atmosphere. In India, Holi is usually not contained to college campuses and select events. Holi happens on one day across the whole country. In a nation often divided by its brimming diversity, it is the one day people of many different backgrounds come together to engage in play. Holi is regarded as a time of new beginnings; a time of rebirth and rejuvenation.
In the United States, Holi has become a tradition with its own unique eccentricities and mainstays in its own right. Many American Holi events, for example, feature music, DJs, and performers, with contemporary Bollywood and western music. The events are usually organized and held in large venues and open locations rather than on city streets. For first-year information systems major Shubhangi Bhotika, who grew up in India, HOLIBLING at Carnegie Mellon was a truly unique experience.
“When I play Holi in India, I prefer playing with a small group of friends on the streets or a smaller more isolated location. It is also preferable to play with colors mixed with water, and we like using a variety of stuff like water guns and water balloons,” she said. HOLIBLING was, for the most part, a “dry Holi,” using colored rice-flour powder. In India, water games in addition to powder are cornerstones of Holi. 
Bhotika added, “HOLIBLING was really different in [the] number of people I played with, the very public location, use of dry [and] powdered colors, the music and performances. It was pretty awesome and is still quite similar to Holi back home, but definitely has its differences. I equally enjoy both styles.”
This year’s Holi was celebrated on March 24 around the world. This date marks the end of winter by the Hindu calendar and the last full moon of the month Phalgun, and this can vary from February to March on the Gregorian calendar. The Carnegie Mellon celebration was held off in order to coincide with spring carnival and warmer weather. 
Preparations started weeks in advance, when orders were sent out for white t-shirts for those who pre-ordered tickets. On the day of the event, OM board members worked tirelessly to ensure that the surrounding academic buildings were inaccessible to the participants, catered food was in place for serving, and people knew where to go. Around noon, a crowd began to form near Baker Hall and Porter Hall. After tickets were checked, all the participants were served an Indian vegetarian meal from the Coriander India Grill. Anticipation built as the crowd could tell the real fun was about to start.
Colors began to fly at around 1:15 p.m. as the lawn erupted into clouds of powder. Once inside the crowd, it was impossible to avoid being spattered with bright hues of pink, yellow, light blue, and purple. As the initial excitement began to slow down, the dance teams began to perform, once again elevating the energy levels of the crowd. The color throwing soon became a free-for-all, as it became increasingly difficult to recognize individuals under the coats of colored powder.
“The atmosphere was amazing; unlike anything I can remember. I liked how everybody threw the colors at everybody whether they knew them or not. It all played into an environment where everyone was dancing and happy.” said first-year Dietrich student Theo Yannekis, who experienced Holi for the first time. Many first-timers were surprised how fun such a simple activity can be. Indeed, Holi seems to be gaining traction not only around the rest of the nation, but here at Carnegie Mellon, with this year garnering one of the largest crowds so far, with over 1000 people in attendance. Curious alumni and members of the general public who were visiting for carnival were curious to see what was happening, and some even gathered to watch the performances and take pictures of the colorful participants.
In all the excitement and celebration, it can be easy to forget that Holi is a very ancient practice, which has significance beyond having fun. Recent articles published by NPR and other outlets have brought up the issue of Holi being used as cultural appropriation; whereby Indian culture is misrepresented by placing a heavy emphasis on Holi. This was in response to Coldplay and Beyonce’s recent release, [ITAL]Hymn for the Weekend[ITAL], which features an Indian Holi celebration. 
Holi is a tradition that has its roots in Hinduism. There are several themes that the festival celebrates; colors are used to symbolize the coming of spring and the end of winter. Another popular theme is the triumph of good over evil, which is the basis for a popular folk story on the origin of Holi. As the story goes, there was once an evil king named Hiranyakashipu in ancient India. His young son, Prahlad, instead of swearing allegiance to his father, worshiped the god Shiva. Hiranyakashipu ordered his sister, Holika, who had the power to withstand flames, to carry Prahlad into a bonfire to kill him. As Prahlad was being carried into the fire, he prayed calmly. Holika burned to ashes and Prahlad walked out of the fire unscathed. In India, the bonfires lit on Holi night commemorate Prahlad’s devotion, and the death of Holika. Despite the tradition, many people, even in India, celebrate Holi just for fun. The entertainment of Holi is a factor which will continue to make it universally appealing. However, it is important to at least recognize that it has a deeper meaning. 
Despite some minor hassles, HOLIBLING at Carnegie Mellon was largely successful. The event was delayed slightly due to the long lines. Because some participants did not pick up t-shirts during the tabling period, they were not guaranteed one at the event. Ultimately, the large crowds were managed successfully, and most of the issues with t-shirt orders were resolved before the main event started.
OM President and junior computer science major Bharadwaj Ramachandran said “Because of the new venue at the mall, people were able to stay closer together, and the event was accessible to people crossing campus during carnival. That definitely extended our audience this year.” In previous years, Holi was held on Flagstaff hill in Schenley Park. Last year, it was held for the first time on campus, on the CFA lawn. Each year, attendance has increased. Ticket sales were also increased due to a boost in last-minute sales from interested onlookers eager to partake in the action. 
True to the name, Hotline Bling was played as the event was wrapping up..

2016-04-25,CMU,India,"Nina is even worse than expected
The Zoe Saldana led biopic based on singer and civil rights activist Nina Simone was the subject of controversy long before it came out. The casting of Saldana, specifically, has been regarded with derision. Saldana is a relatively light-skinned African-Latino woman. Simone was a defiantly African-American woman with far less delicate features. When reports emerged that Saldana was using dark makeup and a prosthetic nose to compensate for the differences, the chorus of criticism only intensified.
Now that reviews for Nina have finally started rolling in, we know that the casting was symptomatic of a much larger problem — the movie is, to put it bluntly, really bad. The movie, currently struggling to hold up a comically low 3 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, meanders from act to act as it portrays a uni-dimensionally troubled Simone in a manner that borders on caricature.
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, “The word on this Nina Simone biopic has been so toxic for so long — it was filmed in 2012 but only released now — I was really hoping to find something good in it. No luck.”
The Marvel juggernaut rolls on
As is the case with most weeks leading up to the summer, Marvel dominated the movie news cycle with a flurry of announcements, rumors, and reviews this past week. First, the bad news: the Inhumans movie has been pulled from Marvel’s movie calendar. The Inhumans are a subspecies of humans that the Kree (an alien race) experimented on millennia ago. Now, when Inhumans are exposed to the “Terrigen Mist,” they suddenly and violently transform into powerful beings. 
Marvel’s reasons for pulling Inhumans are easy to guess — the parallels with X-Men, another Marvel property, are wide ranging. More than anything else though, the head honchos at Marvel have their hands full right now. New entries to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), from Spiderman: Homecoming, to Ant Man and the Wasp, give Marvel little space or incentive to launch another brand new franchise. 
Kevin Fiege, President of Marvel Studios, said:
“Since we made our initial phase three announcement, we added Spiderman, which was a big joyous coup for us. We added Ant Man and the Wasp, which was a big fun continuation of that story for us. Walt Disney Company has announced an Indiana Jones film for right around that same time. So I think it will shuffle off the current date [of Inhumans] that it’s on right now. How far down it shuffles, I’m not sure yet.”
On a more positive note, Marvel’s Summer 2016 juggernaut, Captain America: Civil War has been garnering rave reviews. Civil War is currently sitting on a 97 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the highest of any Marvel movie to date. This is absolutely incredible when one considers the monumental ambition of Civil War. The movie has to pack in more MCU characters than your average Avengers film, build a legitimate story that splits these characters down the middle and sends them to war, set the foundations of the MCU through its critical Phase Three, all while being a self contained “popcorn movie” with enough quips and spectacular action set pieces to wow the average viewer. Consider Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice as an example of everything that can go wrong when a movie tries to do too much.
A tale of two Jungle Books
If you haven’t seen the Jon Favreau directed, Disney produced The Jungle Book, I’d highly recommend checking it out. As a live action retelling of the animated classic, The Jungle Book blends spectacular visuals with the classic, virtually flawless original story. In particular, the voice cast is absolutely top notch. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Idris Elba as Shere Khan, and Bill Murray as Baloo work together (with Scarlett Johannson, Lupita Nyong’o, and Neel Sethi), to make for a rollicking and fun retelling.
That said, if you don’t get a chance to catch this Jungle Book retelling, worry not! A Warner Brothers production, with an arguably even more impressive director and cast, is on the near horizon. Jungle Book: Origins, directed by Andy Serkis, and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Christian Bale, and Cate Blanchett is on track to come out in early 2018..

2016-08-19,CMU,India,"The United States and India can both lay claim to the title of being the world’s largest democracy — albeit by different metrics. The United States for its economy, and India for the number of people it is home to. I was brought up in India, but have spent the majority of my adult life in the U.S. As such, I can’t help but compare and contrast the Indian and U.S. experiences. 
In some ways, they couldn't be further apart. India is chaotic and messy; things rarely work as they're supposed to and are never as they seem. The U.S. experience, by comparison, is so much cleaner, more organized, and seamless. And yet, I’ve found so many direct parallels on issues that I can’t help but think of these two nations as brothers with fundamentally similar world views. I used to think no other country could contain as many colors of skin, as many religions, and as many different points of view as India; then I came to the U.S. I used to think that the U.S. government system was a model of efficiency on a large scale. Now I know that the U.S. system faces many of the same issues that the Indian system does — from too much bureaucracy, to an electorate too polarized to agree on anything, to dangerous demagogues exploiting public fear and ignorance to build support.
Constitutionally, unlike the U.S. presidential style, India has a parliamentary democracy. The Indian president is a figurehead whose every action must be ‘at the advice’ of the prime minister — the real leader of the electorate. When Indians vote in a general election, they aren't voting for either a president or a prime minister. They’re voting for members of parliament (MPs) to represent their constituency. These MPs then elect a prime minister from amongst themselves, who then picks MPs for his cabinet. 
India has two large national level parties, the BJP and the Congress, and more smaller parties than one can count. One advantage of so many political options is that there are people on every side of every issue, instead of two opposites and nothing else. One disadvantage is that it is hard for any party to have a majority. India has had coalition governments for the better part of the past few decades, and such governments take their own sweet time building consensus before getting anything of any significance passed.
Just weeks ago, India instituted a goods and services tax (GST), passing the most extensive reform of its taxation code since independence — and the process was far from painless. The GST Bill was introduced by the current BJP government at the start of its term in early 2014. Negotiations between parties and campaigns for and against specific clauses of the bill continued in the media for more than two years. After concessions from every side, a significantly different bill from the 2014 version was passed with the unanimous support of every voting party in Parliament.
GST was a rare example of constant wrangling and negotiating yielding something worthwhile in the end. The BJP government has been trying even harder to get land reform passed; however, on an issue that polarizing it is unlikely to ever muster enough support. A more typical scene of Indian Parliament is protests and sloganeering washing out weeks worth of session time. India has also had no shortage of Donald Trump style ignorance predators. Some decades ago, a leader rose to power in north India on a promise to tear down the hydroelectric power plants in the region. He convinced large parts of the farming community that their crop failure was the fault of upstream hydroelectric plants, that these were sucking the energy out of the river water that was reaching their farms, and that this ‘lifeless’ water was killing their crops. Fortunately, no power plants were brought down, and the leader never won an election again.
The above described interplay of similarities and differences between the U.S. and Indian constitutions is found in culture and economics as well. The U.S. is undoubtedly far more progressive than India is today on many social issues. For example, homosexuality is just beginning to gain acceptance in India. Same-sex intercourse is still illegal, and yet LGBTQ people are gradually coming out of the shadows in open defiance of the law. Other important ideals, such as freedom of the press, or freedom of religion, are defended with just as much vigor in India as in the U.S. The government and opposition are constantly held accountable by the media. Even though India is a Hindu majority country, the colorful entertainment industry is dominated by Muslims. On some issues, such as gun control, India is actually more progressive than the U.S. Buying assault weaponry is virtually impossible in India. Buying any kind of weapon at all requires an extensive and effective background check.
All said and done though, the biggest and most important similarity between these two nations has got to be the incredible diversity they are both home to. In India, when I took the subway to school, I’d bump into people from every walk of life. I’d see Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, and Parsis. I’d hear a dizzying array of languages — including English and Hindi, but also Tamil, Gujurati, Punjabi and so many more that I couldn't even dream of understanding. In India, I remember having around two to three public holidays every month, because every community, every religion and ethnicity has its own holidays, which must all be celebrated. When I came to the U.S., I saw the same thing in every class I took, every street I walked down, and every Starbucks I went to. This diversity is the greatest asset either country could ask for. Rarely does everyone agree. Entire communities argue all the time. But being exposed to opposing points of view forces everyone to challenge pre-existing assumptions and gradually nudges us to the conclusion that deep inside, we’re all the same — human beings with the same aspirations and insecurities.
In some ways, the U.S. is a young country. After all, it was founded just a couple of centuries ago. But it also happens to be one of the oldest democracies in the world. India, as a democracy, is just seventy years old. But as a civilization, the Indian subcontinent is millennia old. Both countries can learn so much from each other if they can acknowledge their differences and appreciate their similarities..

2016-08-29,CMU,India,"For one week during the month of October, Colors @ CMU, an organization that seeks to ignite conversations about racial issues on the Carnegie Mellon campus in an effort to bring together people of differing backgrounds, will be hosting its first ever 2-4-1k Grand Challenge. 
The 2-4-1k Grand Challenge will take place from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7. Teams, consisting of two recognized student organizations, one of which must be a multicultural organization, will be tasked with utilizing a monetary budget with the goal of collaboratively developing a project that will make a positive impact on the Carnegie Mellon community.  Teams are free to create any project they desire to ultimately satisfy two goals: The project must be community based, directly involve and increase interactions between Carnegie Mellon students, and it must show tangible results by the end of the week. 
The aim of the project is based on Colors @ CMU’s goal to bring together members of different student organizations whose paths would not normally cross. “While there are many amazing cultural organizations out there at CMU, you don't really see them interacting with each other,” said Chrystal Thomas, a senior biological sciences major and creator of the challenge. Colors @ CMU hopes this challenge will increase collaboration between multicultural organizations at Carnegie Mellon. “We would love to see students involved in OM (The Organization for Indian Spirituality and Culture) feeling comfortable and interested enough to collaborate with SPIRIT and vice versa, or to see SALSA (Spanish and Latin Student Organization) collaborate with ASA (Asian Students Association),” Thomas said. “While these groups seem [to] have different interests, I believe they are actually quite similar.” 
Thomas believes this challenge will help show various student organizations the aspects that they have in common, which can ultimately motivate these individuals to step outside of their comfort zones. This can allow the members of the organizations not only to connect over the things they have in common, but also to create a desire to gain new perspectives from students with different cultural or racial backgrounds from their own.   
While the first year of college is when many seek out their niche on campus, this often creates a level of comfort that, over time, makes it harder to break barriers that inhibit us from engaging with other campus communities. The 2-4-1k Grand Challenge seeks to affirm the notion that there is not a limited time when one can partake in self-discovery and that we should be open to reigniting the bright-eyed freshmen desire of meeting new and different people. 
“I think the idea of the 2-4-1K challenge is to give an opportunity to break that barrier and encourage interaction among different people,” Sharon Wu, junior chemistry major and Colors @ CMU e-board member, stated. “In that way, I hope that the challenge will embody what it truly means to be a diverse campus. Having diversity should not be some statistic that admission officers stick on paper, but rather something incoming students look forward to, as they will be able to learn new perspectives and, in turn, grow as people.”
Registration for the 2-4-1K Grand Challenge will be open from Sept. 10 to Sept. 24. There will be an information session on Sept. 10 at Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, room 103 from noon to 1 p.m. The winning teams will be announced on Oct. 14. The first place winning team will receive a $1,000 cash prize, and second place winners will receive $400. There are no restrictions on these cash prizes, so each team can decide to use it as they please. 
Any questions about the challenge, such as a request to see an overview of the rules of the competition, may be sent to 241kchallenge@gmail.com. 
“We're really looking forward to seeing all of the great projects in October!” Thomas said..

2016-08-29,CMU,India,"A 22-year-old University of Pittsburgh student, identified as Grant Birdsong, who hails from the nearby Indiana Township, made waves on the internet last week when he attempted to leap from the rooftop of one building to another, but instead fell and got wedged between the two, all allegedly to impress a woman he just met. The two had gone up a fire escape to the rooftops of the Qdoba and Bruegger’s Bagels restaurants in Oakland when the incident occurred. The area, on Forbes Avenue near Atwood Street, is relatively central to the University of Pittsburgh, but is also often visited by Carnegie Mellon students looking for nearby off-campus food options.
At approximately 2 a.m. Tuesday morning, rescue workers arrived on the scene to try to retrieve the student from the 17-inch gap between the buildings. Police, firemen and paramedics all contributed to the effort for about four hours before Birdsong was finally freed at around 6 a.m. At one point, a paramedic rappelled down the gap, descending around three stories to help. Eventually, a jack hammer was used to break through the wall of Qdoba to successfully extract Birdsong.
The entire episode was live-tweeted by the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department, and was mentioned on several national news outlets. As Birdsong was wheeled away from the scene on a gurney, conscious but bleeding and sporting a broken ankle, he reportedly waved at TV news cameras.
A brief video of Birdsong after he was rescued shows him calmly laying on his back on a stretcher as he rolls towards an ambulance. He raises his arms in the air to give two thumbs up as he disappears into the vehicle.
On the internet, many who reported the story found humor in Birdsong’s ordeal. Time Magazine described it as “a harrowing tale of modern love, male ego, and parkour” and commended the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department’s dedication to live reporting the incident on Twitter.
Vice Magazine had a list of questions for Birdsong, starting with “Are you OK?”, followed by questions such as, “What was the conversation like on top of the roof? Did you immediately start bragging about your long-jumping ability, or did she start talking about her ex who was a really good jumper, or what exactly was the chain of events here?”, and finally ending with “Are you OK? I hope you are OK” again.
The roof-jumping incident even earned a mention in Jimmy Fallon’s monologue on The Tonight Show, as Fallon admitted he laughed when he heard the story, and joked that “Afterwards, the woman actually agreed to go out on a date…with the fireman who rescued that idiot.”
On social media, Birdsong was dubbed “Pitt Spiderman” and earned his very own hashtag.
Following the incident, the owner of the Qdoba, Chad Brooks, commented that his restaurant was likely to be closed for two weeks due to the new massive hole in its wall. However, Brooks stated that, “We were all young and dumb at some point, so no ill will toward him. I’m sure he’s embarrassed. I’m sure he’s hurting too.”
Bruegger’s Bagels was met with more fortune in the aftermath, experiencing a delay of only an hour before opening again at 7 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Police considered filing charges, but according to public safety spokeswoman Emily Schaffer, the cost of the damage done was expected to be covered by the business’ insurance.
In the end, if it’s any consolation to Birdsong, the girl did end up staying through the whole ordeal to make sure he was okay. It is unknown, however, whether they kept in touch after that..

2016-09-12,CMU,India,"Last fall, current Tartan publisher Sarah Gutekunst embarked on a journey to the foreign world of Fantasy Football. Throughout the season, Sarah learned how football worked, cheered as her team won, cried when injuries struck her players down, and fell in love with Denver Broncos kicker Brian McManus. Through it all, she chronicled her journey in articles for The Tartan, allowing readers to join her through every struggle and triumph.
This year, members of The Tartan’s editorial staff have come together to form a Fantasy Football league in the spirit of Sarah’s journey. On Friday, Sept. 2, the Tartan II league held its first draft. The results show who was on their A-game, who were the fantasy rookies, and who screwed themselves because of autopick.
Team 1: Flaming Bears
Layout Manager and former sports editor Zeke Rosenberg is the favorite to win this league simply because he knows the most about sports and actually keeps up with sports. This was evident by his draft strategy.
Holding the first pick overall, he went with the consensus number one pick: Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. Brown has emerged as the league’s top receiver following the retirement of Calvin Johnson, and is likely to lead fantasy wide receivers as well. Bolstering Zeke’s receiving corps are Jordy Nelson of the Green Bay Packers, Mike Evans of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and a secret weapon: Cleveland Browns wide out Josh Gordon, who has missed substantial time due to suspensions but possesses the ability to be a top receiver.
Zeke also snagged Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, one of the few reliably top producers for the position. Though his roster of running backs is questionable with DeMarco Murray new to the Tennessee Titans and Jeremy Langford still an uncertain commodity for the Chicago Bears, his quarterback position is helmed by Phillip Rivers of the San Diego Chargers, who has seen a resurgence as a top fantasy quarterback.
Overall, Zeke has a strong roster that is poised to get stronger as he hits waiver wire targets. It would be surprising not to see him in the championship round.
Team 2: Extremely Dank Team
Sports editor Alex Wood knows the game of football inside and out. He wants winners, and his roster has plenty of them. With the second overall pick, he decided to take fantasy’s best quarterback of 2015: Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers. The dual threat Newton will generate plenty of points on the ground and through the air. He next picked Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant, and then next chose top ten fantasy running back Mark Ingram of the New Orleans Saints, who I had been eyeing but just missed out on.
After rounding out his starting receivers with T.Y. Hilton of the Indianapolis Colts, he selected Thomas Rawls of the Seattle Seahawks, the heir apparent to Marshawn Lynch. He then chose top ten fantasy tight end Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs and then took the Seahawks defense. His next pick could potentially be the steal of the draft: Danny Woodhead of the Chargers, who finished as the third best running back overall last year. Rounding out his starters was Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski, the gold standard of fantasy kicking.
Alex’s starting team is highly talented and playoff bound, but his bench seems somewhat questionable. If he shores up his roster through the waiver wire or trades, he will certainly be a strong contender for the championship.
Team 3: Lieutenant Doodle
Sarah makes her triumphant return to Fantasy Football ... by being “too busy” to draft for any longer than two minute intervals. At third overall, she made the surprising decision to reach for Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. It’s undeniable that Gronk is the top tight end, but the other talent available makes the move either bold or reckless. 
Some elements of last year’s team have returned for Sarah. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, Jets running back Matt Forte, and the aforementioned McManus have all returned to her squad. Sarah also decided to take a risk on Panthers wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, who missed last year due to injury. She may be onto something since he scored 21 points on Thursday, strongly outperforming his ten point projection.
Sarah has the advantage of knowing more about football than most members of the league. Whether or not that translates to success will depend on many factors, but she seems to have a solid roster coming out of the gate.
Team 4: Dreamland Warriors
Honestly, I never expected to return to Fantasy Football. Two years ago, my team claimed victory over my friends from high school, and I was content to go out in a blaze of glory. Giving Sarah advice last season, however, rekindled my interest in the game, and when I was asked to be a part of the Tartan II league, I agreed for the sake of The Tartan.
At fourth overall, I was surprised that New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson were still on the board. While I was tempted to grab Peterson and heed traditional fantasy advice, Beckham was a critical part of my championship team two years ago, so I grabbed him off the board. I overcompensated for bucking tradition by selecting three running backs in a row: Doug Martin of the Buccaneers, LeSean McCoy of the Buffalo Bills, and Jamaal Charles of the Kansas City Chiefs. Soon, I reached for a quarterback, but it’s worth it to me as a New Orleans Saints fan to have Drew Brees.
I’d say my roster looks solid now, but it could still fall apart terribly if misfortune strikes.
Team 5: Masshole Knickerbockers
Lula Beresford’s entry into the world of Fantasy Football definitely started well as she got an excellent first round steal: the aforementioned Peterson. Despite his negative off field presence, Peterson is a phenomenal runner who should be a consistent source of points for her. Her wide receivers include Jacksonville Jaguar Allen Robinson, Brandon Marshall of the Jets, and Oakland Raider Amari Cooper at the top of the list.
Of note is that Lula made the first two free agency selections of the year. Since Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is on Goodell-imposed exile, Lula added Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. Because Cincinnati Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert is injured, she added Colts tight end Dwayne Allen. Both should be serviceable replacements while she waits for those two players, but the hole might become too deep for her to recover from later in the season if the rest of her team isn’t up to snuff.
Still, Lula’s team is nothing to scoff at, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves given how active Lula seems to be combing through available players.
Team 6: Pladdie Daddies
India Price’s entry into the world of Fantasy Football is a mixed bag. On the one hand, I loved her picking Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green in the first round, as he has proven to be extremely reliable in fantasy. I liked her picking up Titans tight end Delanie Walker, and I can see why she would believe in Steelers running back Deangelo Williams. On the other hand, some of her other choices seem very boom or bust. 
Giants quarterback Eli Manning may or may not ruin his passing performance with turnovers. Houston Texans running back Lamar Miller may make the transition to another team or not.
Finally, there are some troubling signs of management on her choice of defense and kicker. The Raiders defense has not been known for quite some time to be a force either in reality or fantasy. In addition, she has not replaced Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham, whose questionable status for Monday night leaves her no cover if he doesn’t play.
India’s team may win greatly one week and lose horribly the next. It’s all up to how she manages the week to week changes. She can choose her own fate, but it will be tough to compete against the stronger teams especially without experience.
Team 7: Mr Rogers’ Neighborhood
Jade, your pun is clever, but it doesn’t work unless you add the “d” for Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Anyways, she seems bullish on Cowboys rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott, who has the potential to be rookie of the year.
Her starters seem very solid, with the likes of Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, Cowboys tight end Jason Witten, and the Panthers defense. 
Her bench may only have a few notable names, but she may be geared up for the first waiver wire.
Surprisingly strong for a rookie team. We’ll see what happens in the next few weeks.
Team 8: Team Tayal
Team Tayal begins pure autopick teams. Autopick granted Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones, Washington Redskins tight end Jordan Reed, Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell, and the Chiefs defense.
The rest of his roster is bare bones, and the fact that he hasn’t set a running back in place of the suspended Bell suggests he will not take this league seriously.
This team will likely fall apart unless Abhishek starts paying attention.
Team 9: Team Foley
Forum editor Sinead Foley’s first autopick generated team is actually really darn good. Falcons running back Devonta Freeman was last year’s surprise top rusher in fantasy. Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer has had a renaissance with the team, and Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley looks to contribute to the team as well. Her wide receivers are of good quality: Sammy Watkins of the Bills, Jeremy Maclin of the Chiefs, and John Brown of the Cardinals are all worthy talents.
If she decides to take control of this team, Sinead might surprise the rest of the league.
Team 10: Team Foley (again)
Apparently, Sinead decided to helm two teams in the league and promptly forgot about it. Cardinals running back David Johnson, Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, Chargers tight end Antonio Gates, and Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles are the only notable performers from last year. Colts quarterback Andrew Luck will likely rebound from last year, but the rest of her roster is bleak and will likely degenerate over time..

2016-09-26,CMU,India,"A quick note regarding this column. Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal was supposed to write last week’s article because of being week one’s worst loser, but extenuating circumstances prevented him from doing so. Layout Manager Zeke Rosenberg has assured me that he has been or will be properly punished, so I’ll let bygones be bygones. In the future, expect the worst loser of the week to write the article, and week two’s biggest loser was me.
A quick recap of week one. Lula Beresford escaped the ignominy of being week one’s worst loser because Tayal started a suspended player. Jade Crockem changed her team’s name to complete the pun as mentioned in the article I wrote two weeks ago, and that’s totally the reason she won. Rosenberg, Sports Editor Alex Wood, and I all won our matchups by comfortable margins. Strangely, Forum Editor Sinead Foley’s second team, which I thought would be weak, scored 141 points. Unfortunately for her, the team faced Online Editor India Price’s Plaidie Daddies, coming from behind on Monday night to total 144 points. India totally won week one in the only matchup that came down to a single digit difference. Now to recap week two.
Flaming Bears over Dreamland Warriors 123–87
As expected Rosenberg totally trounced my team. He picked up Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, Kansas City Chiefs running back Spencer Ware, and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Cole Beasley, actively playing week one’s waiver wire. Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, Tennessee Titans running back DeMarco Murray, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans led his team to victory. On my end, the New York Giants were able to greatly limit the offense of the New Orleans Saints, causing quarterback Drew Brees and tight end Coby Fleener to severely underperform. Losing San Diego Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen for the year after week one did not help my team at all. Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, and Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy were my star players. New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett taunted me from the bench with a 22-point performance, but that would not have been nearly enough to defeat Zeke’s team. The Flaming Bears are now 2–0, while my Dreamland Warriors fall to 1–1.
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood over Masshole Knickerbockers 96–86
See, Jade. That pun is totally the reason your team is 2–0 right now. Actually, the real reason is because injuries destroyed Beresford’s team. Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler left the game after giving Beresford a mere two points, but the more devastating injury happened to Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. I’m really glad I didn’t pick him in the draft because he’s now on injured reserve, meaning he won’t be able to help Beresford at all unless she somehow finds herself in the championship matchup. Strong performances by Carolina Panthers kicker Graham Gano (18 points from a kicker!), New York Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall, and the Houston Texans defense were not enough to overcome performances from Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, and the Panther defense. Beresford’s team falls to 0–2, facing an uncertain future.
McManus’s Anus over extremely dank team 155–93
Publisher Sarah Gutekunst absolutely destroyed Wood’s team. Jets running back Matt Forte, Jets wide receiver Eric Decker, Panthers wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, and the Broncos defense each contributed over 20 points, with Forte adding a massive 30 points. The previously-named Broncos kicker Brandon McManus had a strong 14-point showing that helped give Gutekunst’s team the highest single game point total thus far in the season. For Wood, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton did the team proud, but when his passes were largely going to Benjamin, the 29 points he amassed were completely neutralized. Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant was the only other player to score double digits for Wood. The news only got worse. Chargers running back Danny Woodhead suffered an ACL injury that took him out for the season. I had him pegged as a potentially great contributer for Wood’s team, but now he’ll have to forge ahead without the dual running and receiving threat. Both teams are now 1–1.
Minaj And Co. over Team Foley 136–101
Tayal took control of his team, gave it a name, and managed to dominate against last week’s highest scoring loser in Foley’s second team. For Tayal, Oakland Raiders running back Latavius Murray, Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell, Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones, and Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry each contributed 21 points, already enough to beat Foley’s team. Foley, like some of the other losers this week, had a player get injured: Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart. She’ll need to shuffle her team’s players if she wants to start winning (though in fairness, she would have beaten any other team week one besides India’s team). Tayal’s Minaj And Co. are now 1–1, while Team Foley falls to 0–2.
Team Foley over Plaidie Daddies 101–87
In a reversal of last week, Tayal’s first team defeated India’s team. Foley has the Cardinals to thank, as their dominant performance against the Buccaneers gave her a 24-point performance from quarterback Carson Palmer and a 22-point showing from the defense. One thing Foley should note going forward is Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs. 
After scoring 17 points in week one and 33 points in week two, he probably shouldn’t be on her bench. On Price’s side, the same team that got her 144 points last week only scored 87 points this week. Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams, Titans tight end Delanie Walker, and Broncos running back C.J. Anderson were her top contributors, but her laggards sunk her chances of victory. 
Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham earned her no points since he was injured, and she needs to replace him ASAP. The Raiders defense is a terrible unit: scoring negative points for the second week in a row. Admittedly, they have a matchup this week that keeps them tolerable, but she needs to drop them for another defense as well. 
Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green will not be held to single digit performances every week, so his weak performance against the Steelers is nothing for India to worry about. She should, however, consider benching Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders in favor of Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Mike Wallace, who scored 19 points in week one and 20 points in week two. Price has the pieces for a good team, but she needs to make some moves in order to win consistently. Both teams are now 1–1.
Heading into week three, Rosenberg’s team and Crockem’s team are both 2–0. Rosenberg’s team seems poised to ascend further, after stealing Chargers running back Melvin Gordon from Tayal’s team in exchange for Ware. However, Wood’s team is poised to significantly challenge Rosenberg, especially after picking up Seattle Seahawks running back Christine Michael. The matchup between two of the strongest teams should prove to be interesting.
Elsewhere, I’m fairly certain I won’t be writing next week’s article. I’ve added Jets wide receiver Quincy Enunwa and Chargers wide receiver Tyrell Williams to my roster. Of course, Beresford is still in it against me after picking up Chargers quarterback Phillip Rivers, but she hasn’t yet slotted anyone to replace Peterson on her team.
Foley’s second team got up to a 24–0 lead over Sarah’s team after the Patriots defense eliminated the need to overexert tight end Rob Gronkowski’s return to the field. Still, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is questionable to play, Chargers tight end Antonio Gates is questionable, and Stewart is out. Since Foley doesn’t look like she’s going to make changes at all and Sarah’s starters are all completely healthy, I suspect that Sarah will mount a comeback.
Price’s team got off to a 14–0 lead over Crockem’s team, and she is projected to win her matchup by nine points. Of course, things would be better for India if she changed her defense and kicker, but things might still be fine for this week.
Lastly, Tayal’s team is poised to win against Foley’s first team, especially since Bills head coach Rex Ryan believes “odds probably not real good that [wide receiver Sammy Watkins] plays.” If Foley were to slot in Diggs for Watkins, she would be more likely to win over Tayal’s team.It’s hard to tell where most of these teams will be headed in the future. While Rosenberg and Wood are both clearly poised for winning, other teams have murkier fates. I would say that Gutekunst, Price, and I have some of the better teams, but that would discount Tayal’s week two performance and Foley’s two teams. Crockem may be 2–0, but that record isn’t nearly as solid as Rosenberg’s. Beresford is in danger most since she doesn’t have anyone lined up who can replace Peterson’s production at running back. Still, it is entirely too early to call it game over for anyone..

2016-09-26,CMU,India,"Mortar Board’s Eta chapter at Carnegie Mellon University was presented the Golden Torch award at the National Mortar Board Conference in Indianapolis, Ind. over the past summer. The Golden Torch is awarded annually at the National Mortar Board Conference to the most outstanding chapters of Mortar Board across the nation.
Mortar Board is a senior honor society first founded in 1912 at The Ohio State University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Chicago. Carnegie Mellon’s Eta chapter was founded in 1923, at the then Carnegie Institute of Technology. A select few rising senior students among all disciplines are invited to join Mortar Board each year based on their leadership, academic excellence, and dedication to service. The Mortar Board plays an active role in both the Carnegie Mellon community as well as the Pittsburgh community through several annual events on campus, such as Staff Appreciation Day which is dedicated to recognize the staff members who are working behind the scenes at Carnegie Mellon. Through Mortar Board advisor Sharon Craver, who is also the principal of The Children’s School at Carnegie Mellon, Mortar Board scholars work closely with children and provide educational weekend events for students.
Joshua Zak ’17, a Science and Humanities Scholar studying chemistry, is currently serving as the president of Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board. Zak was invited to join the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board last spring. In July, he represented the Carnegie Mellon chapter at the annual National Mortar Board Conference at Indianapolis, Ind. “The Mortar Board national conference in Indianapolis was an amazing experience,” said Zak. “In just a few short days, the national representatives and section leaders gave me all the information and resources I will need to lead a successful chapter.” He was selected as the student president of Mortar Board a few months before the conference. The experience at the conference had transformed his perspective on Mortar Board.
At the 2016 conference, 36 chapters out of all 231 chapters in the nation were presented the Golden Torch award for their exemplary performance in the past year. The most recent graduating alumni of the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board have achieved excellence in their scholarship as well as their leadership in a variety of events. “[Last year’s Mortar Board members] were all extremely excited to hear that they had won a Golden Torch as it was one of the goals they strove for last year,” said Zak, “I hope we can repeat their successes.”
In the upcoming months, the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board will kick off their annual fundraiser “Turkey for a Day.” This event happens around Thanksgiving to raise money for charities supported by different professors. During this event, students at the university can donate to vote for their choice of professor. The four professors who receive the most donations will dress up in turkey costumes for a day. In the past years, Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board has successfully raised over $1,000 in this one event, and has donated to different non-profit organizations.
Being a part of the organization brings not only exceptional opportunities to participate in service and volunteering activities within the Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh community, but also plenty of chances to network with accomplished alumni from across the nation. Every member selected is guaranteed a $500 scholarship from ReadAcad, a prestigious non-profit venture management program. In addition, the benefit of membership also contains opportunities to apply to prestigious scholarships such as the NIH-Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program as well as the paid fellowship with City Hall Fellows.
Every spring, invitations will be sent to the top 30 percent of the junior class to encourage them to apply to be members of the Mortar Board. After reviewing the applications, Mortar Board invites the top 50 applicants to join the chapter..

2016-10-03,CMU,India,"Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these months you've missed getting your weekly fantasy football update from your old friend Sarah.
That's right, I was the biggest loser last week. One of the Teams Foley got lucky when I made not just one or two bad bench calls, but four. Four bad calls that could have earned me an extra 50 points, saving me the humiliation of only scoring 64 points. But hindsight is 20-20, and the matchup was 86–64.
[BOLD]Team Foley over McManus’s Anus 86–64[BOLD]
Remember how Panthers' wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin was really great for two weeks in a row, raking in 21 and 29 points for me in weeks one and two, respectively? And remember how I reached for legendary Patriots' tight end Gronk in the draft, and then he was injured for weeks one and two? Well, I started them both this week, then they both scored me a hard zero. So thanks for nothing, a-holes. Meanwhile on the bench I had QB Matt Stafford with 26 points, and wide receiver Michael Crabtree with 18. But I'm not bitter. Especially not about the part where Team Foley's kicker Justin Tucker of the Ravens scored 17 points to McManus's 5. That's fine.
[BOLD]Dreamland Warriors over Masshole Knickerbockers 137-86[BOLD]
Assistant Sports Editor Ian Tanaya's Dreamland Warriors continue to make Kirby proud. Just among New Orleans QB Drew Brees, Bills' running back Lesean McCoy, and Seahawks' kicker Steven Hauschka, Tanaya raked in 64 points. Two thirds of his team scored double digits. Even though Beresford and the Masshole Knickerbockers had two awesome performances — 23 from Tampa Bay running back Charles Sims and 24 from Jaguars wide receiver Allen Robinson — the rest of her lineup kind of crapped the bed. My thoughts are with you, Lula.
[BOLD]Mr. Rodgers' Neighborhood over Plaidie Daddies 132-96[BOLD]
This was a juicy matchup. Best friend versus best friend. Jade versus India. Competition was intense. Operations Manager Jade Crockem sealed the deal as the only team with an undefeated record. She can send a major thank you to Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay QB and all-around babe, for his solid four touchdowns and 24 points, and Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin who received for an actually astounding 164 yards and 30 points. Online Editor India Price's Emanuel Sanders, wide receiver for the Broncos, also had a pretty impressive week, receiving for 117 yards and raking in 32 points. But unfortunately, Price's lineup didn't have the depth we saw in Crockem's, and Crockem continues to reign. If I were a betting woman, I'd put my money on her to stay undefeated another week, as she only has Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal and his team Minaj And Co. to beat. We just explained to him this past week what a ""down"" means.
[BOLD]Team Foley over Minaj And Co. 131–119[BOLD]
I have to say how impressed I am that Team Foley has been so successful this season. And in week two, somehow four of Team Foley's players scored more than 20 points (Rams' running back Todd Gurley with 21, 49ers running back Carlos Hyde with 25, Bears' tight end Zach Miller with 27, and Falcons' running back Devonta Freeman with 31). So basically I curse whatever deities exist for the unfairness that was this auto-draft. Tayal and Minaj And Co. still had a pretty good week, though, I have to say. The Chiefs absolutely destroyed the Jets 24–3 last week, so good thing Tayal started their D/ST for a total of 32 points. Dolphins' wide receiver Jarvis Landry also brought in a solid 26 points, but in the end it didn't matter. Too bad Tayal wasn't playing the other Team Foley or he could have won, and I still would have lost anyway. Can you tell I'm bitter?
[BOLD]extremely dank team over Flaming Bears 144–143[BOLD]
I have to say this margin makes me laugh pretty hard at Layout Manager Zeke Rosenberg's expense. Last weekend his attention was pretty occupied by having to take the LSATs, so he forgot to put Green Bay wide receiver Jordy Nelson back into his starting lineup. So of course Nelson scored 28 points for the bench and Rosenberg soiled his undefeated record. I'm sorry, but ha-ha-ha-ha. Sports Editor Alex Wood's extremely dank team can thank Colts' wide receiver T.Y. Hilton for his exceptional 31 points, but the rest of his team is still just pretty great - dare I say dank? I'm thinking I should propose a trade and throw in a couple of articles for his section next week so try to get my hands on some actually successful players.
For week four, I'm excited to see how the inevitable Team Foley versus Team Foley epic matchup will go. My money is definitely on Team Foley! The only other matchup I'm really excited about is my own, against Rosenberg's Flaming Bears, because as a wise friend once told me, ""The most interesting thing to talk about is your own fantasy team. The least interesting thing to listen to someone talk about is their own fantasy team."".

2016-10-03,CMU,India,"Tired of college? Sick of campus food? Want to be in a somewhat more relaxing place? Go to Craig Street!
Right across from the Carnegie Museum of Art, Craig Street is a nice place to freshen up a bit, and get just a little away from the Carnegie Mellon bubble. With restaurants and stores from all sorts of places, from Asian to Irish, Craig Street is definitely the place to go when you crave a sense of home or just want to explore a different culture.
EatUnique is one of the restaurants on Craig Street. Featured are sandwiches “hot off the grill” and the fresh salads. Every day, EatUnique also has a daily special menu, and, trust me, every single item on the specials is absolutely delicious. If you’re a vegetarian, EatUnique is a nice place to get a hot freshly made sandwich, for when you’re tired of the cold and stale salads you get on campus. The incredible food aside, EatUnique also scores on convenience for Carnegie Mellon students by allowing us to use Dinex for purchases, thereby providing a wise and guilt-free way to burn away one's extra Dinex at the end of semester. Besides the regular food, EatUnique also provides affordable and tasty catering services.
Not far away from EatUnique, and right next to Little Asia, is a cute little store called Irish Design Center. While unremarkable on the outside, Irish Design Center is incredible once you step inside. It contains a large variety of Irish goods, from knitwear to decorations to candy bars. According to the owner, the store has been on Craig Street for over 40 years now. As one of the oldest Irish stores around the place, Irish Design Center probably has anything Irish you could possibly ever need. What’s even more special is that the large majority of the products are directly imported from Ireland and Scotland, with the remaining minority made at an Irish factory in the United States. The store is a nice place to check out if you’re in the mood for any Irish-style clothes (especially knitwear), jewelry and decorations, or maybe just want to experience the culture, or even just take back a box or two of the finest Irish tea. Irish Design Center also offers a collection of Irish gifts, which are all pretty and affordable. There’s going to be a special discount for St. Patrick’s Day and a side walk sale during summer time, so be sure to drop by then!
Snowlion Import, also along the street, has arguably the most exotic facade of any place on Craig Street. Like Irish Design Center, Snowlion Import is also a store that sells imported goods. That said, Snowlion Import sells items from Nepal, Tibet and India. Having been around for over 14 years, Snowlion Import is the first Tibetan store in the Oakland area, and the store with the largest collection of Tibetan goods in Pittsburgh. The store sells all sorts of items —from artifacts, jewelry and decorations to clothes, religious and ritual items for Buddhist practitioners. You can find everything here: earnings made from meteorite, gift cards with mysterious patterns, sports-wear made of the most comfortable fabric you ever touched, pillows and books for practicing Buddhism, and small spiritual items that wish you good luck. The owner of the store, a Nepalese native, schedules several trips between the U.S. and Nepal just to select the best products to bring back from Nepal. A portion of the benefits of the store also go to underprivileged children in Nepal. Even if you're not to keen to buy anything, Snowlion Import is a great place to just walk through, to feel the calm incense, talk to the owner and learn more about the history of Nepal and Buddhism. Most of the items at Snowlion Import are relatively affordable and you can always ask for a discount. Don’t hesitate if you ever do decide you want something, because as the owner says, “get them now, since they won’t stay long.”
Top Notch Art Supply, more casually known just as the art store on Craig Street, is a great place to visit if you're an art or architecture students. The art store has everything you'd need as an art student, and if you ever want something the store doesn't stock, you can ask the owner and he will be more than happy to order it for you. Compared to the campus store, the art store in Craig Street is better stocked and, most importantly, much more affordable. With a flat 40 percent discount in the back to school season, and a regular 20-50 percent discount for VIP customers, the store is a great place to restock on art supplies, or even just drop in for a chat with the always friendly and fun staff.
Besides the above stores, Craig Street has so many more places to check out. The comic store with a large collection of books and toys, Lulu’s noodles with the tasty bubble tea, the froyo place that opens 24 hours a day, there’re so many more to try and experience.
Get outside the campus and take a short 10 minute walk with your friend to experience everything in Craig Street. It will be worth it..

2016-10-10,CMU,India,"From the moment I was asked to join The Tartan’s first Fantasy Football league I made no pretenses about knowing what the heck was going on. My leaguemates said they needed one more person to make the league work, so I figured I’d make a team to help them out and then leave it to run by itself, accepting my losses with grace and a healthy side of not caring. And considering that when I went to make my team I couldn’t figure out how to do it and accidently ended up making two, keeping a safe distance seemed like the way to go. 
For a bit there the plan seemed to be working. My auto-picked, automatically named Teams Foley held their own, averaging around 100 points a week for the first three rounds. Then disaster struck in week four. Turns out you have to actually manage and change your teams in this game. Staring at a scoreboard where my team had 45 points less than the second worst loser, I decided it was time to make a change. 
Our beloved Layout Manager Zeke Rosenberg and Assistant Sports Editor Ian Tanaya took it upon themselves to help me on my quest of figuring out what in the world was going on. The first step was teaching me that there is a site where we can actually view and control our teams. Imagine! Then it was time to take it to the next level and teach me how to move people on and off the bench. There are a lot of letters that I’m still trying to decipher, but it seems that you want to bench people who have red letters next to them and replace them with someone in the same position. 
I was starting to feel pretty confident that I could manage this team and quickly scale the league scoreboard until Rosenberg said, “You're also going to want to bench Tevin Coleman too. He has sickle cell anemia and the Falcons are playing in Denver this week.” My reaction was, “Wait, how am I supposed to know any of that.” In that moment, I gave up any hope of figuring this game out. 
There was, however, one thing I could do to improve my situation in the league. At the very least, I could change my team’s names to be more reflective of the situation. And so teams 'What is going on?' and 'How does this work?' were born. And while I have faith that we’ll do better next week with a bit of help from our friends (cough, Rosenberg, cough), I still have to pay my dues and report on our epic demise last week. And so, without further ado, here’s the weekly report.  
Plaidie Daddies over Dreamland Warriors 107–104
Our Online Editor India Price had a narrow victory over Tanaya’s Warriors. The two teams were a fairly even match, with over half of each team scoring in the double digits. Tayana saw some great performances his running backs LeSean McCoy of the Bills and Jordan Howard from the Bears, who earned 22 and 16 points respectively. In the end it didn’t matter, though, because Bengals’ wide receiver A.J. Green earned Price a crushing 33 points. Apparently Green has been a bit of a superstar this season, or so ESPN sports tells me. All I know is that between his points and a beautiful supporting act by Price’s other wide receiver, Broncos’ Emmanuel Sanders, there was really nothing Tanaya could do, but his Warriors fought hard anyway.
extremely dank team over Masshole Knickerbockers 137–110
Both of these teams put their best foot forward this week. Sports Editor Alex Wood’s team crushed it, with all of his players scoring in double digits. High flyers included Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., who pulled off an impressive 25 points and became the first player aged 37 or older with 100 receiving yards and a touchdown since Ricky Proehl in 2005, which was apparently a big deal or something, and Saints’ running back Mark Ingram, who earned Wood 21 points. Beresford made great use of her team this week, losing very few points on the bench, but again luck was not in her. 
Minaj and Co. over Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood 163–112
Now for the big scorer of the week. Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal had an admittedly impressive performance this week, and no one will let me forget it. As people keep mentioning, his wide receiver Julio Jones singlehandedly tied one of my whole teams with 48 points. Jones made history in our league for the most points scored by a single player and out in the real world by becoming the sixth player in history to record at least 300 receiving yards in a single contest. Courtesy of Wood I finally know what that means. Just because the deities of fantasy football like to be unfair, Tayal also had Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who scored 34 points. I was getting an angry rant all prepared until I saw that he was a Steelers player, so I guess I’ll let it go since he’s one of our boys. The most frustrating part is that Tayal didn’t even max out his potential, losing 15 points by benching running back Isaiah Crowell of the Browns in favor of Chiefs' running back Spencer Ware, who earned a limp 8 points. In the face of this onslaught, Operations Manager Jade Crockem didn’t really stand a chance. Still, she raked up a respectable 112 points with the help of quarterback Derek Carr of the Raiders, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot, and Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. Rumor has it that Elliot could end up being rookie of the year if he keeps up his pace.
Flaming Bears over McManus’s Anus 113–94
And now we have Rosenberg facing off against Publisher Sarah Gutekunst. These two get the award for losing the most points on the bench this week, which I’m a little bit pleased about since I assumed I’d be the one with that distinction. Rosenberg wasted the second highest scorer of the week, quarterback Matt Ryan of the Falcons, favoring the Redskins’ Kirk Cousins’ measly 17 points to Ryan’s 35. Gutekunst made her own blunders, leaving her top two scorers, Seahawk quarterback Russell Wilson and Raider wide receiver Michael Crabtree, on the bench. These aren’t the kinds of performances I’ve come to expect from football guru Gutekunst and my mentor Rosenberg. Hopefully they will both refocus in the coming weeks.
How does this work? over What is going on? 93–48
And, last and least, we get to my mess of a match up. I’d say that there should be rules against having to battle yourself, but I’m pretty sure there are rules against having two teams in the first place. My complete lack of commitment to this league finally caught up to me this week. To be fair the meager performance of How does this work? wasn’t completely my fault since all but one of my players never broke 15 points, but I lost 24 points through pure neglect when I didn’t substitute in wide receiver John Brown of the Cardinals for Bills wide receiver Sammy Watkins when he ended up on injury reserve at the start of the week due to a foot injury. I really don’t have anything to say about What is going on? With two of my players out with injuries and wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins of the Texans only managing to eek out one point in the whole week, it was an absolute mess. But never fear! I’ve taken a peek at the coming week’s scoreboard and, spoiler alert, I’m doing quite a bit better.   .
