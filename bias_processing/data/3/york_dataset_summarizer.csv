York University’s new vision for its Keele campus was unveiled April 13, and apparently includes a focus on pedestrian traffic, increased greenery and the possible reorganization of parking spaces and athletic facilities.
The York University Development Corporation’s (YUDC) “Campus in the City” project debuted at an open house event in Vari Hall, at which students could view and comment on almost two dozen panels that showed off new maps, plans and proposed physical changes to the university campus.
Subtitled “Moving Forward: the Master Plan,” the project emphasized three “lenses” through which developers will view the campus: a “Pedestrian First” lens, prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist traffic over automobiles and centering on the new TTC subway stations; a “Greening the Campus” lens, with a focus on tree-lined streets and “greenways”; and an “Infilling the Campus” lens, aimed at better using space in the middle of Keele’s “academic core.”
Various potential changes include shared side roads without sidewalks or barriers, to ramp up pedestrian safety by forcing drivers to slow down; a bike-sharing system that’d let students borrow bicycles for campus use; and a few more high-rise buildings and green courtyard spaces.
The drawings also made room for the proposed new Pan Am Games stadium, which may be erected just west of the Boyer Woodlot. Other athletic facilities would be moved closer to the center of campus, and parking spaces may be shrunk and pushed to the edges.
Christopher Wong, director of master planning with the YUDC, said the plans will be revised based on consultation with stakeholders over the summer, but that the changes realistically reflect the direction the campus will assume over the next few years.
At the open house, students engaged with consultants over the changes; some reactions were quite positive.
“The people who put this together seemed to have a pretty good idea of the university and its needs,” said third-year law major Flynn Paquin, citing the general switch from parking lots and roads to multi-use pedestrian space. “They’ve a pretty good idea of what actually happens on the campus.”
But Paquin was also worried the plans focused too much on “greening” a campus that, for most students studying in the fall and winter, will still mainly feature brown, barren trees.
Wong said while courtyards may not be usable in wintertime, they “provide a visual amenity to the building occupants, bringing daylight into complexes like Schulich and the Seneca@York building.”
The open house was the YUDC’s first information session on the project – they’ve another set for this coming fall – but some students noted it wasn’t well advertised, and spanned only a few hours. “I didn’t know about this at all—it just popped up,” said a second-year liberal arts student. “I think they strategically place it during exam time when not everyone’s on campus.”
Wong explained the presentation panels will be available for download from the YUDC website in the next few weeks.
Looking at photos on several panels, it was apparent the Planning Partnership and Greenberg Consultants Inc., who worked together on the project with the YUDC, drew inspiration from parks and walkways at McGill University in Montreal; in Brooklyn, New York; and in Shanghai, China.

A picture of Liu, taken from her Facebook profile
[UPDATE:] Toronto police arrested and charged a Toronto resident with first degree murder in the death of Qian Liu. Police asked media not to release a photo of the man –  Brian Dickson, 29 – at this time. He appeared in court April 21. Excalibur will continue to update any breaks in the story.
Toronto police have identified the woman who was found dead April 15 in a basement apartment in the Village at York University.
Qian Necole Liu, a 23-year-old student who came to Canada in January and was studying at the York University English Language Institute (YUELI) on a student visa, was found dead at her off-campus Village residence at 27 Aldwinckle Heights.
Liu’s boyfriend, who is overseas in China, told police he was engaged in an online conversation with Liu when she answered her door around 1:00 a.m. A physical struggle ensued between Liu and the man at the door – who initially asked to use her cellular phone – while her boyfriend looked on, until the unknown man turned off the computer.

The computer, an IBM ThinkPad T400, is still missing. The police have labeled the man a person of interest, and describe him as a tall white male with a muscular build and medium length brown hair between 20 and 30 years old.
Her boyfriend alerted friends of the incident via internet; they contacted police. Liu was found dead by the time authorities arrived, approximately 10 hours later.
Excalibur approached YUELI and the Chinese consulate in Toronto. YUELI declined comment, while the Chinese consulate only mentioned there would be a related media release April 19.
Police and forensics were seen on site moving in and out of the residence, though they declined comment.
According to Tony Vella, a Toronto police officer working on the case, ensuring student safety is one of the major issues at hand.
“The [roommates] have been spoken to. Obviously it was a very traumatic experience […] their safety is our first concern,” he said. “We are trying to determine if it was an isolated incident or if it was random.”
Vella said Toronto Police are currently speaking with York security and the public relations department to make sure the school population is safe.
Fourth-year kinesiology student Marco Manca says that for students living in the village, the incident has struck very close to home.
“A lot of us have lived in this Village area for so long,” he said. “[My] friend that lives here has been deeply affected because he’s met the victim.”
Manca’s friend – who was living at the same residence as Liu, though he was not at home at the time of the murder – has since moved back to his family residence.
“He has to move his stuff back to his [family residence],” said Manca. “He’s waiting on word when he can do that, because right now he’s not allowed.”
Alexandra Shiman, a fourth-year student who lives in the Village, feels unsafe in the wake of the incident.
“I’ve always felt uncomfortable living in this area, but my fears have increased since hearing about the murder,” she said.
Anyone with information about the incident or the person of interest is asked to call police at 416-808-7399 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-8477.

The monument memorializing the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre may no longer be visible in the Student Centre, but plans to create a replica are in progress after concerns that the originally planned plaque would not do the statue justice.
Cheuk Kwan of the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC) is currently in talks with the Student Centre’s executive director Scott Jarvis about the possibility of mounting a bronze structure at York to replace the Goddess of Democracy statue.
The original papier mâché statue, which was donated by the TADC and had been a Student Centre fixture since 1992, was taken down due to maltreatment and damage that led to the presence of fruit flies and mould, Jarvis said to Excalibur.
Fine arts professor Bruce Parsons, who oversaw the team of students and Chinese artists that constructed the original statue, explains that while a commemorative bronze plaque was mounted in the Student Centre, it was insignificant on its own.
Parsons expressed his desire to create a more impressive structure either within the Student Centre — to stand roughly eight feet tall and enclosed in a glass case for protection — or behind the Student Centre building near Central Square, which would allow “more room for creativity.”
Parsons met with Jarvis on August 26 to discuss his designs, saying Jarvis was very receptive to them.
Kwan is very pleased at how smoothly talks are proceeding.
“I’m quite happy with the process right now, and I think we’re moving in the right direction,” he says. “They’re open to the idea of a replacement […] Parsons and I are looking at a 3D model tonight.”
One of the goals is to display the monument in a location where students and community members will be able to see and learn of the significance of the commemorative piece.
“People don’t see the importance of the statue, and we want them to see it,” Kwan says.
Future meetings regarding the final decision are in place.

The contract between CUPE Local 3903 and York is due to expire August 31, and both parties — through neither has commented about the current state of negotiations — are expressing optimism about forthcoming meetings.
“We hope to meet with the employer about negotiations very soon,” says CUPE 3903 communications officer Claire Major, noting that negotiations were still in preparation.
York president Mamdouh Shoukri is also confident that talks will be carried out in good faith.
“I’m not aware of the details of the negotiation at this stage, but I’m hopeful that things will go well,” says Shoukri. “One of the most important initiatives that we have undertaken — and this has nothing to do with CUPE, per se — is what we called the ‘Better Workshop Initiative’. I want to understand better the underlying issues that have caused labour relation issues in the past.”
New rounds of negotiations and consultations will be taking place throughout the coming weeks.
A failure to come to an agreement regarding bargaining and negotiations in November 2008 resulted in classes being cancelled and campus shutting down for the duration. Only after Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty’s government passed back-to-work legislation did the 85-day strike come to an end.

York has decided not to renew Pepsi’s campus-wide contract, due to end August 31.
Pepsi will no longer hold a monopoly over York’s beverage options. PIPPIN LEE
While York’s director of food services Anthony Barbisan said the $7.5-million contract has provided York with funding to run student organizations and provide stadium upgrades, there is no desire on the university’s part to pursue another exclusive contract.
“We have no appetite to pursue another agreement,” confirms Barbisan. “We’ve chosen not to pursue it based on community feedback […] the campus retailers will be in charge of their own beverage supply.”
Up until the contract expiration date, on-campus merchants were not allowed to sell beverages competing with brands owned by Pepsi.
Iced tea sold on campus had to be Lipton Brisk; water, Aquafina; energy drinks, Gatorade.
This leaves the fate of the numerous vending machines across campus in question.
“I’m not sure what will be happening to them, but the food vendors won’t be affected [by the contract ending],” says York Federation of Students (YFS) president Vanessa Hunt. “The benefit to students will be that they will have the option of more than one brand of beverages on campus. Students will be able to choose what kind of drink they like, whether it’s Coca-Cola, Pepsi, or a fairly traded brand.”

Textbook expenses are an unavoidable reality for students at the start of each semester.
Choosing new and used textbooks still seems to be the status quo. PIPPIN LEE
However, according to York bookstore director Steven Glassman, the textbook rental program “hasn’t grown as fast as we would have liked” since its initial launch at the beginning of the 2010–2011 winter semester.
Despite the rental option — which can potentially save students up to 75 per cent on textbook costs — Glassman states that the lack of immediate accessibility may be the reason for the slow growth.
“Rented books have to be shipped, which has delays,” he says. “It would be much more satisfying if rental books were physically available in the store.”
He confirmed the bookstore is working to have rental copies immediately available on premises to further expand the program.
As of now, rentals can be accessed through the York bookstore’s website where, once an order is placed, the textbooks will be shipped to the specified address. According to Glassman, there have been no complaints from students who do use the program.

A date for a preliminary hearing has been set for the man charged with the murder of a York student in what is now known as the “webcam death”.
According to Toronto police, the Crown is due to present its evidence against 29-year-old Brian Dickson January 30, 2012. It will be determined at that time whether the provided evidence is substantial enough to proceed to trial.
When questioned on the status of his client, Dickson’s lawyer Robert Nuttall replies that “nobody likes to be locked up on a first-degree murder charge.”

Dickson — who once attended York and was part of the McLaughlin College Council — was charged in connection with the death of international student Qian ‘Necole’ Liu in April.
Liu was found dead in her basement apartment home in the Village with no signs of trauma or sexual assault, despite being unclothed from the waist down.
Liu’s parents collected her remains following the autopsy and funeral service.
Dickson made a brief appearance in court August 16. He is due in court again October 26.

New measures at York will allow on-campus security officers to carry handcuffs and collapsible batons as part of their equipment.
PHOTO BY PIPPIN LEE
These recent changes have stemmed from a Metropolitan Action Committee on Violence Against Women and Children (METRAC) report that was released in March 2010, detailing measures the university can take to make the campus safer.
“We will be providing information on the implementation of the METRAC report,” says President Shoukri, who adds that there has been a 30 per cent increase in security on campus as well as increased campus lighting fixtures.
This is only one of many initiatives the university is taking, following several on- and off-campus assaults and a student death during the summer months.
Shoukri says York intends to give updates on the status of the METRAC report through a goal-oriented community letter, and that security officers around campus should be carrying their new equipment as of early 2012.
Vanessa Hunt, president of the York Federation of Students (YFS), calls this new initiative a “good middle ground”.
“We’ve seen that non-intervention from security officers doesn’t work,” says Hunt. “This option is good since the security officers must be equipped with a certain amount of material to do their job.”
Nevertheless, Hunt’s concern also lies with preserving students’ rights.
“What we don’t want is students beaten with batons, like at a peaceful protest,” she says, explaining the YFS has been meeting with the university to discuss how students’ rights will be protected under this new security measure.
Shoukri, however, explains all officers will receive extensive training.
“We take this very seriously and they have to be trained appropriately,” says Shoukri, explaining that the reason for the 2012 delay itself is due to the time needed to train the officers. “This is about enhancing the ability of security to do their job and that involves providing them with ability to do their job. This training is essential so that staff don’t go wild.”
Shoukri admits that despite speculations the goSAFE program would be scaled back, the program will continue to remain on campus and may even evolve further as safety measures are put in place.
“I know I have heard about how the university is held liable with goSAFE, but I am committed that this service will continue to exist and will be expanded,” he says. “Legalities aside, our number one issue is the safety and security of our campus.”
Shoukri also says further safety efforts are under way in the Village.
“I’m counting a lot on the Town and Gown Committee that we created, which involves representatives of the municipal government and the university staff,” he said. “We want to put pressure on the city to make sure they’re implementing their bylaws.”

As of September 12, the Michaelangelo’s food stand located in the Fine Arts Building will reopen as a Starbucks.
The stand closed for good at the end of April, marking the end of a business that had operated in that same location for over 20 years.
The Fine Arts Building will see more lattes and less lasagna. PIPPIN LEE
Anthony Barbisan, director of food services, says the decision was based on the results of surveys conducted over the past two years to gauge student interest for new food opportunities on campus.
Although the Fine Arts location is under new ownership, the main Michaelangelo’s cafeteria in the basement of Atkinson is still going strong.
Atillio Perrone, who has co-owned both locations with business partner Miguel Arce since 1999, says he was surprised to receive the closure notice late last April. He says he was under the impression the location was on track for a contract extension and possible renovations.
Due to significantly lower amounts of foot traffic, the Michaelangelo’s Fine Arts stand usually shuts down every summer.
“All of a sudden, they said ‘the Dean wants the Starbucks there, and that’s all there is to it,’” Perrone says. He cites a string of possible reasons for the delays, such as the 2008 strike. “They’ve been putting off my contract renewal for three years.”
Barbisan confirms Perrone and Arce were notified late April. He notes such a time frame is standard for establishments that close during the summer.
Petal Foods, the corporation that oversees Michaelangelo’s, will remain in their Atkinson location until the end of the 2011–2012 school year, confirms Barbisan. At that point, “an open proposal bidding for the location” will take place, he says.
“We’ll be consulting with the community [on this matter],” says Barbisan on the process of potentially choosing a replacement establishment for the location.
He says that, alongside everyone else, Arce and Perrone would be welcome to bid for the new contract for the Atkinson space.
Now with just one property to concentrate on, Perrone and Arce are exploring new ways to bring business to their Atkinson location. Perrone discussed plans from hosting Frosh Week events to hosting dances and pub nights.
They are optimistic that they are offering something hard to come by on campus: real Italian food.
“Where else can you get that?” asks Perrone. “We feel that we’ve been treated unfairly. It’s like we’ve had our legs taken out from under us.”

Though students are beginning to settle on and off campus for the new school year, the university is seeing a decline in student residence applications, raising questions of further potential residence closures.
Stong Residence. PIPPIN LEE
“It’s clear that residence applications are dropping, so the number of students living in residence is decreasing heavily,” says vp students Rob Tiffin. “Which is, of course, what happened with Founders [residence].”
After the closure of Founders residence last year, the university commissioned a report dealing with housing at York. This report will be available to the public mid-September.
With the construction of the York subway stop, he explains, students would have even more housing options available to them on and off campus.
“[Our next step] is a consultation process that will review the demand of housing at York and housing in general from every angle possible,” says Rob Castle, senior advisor to the vp finance and administration at York.
He elaborates that a consultation process must occur before any decisions are made regarding residence closure.
Castle confirmed no residences will close this year.
“The rumors that residences will be closing is really just a case of bad broken telephone,” Castle says.
Winters Residence. PIPPIN LEE
President Shoukri also confirmed that the university was not considering any residence closures.
“Just to be clear here, this rumour is totally unfounded.” he says. “I don’t know where this rumour is coming from. That said […] I’m concerned with the long-term interest of the university. Residence is very important, and […] we need to create an environment that will keep the students here.” He explains that he has asked finance and administration to complete a long-term review of residences at York.
Nevertheless, assistant director of residence life Ian Crookshank, who reviews residence life at York, admits residence closure “might be something [the university] is considering.”
“The complex one area residences [like Stong and Winters] have a high deferred maintenance cost,” says Crookshank, referring to the high costs associated with keeping the residences open.
However, he cites the importance of residence buildings in student experience and student life.
“If the university does close residences it will have a huge impact […] students receive a network of friends and support from residence dons and co-ordinators,” says Crookshank.
Various housing options will continue to become available to students as the subway construction continues, says Chris Wong of the York University Development Corporation (YUDC).

York’s new shuttle buses—implemented as part of a safety initiative for students living in the off-campus Village residential area—will be available in the fall semester.

The shuttle buses, which carry up to 60 passengers per shuttle, leave Vari Hall and take a 20-minute express route or an east and west route that serves 11 designated stops and two additional request-only stops in the Village. The east and west routes will depart every half-hour, and the express will depart every 15 minutes with the last departure from Vari Hall being at 1:40 a.m.
Through the east and west routes will not operate during holidays and weekends, the shuttle will still be running during these times. To further enforce the York’s new safety initiative, bus drivers will wait for students to enter their houses upon request.

From August 25-28, Toronto played host to volunteer performers from around the world specializing in fire, insects and chalk this weekend, all in the name of Epilepsy Toronto. One in a hundred Canadians will experience epilepsy at some point in their life, so the support is becoming ever crucial. With that in mind, Torontonians got the chance to guiltlessly watch as all kinds of street performers put their lives at risk (so long as they pitched in a donation).
Scotiabank’s 12th annual BuskerFest was more than just entertainment this year; this time around it was more aesthetically pleasing and thoughtfully artistic than ever. Here’s a compilation of interesting performances.
Close Acts, XL Insects. LESLIE ARMSTRONG
Children crying, teens pointing and laughing, and adults snapping their digital SLRs at the whole scene. The XL Insects, a roaming performance act originating in the Netherlands with the Close Acts theater company, swarmed the streets in front of the Flat Iron building, terrorizing and fascinating with their silver bug eyes and their brightly coloured red and blue bodies. They screeched and dipped their menacing pincers into the sea of people who were just trying to cross the street to use the washroom facilities. Think Cloverfield — but substitute pesky flies in place of gigantic spiders.
Pyromancer. LESLIE ARMSTRONG
We all have a pyromaniac friend out there, but Pyromancer is what happens when that friend gets a little out of hand. Also from the Netherlands, our subject hopped around the stage in a majestic gold cloak, muttering unintelligibly in Dutch, and projecting flames from his mouth. He kept the flame alive by spitting what seemed to be straight vodka (hopefully not lighter fluid) into his fires. The show was finishing, and just as we were about to label him a nutcase, he charmed us by blowing fire-kisses to the crowd.
 
 
 
Chalky. LESLIE ARMSTRONG
Not so flashy and overbearing like many of the other performances, our very own Canadian from Ottawa, Chalky, sat on the sidewalk, reproducing famous historic portraits using nothing but chalk (you guessed it). The result is a smooth, well-blended depiction of the real thing, and all from a man who looks like he could be one of the spectators, clad modestly in cargo shorts and a t-shirt. Chalky’s art will stand the test of time, but unfortunately, not the test of rain showers and pigeon droppings.
Kate Mior. LESLIE ARMSTRONG
Toronto-based installation artist Kate Mior may not do back flips and somersaults mid-air, but avid photographers did just that to get a shot of this world-famous mime. With her perfect ringlets and satin dress, she mimed a wind-up doll, complete with the continuously revolving golden knob on her back. Even with her masterful, calculated movements, she was just as captivating while stock-still. Talk about sitting pretty.

Students from all over the Greater Toronto Area, including those from York, made their way to city hall September 26 to oppose proposed cuts to vital city services.
Sandy Hudson, chair of the Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O), says students from colleges and universities across the GTA have been organizing to make sure their voices will be heard.
“[These are] all sorts of services that students in this city need in order to continue their studies, to get to school, and to make sure that they’re able to do well,” says Hudson.
She points out the biggest concerns for students include cuts to childcare, libraries, bike lanes, and the TTC.
However, city councillor for Ward 17 Cesar Palacio insists that this is not about cutting services.
“It’s about improving and maintaining the level of service,” he says. “The difference is between having the essential services and all other services that would be nice to have—the ones we cannot afford. City council is simply trying to find what services are essential to Torontonians and to find efficiencies.”
Alastair Woods, vp campaigns and advocacy for the York Federation of Students (YFS), agrees city service cuts—especially to transit and bike lanes—will have a huge impact on students.
“We have a lot of students who travel from all ends of the city,” he says. “Any cuts to the TTC—whether it be in routes or whether it be in the number of times [buses] come or whether it be in the actual infrastructure—will end up hurting students in the end.”
Fourth-year York student Sean Dimnik depends on his bicycle to get around the city. The notion of less bike lanes worries him.
“It would limit my mobility,” he says. “My primary resource is my bike in terms of transportation.”
Woods also addresses the concerns of students who rely on childcare.
“I think the common misconception is that students are 18 or 19 years old and don’t always have kids to take care of,” he says, “but that’s not entirely true.”
Tanya McFayden, vp gender issues for the Graduate Students Association, has a child in the Lee Wiggins Childcare Centre at York.
“I know many people in my life with children who end up putting them in childcare they don’t feel comfortable with,” she says. “They put them into unlicensed daycares and into home daycares simply because they need a spot and they have to work.”
If she didn’t have a spot, says McFayden, she would not be able to pursue her graduate studies.
Hudson says the massive outcry from residents across the city has resulted in city council delaying some service cuts, such as those to public libraries.
“[People] here today are demonstrating for two reasons: one is a bit of a celebration because it looks like some of the cuts that were on the table […] before have been delayed or will be, at the very least.”
However, Palacio believes there won’t be any radical changes.
“[In reality], there won’t be any closures to city libraries in Toronto […] and the city is still going to provide daycare services,” he explains. “What we’re asking is simply for the province to subsidize the additional funding that we need to provide the 2000 additional spaces [to daycare].”
“The main thing is that we’re in a crisis right now, and we have a chronic financial problem and deficit of $470 million dollars,” Palacio points out. “In the last administration, nothing was done. But this administration has taken the fortitude to stand up to the challenge and get a review of city financing.”

As the memories of Frosh Week 2011 fade away, groups of students participating in a campus walking tour have the chance to learn about the “unofficial” side of York.
DisOrientation 2011, a week-long series of events organized by the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG) and their allied organizations, attempts to introduce students to the political history of York. The event, which serves as an alternative to traditional orientation, centres around issues of social and environmental justice.
The Radical Walking Tour, the first event, took students on a walk through campus, focusing on places of political significance at York.
“We start off by looking at the governing structure and how York is managed,” says tour guide Imran Kaderdina. York’s mission statement “speaks of having a community that values freedom, social justice, and accessible education, but those are not always upheld by the university through its actions.”
Kaderdina also explains where many of York’s building names came from.
“The buildings are often named the way they are because of donations, which come with strings [attached] that many students don’t know about,” he says.
Participants ranged from students to faculty to community members.
“It’s a pretty diverse group,” says Aruna Boodram, volunteer and programming coordinator at OPIRG York. “I’d say it’s for people who want to learn more about the issues happening around their community and around the world.”
Viola Huang immersed herself in DisOrientation activities all week—including the walking tour and a screening of Slingshot Hip Hop, a film presented by the Toronto Palestine Film Festival—and hopes other students will show more interest in politics.
“I can understand this indifference to a certain degree when I think of all the busy schedules students have here,” says Huang. “I think it is pivotal for students themselves to get engaged in politics, to know what’s going on, and to educate themselves.”
Kaderdina also believes it is important for students to be engaged in campus politics.
“I think it’s impossible for students to stay politically neutral,” says Kaderdina. “If the students aren’t engaging with the university, they are essentially supporting the status quo.”
DisOrientation events—which include workshops, film screenings, and a free concert—are being held every day until October 1.
Forthcoming are a workshop on the decriminalization of sex work, a discussion on Canadian immigration, and a workshop on alternative media.

Almost a month after it was taken down by York management for “health and sanitary reasons” a new Goddess of Democracy statue may soon see the light of day.
The York University Student Centre (YUSC) has allocated a spot for the new statue—which commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre in China—near the Treats Coffee Emporium located in the Student Centre.
Design plans are currently being developed by Bruce Parsons, fine arts professor at York.
“I’m working on six or seven drawings right now,” Parsons reveals. Once done, he says, the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC) will decide on the best one before a design plan is reviewed and approved by the Student Centre.
The height of the statue, Parsons adds, will depend on cost. Bronze, the preferred material, costs more than alternatives like aluminum. Though there are cheaper and quicker alternatives, he feels they will not be a creative, long-lasting solution.
Cheuk Kwan of the TADC is hoping a bronze statue will be approved.
“The Goddess of Democracy is the most symbolic icon of the Tiananmen Massacre,” he says. “Thus, it must be both prominent and identical to the original, both conditions laid down by the TADC to emphasize the statue’s historical significance. It can’t just be any art piece [or] abstract statue of remembrance.”
Parsons estimates construction may take up to six months.

If there is anything to remember about the Nas concert at York, it’s that Nas never disappoints—and when he does, he makes up for it.
Nas was initially a no-show due to illness at the Yorkfest concert scheduled for September 21. This was not much of a surprise to some York students.
“I was actually expecting him not to come,” says first-year biochemistry student Ali Khan. “This man is a legend. He is like the walking Jesus of New York, and [if he doesn’t] show up in Toronto and specifically at York University […] you can expect that.”
Regardless, Khan and other students went to the concert on Wednesday to see other artists, including Shawn Desman and Danny Fernandes.
When it was announced that Nas would be unable to perform, many students began to leave, recalls Zuha Vance, first-year biomedical student.
“The organizers informed us that Nas wasn’t coming, and everyone left,” she says. “Like ‘screw that’ […] it [was] raining.”
The following day, Nas tweeted “#Yorku sorry about yesterday, I was ill. BUT Fri 23 Sept I will def be there at #Rexall @yorkfest2011 @YFSlocal68” informing followers of his intention to hold a “Redemption” concert.
Despite the initial fall-through, the York Federation of Students (YFS), which organized the concert event, was determined to get Nas to perform at York.
“We had to make sure those students got to see Nas,” explains Monirul Pathan, vp campus life. “Within roughly 13 hours, we did a lot of concert class talks, and making sure the word went out
[…] we had to manage space, security, and venue. It was quite hectic.”
Almost 3,000 people attended the make-up concert.
As student Khan puts it, the concert itself was “insane”.
“He is a legend; you got a legend.”

Despite being over 20 kilometres apart, York and Ryerson University have entered into a partnership this fall to exchange grad school students for select studies.
The Reciprocal Interdisciplinary Studies Opportunity will allow York’s Osgoode Hall Law School students to take courses at the Yeates School of Graduate Studies at Ryerson, and vice-versa.
The exchange—which will combine York’s legal expertise and Ryerson’s applied education—will be launching this fall semester. A limited number of students each semester will be allowed to enrol in courses at the host university, but will pay tuition to their home university.
Though the courses are complementary, Ronda Bessner, assistant dean of the JD Program at Osgoode, encourages students to take advantage of the opportunity and the expertise of the partner university.
“A maximum of five students [from each institution] each semester from Osgoode and from Ryerson-Yeates will be permitted to enrol in designated courses,” she notes.
Selected students will be allowed to register for up to one full year or two half-year courses from a list and will get transfer credits based on a “pass” or “fail” on their transcript.
Osgoode students are impressed by the new exchange and commend the positive addition.
“Given that a law degree is so transferable, it definitely makes sense to give students access to some other areas of study that are likely to have some crossover with law,” says first-year law student Laura Fraser.
However, she doesn’t think commuting downtown is practical for her.
“I can’t see myself enrolling in Ryerson courses just because of the proximity issue, “ Fraser says. “Being at York all day, I don’t know how feasible it would be to commute all the way downtown for a single credit.”

The Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O) released a report card last week grading each party based on promises and platforms, giving the New Democrat Party (NDP) the highest grade of B+ overall. The NDP took top marks for its promises on tuition fees, student debt, funding, and research.
The Liberal party, however, maintains that the attractive planks of the NDP platform have not been properly accounted for.
According to a media release sent out on September 26, the Liberals state that “according to the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the NDP have promised that, if elected, they will raise the per-student funding to more than the national average. That’s a $1-billion promise. Every year. But in the costing document the NDP released yesterday, there wasn’t a single penny set aside to back up that promise.”

Chairperson for the CFS-O Sandy Husdon, however, points out that all parties have made unfounded promises, and that this doesn’t change the NDP’s grade on the report.
“What the NDP stated to us when they made that promise was that, if elected, they would talk to each of the institutions about what kind of funding shortfall they have and what kind of funding they need and to develop a framework to get that money to the institutions,” she says.
Overall, Hudson says the goal of the CFS-O report cards are to “boil down […] what the crux of these parties really are.”
“We think it’s really important for students to know how the election will be affecting them, and what kinds of things can and might change as a result of the election.”

She could blame her name, her first name. Eke.
No one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.
What parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.
Room 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.
From the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.
The campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.
Her pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off.  Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.
She heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”
“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”
“No, she never goes anywhere.”
“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”
“Did you notice in English lecture…?”
Eke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.
“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.
She blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.
During her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.
“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.
“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”
At six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.
His arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.
Eke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.
Joining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.
But this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.
“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.
With her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.
“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.
Her hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.
Knock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.
The door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.
“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”
“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.
“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.
“Do I know you, girl?” he said.
She grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.

Cozy contentment seeps through the night as cars slosh along the slick streets. Mom sits at the dining room table with a phone pressed to one of her large ears. She runs through a list of birthday guests, talking loudly in her overexcited Filipino way. The warm wind flutters the blinds and the smell of cassava cake drifts under my nose. The TV blares from the living room. My eight-year-old sister Naomi—Ate, meaning big sister in Tagalog—makes arts and crafts upstairs. I play with my sister Jillian, who will turn three tomorrow, May 20. I will turn seven in October.
Together, we created a game we call “Rocketship.” I lie on my back with my arms and legs in the air, bent at strange angles, like a dead beetle. Jill clambers onto my shins, pressing her feet against mine and holding my hands for balance. Her long, thick hair tickles my arms. Her small hands are squishy and her brown eyes are bright.
“One, two, three!” I say, and catapult her off of me onto the green and white linoleum. She lands clumsily on her bum.
“Again!” Jill beams, her teeny teeth gleaming. She climbs onto the launch pad and prepares for blast off. I count.
“It should be backwards,” she says matter-of-factly.
“Yeah, okay. But that means you should be backwards, too,” I say. This time I hold her feet and she holds mine. “Ready? Three, two, one!”
This repeats for a while, but then Mom’s patience runs out. She slams her hand over the receiver and turns to us, her sleek black hair flying.
“Kezia! Es-stop making noise! I am on da pone! Go up stair!”
“Okay Mommy. Cuddle time for-a-miiiiNUTE!” Jill sings, throwing her arms around Mom.
“Sandwich!” I screech, falling on top of Jill. I poke the mole in Mom’s eyebrow. Mom pats us both.
“Now go get ready por bed!” she says.
Jill and I pivot and bolt out of the kitchen, streaking through the dim living room between the huge TV and a dozing Dad. His moustache quivers. We galumph up the grey-carpeted stairs on all fours like dogs. The china cabinet rattles. We enter my room and flop onto my small bed, which creaks and groans under the weight of two bodies. Posters of puppies cover my walls. I shift aside a heap of blankies and stuffed animals and lie down in the dead beetle position. Then I fling Jill off my legs and she soars through the air before she lands on her knees at the foot of my bed. She throws her hands out in front of her, her face dangerously close to the rails. My purple Doodle Bear fixes her with its button-eyed stare.
“Wait!” I say. I place a pillow beside my bear, against the white bars that almost smashed her face. “Now you have a target.”
This time, the rocketship lands on the landing pad. We giggle and squeal with delight.
“ES-STOP ES-SCREAMING!” Mom yells from downstairs. We ignore her and continue our game. Jill climbs onto my legs again. This time, I hurl her off of me as hard as I can.
Time slows down.
The pillow shifts.
And then red spurts everywhere.
I lock eyes with Jill, her sweet face pale and contorted and covered in blood. Her dark hair sticks to her cheeks, tangled. My eyes bulge. An infinite second of stunned silence stretches on.
Suddenly, Ate stomps out of her room, a foam slipper in one hand. She throws out her chest importantly and irritably pouts out her lower lip.
“Will you guys be qui—MOM!” Her eyebrows shoot up higher the longer she holds the word. I wait, frozen.
Mom is already in the doorway, her eyebrows contracted and her eyes wide and worried. Her eyes sweep over the scene, over the blood on my sheets, on my clothes, on my pillows. Blood gushes from a gap in Jill’s mouth where three of her top front teeth had been. Tears form in Mom’s eyes as she grips fistfuls of her hair and screams. She steers Jill out of the room. As if I’m sleepwalking, I shuffle down the hall after them. Dad strides into the bathroom to help clean Jill up.
My vision blackens and blurs as I watch the sink water turn pink. Mom lets out high-pitched, hysterical sobs. Her hands tremble as she moves around the cramped bathroom. Jill fidgets. Dad keeps his calloused brown hands steady as he slumps over Jill.
He wipes the smears of red from Jill’s face and puts rolls of gauze in her mouth. Dad’s eyes are weary and his curly hair has lost its shine. Jill finally starts to cry. The gauze gives her squirrel cheeks. Dad murmurs to Jill and pets her hair.
“I kanat beleeb it. It’s nine o’clock at night and we’re going to da hospital,” Mom rages to Dad.
I hobble back to my room and sit on the edge of my bed, dizzy and clammy and shaking. Mom follows me. She screams and scolds with unintelligible words, and I cower. Tears slip silently down my cheeks. Flecks of red splotch my Doodle Bear, complementing the blue scribbles.
For a long time afterwards, the three black X’s in Jill’s gums haunt me every time she smiles. The stitches float in the darkness behind my eyelids, disembodied, glowing white.

For those who missed it, on February 18 there was a shooting in the York community. A shot was fired inside an apartment residence on Assiniboine Road, and fortunately, the grad student inside was unharmed.
What bothers me is the lack of security we have in our community. For a campus of almost 65,000—a population big enough to rival small towns—we don’t have a police department on site.
Yorkton, a tiny city located in east-central Saskatchewan with a population of roughly 17,200, has a better source of protection than students here; they have the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) nearby. It’s honestly surprising that York doesn’t have a detachment of Toronto police, given our notoriously problematic location near Jane and Finch.
With an active police force on campus, we would surely see a dip in crime. I acknowledge that we have the York security patrolling the entire community alone, but they cannot do this alone. With the added extension site of Toronto police, they would offer far more presence to our community.
Let’s face it, we’re basically a city with a shopping mall, but even in my hometown of Mississauga, we have a police station—it’s located within the shopping centre of Meadowvale. Then there’s another two in the area to boot. So why can’t our community benefit from another form of protection?
We have the emergency towers dotting the campus and York security, and if we don’t have Batman or any similar vigilante, we should most definitely have a Toronto police branch on site.
I don’t fear many things, but as an individual incapable of stopping bullets with my face, I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m going to fear a person with a 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Unless York offers bulletproof vests to students with our tuition, I regretfully fear that without vigilantes or armed security, our rather large community will continue to suffer through its ongoing trend of crime.

Louis realized he was staring. His gaze drifted through the bent spider web in the windshield, down the hood, and off into the twinkling embers on the plains below. Over the lake, another anvil flickered silently and the sun seemed to shear off the air itself. Calvin was down there, watching the coverage of his dad on TV. Louis had done a bad thing and now his son and the rest of the city were learning of it in high definition, with surround sound. Far away, his story was
interrupting sitcoms.
“Now what?” he said, for the sound of it. Aluminum and iron, injectors and water pumps, all ticked and cooled beneath deep, dented green. Nothing. Nothing to say, nothing worth saying. He sat and wondered in his car on that tarmac ledge between the caves of damp coniferous and the vast potential below. He couldn’t stay here; he was prey. He’d ditched a chopper, for Christ’s sake. No one ditched the chopper.
The road hugged the edge of the escarpment, damming up the heavy moss of the forest. The moaning trees twisted in the grip of the cold front, pushing the storms east. A dandelion seed barrelled in through the window and settled on the dashboard. It probably wanted an autograph.
Soon he realized that he needed to piss. He might have held it all day—he hadn’t been paying attention. He slithered from the car, his cartilage creaking as the rear strut did. The sheet metal there deflected inwards to conjure police-issue ram bars. He tried to cross the wire fence that girdled the ditch but it was loose with age and wavered as he stood
on it. He imagined falling and shooting himself and the image brought hints of irony to his mouth.
He’d never owned a pistol, and he was wary of it. He also noted that wedging it in the front of his pants was probably not helping, but it stayed.
Leaping, he pushed his foot into the post and it crumbled under his soles. He started to swear then hit the ground hard. Finishing the curse and tossing in several others, he brushed the mud and needles from his hands, revealing the fine wisps of scarlet meteors across the butt of his palm. The throbbing pain along his side persisted but he repressed it, breathing deep to pull in the howl of the wind and chill the blood that wept from his hand, stigmata of an unconvincing Christ.
He moved into the forest until the rush of it surrounded him. If the car were spotted, he at least wouldn’t be caught with his fly down. By now, the warmth of his body had begun to flow back into the grip of the pistol and the metal seemed to fuse with skin until he pulled it out to avoid shooting his dick off.
As the sodden evening shivered, he loitered. The smells of exhaust, gunsmoke, and blood were gone from his nose but they were dusted across his brain. And suddenly he was strolling in the woods.
Sitting on a dry log, he thought about smiling and stared some more. The storm had saved him
earlier. Lucky break. Now the humid air chilled him and drew his thoughts to warmer places. He thought about shooting himself, for prudence’s sake. There wasn’t really a choice but he held up the gun anyway, taking it in his hand and cycling the action. The unused bullet flew silently into the moss. As he levelled the sights, the setting sun risked a glance through the ragged clouds and dripping leaves, igniting the crooked birch and forging little diamonds on its paper dress. Fate, babe. Bang.
There were holes in the back of the Mustang. Little ones where the patrolman had aimed. He doubted that it was protocol to open fire during high-speed pursuits, but the holes had no comment. He had a thought and dove to the pavement to check for leaks: clear, red, green, brown. Now would be too soon—he’d made it this far and he wasn’t done yet. Satisfied, he wiped the oily road water from his palms and lowered himself back into the leather bucket seat.
“You’re still with me, right?” He was talking to a car. The breeze sent the little fluff of dandelion flying out the window. Some sign.
Calvin had called the Mustang Stacy. He realized again that he hadn’t said goodbye. He muttered something under his breath that shook past a lump.
In time he took a breath and placed his hand on the key and turned. The eight cylinders grunted to life. She was ready. He was ready. Easing out the clutch, he headed off to die. 

 
 
 
spotted on campus • Blueberry Hill, one of York’s old eateries over yonder in York Lanes, is due to close April 30. However, loyal Blueberrians showed that they would not give up without a fight. Several supporters were seen strolling around campus wearing posters reading “Save Blueberry Hill.” What does fate hold for Blueberry Hill?

Debate boils down to quantity versus quality

According to a survey, most students would rather enrol in a four-year program than a three-year program.
A February 21 report released by Higher Education Strategy Associates revealed that, from a survey of at least 850 people, 94 per cent of university students agreed that they would rather study in a four-year program than a three-year program. In fact, half of those students were taking extra years to finish their studies.
Some York students, like sixth-year theatre and English student Garett Oliver, disagreed with the idea of a three-year undergraduate degree program, saying that the quality of education would only suffer as a result.
“That hasn’t really worked in the past,” he says. “They did it with high school by removing grade 13. It’s looking at it more as getting a piece of paper with your name on it saying whatever program you’re in rather than actually learning something, which should be the function of post-secondary education.”
On the other hand, several students commented in favour of a condensed three-year undergraduate program, saying they would rather jump-start their careers and save some cash on the way.
“It would be done faster. I can get out of here and start my career. I’m a musician,” says Cecile Eugene, a third-year music major. “As soon as I’m done, I can get on the road and tour. But because it’s a four-year program, I have to stay here for four years instead of three. Plus, all these extra courses I have to take—like humanities and social science—won’t help me be a musician.”
Some students have actually seen how the three-year programs work overseas, and are quite taken to the idea. Venessa Lao, a second-year accounting student, sees the move as a good thing for students. She says that in countries like Australia, a lot of her friends finish their studies abroad in three years.
 “It would be a benefit for students financially,” she says. “I have friends who are basically taking loans that they have to pay off the minute they graduate.” 
But who ended up with the harder job?

President Mamdouh Shoukri swapped his suit and tie for a letterman jacket and backpack, joining the throngs of students on the Square One GO bus to York. This day marked York’s—and Canada’s—first-ever President for a Day event.
The lucky York student who won a day in Shoukri’s presidential seat is Rabia Sajun, a third-year biochemistry and education student whose winning contest entry included three ideas for improving student life: expanding Steacie Library, reducing class sizes, and enhancing campus safety.
“It’s been super busy,” Sajun describes her day. “I’ve been in a lot of meetings. I met vp Rob Tiffin about disability. I’m interested in accessibility services for all students. I met vp Brewer about campus safety.”
She also talked to vp academic and provost Patrick Monahan about class sizes, and about improving student engagement in classrooms.
While Sajun sat through several meetings, Shoukri spent his day in a lecture on molecular biology and in a physics lab. Sajun serves as the co-president of the Chemistry Society, and Shoukri sat in for her office hours, selling students old lecture notes and professor-approved sample copies of old tests for $15 a packet.
“I’ve had a chance to talk to students there, learn more about the university and about their concerns,” he says.
The one negative of the day for Shoukri, however, was when he visited a very crowded Student Centre for lunch. The lineup for the microwaves especially dismayed him.
“I wouldn’t do that if I was a student. I’d give up on warm food,” he remarks. “To be honest, maybe building a new Student Centre will take time, but doing something about the microwaves should not.”
For Shoukri, the event was a way of engaging with the student population, something that he didn’t expect would happen on such a high level.
“Fact is, I walk through campus all the time and talk to lot of students,” says Shoukri. “But they want to talk to me more now, probably because I’m not wearing a suit, I’m wearing this—” he gestured to his letterman jacket—“They’re probably more comfortable seeing me trying to reach out to them.”
Sajun highly approves of the President for a Day campaign and believes it should be a recurring event.
“I think this idea was a really interesting experience to get a behind-the-scenes look into what is involved in implementing something,” she says. “The admin is doing its best to better student life, and this gives students a better behind-the-scenes look.”

The world-famous TEDx talks are about to begin their second round at York.
The Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED) Conference is set to take place March 10 at York’s Glendon campus.
The talks are part of a number of globally-occurring conferences that are owned by the private not-for-profit Sapling Foundation, which began in 1984 and aims at addressing a number of issues within science and culture.
“There’s been a terrific increase in interest this year,” says Ross McMillan, one of the co-curators of the event.
McMillan adds that the event has already received many more applications from students eager to participate in the talks than the 100 spots available.
Some of the speakers set to present at York include a student talking about her research on domestic violence and aboriginal women, and a York vice-president presenting his take on how universities are changing to meet the demands of the future. Past presenters in the talks include figures such as Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, though they were not at York campus.
All speeches fall within the overall theme of this year’s conference, “Impact Matters.” Speakers are encouraged to highlight their stories about making differences in their communities.
Ross calls the event a “one day symposium,” where participants will spend the entire day listening to the twelve speakers and watching two performances.
“It’s really a cross-section of the York community,” says McMillan, who notes that organizers are looking to cultivate an audience from all walks of life that can not only attend, but also engage in talks with other participants who they would not normally interact with.
The last day to send in an application is February 29. For those unable to attend in person, the event will also be streamed online. 
CUPE accuses employer of continuing to ask for concessions from union

Four months of negotiations and a total of 34 agreements.
That’s the number of motions that have been agreed upon by York management and the Canadian Union Public Employees (CUPE) local 3903, but the negotiations have reached a turning point with about 120 proposals still remaining on the table.
CUPE 3903 has made the first step towards putting the union in a legal strike position by filling for conciliation with the Ontario Ministry of Labour on February 15, asking for a government-appointed conciliator—or third-party individual—to help facilitate and attempt to enable the two sides to reach an agreement.
While the union emphasizes that it hopes to reach an agreement with the university through the conciliation process, it is also lashing out against the university, stating in a website update that “given the Employer’s reluctance to recognize our members’ needs and their unwillingness to bargain on a proposal-by-proposal basis thus far, the Union has no choice but to begin preparations to hold a strike mandate vote and set a bargaining deadline.”
Karen Walker, chair of CUPE 3903, explains that conciliation is the step before holding a strike mandate vote, which would determine if the Local will strike.
A strike or lockout of the Local, however, can only occur 31 days after the conciliation process has begun, which should be starting in the coming days.
Walker also explains that the university has failed to address each proposal made by the Local, and is instead offering a total compensation package of two per cent, encouraging the Local to accept the package and divvy up the money at their discretion.
While Walker notes that in past years CUPE has received a package of five per cent and that initial offers made by the university are usually low, her concern is that most of the items that have been negotiated upon thus far have been inconsequential.
Walker says that while the Local has given hundreds of proposals to the employer, the employer has only made six counter-proposals to the original package and are unwilling to budge on many of the important ones, including refusing to move on the “sign back deadlines,” where the Local is contesting the new deadlines given to teaching assistants to sign back their contact.
“Such deadlines are a not-so-subtle attempt to place the blame on us for the fact that they were late with September pay for 1,400 members […] despite the fact many of these contracts were signed in June and July!” states the update.
Walker says the majority of proposals agreed upon thus far have been items proposed by the university and accepted by the employer, not vice versa. For her, the actions of the university are impeding upon the negotiation process causing no agreements on key proposals.
“Without this leverage, we are concerned that the Employer will continue to stall through conciliation, talking in circles while our contracts continue to be eroded by inflation,” states the update. “Rather, the Employer’s stance remains unchanged: reduce your demands to fi t within our financial mandate and maybe then we can talk on some of these issues,” it continues.
Robert Castle, senior advisor to vp fi nance and administration, is adamant that the university is doing everything in its power to reach an agreement with the union and says that negotiations thus far have been positive.
“We’ve had good work done with the union,” he says.
Castle notes that the university received over 170 proposals from the union in November of last year, so it is only reasonable that the process is taking time.
“There’s been a lot of work done through our negotiations […] it’s hard to see how we’re not taking this situation seriously,” he says.
Castle also says the university is pleased to go into the conciliation process.
“We’re perfectly happy going into conciliation and we don’t see the conciliator as leveraging for either party. It’s a third party independent voice to help us to get to an agreement,” he says, adding that the university does in fact expect a detailed review and discussion of all the proposals.
Once a conciliator is appointed by the Ministry, the individual will reach out to both parties to continue with the negotiation process. Nevertheless, CUPE says that having a strike mandate does not mean that the union will strike.

2017-01-30,York,China,"In the first century AD, Soranus, a Roman physician, prescribed tragedy for his manic patients and comedy for those who were depressed. The ancient Greeks considered libraries to be “healing places of the soul.”
Literature is a worldwide phenomenon that developed differently over time and regions, but there is one concept that unifies them all—the belief in the power of words and poetry to treat and heal people.
Aristotle discussed the concepts of using poetry for both insight and catharsis, referring to its ability to condense and state things that we usually would not speak of in daily conversation. Sigmund Freud wrote: “Not I, but the poet discovered the unconscious.”
He was a keen advocate of symbolism, which is used quite widely in poetry and its ability to refer to the much more abstract concepts of thought in an almost tangible form.
Poetry is still being used as an effective tool in cognitive therapy for helping patients cope with their psychological issues, having been found to be effective in treating elderly people who suffer from dementia.
In an article published in the Journal of Poetry Therapy, Marvin Wexler found that in older populations, memorization of poetry has been shown to prevent dementia and slow down the onset of Alzheimer’s.
Rhymes and jingles are more effective because their cadence is easier for the elderly to pick out and remember. In nursing homes, the act of regularly reading poetry to seniors and having them participate in rhymes and songs generally had a positive influence on subjects who exhibited symptoms of mental illness.
Writing poetry from the point of view of a person’s mental illness as if it were a person allows them to view their depressogenic beliefs in a more detached manner. This is not to say that poetry in and of itself is enough to aid in complete healing and full recovery, but rather that it promotes better mental health.
Poetry also helps the elderly recall past experiences, in turn helping them with memory and integration.
For a person with Asperger’s Syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder, who is more of a visual thinker, poetry can be used to help them visualize communicative issues through metaphors. This helps them understand and act upon matters that they can improve on.
Many of us memorized poems in our early years and for good reason: poetry has been shown to improve children’s reading capabilities, memorization abilities, development of potential for self-expression, as well as an understanding of rhythm and bring about emotional intelligence.
Poetry provides the antidote to a culture that is constantly racing against time and discarding anything found to not be useful. At a time where the aged are being put in nursing homes and left behind, it serves as a soothing balm in its need to be slowly read in order to be absorbed and understood, its deep philosophical approach to life and its relevance to the vast array of emotions these elderly have experienced throughout their lifetime.
“When I read poetry it unlocks a different part of my brain. The reason being is that I have to look within to understand what the words mean,” says Fatema Ali, a third-year biology student. Poetry can help make logical and figurative connections, forcing them to actively think, which may help with memory disorders and impaired reasoning.
Some say that poetry is now becoming extinct in a culture where modern technology is being consumed at an increasing rate. But if one looks at the other side of the coin, the influx of technology, especially mass communication and social media, has greatly expanded the extent to which poetry can be shared and read. Social networking sites such as Tumblr and Instagram have many accounts completely dedicated to poetry. In a way, social media is both the problem and the answer, as it is now much easier to access poetry online and virtually anywhere.
The beauty of poetry as a promoter of mental health stems from its volatile nature. It can be imbibed and etched into one’s memory, yet developed and produced in a simple form by someone who desires to create it. It can also function as a powerful symbol through metaphors and conveys stories in its own unique form. 
 
When you step into an art show, it’s like stepping into another world.
That’s what Marcia Villeneuve evokes with her art show Surreal Spaces. Recipient of the 2016 Willowdale Group of Artists Painting Award, which is awarded to distinguished upper-year visual arts students at York, Villeneuve is adept in creating beautiful stories through paint.
Stepping into The Gales Gallery, one isn’t quite sure what to feel as the installations are disorienting. As visitors enter the room and move from art piece to art piece, Villeneuve’s brilliance becomes evident as the space transports visitors from reality into a delightfully surreal world.
At first glance, the magical aura of Surreal Spaces appears to be contradictory to the minimalist style of Villeneuve’s art. The exhibit features only a few paintings slapped up onto blank white walls. Surrealist artists typically make use of unexpected juxtapositions, surprising elements and shocking reworkings of mundane objects.
Villeneuve cleverly achieves the contradiction between philosophy and dream, and expectation and reality through the critical engagement of space.
For Villeneuve, surrealism takes on a different meaning, symbolizing what is not normal.
“I like to put objects in a space that doesn’t make sense or where they don’t really belong there,” says Villeneuve.
“Like with all the dark images, giving them properties that they wouldn’t normally have. You’d never see a rainbow tree that’s glowing at night.”
“I get most excited about painting things that look realistic but have a surreal element,” shares Villeneuve. She sparks surrealist interest by playing with what visitors expect to experience when they enter Surreal Spaces versus what it is, resulting in a duality of transformation.
The stripped-down style of the exhibition forces visitors to engage more intimately with each work. The brushstrokes, colour scheme and subject choice become emphasized in the cumulative masterpiece that is Surreal Spaces.
Even though all the paintings share a realistic theme, no two are alike. Every painting is unique because of its complex colour patterns and where it takes you. Each painting tells its own story, but depending on the eye of the beholder, that story changes.
The three paintings all together, referred to by Villeneuve as a triptych, is a final realization of months of hard work.
“This triptych represents the places I call home. My entire life I have been moving back and forth between Toronto and North Bay. While they’re very different spaces, they have some similarities, including very similar beaches, so I chose to connect these two cities with an image of a beach in the centre panel.
“I wanted to add a surreal element by making the spaces look connected as a whole while also playing with the different times of day,” said Villanueva.
Surreal Spaces ran until Thursday, January 26, but those unable to experience the exhibit in person can visit Villeneuve’s website for an online gallery. 
 
Some families bond over sports, some over movies. But one thing that is known to bring people together is food. Whether homemade or takeout, dining has a way to fill our stomach with grub, our hands with new foods and our memories with new experiences.
That’s where Tinuno restaurant hopes to thrive.
Hailing from the northwestern Luzon region in the Philippines, Gerald Aquintey, co-owner of the restaurant, says the name Tinuno came from its direct translation from his native language of Ilocano, meaning grilled.
Most Filipino restaurants are usually takeaway, while Tinuno encourages customers to dine in because of their unique eating style called Boodle Fight.
Boodle Fight involves using your bare hands to eat food spread out on banana leaves. It has roots from the Filipino military, as utensils were not offered to their soldiers during Boodle Fights. Water jugs were placed on each sides of the banana leaves spread for soldiers to use to wash their hands before and after their meal. The term fight in the word indicates that every man is for himself during the feast, which means that you try to eat as much as you can before the food runs out.
The spread includes white rice, grilled foods and fruits piled on top of a banana leaf. It is usually set up on a long table where everyone has a space and a chance to eat as much as possible. Filipino soldiers do not start eating until they are signalled to do so.
However, in Tinuno, the setting is much calmer and relaxed. Once you enter, you are greeted with a smile and are shown to a table with banana leaves spread out. You will not be forced to eat with your hands, however you are encouraged to do so. There is no signal to follow, and people do not fight each other for the food. Tinuno simply follows customary restaurant protocol where waiters bring your food to your table and place it decoratively.
The restaurant’s setting also successfully invites you in with its historical pictures of Filipino elders, Filipino traditional clothing, a definition of Boodle Fight and soldiers actually eating in Boodle Fight style.
Interestingly enough, the restaurant was actually a laundromat before its Boodle Fight.
“All the laundry started to break down, so we decided to convert it into a restaurant because it would have cost the same amount of money for us to replace the equipment,” says Aquintey.
“The Boodle Fight was actually accidental. It wasn’t supposed to be part of the business; we were supposed to be just a take-out place. Then, a couple of [customers] requested to do Boodle here, so we did that for them, and from there, it just got big.”
The combination of grilled food and the Boodle Fight resulted in quite a successful restaurant.
“The Filipino [student association at York] has come here a couple of times already,”says Aquintey.
“So have [the Filipino student associations from] Ryerson and U of T.”
Quickly gaining popularity, Tinuno was able to expand their space.
“We took over one of the rooms in the second floor. We might even take over the whole building, we’ll just see how it goes,” says Aquintey.
With their popularity, they were also invited to be one of the food vendors for the ASEAN Festival at Ryerson, an event celebrating Southeast Asian cultures, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Laos and Thailand. 
Every year since 2010, Bell Canada hosts a campaign with the primary goal of creating a conversation about mental health in Canada.
In 2012, 2.8 million Canadians over the age of 15 reported symptoms consistent with one or more mental health illnesses or substance use disorders, according to Statistics Canada.
Many who live with mental illnesses are not vocal about their conditions because of the stigma they fear they may face.
The Bell Let’s Talk campaign was created with these notions in mind, and aims to educate the public on the magnitude of the problem and how they can become active listeners and supporters.
Bell will donate 5 cents towards mental health initiatives for every text, tweet or Instagram post that includes the hashtag #BellLetsTalk and for every view of their official Facebook videos. People can also participate through Snapchat by using the Bell Let’s Talk geofilter.
All proceeds are donated to various relevant organizations within Canada.
“I feel like Bell Let’s Talk is more of a means to publicize than actually raising awareness. I had heard of a thing called Bell Let’s Talk but had no idea what it meant or wanted to achieve. The donation part might be legitimate but in my opinion, it isn’t effectively named. The aim of trends is to educate people who were unaware of the issue. The “ALS Ice Bucket Challenge” effectively describes what it sets out to do, whilst also raising awareness. When you hear about it, you’re curious and want to find out what it is. When you hear Bell Let’s Talk, the first thing you think is that it’s probably another one of Bell’s events.” ? Samandeep Singh | 20 | Software Engineering
“It is important to realize that mental health is every bit as important as physical health. The isolation of mental illnesses from physical conditions like having the flu only serves to perpetuate the notion that people should be ashamed for wanting to care for their brain—their entire body’s command centre. Influential organizations should make further attempts to emulate the #BellLetsTalk campaign that fights to end the stigma while raising millions for important and necessary research.”  ? Yun Lin | 21 | Human Rights and Equity Studies
“Bell Let’s Talk brings awareness to issues that people don’t take time to address in their daily lives. We become so engulfed in our schedules, sculpting that perfect life, that we become lost in our stress and anxieties. We forget to take care of ourselves and take a minute to reflect and acknowledge what causes the stress in our lives and what affects our mental health. Often we suffer in silence and become unknown to those around us. It is important to talk to someone. Make yourself heard and reach out for help. I think that the Bell Let’s Talk campaign helps drive these principles home.” ? Suman Dhillon | 21 | English and History
“Raising money for small organizations, or well-known organizations, doesn’t provide enough funding for it to make a positive impact. Focusing on one day does raise a type of awareness, but it just serves to promote Bell as a company. The marketing strategy and distribution could be managed [more efficiently] to provide a better mental health awareness day.” ? Chris Muradyan | 20 | Administrative Studies 
 
The provincial government has introduced a ban on the use of arbitrary carding, also known as street checks, by police in Ontario.
The ban, which took effect on January 1, will prevent Toronto police from collecting personal information from anyone who is not under investigation.
Police will still have access to historic data, however, and have defended the practice, stating that database-logged information could help identify possible witnesses or suspects in future investigations.
This has faced controversy over claims that much of the data would now be classified as having been obtained illegally.
Critics believe carding violates Section 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states anyone detained by police has the right to “instruct counsel without delay.”
Often, people are not informed of this right by police and not aware that they are not obligated to provide personal details if not under arrest or investigation.
Ontario’s Community and Safety Correctional Services Minister Kevin Flynn has stated the regulation was drafted following a consultation with the public on how to improve police interaction.
“These new rules protect the rights of people who are not under investigation while also laying the foundation for more positive, trusting and respectful relationships between police and the public,” said Flynn to the CBC.
Along with Flynn, Ontario’s Anti-Racism and Children and Youth Services Minister Michael Coteau believes the ban will prevent systemic racism within the justice system.
Police are now banned from carding anyone for being present in an area with high crime rates nor due to racial bias.
According to a report by the Toronto Star, 25 per cent of the carding data between 2008 and 2011 related to young black men, even though only 8.3 per cent of Toronto’s population is black.
The report also found that within 72 different patrol zones, the number of young black men carded exceeded the number of young black men living in those locations.
Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair believes the reason for this is that carding statistics apply to both residents and people simply present within those areas.
Sandy Hudson, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Toronto, does not believe the ban is enough to prevent racial profiling.
“Where these rules apply—and where they don’t—doesn’t change anything about carding. A police officer can always say they are investigating a particular crime,” she told the CBC.
Police are still able to gather personal information during routine traffic stops, when someone is being arrested, detained or when a search warrant is executed. 
 
Mental illnesses cannot be perfectly encapsulated in words. Every breath is a cliffhanger. Not knowing what is causing these emotions is like being lost without a map. The ground is like sand, shifting under each step, ready to give way. You’re taking shots in the dark, looking for solutions anywhere—through anything. But treatment is tentative and you just want the feeling to stop. The feeling that it is always all or nothing. It is physically and mentally draining and it gets easier to sink and shatter under the weight that is holding you down, pulling you down.
There are some illnesses you cannot see, and often with mental illness, there is no clear visible ailment. Due to this lack of perception of immediate and physical harm, there is a stark contrast that exists between the care, treatment and understanding that is applied to mental as opposed to physical illness. There are a number of reasons why individuals may suffer with their mental health and a number of treatments available to those seeking relief. However, mental illness and mental distress extends over a wide variety of people.
As the number of those suffering from mental health problems continues to grow, the introduction of therapy animals, or animal-assisted therapy, progressively integrates itself into the field of mental health.
Therapy animals are used in a number of settings, from hospitals to schools and even in the home.
In a therapeutic context, animals may help provide and induce comfort and companionship for people who may feel scared, overwhelmed, lonely, depressed, experiencing PTSD, anxiety or are in pain, with few to no side effects.
Petting an animal can release hormones and endorphins in your body, such as oxytocin and serotonin, which have a calming effect, helping to lower blood pressure and stress levels. People want to connect with other living things, and human-animal interaction is a form of nonjudgmental social support.
This form of treatment alone could be enough for some people experiencing new symptoms of a mental health problem that they wish to combat, or it can reduce the amount of medications an individual coping with mental illness may need.
Although therapy pets are most commonly dogs, almost any animal can be considered an emotional support animal and registered. Whether through pet ownership or registration of a certified service animal, these relationships may offer an antidote to the plethora of symptoms that present themselves. From rabbit to guinea pig, hedgehog to cat or horse to parrot, this form of therapy is an inclusive approach that fosters connections and serves to benefit individuals both physically and emotionally.
Animal companionship is often viewed as an informal source of comfort and relief, however, it is time to credit this relationship for all that it is worth. Animal-assisted therapy is an undervalued form of treatment because of its informal nature and simplicity. While the list of benefits for this alternative treatment is ever-growing, the list of side effects that are common in pharmaceutical drugs continue to persist. If there is a potential for hope and less invasive and threatening treatment options, let it exist. 

At one point or another, almost everyone has been in “the zone.” It’s a great feeling. Everything you do clicks: your awareness sharpens and your movements become natural—free-flowing, yet precise. You feel unstoppable. In the field of positive psychology, this is what is known as a flow state.
When implemented via meditation, it is a way to take your craft to the next level.
First introduced by Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his exploration of the phenomenon in Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, a flow state is most easily described as a completely focused state. Much like how a musician focuses on only the next few notes of their intricate technical piece, or how a painter loses themselves in the blending of their colours, the key to enter flow is to focus on nothing else but the immediate task at hand.
Oftentimes, flow states are achieved when the challenge of the task aligns perfectly with one’s current skill level.
Some keystone features of flow states include a loss of reflective self-consciousness, a sense of personal control, deep harmony and peace with the environment. Studies also show that the promotion of such mind states lead to lower levels of depression and anxiety.
However, prospective artists need not dive into a creative frenzy to enjoy these benefits themselves. At the heart of the flow state is actually one of the oldest and most empowering practices known to man: what is known in Buddhism as mindfulness meditation.
One of the central motivations behind Csikszentmihalyi’s research was the question of what exactly inspires long-lasting happiness. It wasn’t money or possessions, nor was it dependent on relationships. It was being in flow, and the longer you find yourself in this state, he concluded, the happier you are. In essence, this is the practice of mindfulness meditation: keen interest in your immediate here and now. Dancing, acting, painting and many other forms of art inspire healthy daily and mental patterns.
It should come as no surprise that positive psychology research also finds a direct correlation between a daily practice of meditation and improved artistic capability—promoting a whole host of mental benefits, including: enriched relaxation, greater emotional stability and clinical aid for mental disorders such as anxiety, depression or attention deficits.
Daily meditators find that when writing, listening to music or creating art, they often lose themselves in the moment, becoming so absorbed in their work that it feels effortless, like one fluid act. This is because they have trained their mind to disconnect from their incessant stream of thinking. At its core, meditation functions to reduce irrelevant—oftentimes unwanted—thoughts by promoting internalized attention.
The next time you engage in any activity—artistic or otherwise—heighten your consciousness.
Before you know it, you will have entered into one of the most fruitful, pleasant upward spirals that will not only create some of your best work, but will also keep you in tune with your mental state.

The flags at York’s Keele and Glendon campuses were lowered to half mast last week in remembrance of Dr. David Bell, professor emeritus of environmental studies.
Dr. Bell, aged 72, died of pancreatic cancer on January 10 at the Kensington Hospice in Toronto.
Born April 14, 1944, Dr. Bell was an ardent scholar who, after attending Glendon College, went on to receive his PhD in political science from Harvard University.
After a short teaching spell at Michigan State University, Dr. Bell returned to Ontario, where he took up a teaching position at York. He served as Dean of Graduate Studies before becoming the Dean of the Faculty of Environmental Studies.
A staunch advocate of sustainability, Dr. Bell’s drive for environmental education was recognized with a number of awards throughout his lifetime—notably, the 2014 Canadian Network for Environmental Education and Communication Award and The Green Toronto Award for Leadership in Sustainability.
Marilyne Lambert-Drache, the associate vice-president international at York and former colleague of Dr. Bell’s, emphasized his passion for education in an interview with the Toronto Star.
“I saw him giving lectures two times to undergraduate students and he was an incredible communicator,” she said. 
“He radiated that passion and students were absolutely mesmerized by this tall man with a big smile and just listening to every one of his words. It was really wonderful to witness that,” she added.
In addition to his academic pursuits, Dr. Bell was an active jazz musician and also founded the women’s soccer team at York in 1984. He held the role of head coach until 1997, guiding them to an Ontario Women’s Intercollegiate Athletic Association silver medal in 1988 and a bronze in 1990.
After retiring from York, Dr. Bell went on to become the chair of the Board of Learning for a Sustainable Future, a non-profit organization dedicated to changing the Canadian education system to include sustainability education in its curriculums.
He also became chair of the Board of Directors of Parc-Downsview-Park and served as a consultant to universities, G8 summits and governments in Canada, China and Jamaica.
Dr. Bell’s family have requested that donations in his name may be made to the Wallace McCain Centre for Pancreatic Cancer through Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, or the Kensington Hospice in Toronto or Learning for a Sustainable Future.
The Learning for a Sustainable Future has established the Dr. David V.J. Bell Memorial Fund to continue his legacy in support of world change by empowering children.

This time of the year always means dreary days and longer nights. To lighten up your days during the autumn, here are some new songs sure to lift your mood. From Wyclef Jean to Dvsn, I’ve compiled a playlist that will make you ponder life, but also put you in the mood to get down and groove.
NF, “My Life”
The Michigan-based rapper NF continues to open up about his life on his newest album, Perception. The song “My Life” speaks to his sister about her substance abuse, which made it difficult to connect to her at a higher level. Nevertheless, his love for her is present as he continues to raise her up and motivate her to live a better life—all the while, taking listeners on a crisp, flowing wave over a hypnotizing and enchanting beat.
Giggs, “The Essence”
Nathaniel Thompson, famously known as Giggs, continues to produce much for the world stage. Hailing from across the pond in London, England, his roots are easily recognizable and represented in his distinct sound. “The Essence,” which comes off of his most recent mixtape, Wamp 2 Dem, follows an introspective line of thinking, expanding on the situations he’s faced, the work he had to put in, and the chance breaks that enabled him to get to the position he’s in now. The production lets his story roll easily, giving you a glimpse into his life before fame.
Clairmont The Second, “Stories”
A Toronto native based in the Weston Road area on the west side, Clairmont The Second brings a refreshing sound to the Canadian hip hop landscape. “Stories,” a track from his second album, Lil Mont from The Ave, pulls us into his hectic life. Its smooth flow over a hard beat paints a picture of the ups and downs of life—after overcoming one challenge, a new one arises.
Wyclef Jean, “Double Dutch”
No introduction needed—Wyclef Jean has blessed our audio experiences from his days with The Fugees and now to his independent projects. His most recent work, Carnival III: The Fall and Rise of a Refugee, does not falter under this reputation. The song “Double Dutch” builds on themes of survival, whether through illegal means, or by surviving the illegal acts governments impose on their populaces. The beat will bring you back to childhood with its cadence of two skipping ropes used for Double Dutch. Infused with a deeper message, you can’t help but enjoy this masterpiece.
Damian Marley, “Here We Go”
Damian Marley released his fourth solo studio album earlier this year. Despite having a bit of a gap between his last collaborative project, not to mention his last solo project, he brings forth every ounce of energy into this one, reminding us that he’s still very much in the game. “Here We Go,” the first song after “Intro” on the album Stony Hill, establishes this with a masterful blend of both production and characteristic wisdom. Using his signature style, he paints a picture of where he personally finds flaw in the music industry today and why his resurrection is very much necessary.
Sabrina Claudio ft. 6lack, “Belong to You (Remix)”
Sabrina Claudio’s most recent album About Time deals with the interlacing of time and love. She graciously includes a bonus track expanding on her original track “Belong To You,” which she remixed with the help of 6lack. While the original track tricks you into thinking she’s talking about someone else and then tying it back to herself, the remix gives the impression that love takes two. They expertly mesh their voices together in consideration of the piece’s rhythm. You realize that you can’t help but start moving—and vibing to it—effortlessly.
Jhene Aiko ft. Big Sean, “Moments”
Jhene Aiko’s most recent album Trip literally takes us through a trip through what has been going on in her life. She tells us about the present, catches up with her past, and how she looks forward to potential future ventures. This is elevated further through an intoxicated perception, as many of her songs allude to on the album. “Moments,” a collaboration with Big Sean, takes the concept of a love song with an air of honesty and relatability. With Big Sean enhancing it with his word play, all over a beat, the song is made easy on the ears—and dance moves.
Dvsn, “Mood”
The Canadian R&B duo Dvsn, comprised of Daniel Daley and Nineteen85, dropped “Mood” on September 5, which is a nod to their debut album, Sept. 5th. The song has an excellent use of diverse piano melodies and extended vocals, making you feel as though you’re falling deep into a heavy, blissful dream.

Imagine an alternative to your everyday coffee, pop, tea, or energy drink—a refreshing, sweet drink that may offer multiple health benefits—kombucha. Kombucha is a drink made from sweet black tea, fermented with yeast and a bacteria culture.
Kombucha only recently become a mainstream beverage and can be found in health-food, grocery, and some convenience stores across Canada. One Regina café even offers kombucha on tap as an alternative for those who are health-conscious.
The origin of kombucha is unknown, but it has been around for thousands of years, praised as an “immortal health elixir.” Throughout the 20th century, scientists in Russia and Germany investigated this mysterious drink after noticing that entire regions of their respective countries appeared to be immune to rising rates of cancer. The reason? Kombucha.
The drink is especially prominent in the East, including in China, Russia, and Serbia, where it is known for its health benefits. Some of these include an increase in energy, a strengthening of the immune system, improved digestion, weight loss, reduction in high blood pressure, decreased chance of heart disease, and the lowering of one’s chances of developing various cancers.
The drink is rich in antioxidants, B-vitamins, and glucaric acids, and is also credited for reducing or eliminating the symptoms of fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety.
There is, however, one element produced during the fermentation process that further sets kombucha apart from your everyday energy drink—alcohol.
Kombucha contains a small, yet measurable percentage of alcohol. A single bottle can contain an alcohol level of 0.5 to 2.5 per cent. While it may be easily sold and accessed, some demand that kombucha be registered and regulated as an alcoholic beverage, only to be sold in facilities licensed to handle alcohol. Due to this controversy—and as a measure of caution—a number of chain food stores, moreso those in the United States, will require patrons to show proof of age before allowing them to purchase it.
There is, however, a mixed reaction from those who have tasted it. Nathan Abdool, a fourth-year Kinesiology student, notes its alternative taste, and Negar Almas, a third-year Political Science student, raves about its texture. Both suggest more people should try kombucha and form their own opinions of the drink.

Dr. Avis Devine, a Schulich professor in Real Estate, was awarded the 2017 Nick Tyrell Research Prize for her recent paper. The paper, entitled “Decomposing the Value Effects of Sustainable Real Estate Investment: International Evidence.” Her co-author is Dr. Erkan Yonder, an assistant professor of Finance and Real Estate at Ozyegin University in Istanbul, Turkey, who is a co-recipient of the award.
Devine comments that she does “the majority of her research on the financial implications of green and environmentally certified real estate investment.”
Her goal in this line of work, “is to inform the industry of the operational details of environmentally conscious buildings, so as to encourage greater investment in the field.”
Yonder says: “From a corporate perspective, real estate and Real Estate Investment Trusts are unique.” To him, environmental sustainability can be achieved through green real estate.
“Real estate is essential for the environment—it can aid in attempts to decrease resource consumption and daily carbon dioxide emissions,” he states.
Both of these researchers attempt to study the implications of sustainable infrastructures on the real estate market, as well as the implications of such buildings upon potential buyers.
“Green certifications, such as LEED and Energy Star, maintain a certain level of environmental efficiency and sustainability for real estate,” says Yonder.
The paper investigates the impact of investment on the value, performance, profits, and costs of producing environmentally-conscious real estate, concluding that the way to sharpen awareness within the industry is through entailing standards on environment-based reporting.
Both researchers analyze the benefits of sustainable infrastructures on a social, economical, and environmental level.
“Our findings demonstrate that these institutional investors buy and hold more of the stocks of real estate companies with sustainable investments. Thus, greenness in real estate investment is equivalent to both environmental and business maintenance,” comments Yonders.
“My co-author, Dr. Erkan Yonder is also an early career academic with a background in real estate finance and specialty in sustainable and environmental real estate research. We find that we collaborate quite well, as we both have complementary research strengths. We intend to continue co-authoring in the future in this field of study,” adds Devine.
“This is wonderful news for Schulich and the Brookfield Centre in Real Estate and Infrastructure, as well as for Dr. Avis Devine,” says Dr. James McKellar, a fellow professor at Schulich.
“Her research also reinforces our ongoing commitment to sustainability, and her work is rapidly gaining international attention both in academia and within industry.”
With international and national appreciation, both professors from different universities are well-praised for their work in environmental sustainability through the examination of sustainable real estate.
Both Devine and Yonder plan to further their work within this field of research.
 


Congratulations Dr. Devine and and Dr. Yonder!

Imagine yourself playing a sport—any sport. What do you picture yourself doing? When many of us think about playing sports, the first thing that comes to our minds are the highly active motions of running, jumping, dodging, or tackling. Although plenty of us find comfort in these strenuous motions, there are several others who would rather put their energy into something that requires less stress on the body—perhaps, something that requires more emphasis on mental focus, calmness, and form.
“I’ve been doing archery for four or about five years now,” says Charles Objero, a fourth-year psychology major and executive member of the York Lions Archery club. “I started all the way back in high school—it’s kind of funny how I got into it. Back then, my girlfriend did archery as an after-school club and I’d normally wait for her. The coach saw me just sitting there and offered me to come try out and shoot. Ever since then, I was hooked.”
The Lions Archery club consists of students who have taken an interest in the unique and satisfying sport of archery. With their practices held in an indoor shooting range located in the Tait McKenzie Centre, the objective of the group is to help members learn the basics of archery and develop their shooting skills in a friendly and accepting environment.
“We welcome everyone regardless of their skill level. In the very beginning of the year we start off as a recreational sports club, gradually becoming competitive to get ready for the IUAT (Inter University Archery Tournament), which is held around the middle of March. Our club provides coaching and all the equipment necessary for everyone to start shooting,” Objero adds.
“We normally focus on the Olympic recurve style of shooting. Our practice times are Mondays from 8:00 p.m to 10:00 p.m., Wednesdays from 6:30 p.m to 8:00 p.m., and Saturdays from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. Our practices run in the evening to accommodate those who have classes in the morning. Attendance isn’t mandatory if you join. People can come in freely, whenever their schedule permits them—however, I highly encourage members to come to all practices to get themselves ready for the competition. We hold two in-house competitions—one near the end of November and one around February—here at York, which are only open for club members. It’s to promote competitiveness and help archers improve their skill.”
When looking at it in the realm of athletics, archery is not quite seen as a conventional sport. Rather than putting incredible amounts of stress on several parts of your body, archery requires a more focused approach, emphasizing a still calmness over a variety of constant fluid motions, being similar to hockey or basketball. Much like the purposes of yoga or meditation, archery is used as an agent of inner peace for students who need an outlet for their stressful, demanding lives as university attendees.
“Archery has been beneficial to me because it’s a really good stress reliever; you shoot your stress away. For me especially, it helps me clear my mind and has helped me find inner peace,” Objero says.
Instead of looking at it as a part of the realm of athletics, Objero sees archery in a different light, one closer to the realm of creativity and aesthetic.
“It’s like art for me. Shooting an arrow is similar to painting your target on the canvas. It promotes the mentality that nothing is ever perfect and there is always room for improvement.”
When looking toward the future of the club, Objero has ambitious hopes for a sport that eventually breaks out of the “competitive club” title in universities and becomes something much bigger.
“Archery is a growing sport. Most of the universities in Ontario have their own archery club. All the universities are helping each other to make archery an official OUA varsity sport, rather than just a simple sports club. So hopefully in five year’s time, we’ll be an official OUA Varsity sports team,” he continues.
So, if you are ever craving the nickname of Hawkeye or Katniss amongst your friend groups, or are simply looking for an outlet to relieve the stresses of university, the Lions Archery club always has its doors open. The target is a blank canvas, waiting for you to paint it with your arrow.
All waivers and information on practice times for the York Lions Archery club can be found on their Facebook page, Lions Archery. They are always looking for new members, so make sure to give them a try before the season ends!

It was a tough week on the court for York this weekend, as the men’s and women’s basketball teams failed to obtain a victory in both their matchups against the Western Mustangs and Windsor Lancers at home.
Looking to build off last week’s success against the Laurier Golden Hawks and the Waterloo Warriors, the Lions women’s basketball team played host to a 4-3 Western squad that they had defeated last season by a score to 48-41.
The first half of the game was a battle of the guards, as Lion Chante Clarke and Mustang Mackenzie Puklicz scored 10 and 11 points respectively, with Puklicz draining three of four triples to start the game.
After a first quarter that saw the Lions lead by a score of 15-14, the Lions began to take a clear lead due to a strong rebounding effort on the offensive glass, as they tallied eight second-chance opportunities compared to Western’s zero. This allowed the Lions to increase their lead.
Despite having shot 37 per cent from the field—five per cent less than Western—York took a 34-25 lead into the break.
The third quarter saw an explosion of offense on both ends, as both teams managed to score over 20 points in the frame.
Holding a 56-46 lead going into the fourth quarter, the wheels fell off for the Lions on both ends of the floor. York allowed the Mustangs to score a staggering 27 points in the frame, while only being able to muster 11 points themselves. In a half that saw the Mustangs shoot 58 per cent from the field, York only hit on 25 per cent of their shots. While Western had three players score 10+ points in the half, only one Lion, Lindsay Shotbolt, was able to score in the double-digits, as she recorded 15 points in the half.
The result was a 73-67 victory for the Mustangs, who were led by the performance of Puklicz, who fell just short of a double-double with 29 points and eight steals in the win. Shotbolt and Clarke scored 19 and 16 points respectively in the loss.
After a 70-63 loss to Western on Friday, the men looked to snap their five-game losing streak on Saturday against a 2-5 Lancers team that had defeated the Lions last year by a score of 83-78.
The Lions got off to a hot start in the game, outscoring the Lancers 20-12 in the first quarter. Leading the way was Lion Gene Spagnuolo, who netted 14 points on 5 of 6 shooting in the first half.
Despite stumbling on the offensive end in the second quarter, the Lions managed to go into the half with a four-point lead thanks in part to their defense, which limited the Lancers to just 26 per cent shooting in the half.
The Lions continued this effective defensive play in the second half, but failed to create many scoring opportunities down the stretch, as they only managed seven field goals on 37 attempts in the half.
The one bright spot for the Lions was guard Prince Kamunga, who scored 18 of York’s 25 points in the half.
Despite poor performances on the offensive end for both teams, the difference in Saturday night’s game came down ball handling, as the Lancers outscored the Lions in points off turnovers 23-9.
The result was a 65-61 victory for the Lancers, who handed York their sixth-straight loss on the campaign.
Both teams look to end their semester on a high note before the break, as they take on the Queen’s Gaels in Kingston on Wednesday. Tip-off is at 11 a.m. for the women and 1 p.m. for the men.

Rakshitha Dheenadhayalan, a fourth-year Economics Major and international student, recently claimed to have been the victim of fraud involving a fake immigration official.
On November 23, 2017, Dheenadhayalan says she received a phone call from an individual who claimed his name was Jim Rosen, who claimed to be from the Immigration department.
“York is deeply concerned for our student community following the recent spate of fraud targeting international students in Toronto, and we are monitoring the situation,” says Diana Ning, associate director at York International.
“We would like to remind our students that a government agency would never contact international students by telephone to demand immediate payment.”
Rosen then claimed to have an arrest warrant for Dheenadhayalan, and informed that she should cooperate and not involve anyone else, or else she would face arrest and deportation.
She then spoke to another man allegedly named David Anderson, who claimed to be the manager. He told her to expect a call from the police. A few minutes later, she got a call from someone claiming to be from the police department, who she alleges told her to pay $3,000 for a lawyer.
Doing as she was told by Anderson, Dheenadhayalan then made a series of wire transfers via Western Union and iTunes gift cards. She was told to make more payments to the Ontario Court of Justice via iTunes, and to wait at home for the local authorities to sign the relevant paperwork to close the case.
However, when she returned to her home, Dheenadhayalan received another call from Anderson, telling her because it was the evening, she would have to wait until the next day for the authorities.
The following day, Dheenadhayalan alleges she was told that her case was approved, but in order for the Supreme Court to release documentation, she was told she must pay the remaining $2,000—$1,200 through Western Union and $800 via iTunes. As the hours passed, nobody arrived to her home with the paperwork. She tried to call Anderson, but the call did not go through.
Fearing that something was wrong, Dheenadhayalan googled the Immigration website and realized there were numerous warnings about scams. Following her shock, Dheenadhayalan filed a report with 31 Division (at 41 Norfinch Drive) the following day.
“I provided the police with all the details; which included the receipts, showing all the payments that were made. The police mentioned that the chances of getting the money back are very low; however, they will try their best to track the individual,” adds Dheenadhayalan.
Maijura Ra, also a fourth-year Economics student, says: “Hundreds of people continue to be affected by various fraud cases. It is unfortunate that it is the most vulnerable whom are targeted (seniors, students, international students, et cetera).”
“We would like to urge international students to stay connected to the campus community, by visiting the York International Student Office, meeting student leaders and counsellors, and learning about services available to students, both on- and off-campus,” Ning says.
“Students are also asked to be cautious about protecting their personal information and not make hasty decisions but instead, reach out to university support staff for advice.”
Rares Pateanu, an Information Technology (IT) professor at York, says: “As someone who has spent over 35 years in progressively more senior roles in IT, I am deeply aware of the enormous change IT has brought into our lives. Unfortunately, as my student Rakshitha Dheenadhayalan has recently experienced, not all those changes are positive.”
“In my courses, I often emphasize how important it is for all of us to be aware of the potential pitfalls of technology, and to be ever so vigilant in defending ourselves against the many fraudulent activities perpetrated on people by unscrupulous use of technology,” he adds.
“I think it is a very important topic that still does not have sufficient exposure, particularly in the student population. Students often think they are too savvy regarding technology matters to be taken in by fraudsters.”
Ra says: “Many stories do not become publicized due to privacy concerns. However, I believe it should be mandatory to share such stories in order to bring out awareness.
“This could have happened to anyone.”

Featured image: Here are some tips from your fellow undergrads on how to keep yourself motivated and hit the gym. | Courtesy of Pexels
We all know how crucial it is to get a daily dose of exercise—whether or not we’re willing to make time for it is a different story. Health Canada recommends 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week for adults aged 18-64. Despite exercise being so important for our health, there’s always an excuse we make for ourselves for not doing it.
Many individuals often provide the reason for not exercising as lack of motivation and enjoyment. Let’s face it—an elevated motivation is a key determinant in whether you will exercise or not. Having a high drive and sense of pleasure can help you exercise consistently, get you in shape, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
If a lack of motivation and enjoyment are what’s keeping you from staying healthy, here are a few tips of encouragement to stay active, as told by your fellow Yorkies:
“I believe by setting and tracking your goals constantly, it will help you stay motivated constantly. Your goals do not have to be achieving certain body percentage, as many factors such as genetics, environment, and culture can affect our ability to gain or lose body weight,” says Karam Ali, a second-year Biology student.
These goals can range from going jogging for 50 to 60 minutes daily, to performing intense workouts for up to 20 minutes, or cutting down your six-mile running time by a few minutes. If you work out to attain these goals on a regular basis, you are less likely to stop when you know you can easily achieve your goals.
Extrinsic motivation pulls more weight in your workout regime than you might think. Looking up to others plays an important role in keeping you motivated, so if you’re struggling to find inspiration, your answer may lie in online motivational quotes.
“I would suggest using inspirational quotes to help you get motivated, because if you see someone successful, it will motivate you to be the same,” says Shahrukh Afza, a fourth-year Social Work student.
Post them around your house to remind you of your goals, and that if a certain person can attain their goal, then so can you.
“I suggest finding buddies to go to the gym with. I often go with my friends from university, which helps me stay motivated and exercise regularly, especially when I don’t feel like it,” says Zainab Kham, a second-year Biomedical student.
This will help you enjoy your exercise and work out harder, as you will have someone with similar goals to you.
“Going to the gym with someone is always fun and can be used as motivation to help you stay active,” he adds.
The particular person does not have to be your friends or family—it could be anyone you know, including someone from your neighborhood, co-workers, or people you stay regularly in touch with online, which will help you push your limit everyday and encourage you to stay on track and pursue a healthy lifestyle.
Take time out to go to the gym.
“After some time, it become a habit and you just don’t feel right if you miss out on gym days. That also helps to bring me back to the gym if I have to stop during midterms, or other times when I am really busy,” says Ahsan Al Lawati, a fourth-year Kinesiology and Health student.
“I want to build my body and stay healthy. I’ve also noticed that I feel a lot better and am better focused on my studies when I work out, so I make it a point to take time out and go to the gym.”

Friday November 17 marked the opening of the third annual Open World Toronto Film Festival (OWTFF)—held in the Alliance Francaise Spadina Theatre, just north of the Maddy—lacing together a celebration of aspiring Toronto film talent, musical performance, multimedia coverage, and international filmmakers sharing their lessons from the industry, for the industry.
“Students are young. They are fresh,” says Sabine Mondestin, OWTFF president and founder. 
“What I love is to be able to give them that platform to be able to experience the festival feel, to be able to know what it is like to showcase their film and to have that experience. We have granted free access to all university and college students.”
Upon entry, festival-goers could not help but notice the red carpet laid out before them with an OWTFF backdrop ringed by a wave of fluttering flashes as photographers and videographers captured the night’s invited talent. Downstairs in the basement, a professional makeup studio was assembled to have everyone feeling celebrious.
“I attend so many other events in Los Angeles,” Mondestin explains. “What I really like there is that feeling of ‘Oh my God, I’m a star!’ so I really want to give students that same treatment. [The filmmaker’s] film is there, and they get the star treatment: the paparazzi-style pictures—this is something that people like.”
Mondestin says she uses this unique framework to also recognize new photographers. “[Student photographers] don’t all have careers, but they are talented. They send us their portfolios and say: ‘I really want to take pictures in front of the red carpet.’”
Over the course of three days, the festival featured 17 films and provided a space for directors, producers, actors, models, film reviewers, and multimedia professionals to all network and share their processes. Screened movies were selected from submissions to FilmFreeway and the official OWTFF website.
“We’ve been travelling around and, you know, Canada is a bit behind on this compared to Los Angeles,” says OWTFF Director Steve Lareau. 
“Over there they really know how to market their movies, but here—not so good. We are inspired quite a bit by Los Angeles in this business model.”
The 2017 film selection featured short student films, documentaries, animated shorts, music videos and experimental films from Toronto, New York, Japan, and Turkey. Films included The Kidnapping of a Fish, Poison in the Water, The Oasis Affair,  Nights of Contrition, Princess Eun Hwa, The Box, Voice of Grace, Frapuccino, Approaching, Finding Hope, and Echo Park Blues.
“There have been lots of movies we’ve seen over the years that have been excellent, but we think that even more people should see them—to bring some light to those talents,” adds Lareau. “Every year, as soon as we’re done with a festival, we start to find new talent for next year, and we really try to find those little diamonds.”
The festival further featured a conference, moderated by Alina Christensen, on financing and filming in—and co-producing with—China alongside James Nan Guan, a Chinese producer who has worked on films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drago, among others. 
Christensen, a York Theatre alumna, says she was particularly impressed with Nan’s eagerness to share his knowledge. “It was clear to me that despite all the experience he has, he was still very humble and passionate about cinema, wanting to connect with likeminded artists here in Canada.”
Nan forecasted that the Chinese film industry will soon surpass Hollywood’s.
“The Chinese population is much greater [than America’s],” Nan noted on stage, speaking with her. “Toronto’s is three million; Beijing’s, 23 million. If even 10 per cent of China sees a movie, that’s already more than all of Toronto.”
“He answered every question with confidence and in plenty of detail, and he even threw in some humour too,” Christensen adds. “His charisma kept the audience attentive and focused.”
OWTFF further invited critics and reviewers to offer feedback to the featured talent.
“Film festivals offer a great opportunity for young filmmakers to network and meet industry professionals,” says Maziyar Khatam, a Toronto filmmaker who had his own movies screened. “It’s a good chance to have your film screened in front of an audience and to receive feedback on your work. 
“The technical aspects of [OWTFF’s] films—the cinematography, editing and music—were astounding. My favourite film from the festival was Bakemono, a 48-minute Japanese experimental film.”
This is the festival’s third year running. “We try to add one day every year,” Lareau mentions. “The first year we did one; the next year, two; and this year, we did three.”
“It’s easy to remain in your university bubble, especially at a school like York which is located away from the downtown core and where everything you need is on campus,” Christensen notes. “It’s a really good idea to get out there and begin creating a network outside of your own school, which allows you to meet industry professionals as well as other students.”
After all, this is what Mondestin aimed to create.
“The main thing we want to accomplish is to showcase talented filmmakers who have the talent, but don’t have the name,” she says. “It’s hard to get into festivals if you don’t have a name. 
“And I’m all about glamour.”

With the release of his latest album Everybody this past May, 27-year-old rapper Logic (born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II) touched upon a variety of issues such as politics, social media, race, and most importantly, suicide. His song “1-800-273-8255,” the title itself being the phone number for America’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL), portrays a conversation between an individual who has called the lifeline and the operator on the other end, who tries to convince the former why they shouldn’t take their own life.
Such sensitive topics such as suicide must be approached carefully, and it’s rare to hear mainstream songs grappling with the issue. However, Logic has attempted to promote awareness and create discussion regarding the struggle between life and death due to feelings of isolation. 
Inspired by conversations that he’s had with fans who have told him that his music has saved their lives, the rapper created a song specifically for that purpose, which has had a tremendous effect on mainstream music’s landscape. With assistance from two other talented artists, Alessia Cara and Khalid, “1-800-273-8255” quickly became his most influential track to date.
The track has seen incredible success, with over 100 million views on the official music video, and nearly 350 million streams on Spotify. Combined sales and streaming numbers for the track gave Logic his first-ever platinum record, which would later become triple platinum, and would then go on to break into the Top Three on Billboard’s Hot 100. It was recently nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Music Video.
But this isn’t the only impact that the song has had. In the weeks following it’s release, the NSPL saw a 27 per cent rise in calls and an additional 400,000 visits to their website over the following months. During the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), Logic performed the song live and had many survivors of suicide join him on stage for what became an emotional and powerful display of unity and hope. It showed us that we aren’t alone, and that unity is crucial for someone experiencing suicidal thoughts, or other serious mental health issues. Soon after this performance, the NSPL saw a 50 per cent surge in calls.
Logic has proved that music doesn’t need to sound a certain way to grab the attention of its listeners, that it can simply be a positive message that can go a long way with others. This song alone is an excellent example of who the rapper is as a person. He’s best known for his motto: “Peace, Love, and Positivity,” as he strives to use music as a platform to show others that they aren’t the only ones struggling, and that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel—remember: “It can be hard, It can be so hard, But you gotta live right now, You got everything to give right now.”

By 2020, if you happen to be in Chengdu, China, take a look at the night sky; you may notice something extraordinary.
At an innovation convention in Chengdu on October 10, Wu Chunfeng, chairman of Chengdu Aerospace Science and Technology Microelectronics System Research Institute Corporation, announced his plan to launch a satellite into orbit 500 kilometers above Earth, specially designed to reflect the light of the sun—just like the moon.
The ambitious plan is in response to the expensive street illumination in China’s larger, more active cities. The artificial moon could save the city of Chengdu $174 million when providing light for only 50 square kilometers. They plan to send three more after the first; if and when the following three are operational, they’ll be able to cover 3,600 to 6,400 square kilometers.
According to Chunfeng, extensive testing for the satellites began years ago, so hopefully, when the mini-moons are ready to be launched, there won’t be any problems. 
Russia conducted launch tests in the 90s on a similar device, dubbed ‘The Znamya 2’, which was taken into orbit aboard the cargo spacecraft Progress. It was equipped with a 25-meter mirror capable of producing a bright spot on the Earth, 4.8 kilometers in diameter. The overall project was a failure, as the subsequent test of the Znamya 2.5, the Znamya 2’s predecessor, resulted in an entangling conundrum between one of the antennae of Progress, and the mirror itself. The mirror was irreparably destroyed, costing the Russians a pretty penny, and ending their audacious attempt indefinitely.
But in today’s day and age of species extinctions, deforestation, and global warming, it’s not the satellite that people are worried about; it’s the wildlife. Many animals are reliant upon the rather predictable nature of the moon. Be it for hunting, mating, or navigation, the moon is a powerful tool used by numerous nocturnal animals. With the addition of a second ‘moon’, there is a concern that these creatures of the night may be affected negatively by the increase in light exposure.
Alex Mills, an associate professor at York who has taught undergraduate courses in evolution, population ecology, conservation biology and animal migration, explains that “many organisms are light-sensitive.” Having completed his Master of Science on the influence of moonlight on nocturnal birds and bats, Mills further elaborates that “some species avoid night, some prefer night providing there’s some light (as in twilight or moonlight), and others prefer night without moonlight.”
The birds and bats that Mills studied are defined as “lunaphilic”, which means they are moon-active, as well as twilight-active, “but some bats are lunaphobic, meaning they do most of their feeding in the dark, without moonlight.”
When asked how he thinks night-active birds may be affected by the artificial moon, Mills says: “There is evidence in North America that breeding birds that are inactive by day, and inactive during dark night, but active during twilight and moonlight, are influenced by artificial anthropogenic light, such as is found in urban and suburban areas. It does affect their circadian rhythms, although I’m not sure anyone has shown it is costly for them.”
 In regards to his own subject species, he describes that they “adjust [their] reproductive schedule to the lunar cycle (laying eggs at the time of the full moon). I suspect this kind of facility would interfere with that kind of cycle, because the light periodicity associated with the lunar cycle would disappear.”
Mills further notes that light pollution produced by cities is “a huge problem for migratory birds,” as countless birds have died colliding with commercial office buildings, houses, and apartment buildings, which are often kept lit at night. The best course of action to prevent this from happening is to remember to turn off all lights that are not in use, or use curtains, even when it’s dark outside. To learn more about how to help protect these birds, Mills recommends a citizen science group called FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program), based in Toronto.
Though the idea of an anthropogenically placed moon sounds totally out of this world, it may not be as far out as it seems—or rather, as far out as it should be. In an interview between Discover Magazine and Ryan Russell, an associate professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas, Russell said: “Their claim for one LEO (Low Earth Orbit) sat at [500 kilometers] must be a typo or misinformed spokesperson. The article I read implied you could hover a satellite over a particular city, which of course is not possible.”
According to Discover Magazine, geostationary orbital satellites, or satellites that maintain a fixed position over Earth, are only capable of doing so at approximately 35,500 kilometers. If Chunfeng and his team were to set their mini-moon at that height, the mirror would need to be much, much larger for anyone to even remotely see the light. And at a distance of 500 kilometers, the satellite would require thrusters, as well as a significant amount of refueling, to remain stationary, which simply wouldn’t be economically feasible. 
So are they lying? We’ll just have to wait and see. One thing can be known for certain though: most people will be getting a good night’s rest under one moon, just as nature intended.

Recent evidence suggests that gingivitis, the first stage of gum disease, and Alzheimer’s disease are linked by a particular bacterium.
The bacteria in question is Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), an oral anaerobe that is involved in the development of periodontitis. Periodontitis — the stage after gingivitis — results when so much bacterial plaque accumulates on the surface of the teeth that subgingival pockets are formed between the tooth and the gum. With time, the tissue and bone that hold the tooth and gum together deteriorate until the tooth falls out. In those who have reached this stage, P. gingivalis is highly prevalent.
Fascinatingly, researchers have also found the bacterium in the brains of people who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease.
Leading the research behind this bewildering connection is a pharmaceutical company called Cortexyme. Using mice, they have shown that the subjects given the bacterial infection of P. gingivalis suffered neurological damage — the kind seen in human Alzheimer’s cases.
 Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, P. gingivalis, and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis,” said Dr. Stephen Dominy, co-founder of Cortexyme and lead author of the paper.
“This demonstrates the potential for a class of small molecule therapies to change the trajectory of disease.”
As strange as this may sound, there have already been a few studies conducted that link oral and mental health. In 2016, a study was conducted that determined those with both Alzheimer’s and gingivitis experienced a more rapid neurodegeneration. Even more astonishingly, the Herpes Type I virus, an STI, has also been linked to Alzheimer’s.
It should be noted that more research is required before it can definitively be determined that one disease causes the other. Though an individual may have Alzheimer’s, he or she may also have been avid brushers; though an individual may have lost all of their teeth, he or she may be in perfect mental health.
A list of preventative measures that one can take to avoid developing the neurodegenerative disease can be found at alzheimers.net. Some of the suggestions include: quitting smoking and drinking; engaging in social activities; giving your brain daily challenges, exercise, a good diet, and managing stress effectively.
Remember, this may seem like a possible problem too far in the future, but the bad habits you develop as a young adult may stay with you into your later years. It’s better to be in the know now than regretting your ignorance later.

Featured Image: Microdosing is defined as the act of taking very small amounts of a particular substance to improve mental well-being. | Courtesy of Pixabay
A peculiar new trend has caused more than just a stir in the medical community lately. Microdosing is the act of taking drugs such as acid, DMT, mushrooms (psilocybin), or MDMA in very small quantities over the course of a period of time. This method has become the new form of treatment in the fight against depression and anxiety.
Many are hailing microdosing as the miracle cure, but how can one be sure that one isn’t just needlessly subjecting the brain to mind-altering drugs on a daily basis?
In spite of what the general consensus may be, the information behind this phenomena is slim to none. A review in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, written by a team of researchers hoping to define and analyze medicinal microdosing (specifically that of psilocybin) more sufficiently, found little in the way of actual solid data. As such, they feel that it is too early to say anything definitive on the subject.
Dr. Kim Kuypers of the Maastricht University in the Netherlands, the first author of the study, told MedicalNewsToday:
 Patients might feel attracted by those reports to try it but may actually not be helped by it. We try to emphasize the lack of scientific proof that microdosing is indeed effective in combating certain symptoms and hope that this will give impetus to new lines of research in this area.”
But what is microdosing exactly? Professor David Nutt, the Edmond J. Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, is the senior author of the review. After researching the ins and outs of microdosing, Nutt and his team define the phenomena by three main characteristics: very low doses that neither cause perceived change in the imbiber nor impair any normal functioning; multiple, scheduled dose times over a period of time; and a desire to enhance one’s self though microdosing. The amount itself, the ‘microdose,’ is defined as “approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth of a recreational dose.”
As for the lack of information related to microdosing, Nutt told MedicalNewsToday that the legalities of the substances are the main deterrent to gathering relevant data, but he and his team hope that the recent publicity will be of use in removing the red tape.
Kuypers holds the same sentiment: “This review is timely as a lot of hope is generated by positive media reports about alleged effects of microdosing.”
So, before you pop a few mushroom caps to write your next exam, remember that the data simply isn’t available yet and anecdotal evidence is hardly evidence at all without an empirical approach.
As Nutt and his team put it: “Rigorous, placebo-controlled clinical studies need to be conducted with low doses of psilocybin to determine whether there is any evidence for the claims of microdosing.”

The holiday season can be far from winter nights sitting by the fireplace sipping hot cocoa. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a medley of holidays or none at all, December is often regarded as the “ideal” time of the year. It is a month typically free from university classes and full of non-stop gift-giving and quality time with family and friends.
However, for some, this period is far from being “the most wonderful time of the year” – but why is that? Why is this time of year, synonymous in society with glee and relaxation, often not experienced by many in such a joyous way?
Some may categorize themselves as having the “holiday blues” during the holiday season.
According to Gordan Flett, Personality & Health professor, the holiday blues is “the idea that a substantial proportion of people feel sad and depressed during the holidays. It also suggests someone who is quite lonely and isolated from others.”
Woo Kim, International Student & Scholar Services associate director at York, says the holiday blues may be experienced for various reasons for some international students in particular.
Kim describes that an international student may be in a mundane mood because “they may not be going home over the December holidays and won’t get to see their family and friends. This may lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, at least temporarily.”
Aparna Mehta, third-year English student at York, explains how she was impacted during the past holiday season when she was unable to visit her family in Delhi, India.
“The holiday season tends to be a time for family. As I was unable to travel back home and be with my family last year, I did feel a little unhappy and homesick.”
Kim also explains how “for other students, this may be their first, or one of their first, winter. If they’re from a country where the weather stays fairly mild or hot in winter and stays sunny, the early darkness and grey winter days may cause them to feel less energized and ‘blue.’”
Sarah Irwin-Gardner, York’s Graduate Student Wellness Services manager, lists some factors that generally may impact students’ well-being during the holiday season. One factor Irwin-Gardner mentions is “feeling pressure to produce or experience a ‘perfect’ holiday.” Cassandra Carcasole, third-year English student, describes how she feels this expectation Irwin-Gardner describes.
 The holidays do cause some stress for me because there are so many things on my mind. I also feel like I need to buy everyone the perfect gift, so there’s always some pressure there,” Carcasole says.
Brian Villa, third-year Business Administration student, also has experienced this type of pressure. “My stress derives more from what to do on Christmas so that everyone will be happy.”
Irwin-Gardner discusses how the holiday season may affect a student because they tend to “manage multiple demands on one’s time.” Such demands may include balancing time for holiday shopping and social gatherings with time for final exam and assignment preparation, on top of working a part-time job.
“Other than being a student, I work two part-time retail jobs. Right now, it’s definitely a lot. I don’t have any days off,” Carcasole says.
“I am able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments, but it is not easy and definitely not the ideal situation.” Villa adds.
Charles Matthew Mishiyev, second-year history student, explains how becoming accustomed to a hectic routine is his key to balancing a hectic season.
“I am somewhat able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments because I have worked in retail during the holiday season for two years and have adapted to it,” Mishiyev says.
Adelaide Dolha, third-year Devised Theatre student, recalls her experience working in retail during the holiday season.
“Last year when I worked in retail, I had more hours due to more people being needed and these were 5 a.m. shifts. I even had one on Christmas Eve which made me tired for the rest of the day.”
Another factor Irwin-Gardner adds to the list of potential reasons for stress during the holidays is an “increase in academic pressure and the effects of working intensely leading up to the holidays.”
“I am able to balance my schedule as I usually start preparing for the holidays only once exams are done,” Dolha adds.
Irwin-Gardner also lists “feelings of isolation or feelings of loneliness” as a contributing factor for one’s holiday blues. Silsila Bahrami, fourth-year communication studies student, shares her feelings of discontentment with this time of year.
“I do not typically enjoy the holiday season. I am not a fan of the cold weather and I usually feel left out of the festivities, as my family does not celebrate the holiday season. I try to keep myself busy during this time period, but it is difficult when most people are away and/or celebrating while I am at home.”
Other factors listed by Irwin-Gardner include: “Distance from loved ones; increased financial demands/pressures; change in routine; missing loved ones who are far away or no longer alive; seasonal effects on mood (SAD), and difficult or distressing family dynamics.”
If you feel as if you may have experienced, or are currently experiencing, the holiday blues, there are other students at York, and in the country, who share your discontentment. But, how many students do the holiday blues impact?
Unfortunately, there has not been any research conducted that has established a relationship between the holiday season and an increase in stress and unhappiness among students, according to Flett. Nonetheless, there are still students who may feel a sense of unhappiness at one point during the holiday season due to the aforementioned potential factors.
 I look at the holidays as a time for relaxation and enjoyment for some people, but potentially hellish for others. It is a difficult time for any student who is preoccupied mentally and emotionally with not having done well in the fall term or who is returning to a less than optimal interpersonal situation or who is just feeling isolated and lonely,” Flett explains.
Flett also further supports the factors listed by Irwin-Gardner as to what could contribute to the holiday blues.
“It is more stressful for those who are focused on happier times in the past and why aren’t they so happy now. Or, for someone who is overly focused on comparing their holiday experience to the idealized accounts of life over the holidays provided by other people. Also, some people really buy into the notion of the perfect holiday season and they can exhaust themselves and others by trying to live up to an idealized image of how it should be or could be. Others are disquieted because they are so work-obsessed, they don’t know how to respond during times when the focus should be on rest and replenishing oneself.”
Louise Hartley, York’s Psychology Clinic director, comments on how marketing is also a contributing factor for those experiencing the holiday blues. Marketing has surrounded us with a narrative of how the holidays “should be,” despite it being unattainable for some.
“The holiday season can be difficult for anyone because there are these expectations built in through the excessive advertising – that this is a ‘happy’ time of year.”
So, how can one cope with the holiday blues?
Mayo Clinic shared 10 tips to coping with stress and depression during the holidays. The Mayo Clinic staff recommended that if you are experiencing the holiday blues for any of the aforementioned reasons, you should try to do the following: “acknowledge your feelings; reach out; be realistic; set aside differences; stick to a budget; plan ahead; learn to say no; do not abandon healthy habits; take a breather, and seek professional help if you need it.”
If you often feel lonely during the holiday season or you feel yourself feeling in such a way in the next few weeks, registered psychologist, Dr. Ganz Ferrance explained to CTV News that “if you are isolated from your family, find other ways to connect with people. Make time for friends or volunteering to help combat loneliness.”
Kim provides information on how York students will be able to connect with other students staying in the city to avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness this holiday season.
“International students who aren’t going home and staying in Toronto may want to connect with other international students staying over the break or with domestic students who live locally. This year, York International will be running a few events and outings in the city for any international students staying in Toronto so they can connect with other students staying over the break.”
The Mayo Clinic staff put it best: “Don’t let the holidays become something you dread. Instead, take steps to prevent the stress and depression that can descend during the holidays. Learn to recognize your holiday triggers, such as financial pressures or personal demands, so you can combat them before they lead to a meltdown. With a little planning and some positive thinking, you can find peace and joy during the holidays.”
It is very important to reach out for support if you have concerns about your mental health or wellness during the holiday season or at any point during the year. York University’s Student Counselling & Development Services offers walk-in counselling Monday to Friday between 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. More information can be found at counselling.students.yorku.ca
The Good2Talk Helpline is a free, confidential helpline for post-secondary students in Ontario that is available 24/7 as well.

The struggle between youthful rebellion and mature reasoning among us university students can be seen by the protests that occurred on Wednesday, November 20 against the IDF soldier.
History and society idealizes images of young rebellious types who, through strong (and mostly violent) acts of defiance, challenge the status quo and change their countries for the better. Images of students marching to American Embassies or toppling statues of some tyrant comes to mind when we think of student activism. This is inherently wrong.
In young students who, for the first time, hear their voices in society, they develop an impulse to correct the oppressive ways of the old. Our education, which bores us to death, does not fulfill us intellectually; this produces a loud and boisterous beast of a mob that overtakes all rationale.
Western civilization owes its success to free discourse and debate. In fact, this is the exact notion that universities should aim to do — this is the only value that we as students should learn. If someone honestly believes in a cause, or in the case of the events of last week’s events, against a cause, they should not chant and try to silence others. This will only regress us to the barbaric past we are trying to avoid.
If you believe someone’s message is wrong and/or detrimental, then prove it. Set up a booth, and call people to hear the facts.
There needs to be a shift in the understanding of student activism. Let’s change hoisted fists as logos for organizations (cough, YFS) to pens and microphones. Let’s take up booths rather than banners, as this and nothing else, will drive us forward.

With protests surging in Hong Kong, many residents have had their lives put into danger. Some of these residents are students who are there on exchange programs from Canadian universities.
As a result, York and other Canadian universities have requested that the exchange students come back to Canada out of concern for their safety.
After Hong Kong was returned to China after being a British colony in 1997, Hong Kong still maintained a certain level of independence as a separate entity from China.
Since June, protests have escalated as Hong Kong has put forward a bill which threatens to have criminals from Hong Kong extradited to China for punishment.
The protests have gradually become worse. They have been characterized by Chinese officials as riots and have led to many protestors being killed, injured, and detained.
“I think it is reasonable for them to call back the students,” says Kevin Gu, first-year language student. “The protestors have attacked the universities,” he adds, emphasizing that the severity of the protests were putting Canadian students’ lives in danger.
One student, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of a reaction from the Chinese government, had a different outlook.
 Canadians are safe in China. Canada has always been viewed positively by the Chinese, ever since Mao. This is all being blown out of proportion. China doesn’t see Canada the same way as other Western countries,” says the student.
“If the protests continue to grow more violent, based on history, it could lead to a civil war, and Canadian students could be caught in the crossfire,” says third-year history student Eric Solomon.
“I don’t know how bad it actually is, but studying abroad is stressful enough, having this going on would take a toll on one’s mental health,” adds Solomon. “Even if Canadian students aren’t being targeted, they’re getting affected one way or another. Everybody is hurting. No one wins.”
First-year interdisciplinary studies student Katherine Mu challenged whether the overall concern from Canadian universities was for the best of all involved.
“Are we valuing some lives more than others? Why don’t we focus on creating a safer environment for everybody rather than just calling these students back? For any university or country to only call back their people from a situation like that shows they are valuing some lives more than others,” says Mu.
Despite being across the world, many students at York are engaging in discussion and protesting around the current situation in Hong Kong. For now, all students can do is hope for the safety and well-being of those affected by the conflict.

Amnesty International at York invited students to write letters to advocate for human rights across the globe.
The event, held on November 19 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., saw students arrive throughout the day to write for a variety of specific issues.
“Amnesty International holds Write for Rights every single year, where they pick ten cases — different cases around the world in different countries,” says third-year law and society student and Vice-President of Amnesty International at York, Nada Abdel-Maksoud.
These cases will often involve political prisoners and human rights injustices, according to Abdel-Maksoud. Then, students and supporters will come together and write to the governments who are committing said human rights violations to try to invoke change.
The event garnered a good amount of attention last year, sending out just under six million letters and messages from over 200 countries.
“The past years, we’ve had to send out over a hundred letters,” Abdel-Maksoud says, discussing the York extension’s impact. “In the years I’ve seen the event happen, it has attracted a lot of attention, so we’re glad about that, and it really helps because it seems like such a small thing but it makes a big difference.”
And the event has made a difference. In 2014, film director Oleg Sentsov was arrested by Russian authorities on charges of plotting terrorism acts. Amnesty International, alongside other human rights organizations, took to his side to defend him and label the accusations by the Russian court as fabrications.
After being released on September 7, 2019, Sentsov thanked activists and people who wrote letters during his incarceration.
“I brought two bags. The second contained 22 kilograms of paper, mostly letters. I did not throw a single one out. I brought them all and kept them, as they are so dear to me. There are books, notebooks, a big pack, 15 of them. They are completely filled with writing.”
Abdel-Maksoud says the letters are not directly connected to the remediation of these human rights violations; however, they could be a factor that help individuals around the world.
“Those letters, because they are so personal, you can write them to the people facing that injustice or the government itself. It really makes a difference because people get to read, people that are in solidarity with them, and governments get to see how much people want these injustices solved,” says Abdel-Maksoud.
York students attended for their own personal reasons, and explained how they were touched by specific cases that Amnesty International was working on.
 I, myself, wrote to the case about people arrested for helping refugees in Greece. They volunteered for a rescue mission, and were arrested. Although they’ve been released on bail, they are pending charges,” says fourth-year communication studies student, Olivia Graham.
“This seems like such a small thing, and people always seem to think that writing letters and signing petitions are small actions. It’s the most basic form of mobilization for your rights and the rights of others,” says Abdel-Maksoud, urging others to attend the Write for Rights event.
The official event by Amnesty International will take place on December 10.

Why are there still people out there that don’t trust scientists, or worse, even science itself?
The modern age is one of misguided antics, mystery pandemics, misinterpreted facts and misinformation. We spend our days grovelling over social media, absorbing what we believe to be factual information instead of doing the research where it matters. Our degrees are earned on YouTube, and our egos are built in nonsense. We call ourselves “woke,” educated, and informed, achieving a level of confidence akin to a king, but becoming nothing more than a jester.
If that isn’t a recipe for societal disaster, I don’t know what is.
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, while we run amok clinging desperately to toilet paper and dropping our dignity, there is no better time to be aware of the contribution that science has made to humanity. 
It is because of science that we have any semblance of hope for the future, and it is because of science that we will survive. It is not your local “wellness” store that will save you, nor will planets in retrograde or full moons on Fridays. It is the hard work of dedicated, passionate researchers, men and women of science who chose to take a more difficult road, a road of logic, reason, and most importantly, humility.
A scientist must be humble. They cannot be afraid to say that they do not know, or that they are wrong, and therein lies their power. Can the same be said of the online charlatan trying to sell you their snake-oil miracle cures (I’m speaking to you, Alex Jones)?
But how could being wrong be a good thing? Because when a scientist learns they are wrong, they are one step closer to learning what is right.
It is the truth that matters, above all else, and a true scientist understands this. Would you rather live in a world of ignorance, making your choices with dice as if the only life you had was a board game, or would you rather trust in science, and know with confidence that every step a scientist takes is towards the truth?
Now you may ask, how do I know science is the answer? I don’t know, but what I do know is that a scientist, the “building block” if you will of the greater scientific body of knowledge, is trained to look at things logically — to take careful, consistent records and above all else, to be objective. It is this empirical approach to information gathering that forms the steel of all our greatest machinations. Without it, that greater scientific body of knowledge would buckle under its own weight. 
But alas, its structure holds firm. After all these years, the truths of the past are still truths of the present. Can we say the same of other “sciences”? Have we not proven that burying toads in our backyards, or rubbing lavender oil on our foreheads will not cure us of our ailments? Why then do we still believe in such archaic notions?
For example, it baffles me to know that there are people out there who still believe the world is flat. What kind of inhuman mental gymnastics do you have to perform to believe such nonsense? Do you have any idea what kind of undertaking it would be for the government to hide such a fact? Better yet, why would they? It doesn’t make any sense!
And of course, the same goes for vaccinations. In our complacency we have become FUBAR-level stupid, mistrusting the very creations that have done nothing but save us from agonizing, soul-wretching deaths, from the tortuous experience a truly uncontrolled plague would be. 
If only the memories of our ancestors would reemerge and pull us back to dark realities we know nothing of, maybe then we’d understand just how good we’ve got it today.
And why do we “have it so good”? Because of science, people. The reason we have everything from clean drinking water to high-definition TVs, cars that move to planes that fly, is because of the millions of dedicated hours of careful note-taking, tinkering, and experimentation. It is because of the empirical method that you aren’t dumping your toilet bucket on the streets, or curing mental disorders with bloodletting.
So the next time you decide to “save” your dying child with berries and herbs, or launch yourself into the stratosphere in a homemade rocket to prove those conniving, dastardly, round-world scientists wrong, remember why you have the time and liberty to question such things in peace. 
In an unenlightened, science-less world, proving science wrong would be the least of your concerns.

We continue to repeat the age-old saying, “beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” yet we continue to be influenced physically and psychologically by those who try to tell us what beauty is supposed to be. And this is not our fault. 
What exactly is beauty, according to those that shape this definition? Why can we never achieve beauty? Or rather, why do we feel as if we can never achieve it?
According to Psychology Today about 54 per cent of young women and 41 per cent of young men, both ages 13 to 19, said they are dissatisfied with their appearance; 57 per cent of women and 38 per cent of men ages 20 to 29 made the same claim.
Both men and women are faced with high standards of beauty, but there is an extraordinary amount of pressure on young girls and women in particular to meet these unrealistic expectations.
Rebecca De Santo, third-year sociology student at York, says that there is a difference in expectations because of “the way we structure society.”
   Throughout history and especially in our society today, women are sold an idea of beauty from such a young age, which can develop negatively throughout their lives,” explains De Santo.
Milena Giangrosso, third-year biomedical science student, comments: “Historically, the people who made up the voice and power of a society and culture were the straight men. The way a woman ‘should’ look was dictated by the wants and fantasies of the people in power; they were able to spread iconography of ‘ideal beauty for women.’”
Silsila Bahrami, fourth-year communication studies student, also says that this difference exists because of “the cultural influences that impacted a woman’s upbringing in the patriarchal world.”
“In most cultures, men typically hold the most power and can use this power to further their own interests,” adds Bahrami.
This standard of beauty for women is referred to as the “feminine beauty ideal.” This is a social construct, and it revolves around the flawed idea that physical attractiveness is an important asset that all women should strive to achieve, and once they do, to maintain it.
The feminine beauty ideal can be traced back to old fairytales, typically written by men. These stories would describe women as having certain characteristics of beauty.
For example, in the story “Snow White” by the Brothers Grimm, the titular character is described as being “beautiful as the light of day,” with “skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony wood.” Antagonists in fairy tales were often described as old hags and physically unappealing.
The relationship of “beautiful princesses” and “ugly villains” was thus exposed to us as infants. This made us believe that if we did not look the way that princesses like Snow White did, we were the Evil Queen disguised as the dreadful witch by default.
Ideas of beauty have changed throughout history and within cultures. For example, during the Middle Ages and early modern period, beauty was associated with a pale complexion and a larger weight; this meant that one did not have to work outside and could eat as much as they desired, which was a sign of wealth.
In contrast, those who had a more tanned complexion and a smaller weight represented an undesired physical appearance; it signified a poorer individual who had to work in the sun all day and did not have as much access to food.
However, the association to these types of physical characteristics have reversed in today’s culture. It is fascinating to see how these standards of beauty have changed over the years. What was once associated with beauty is now what we are told to avoid.
We focus on trying to meet these expectations of beauty that are relevant today, yet they could change in a matter of weeks, months, or years. We spend our money, time, and energy to meet these standards only for them to change in just a matter of time.
This dedication to understand what is and what is not beauty takes a toll on not only our physical appearance, but also our psychological well-being. How can we keep up with these changes?
The reality is, we cannot. We can try to, but it is difficult to meet these physical demands put on to us. But who is putting these demands out?
Businesses and brands are often the ones who create these standards for us to meet. We are shown commercials and campaigns that tell us what we need to do away with: weight, stretch marks, cellulite, dandruff, pimples, scars, dark circles, fine lines, and wrinkles, to name a few.
What these advertisements refrain from telling us is that these elements are what make us human. Instead, we are convinced that we should never have had these natural traits in the first place.
If we were not told over the years of campaigning that these are “ugly” traits, we would never associate them with this term. We should want to lose that weight or use a 10-step skincare routine to help ourselves feel better, not to remove ourselves from this classification that considers us unattractive.
Young girls and women are faced with a number of issues, with the battle for clear and “baby-like” skin being one of them; we are told that any pore in sight is unappealing. Laura Maiolo, third-year kinesiology and health science student, explains her experience in responding to these standards of beauty.
“I usually cover acne breakouts with makeup because there is an expectation of women to have clear skin. People associate acne with a lack of hygiene, but in reality, it’s not something that can always be controlled,” says Maiolo.
“As a teen, I was very self-conscious of my acne; I didn’t have makeup and I didn’t know how to use it. I felt a lot of pressure to fit into a mould of beauty that I had very little knowledge of, and my socio-economic standing didn’t allow me to always have the newest things,” adds Giangrosso.
Social media is also another culprit in creating these unrealistic standards of beauty. When we are constantly on our phones and scrolling through social media, we are exposing ourselves to these beauty expectations. We expose ourselves to those athletic and tanned models without either pores or wrinkles, and with lusciously voluminous hair.
This is not the norm. The norm is love handles, back fat, hyperpigmentation, flaky scalps, split ends, and dry skin. We don’t realize this is the norm though because those who have these traits are often too self-conscious to post a vulnerable photo or a tweet disclosing their imperfections.
Jennifer Mills, an associate psychology professor at York, conducted a survey in 2018 where she asked female undergraduates to take a selfie on an iPad and upload it to social media.
Mills and her colleagues discovered that all the participants, including those who had the chance to edit their photos, felt less attractive and less confident after posting their selfies compared to when the experiment began.
“Even though they can make the end result look ‘better,’ they are still focused on aspects of what they don’t like about the way they look,” Mills explained.
If we are at risk of reaching obesity, or we have an itchy scalp, or we have scarred skin, we should want to change these issues for our own personal benefit, not because a business or a social media platform tells us to change.
   I find that my feelings about my appearance are most magnified when I see other women on social media. My thoughts gravitate towards the feeling that my features should resemble these women and that I could have these features if I had certain procedures done, or if I bought specific clothes, food, or beauty products,” says Bahrami.
Trying to meet these expectations of beauty is physically demanding. We starve ourselves to reach that weight goal. We spend hours at the gym, and we are conscious about what we can and cannot eat throughout the day.
We get nose jobs and lip fillers because we see other celebrities or social media influencers doing so. We move fat into our bust and rear to plump those areas because we see that the hourglass figure is the ideal and the most complimentary figure of beauty. We make our faces more symmetrical; we give ourselves new chins and cheek bones.
We erase ourselves. We stray as far away from who we are naturally because we are convinced that we are not good, or beautiful, enough.
Cassandra Carcasole, third-year English student, says that beauty standards resemble “the grass is always greener on the other side” mentality. 
“I have curly hair, but when I see someone rocking straight hair, I wish I had that. Then when I straighten my hair, I think it’s too flat and I wish it was curly,” explains Carcasole.
Trying to meet these standards is psychologically exhausting. Being told repeatedly that we aren’t beautiful enough takes a toll on our mental and emotional well-being. This often leads to issues in our mental health including anxiety and depression for the fear and disappointment many face of not being able to reach these goals.
We continuously fill our minds with thoughts of, “Why can’t I look like that?” or, “Why did I have to be born this way?” which leads to further negative consequences on our mental well-being. According to the BBC, a journal article in ScienceDirect conducted a survey of 227 female university students, where “women reported that they tend to compare their own appearance negatively with their peer group and with celebrities.”
It is ironic that we look to social media moguls and celebrities as an inspiration for beauty that we want to resemble because these individuals often don’t even look the way they do in their posts.
With the help of Photoshop, filters, air-brushing, and fine-tuning programs that are getting more accurate and realistic by the minute, we are fooled into believing that a certain person has zero pores or wrinkles with a tiny waist and large bust. We are convinced that we should be able to reach this level of perfection, when that person cannot even do that themselves.
Instagram in particular is a social media platform that plays a major role on how we view ourselves. On a platform where we scroll on a feed full of these models and celebrities, we are constantly comparing ourselves to what we are not. These expectations of beauty tie in with the psychological notion of wanting what we can’t have, as opposed to embracing what we do have, as Carcasole mentions.
It is tiring scrolling through Instagram seeing these people who have perfect bodies, skin, and hair. We constantly crave for “real” people represented in advertisements and social media, as well as in television and film.
There is a desire for not only representation of different races, genders, sexual orientation, and cultures to exist on large platforms, but there is also a need for representation among those who do not reach these unrealistic beauty standards.
We go through hell and back just to reach a standard set by a company who wants us to buy their luxury moisturizer, weight-loss plan, or gummy vitamins. Why don’t we try as best as we financially, emotionally, and physically can to reach goals set by ourselves that are actually attainable? 
Why do we try to go down ten sizes instead of working on going down one size at a time? Why do we try to give ourselves an entirely new face instead of working on one skin concern at a time? Why are we in such a rush and panic to change ourselves?
We need to set realistic goals. There is nothing wrong with trying to change your physical traits if you are personally unhappy with how you look. There is nothing wrong with losing weight, getting a nose job or lip filler, eating healthier, or investing in skincare. However, we should not be trying to change our habits and our appearance because a business or social media platform manipulated us into doing so.
We need to make these changes on our own account. We need to want these changes to make ourselves happy because we will look in the mirror and see someone who is beautiful in our own eyes, not in the eyes of someone else who only wants our money or attention.
There are a variety of changes to make if you find yourself physically and/or psychologically exhausted from trying to meet these standards of beauty.
One recommendation Mills made is to simply put down our phones. “Take a break and engage in other activities that have nothing to do with appearance and comparing yourself to other people,” suggests Mills.
   Don’t compare yourself with other women or the unrealistic expectations that are placed on women. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but I think that minimal changes over time can be very impactful in the long term,” advises Maiolo.
“Who and what we surround ourselves with can greatly influence our feelings towards ourselves. Putting an end to beauty standards starts with loving yourself as who you truly are in this moment and actively taking steps towards building self-confidence,” recommends Bahrami.
“As women, we need to continue the conversation of what it means to be beautiful. Once we all come to understand that there is not one form, size, shape, or style of beauty, we will be the most beautiful versions of ourselves,” adds De Santo.
“Try to stop listening to beauty media, watching that Instagram model who surgically removed some of their ribs to look unnaturally skinny, and prescribing to the idea that you need to look a certain way,” advocates Giangrosso.
“Dress how you want to, put on what you’re comfortable in, and don’t give a damn what anyone else thinks. Live for you.”

Medicago, a Canadian bio-pharmaceutical company, has recently made what is known as a virus-like particle (VLP) of the Covid-19 virus — an important step in producing a vaccine.
But why is this step so important, exactly?
A virus-like particle is a molecule that resembles a virus very closely, but is non-infectious as it contains no genetic material. This makes them easier to analyze by researchers.
On top of this, the VLP can much more efficiently present antigens to the human immune system.
As effective as the VLP is in the search for a vaccine, the real trick up Medicago’s sleeve is the company’s rather innovative, time efficient and cost effective process of vaccine production involving plants.
 “The pace of our initial progress in Covid-19 is attributable to the capability of our plant-based platform, which is able to produce vaccine and antibody solutions to counteract this global public health threat,” said Medicago CEO Dr. Bruce Clark.
   The ability to produce a candidate vaccine within 20 days after obtaining the gene is a critical differentiator for our proven technology. This technology enables scale-up at unprecedented speed to potentially combat Covid-19.”
Normally, chicken eggs are used as an incubator for the production of vaccine proteins. Many, many eggs are required and as such, the process becomes very expensive and time-consuming.
What this new plant-approach to incubation involves is the use of altered agrobacterium. Each bacterium has the virus’ genetic sequence injected into them, then it is put into the plant’s soil and left for the plant to absorb. When this has happened, the plant will produce the virus proteins necessary to develop a vaccine.
“That’s the difference between us,” Clark said. “We go directly to producing the vaccine or the antibody without having to propagate the virus.”
Medicago’s process is so effective, back in 2009 they were able to produce an H1N1 vaccine within 19 days. Then three years later, within the time-span of one month, they made over 10 million doses of monovalent influenza vaccine for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
With such ambition, it is no surprise to hear that the company is hoping to enter phase I trials of human studies by July, a goal that may require some cut corners. “It would depend, quite extensively, on the decisions the regulators make in terms of the hurdles they want us to have in the normal course of development,” said Clark.
But if all goes well, the vaccine could be made available to the public by next November. 
“I won’t put words in their mouths. I will say our intention, taking a very standard approach, is that by November of 2021 we will have completed phase III,” continued Clark.

The concept of identity and gender has, for a long time, existed within rigid boundaries. The binary (i.e solely male and female) has defined much of what society knows about gender and gender expression, as well as what is considered acceptable forms of expression for each. 
The exhibition, Re:Framing Gender curated by Jason Cyrus, seeks to explore the different ways one may express their gender, and go beyond what is stereotypically considered masculine or feminine. 
As soon as you enter the space, there is a white wall that has a list of terms that revolve around gender and sexuality, as well as their respective definitions. Some of these terms include: “hijra” (a legally recognized third gender specific to the South Asian subcontinent), “QTIPOC” (a queer, trans, and intersex people/person of colour), and “agender” (meaning “without gender”, and is used by someone who understands themselves to be genderless or gender neutral). 
The rest of the exhibit consists of a lineup of mannequins dressed up in different kinds of attire, each with stereotypical labels placed beneath them. The lineup starts with a set of mannequins all dressed in evening gowns, and some of the labels ascribed to these aesthetics are “girly-girl,” “diva” and “cutesy.”

There is also a quote that hangs above, describing how a hyper-feminine appearance (which is enforced by the clothes one wears) is generally what a heterosexual man finds attractive, and that when trans people adopt that certain aesthetic, they’re crucified for supposedly reinforcing gender stereotypes. 
At the end of the lineup, there is a clothing rack displaying menswear in its various different forms. In this section, there is a focus on suits, and how that is ingrained into masculinity. 
Some of the labels that sit beneath these pieces are “rebel,” “playboy,” “tycoon” and “jock.” The quote that hangs above describes how gender stereotypes are so ingrained, that if one were to slightly deviate from them, that would essentially mean “game over. 
Located in the Joan and Martin Goldfarb Centre for Fine Arts room 275, Re:Framing Gender was scheduled to be on display until April 17. However, with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, the gallery is closed and it is currently unknown when the gallery, and the exhibit, will reopen.

The 2020 Festival of Art and Science Exhibition, (BE) Coming An Exhibition of Experimental Contemporary Art, co-sponsored by Sensorium: Centre for Digital Arts and Technology, ArtSci Salon, and The Fields Institute at the University of Toronto, is a unique collaboration between York’s School of the Arts, Media, Performance & Design (AMPD) artists and artists outside of the York community. 
This exhibition seeks to explore the idea of change and its inevitability, as well as its process. Humans collectively tend to fear change and try to avoid it as much as possible, but often forget that there is no stability without instability — that change, or rather transformation, is an essential part of life. 
One of the first exhibits that is visible when entering the space, titled Growth, is a sculpture of a human/non-human hybrid (although, this is not apparent at first). Created by fifth-year AMPD student, Esther Kim, this sculpture is actually a segment of a human torso, with a network of coral growing from the top of it. The torso is casted from plaster while the coral is casted from aqua resin.

“The fragility of the human body casted in plaster is contrasted with the solidity of the resin, an excrescence to the human body. This unnatural growth of corals acts as the skeletal framework holding the body in place and completing its form,” Kim described in her artist statement.
Another eye-catching display is titled Ovum created by Suzanne Anker. It is a set of five egg yolks each contained within a petri dish that addresses the age-old question, “which came first, the chicken or the egg?” 
“The ontological question of which came first can be explained in Darwinian terms. During evolutionary processes of the transformation of species over vast amounts of time, the chicken as we know it today emerged as a proto-species, which had the capacity to produce calcium carbonate for its shells,” said Anker in her artist statement.
Anker describes the egg yolks as being seeds, which move towards crystallization.
This exhibit was located in the Gales Gallery, within the Accolade West building, until March 12, 2020.

2020-10-29,York,China,"LSD, less commonly known as lysergic acid diethylamide, has gained a reputation throughout the years as somewhat of a “hippie drug,” allowing its users to “expand their consciousness” and experience the world through a lens they would otherwise never be able to.
As time has gone on, and the stigma around it has lessened, we have been able to learn more about LSD and psychedelics in general. 
“LSD makes you feel really in touch with the world; I’d consider it a spiritual journey. But it can definitely also make you think too much, and just be in your own head,” says Allen Rotger, a fourth-year economics student. 
Modern day pundits such as Joe Rogan have emphasized that psychedelics make him “more compassionate, more aware, more vulnerable.” And Steve Jobs, the late founder of Apple, was even quoted as saying that taking LSD was one of the most profound experiences of his life. 
And now, science has something to say about the drug as well. A study published this past August set out to discover the effects of taking very small doses of LSD (a phenomena now known as microdosing) in relation to productivity, depression, and other mental health issues. These aspects were investigated after long standing anecdotal reports. 
The study gave 27 volunteers a placebo, as well as actual LSD, on separate days while monitoring their brain-derived neuropathic factor (BDNF) blood plasma levels every two hours. 
The study found that at a dose of five micrograms of LSD, BDNF increased and peaked after four hours, while 20 micrograms also saw an increase with a peak time of six hours. 
What exactly is BDNF, you may ask? Tya Vine, second-year medical student at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine with a BSc in neuroscience, sheds some light on the subject.
  “The research was conducted on healthy volunteers, so I think much more research, including potential clinical trials on patients with mental illnesses, would be needed before concluding that microdosing LSD could be considered a form of treatment for mental illnesses.”
“BDNF is a growth factor that is important for brain development and maintenance. BDNF production and release is activity dependent, which means that properly functioning neurons produce more BDNF, which in turn maintains the healthy neuron and its synapses. It is important for both supporting the survival and health of existing neurons, as well as encouraging growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses,” says Vine. 
BDNF also plays key roles in learning, memory functioning,  and neuroplasticity — the capacity of our brain to rewire itself. This is fundamental to depression and neurodegenerative disorders like dementia, all of which are tied to a decrease in BDNF levels. 
So, with all this research done and anecdotal stories recounted, does LSD really give its users any support when it comes to the busy workday or the distress of mental health issues? The answer is: maybe. 
In the aforementioned study, a 10 microgram dose of LSD had no effect on BDNF levels, even though a five and 20 microgram dose did. This shows that our understanding of the way this substance behaves is still far from plain sailing. 
In reviewing the study, Vine shared some potential changes that could be taken into account for future research. 
“The research mentioned in the article was conducted on healthy volunteers, so I think much more research, including potential clinical trials on patients with mental illnesses, would be needed before concluding that microdosing LSD could be considered a form of treatment for mental illnesses,” says Vine. 
The study itself indicates that though results were promising, “new studies performed under modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge.”
Positives and negatives aside, it is still important to keep in mind that the unauthorized consumption of LSD and most other psychedelics is still illegal in Canada.

York International hosted several events throughout October, displaying how their study and work abroad programs have been adapted in the face of COVID-19 travel restrictions. For the first time ever, York will be offering remote global internships in Winter 2021. Several international universities have also made remote study options available for York students.
“These are offered through our direct partner organizations, and they may or may not include a program fee — most of them do not,” said International Internships Assistant Natasha Pursun, at a Global Internships Q&A session. “The selection process is handled by both York International and the organization.”
These remote internships are three months long, and interested students can apply directly to York International. Short-term remote internships are also available and will be offered year-round through external providers. 
Current remote opportunities include fields like accounting, marketing, non-governmental organization (NGO) management, and conservation, in countries such as China, England, France, Japan, Portugal, and Peru.
While these internships no longer provide students with a physical international work experience, they still retain the financial benefits. Students are eligible for a funding of up to $3,000 for these opportunities.
Depending on the travel situation, there may still be some international opportunities available in summer 2021. However, they will not be hosted through direct partners like the remote opportunities.
“These are organizations we’ve partnered with through faculty connections here at York,” said Pursun. “We reached out to faculty members here at the university and we asked them for any connections they had in the field, either working with other organizations or working with other universities.”
    “Obviously it was upsetting, having the trip cut off and flying home, but at the same time the situation was getting really scary in Europe, and Canada had it better under control in that sense.”
In terms of educational opportunities, many international universities have pivoted to virtual learning as well. While summer 2021 opportunities have yet to be posted, fall/winter virtual opportunities currently listed include the European studies program at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, and the Winter Abroad program at South Korea’s Yonsei University.
Fourth-year Schulich iBBA student Meena Shanmuganathan can speak to the benefits of her own exchange term this year: “I loved my exchange experience, it was a fantastic time. I really got to discover independence in a new country, in basically learning the language and everything I had to do there. I did get to travel alongside the South of France, I went to Aix-en-Provence on exchange.”
However, Shanmuganathan’s experience was cut off early due to the onset of COVID-19. The time of her return marked the beginning of York’s overall transition to virtual international opportunities.
“Obviously it was upsetting, having the trip cut off and flying home, but at the same time the situation was getting really scary in Europe, and Canada had it better under control in that sense,” she says. 
“It was definitely my first time travelling that long on a plane alone, and I travelled without my suitcases because I’d left them all in France. I flew straight home from London, kind of like an emergency flight.”
While Shanmuganathan enjoyed her own in-person exchange, she still believes it’s worth it for those virtually studying abroad.
“Of course I think exchange isn’t all just about the school you go to, it’s about learning to live in that environment with the locals as well. But the good thing is, I actually really like the virtual study tour opportunity, where I believe you get to meet other businesses or you get to meet people from different parts of the world, so it’s really eye-opening in that sense.”
“Some of these schools are highly prestigious,” she adds. “To be able to say you studied from them, even virtually, is always going to be an asset for you on your resume.”

Senior Staff
Students and staff at Osgoode Hall Law School are demanding an apology and explanation from the Toronto Police Service after one of their officers suggested women can avoid sexual assault by not dressing like a “slut.”
On Jan. 24, a campus safety information session was held at Osgoode Hall, where members from York security and two male officers from Toronto police 31 Division handed out safety tips to community
members.
Ronda Bessner, who attended the session, remembered being surprised by what the officer suggested to women.
“One of the safety tips was for women not to dress like ‘sluts.’ He said something like, ‘I’ve been told I shouldn’t say this,’ and then he uttered the words,” said Bessner, Osgoode assistant dean of the Juris Doctor Program. “I was shocked and appalled. I made contact with the police […] and we’ve asked for a written apology and an explanation.”
YFS vice-president Darkshika Selvasivam, who did not attend the session, also expressed shock upon hearing the comments.
“I’m appalled by the comment that the police officer has made saying that women should avoid dressing like sluts, and I think it goes to show the inherent misogyny and lack of education,” said Selvasivam, York Federation of Students (YFS) executive.
“I think the officer should be very seriously reprimanded for the comment.”
After the session, Bessner spoke with students and student organizations and noted they, too, expressed concerns about the comment. Bessner proceeded to call 31 Division to demand an apology and explanation.
“Initially it was a call, and the officer said he would get back to me right away. A couple of days had lapsed, so I sent a letter,” she said.
Toronto police spokesperson Constable Wendy Drummond confirmed the incident has been brought to the attention of senior officials and is currently under investigation.
“[This is] definitely something that we take very seriously. This matter […] has been brought to the attention of our professional standards unit and is something we will be looking into,” she said.
However, she could not confirm whether Toronto police intend to issue an official apology.
“We are of the position that if these comments were made, it is definitely something that we will [act on],” she added.
Bessner said she has yet to receive an official apology from the officer. She has also spoken to York security and noted that they were also upset by the comments.
“We have a good relationship with the Toronto Police Service and work collaboratively with them,” said Janice Walls, York spokesperson. “However, we were very surprised and shocked by the comment that was made and we certainly don’t agree with it.”
Bessner argued that such comments make it difficult for victims dealing with sexual assault because they make them feel uncomfortable going to the police for help.
“I think the problem with the constable’s conduct was that he was blaming the victim,” she said. “He’s also not making victims feel safe to go to the police. It’s quite astounding that in 2011 that you hear comments like that from a professional.”
Bessner stressed the importance of officers having proper knowledge about sexual assault cases.
“I think it’s really important that the police […] receive appropriate training on sexual assault, so that statements like this are never made and that they understand the dynamics of sexual assault.”

Cop’s “slut” comment draws backlash from guerrilla activists
SlutWalk Toronto: April 3, 2011
 


I happen to agree with him. You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. And why should you blame the officer? It’s your society which turns women into chattel by making a half naked woman sell a pepsi or sprite bottle. That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. Also, girls today dress like sluts so the whole lot of them take offense when someone tells it how it is. Kudos to you Officer.
Of course the men are responsible who perpetrate this, but seriously, when they chose their victim I’m sure that they searched for someone who was eyecandy to them. They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.
You’re just as bad as him. You’re basically insinuating that ‘hindu or sikh or muslim’ women don’t experience sexual assault. You’re saying that men only want eye candy. You’re the one reducing women to their appearance anyway. What about mentally challenged women who are assaulted? Young girls?  You’re blaming women for men’s crimes. You are furthering ideas that men have uncontrollable urges and act on impulse rather than the fact that they have internatilized misogyny and feel the need to exert control over women due to their own insecurities about masculinity.
I happen to know a lot of decent men who don’t believe that the way a woman is dressed gives you permission to do what you please with her. I also know of a lot of men who think they have that permission, regardless of the situation or your dress.
Educate yourself. Stop being so ignorant. Your victim-blaming rhetoric is not needed here.
Very well said.
It’s not that the victim is being blamed. You can’t change those around you so you should do everything you can to keep yourself save. I agree that people who are covered up also get raped but you try to optimize your security as much as you can… One way is to dress less provocative and make sure you are always around someone you trust when you are at a party and prevent being in unsafe areas. I think the officer used inappropriate words to say what i think he was trying to say or he could just be a really sick person who believes that it’s ok for men to do it if women dress the way they want to.
I agree, if you leave your car keys in plain sight in your car it is more likely to be stolen. This logic can be transferred to the topic at hand  The officer simply made a suggestion without sugar-coating it and he got his point across.
i dont think its about “blaming victims”. it’s about common sense. i think that’s what the officer’s intent was with his comment, though obviously it skirted sensitive territory.
Obviously, as a society we want to ensure all citizens are safe and that we all adhere to the social compact. but that’s not how the world works in reality. While it’d be wonderful to leave precious possessions laying about in plain view unattended, the expectation that we should be able to do this without having them stolen is delusional. That’s why we lock our doors.
Women should also realize that the officer’s intent here was to protect them, not to blame them. Like many fathers, brothers, boyfriends and husbands, men worry a great deal about the safety of the women and girls in their lives. And we know that in a society as hyper-sexualized as ours, that avoiding unwanted attentions often times means applying a conservative approach to how we present ourselves.
Sadly the rhetoric and anger surrounding this discussion does a disservice to the police and to the law abiding citizens. I think it’s a shame generally that we can’t seem to appreciate the nuances of coping with the dangers in life.
Oh, the old comparison to the common sense of locking our door because things get stolen. There are so many things wrong with this analogy.
First, while leaving your doors unlocked makes it easier for someone to rob your house, dressing sexily does nothing to make it easier for someone to rape you. A woman in a long skirt is just as easy to force sex on than a woman in a short skirt, as is a woman in baggy jeans vs hot pants, as is a woman in a t-shirt vs a low-cut top. The clothes I wear do not make myself more or less able to defend against an assault, nor do they prevent me from taking other, more realistic safety precautions such as not being alone while out at night.
Second, all this rhetoric goes on the baseless assumption that the more attractively a woman dresses, the more likely it is a rapist will target her. This is simply not true. Rape is about power and is most often done when it is convenient, as most victims are raped by people they know or who already have some sort of power over them.
Third, everyone seems to be forgetting that sometimes women dress provocatively because the DO want to attract attention – of the consentual kind. Blaming the woman for wanting to look attractive is like blaming a store owner for having such nice and expensive things in his store, after the store is subject to an armed robbery. Clearly the owner should cover up and hide all the nice things so no one wants to steal them.
I completely agree. The part about clothes reminded me of the Italian judge who ruled in favor of the (alleged) rapist on the basis that women wearing jeans are physically impossible to rape.
People seem to like telling women not to dress in sexy clothes, not to get drunk. Wish they’d turn that righteousness to telling men not to rape people.
Are you suggesting that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women never get raped? Sadly they do. And many of them face ridiculous cultural laws in which the rape must have been witnessed by several MEN who are willing to testify on their behalf or they can’t even report it! Also, a shocking number of seniors are raped every year. So the statement that women dressed “respectably” or women that are not considered “attractive” do not fall victim to sex crimes is seriously seriously flawed.
A while a woman who dresses up to go to a club may very well be there to pick up (just like the guys are) she still has the absolute right to decide who picks her up.
I’ve never heard or read of Sikhs or Hindus having a law where male witnesses must have witnessed the rape to testify on behalf of the victim.
FYI I am a Sikh and have lived for years at a time in Canada, India and the UK.
Actually in most western countries convicting a man of rape is difficult-this is reflected in the conviction rate for rape cases (Google it). So to suggest Sikh, Hindu and Muslim rape laws are so woefully inadequate compared to Canadian ones is unfair.
And a women has the right, but how would she enforce it? This is an issue of ideals versus reality and the reality is men are physically stronger than women.
Regardless of if you take self defense classes-9 times out of ten an average grown man could rape a women if he was so inclined.
Its always smarter to avoid attracting unwanted attention anyway.
I’m not saying women don’t have the right to dress how they wish or to dress attractively because after all most men enjoy seeing a beautiful women. But women should exercise common sense too!
I think women need to realize that although the sexes are equal, that does not mean we are the same.
You’re basically saying that you do agree that women shouldn’t dress provocatively.
Come on no one respects a women who picks random guys up at clubs or anywhere else.
I don’t understand why some women don’t respect themselves more. Is it because your trying to emulate some men? Or is that just an excuse-I hear it sometimes ‘men sleep around and they are considered studs so why are women called sluts when they do the same?’ Well thats just a highly reductive and generalized statement that just comes as extremely stupid and not what most sensible people would expect from a university educated women!
Because believe me we are not all promiscuous.
This reflects a bigger problem with our generation we don’t value ourselves enough. Society is way too hyper sexualized (as someone else commented).
Anyway students should spend more time studying and less time messing around at clubs and dressing sexy. Where are your priorities?
FYI-
Please don’t make baseless ignorant generalizations. I am a self-identifying slut, and plenty of people respect me completely. Because many people are not sex-negative fuckwads.
I like to have sex with people I like. It’s enjoyable, fun, good exercise, and generally makes my life more awesome. I am safe, use multiple birth control methods, and get tested regularly. How, exactly am I not respecting myself? I am doing what I choose when I choose with people I choose. I empower myself in my own sexuality rather than letting any societal construct dictate my actions.
However, the most important thing here is that I CONSENT. No matter what the context, no matter what I’m wearing, who I’m with, where I am, I expect everyone to establish consent before having sex with me. I might be dressed sexily because I’m looking for sex, or not, but the way I dress NEVER implies that just anyone can have sex with me without consent. Nor does the way I dress render anyone incapable of making decisions for themselves about whether to rape me.
You are right about one thing and that is our society is hyper-sexualized, but only in that it glorifies sex WITHOUT putting the equal necessary effort into promoting consent work and sex-positivity. We make sex tantalizing without making it empowering. But we need to empower ourselves in our sexuality, not by slut-shaming, but by encouraging everyone to make intelligent, informed, consentual decisions about sex.
Also, in all my sluttitude, I got all A’s and B’s all four years at university. Explain to me what those exactly have to do with each other?
How dare you suggest that a woman leading a sexual life on her terms doesn’t respect herself.
“a women”
what
“a university educated women”
what
“is way too hyper sexualized”
redundant phrasing
Quit school; Marry soon; Let party girls party. You give yourself too much credit and respect, and others too little.
Thank you for replying and yes very well said!  It’s sad that there is still such ignorance like that out there…
…and oh it is Brittaney i agree with if that was unclear.
Sexual assault has nothing to do withthe way the victim is dressed but the sickness of the rapists mind! 80 year old women and little girls get assaulted too! dont make excuses for these sick bastards!
The problem is that this is being made into a women’s rights issue when it is broader than that.  For example, I should be able to walk through Regent Park at 3 AM carrying a clear briefcase filled with cash, but I wouldn’t because it would greatly increase the odds of attracting trouble.  This is an exaggerated example, but the point is valid.  Women should be able to dress as they please and go where they please, when they please, but there are people with no respect for the law or other people.  The common sense solution is to avoid drawing their attention.  It doesn’t make it right, but too many people are in here arguing that women should be able to dress as they please and not be sex objects, when no one actually disagrees with that.
The cop chose a poor word, and everyone has keyed in on that word, but his point is valid.  You should be able to dress as you please, but in an area where there is a history of sexual predation, you have to adapt and take precautions.  The vast majority of men who respect the law and the rights of women are not your issue here.
You are one of the biggest idiot douchebags I have ever read but I guess thats the downfall of the internet, you have to read the opinions of people who think they actually know something about a highly complex topic- that of gender, misogyny and politics. Get educated before you open your mouth. You seem to know nothing about which you are speaking of and you look like a fool. I HATE people like you.
You discredit your own argument as lacking intelligence by engaging in ad hominim attack. Your comment adds absolutely nothing to the conversation.
I agree with and am delighted at your rage and indignation — but I have to interject at “downfall of the internet.” Such a phrase suggests that the internet was ever “up” to begin with; i.e. that it was ever used as an outlet for anything more than toxic opinions amplified by anonymity, moronic acronym-and-emoticon-based “conversation,” and porn. Sorry for interrupting, thanks for listening.
Wow. Way to go buddy. Misogyny and racism at it’s best/worst, right there. Do you really think that rapists care what a woman is wearing? Women who are dressed conservatively get raped, too. The only thing a woman can do to avoid being raped is to not get raped. Seriously, next time, educate yourself before you decide to put your two cents in.
I was raped while wearing an ankle-length dress with a high neck and long sleeves.  I had NOTHING showing.  The only person responsible for rape is the RAPIST.  PERIOD.  Rape is not about sexual attraction, it’s about power and hatred of women.  Educate yourself before you open your mouth.
Bullying and murder are about power and control, rape is about satiating one’s lust for sex. Power and control over the victim just happens to be the method used to satiate said lust. Have you ever heard of a rapist raping someone he couldn’t overpower? That NEVER happens.
You don’t have to dress provocatively to be raped, but rape is one of only three ways to satiate sexual lust. The remaining two methods are consensual sex, and masturbation. If you can think of a fourth method, please, let me know so that I will know too.
Joe, please tell me you’re being sarcastic.
How is it that you profess to know so much about the underlying causes of rape? Should I assume that you’ve being researching rape statistics and studying the psychology of rapists for the last 20 years?
Or have you raped before? Did you commit such a horrible crime just so you could get off? Because to be honest, I don’t know a single man or woman who would rape someone, who would put another human being through the terrible hell of sexual assault and rape, just so they could get laid.
And to anyone on this post who DARES to suggest that women are raped because of what they’re wearing, how they’re acting, if they’re flirting or not, or if they’re “asking for it,” then how do you explain that 1 in every 3 women in the US army is raped?

My apologies. I tried to find Canadian statistics, but to no avail. Instead, I have an anecdote. A friend of mine just came back from doing a tour in Afghanistan (she’s Canadian Forces). One day, her commanding officers had a meeting with all the females in camp. They gave the women a little whistle, and told the women that if they were ever attacked by a man, to blow the whistle for help. A f&%ing whistle? Really? Canadian Forces can’t do better and maybe find ways to deter potential perpetrators?
But you don’t need a Phd to figure the reasoning behind a statement such as ‘dressing a little less provocative’.
You are a women and as such you will never understand how men think irrespective of how much education you have-its experience versus sitting in an ivory tower. Some men are nice as pie, where as some may appear nice on the outside and yet be very evil minded on the inside (e.g. Ted Bundy).
In war a lot of the rules in civilian peace time society are thrown out-this happens regardless of the Geneva Convention and is a sad reality.
I think we seriously need to bring women down to earth-you are not the same as men (yes, you are of course equal I’m not disputing that!). Men can be brutal towards one another-how the hell do you think you will stand up to that? (Unless you are some sort of Martial Arts expert).
The fact that someone would call this “Fair Game” is sickening.
A woman has the right to dress however she chooses. Whether she chooses to show skin, or cover herself should not affect the fact that any sexual assault is fully the responsibility of the perpetrator.
It seems to be a typical defense response to call a woman a whore or to imply that she was “asking for it”.
This post says that “of course the men are responsible”, yet it is said that by choosing unrevealing clothing then a woman is less likely to be assaulted, putting responsibility in the hands of the victim.
I guess I’d better start wearing a parka at all times so that no men will see my body and be driven into a sexual frenzy… don’t want to get myself attacked or anything…
It’s a shame that people still hold these misogynist ideas in Canada in 2011, you’d think we’d be past this.
What a disgusting and misogynistic human being you are. It is people like you and comments like the one you’ve made that have created and sustained a patriarchal rape culture. As a Muslim woman who is a survivor of rape, I can tell you that having your body covered has NOTHING to do with why sexual violence occurs. Sexual violence is about POWER AND CONTROL, not the clothes you wear, and not about being “eye candy”. The comments that you and the police officer have ignorantly made do nothing except re-victimize and re-traumatize victims of sexual violence, and do NOTHING to put blame or punishment upon the individuals who perpetrate such monstrous crimes. Please get yourself a REAL EDUCATION while you are at York, and never make such hateful, disgusting, shameful comments about women who have survived sexual violence again. I am disgusted to go to school with a human being as deplorable as you. May you NEVER have to feel like a survivor of sexual violence and be blamed for the lifelong trauma and horror you experience.
Anecdote is not an appropriate means to determine if fully covered women experience less sexual assault than sluts.
It does prove one instance of its occurrence on a fully covered woman, however, which is more than some are willing to admit is a possible situation. In addition, you have proffered no valid research demonstrating the contrary, instead hoping that your simplistic refutation of an assertion will lead others to believe that its opposite is true.
Fair Game, you are completely right. In the history of the world, a hindu/sikh/muslim woman has NEVER EVER been raped. Women, if you don’t want to get raped, stop being “eyecandy” to men. You should always think of possible rapists while getting dressed and going outside. In fact, why do women even bother going outside? Sure, you could dress conservatively to ward off rapist, but you might accidentally smile seductively or brush your hand against your breast- things that will lure the rapist and force him to rape you.
I’m actually confused why a woman is Assistant Dean of the JD program. Are they even allowed to vote??
Marry me…
A women has a right to wear whatever she wants without fearing sexual assault. Are you actually suggesting that before leaving her house a women is supposed to consider if she looks like an “eye candy” to some sociopath or a pervert with no self restraint? You should be deeply ashamed of yourself, especially for putting the word “freedoms” together with the garbage you wrote.
So by your reasoning their are no rape victims in muslim countries that force women to cover themselves from head to toe.  What planet are you from, because you surely aren’t  from this one.
What?! What’s like saying that children who have suffered from sexual assault deserve it.  Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts, and telling girls not to as a step of sexual assault is bound to make victims uncomfortable.  Victim =/= enabler in most cases like this.
If your mom was sexually assaulted, do you think you would say “well, were you dressed like a slut, mom?” Or do you think it’d maybe be best just to assign the blame where it belongs (hint: not with the victim) and be supportive.
“Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts”
you suck just as much as the person you are replying to .
It is abominable that someone would ever have this opinion, as it is exactly this type of ignorance and misogyny that breeds the sense of entitlement which feeds behaviors such as sexual assault.  Rape is a war crime; not because a whole village, city, or country is filled with women who are ‘asking for it’ by dressing provocatively, but rather, because rape is about POWER.  Even more disgusting is the fact that you seem to think that women who dress in a way that covers their bodies don’t get raped. Rape is one of the many things a man can use to wield his physical power over a woman (and a man or a child, by the way), so in case you missed the last fifty years, women are people now too. Idiot.
its not just females that can be raped.  I was raped as far as the topic im sorry i have to agree with something 9 times out of 10 it is the women that dress provocative that males rape.  It does make me sick to my stumach that this happens though.  i do have a heart.  I know 3 females that have been raped and one mail that was raped and thats me.
And you didn’t deserve it, even though you’re an asshole. Were you dressed like a slut? That doesn’t make it your fault.
Amen sister or brother!  Thank you “Winter”!
I just want to add that thinking the way “Fair Game” does is still universal amongst many societies.  I was teaching English in Japan in 2001.  We threw a party for one of my roommates. That night a foreigner attending the party slipped me the date rape drug.  Even though, I’m pretty sure that I wasn’t actually rapped per se he did have his way with me.  I remember bits and pieces.  He by the way was a fellow English teacher and not a Japanese citizen.  I did end up reporting the crime at the hospital and little did I know, police then become automatically involved.  The reason I bring this up is that amongst all the stuff I was going through at the time, the police while investigated made me find the clothes that I was wearing at the party that night.  At the time, and for a moment the act of photographing my clothes made me feel like I had asked for it.  Now of course I know better.  Making women feel like it is their fault due to their dress really does re-victimize the victim.
Actually, the statistics show that a woman’s appearance and pattern of dress have absolutely NOTHING to do with her risk of being sexually assaulted by a male.  Muslim women DO get sexually assaulted. Older women DO get sexually assaulted.  Little girls DO get sexually assaulted.  Moreover, the majority of male-perpetrated sexual assaults against women take place in the HOME.  I can wear baggy sweat pants on the street AND in the home, and statistically, it will do absolutely nothing to ‘protect’ me.  Perpetrators are responsible for choosing violence.  Believing otherwise is sexist ignorance.
So Fair Game:
Let me get this straight… what you’re saying is that:
a. Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women (which by the way, all of whom apparently dress “traditionally”) do not get raped because they are covered up.
b. Only hot girls get raped. No one else gets sexually assaulted.
I would normally suggest that someone as ignorant as you pick up a book or a newspaper, but I’m not sure that even that could save you. I would site some statistics about the sadly high number of women that get raped in all different countries of all different religions and demographics, or even explain to you that a woman has the right to dress how she wants without being sexually assaulted, no matter how provocative it is, or even question what a slippery slope your argument is– next you’ll be saying that if a woman has a drink or two, she’s also “asking” to be raped. But it’s not worth my breath. If you truly believe a woman who shows some skin is apparently “fair game” for sexual assault, as you put so repulsively in your pathetic attempt to be clever, you are ignorant beyond repair. Making excuses for those who would sexually assault innocent women, no matter how they are dressed, is lower than low.
As if infants, the elderly, and women in proper hijab aren’t raped every day.
Nice work, Mr. Troll.
You’re a pig. Sexual assault should never be the storm cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim, especially a woman, looks like.
That’s not true. You can be wearing jeans and t-shirt with nothing revealing and you could still be a victim. If the community start thinking that victims are usually “sluts” as you put… the victim (who is already going through hell for what has happened to her) will start thinking that she is disgusting and blame herself for what happened.
There are people out there that think the victim was probably dressed “slutty” and got what they deserve. It’s those kind of thinking that make victims try to hide what happened because THEY will be viewed as “disgusting” by the community and NOT the perpetrator.
Please understand that it is NOT the victim’s fault. No matter how they are dressed. Why should the victim get condemned by the society for being a victim? Is it their fault? They dressed to impress not to imply that they want to be sexually harassed.
Truly an idiotic comment. There is absolutely no excuse for rape and what a woman is wearing is nobody elses business. Muslim and Sikh women are raped regardless of dress. It’s not a question of clothing but of mens attitudes, such as the one you voiced. Is there a set of conditions that makes it justifiable to violate a persons physical autonomy? The comment has a very wide range of implications and all of them are negative towards women and victims of crime. There is always an excuse by the perpetrators to try to justify their actions.
I think If you were to dress less like a ‘slut’  you might actually decrease your chances at getting raped. How hard is that for you feminazis to understand?
See my response to Fair Game.  It applies to you as well.
@Feminism stinks, Sometimes, people have a hard time understanding things that don’t make sense. Let me educate you:
Utah State University Sexual Assault and Anti Violence Information:
Myth: Rape victims provoke the attach by wearing provocative clothing.
A Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only
4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior on the part
of the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple
as a glance).
Most convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.
Victims range in age from days old to those in their nineties,
hardly provocative dressers.
Utah State University

I fail to see how not wanting to blame victims for the actions of the perpetrator of a crime, when statistics don’t suggest that “not dressing like a slut” helps, makes one a “feminazi.”
I’m pretty sure my niece could never force someone to assault her, so I guess I must be a feminazi.
I read in the news about elderly women who got repeatedly sexually assaulted by the same perpetrator who would break into the home in the middle of the night.
Yea, shame on those sexy grannies who are seducing men into committing rape!
@Feminismstinks: please do the world a favor and REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS PLANET IN THE FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY!  may I recommend walking off a bridge?
Firstly, women are raped regardless of what they’re wearing.  Secondly, stop placing blame onto women.  No one WANTS to get raped.  Wearing a certain outfit is not an invitation to rape me.  Fuck off.
i agree that it would help however is not a solution and proper security would go a lot farther then longer hem lines.
are you ill ? who doesn’t know that rape has nothing to do with sex, it’s about power and humiliation. are you saying that women who don’t dress like “sluts” never get raped ? or women that people may not deem “attractive” ? did you know that 45% of rape victims were assaulted by their partners, compaired to only 8% who were assaulted by strangers ? this makes it hard for me to think that women are raped because of the way they dress.
you said yourself that images of half naked women are used to sell products and this is half the problem. society objectifies women into nothing more than sex objects WHEREEVER YOU LOOK. and opinions like this do not make it any better.

And what exactly does “getting treated like a slut” mean to you? Getting raped? Sorry to point out the obvious, but even sluts aren’t out to get raped, they are out to have consensual sex. A man is not some kind of wild animal species that can’t control its urges when it sees a short skirt. Also, rape is usually not about “eye candy” but about asserting power over the victim. And victims are often not “slutty”-looking girls, they can be anyone from your daughter to your grandmother. Your comment is ridiculously asinine and ignorant. Hope nobody you care about ever gets attacked.
You do know that women in traditional clothing get raped all the time, right? The more “traditional” a society, the higher its incident of rape (including marital rape), and IN ADDITION to the higher incidents of rape these women are actively discouraged from seeking justice. You have a serious problem. How about teaching men NOT to RAPE. Dick.
In the immortal words of Antoine Dodson, “You are so dumb.  You are really dumb.  For real.”
Other commenters have eloquently covered all the reasons why you are so dumb.  That is all.
Oh I love that song!!!
and it certainly applies to all rapists and rapist supporters!
Oh, of course you are right.
And, if you are robbed, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought stuff that someone might want.  If you are carjacked, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought a car.   If any other crime happens to you, it must be your fault for having something the criminal might want.
This all makes perfect sense.
Well Fair Game is completely right. I mean Hindu, Sikh or Muslim women are never raped. Western women only started showing more skin around the 1920’s and that’s right about the time that women started being raped. Coincidence? I think not. Thinking back to when I was raped at 17, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved sweater. Must of been asking for it right? If only I’d had a burka on to clearly indicate that I wasn’t interested in being held down and raped.  I never told anyone about it because I felt like it was somehow my fault. I felt ashamed. I shouldn’t of let myself be in that situation. The comments made by Fair Game and the officer are the reason so many women never come forward when sexually assaulted.  That officer should be fired. Fair Game, if you have any females close to you, try talking to them, chances are one of them has been sexually assaulted.  Ask your mother, your sister or friend if they were asking for it when it happened to them. Or then again, maybe you don’t have many females in your life that you’re close to. Wouldn’t that be a shock.
You’re an idiot. Men walk around showing skin all the time, no shirts, for example. What is a “slut”? Aren’t men the definition of the word? Also, you may want to look up rape victims–they are the elderly, they are the two year olds, they are the nine-year-old male, they are in prison. Get an education.
You do realize that Middle Eastern women who wear veils, abayas and burqas are also victims of rape? In fact, victims of rape in Middle Eastern countries are subject to public lashings and honor killings because they “shamed” their family by being the victim of a crime.
Rape isn’t about sex, it’s about controlling and humiliating another person. Men can be raped too, so can children and elderly women. What would you attribute that to? Slutty looking 5 year olds? Please.
I feel sorry for anyone you know personally that is a survivor, because clearly you have no idea about the true psychological motivations of rape.
@Fair Game, Rapists will rape people regardless of what they are wearing. No one asks or deserves to be raped. The only people responsible for rape are rapists and rape apologists like you.
considering the fact that the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows (relative, friend, date etc.) I’m certain that when “they” chose their victim, it likely was not at random and probably had nothing to do with how she was dressed.
in fact, dressing in a manner that exudes (and requires) confidence would probably deter a man from assaulting them.
nothing a woman says, wears or does warrants being sexually assaulted.  it is a act of power and control that is perpetrated by someone who has neither.  it is a demeaning and shattering experience that no one asks for. and if you think for one moment, Fair Game, that Sikh, Muslim or Hindu women do not experience this kind of torture, you need to put down your excalibur and pick up a G and M.
wow. check your privilege, asshole.
http://sap.mit.edu/content/pdf/male_privilege.pdf
the definition of “slut” is so loose that it can apply to a woman who has had multiple sex partners, and to a 14 year old girl in a short skirt.
what the crappy thing is, women are judged on EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR PERSONALITIES. a woman is not a slut for enjoying sex or wearing revealing clothing that is not always worn to attract others, but to make the woman feel good.
rape and sexual assault are ALWAYS initiated by the presence of a rapist. the woman (and sometimes men are raped too! think about that!) is NEVER asking for unwanted sexual advances.
you sir, can fuck off.
Even though I didn’t have sex (of any kind) until I was 19, I was labeled a slut in middle school just for having large breasts, which were always covered by baggy t-shirts.
I totally agree with you on this one, girls who want to dress in a certain “sluttish”  way, they have to pay for the consequences. 5/5!
“The way a woman dresses or acts does not cause or prevent sexual assault; an attacker rapes someone because they want to exert power and control over him or her. The attacker is solely responsible for the crime. However, this responsibility is lost in translation through the police, the courts and the media.”
from: Don’t Rape (http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/3497)
Curl up and die please. You’ll do everyone a favour.
Since when is the onus on women to make men behave like gentlemen? If you can’t keep your pants zipped, YOU have the problem, not the victims!!
Rape is more often than not, an act of dominance.  Sociopathic individuals will commit rape to assert dominance and inflict harm on an individual because that aspect is sexually arousing to them; they do not usually rape someone based on how that person is dressed.  On the contrary, rapists generally look for someone who has low self-esteem (no confident, sexy outfit?) and may not put up much of a fight.
Yeah only the issue is the disgusting and unacceptable crime of the perpetrator, not their sexual preference. Implying that a woman is somehow deserving of sexual assault because of what she wears implies that the crime AGAINST LAW of sexually assaulting someone can be justified. Any grown man that is rational and worth a trial can presumably control his sexual inclinations around a girl in revealing clothing.
Fair Game is a troll.
To call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.  Clearly, what you said is a reflection of what and how much you know about our society.  First of all, sexual violence has NOTHING to do with sex.  It is about POWER, HATRED AND VIOLENCE against another human being.  Second of all, to say “wouldn’t choose a Hindu, Sikh or a Muslim because they are covered in traditional clothing” is an absolute horrible thing to say.  Fair Game, go educate yourself about violence and please keep your comments about our society problems to yourself.  Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.

It’s sad to know that there are people out there that concludes that women who dresses provocatively are “asking” for this type of crime to happen to them.  One does not have to dress like a “slut” in order to be raped.  The responsibility lies in the fact that our society needs to educate people of all cultures about violence.  It is disappointing that a police officer, someone whom you think that will serve and protect you and your city would lower himself to a comment like that.
Stupid troglodyte!
Some years ago I was raped by a man I considered to be one of my closest friends, in my own home, while clad in a decidedly unsexy sweatsuit and bunny slippers. The only thing making me attractive to the bastard was my gender, my trust and my availability.
hey so if I think you’re dressed like a douchebag I should get to beat you up, right? After all, it’s YOUR fault for asking for it! You’ve got the face and clothing of a douche just begging to get beat up!
first of all, you’re disgusting. Secondly if you dress in a way that I decide is “slutty” I suppose you’d be okay with it if I violently destroyed you too. I dress how I want to because it makes me happy, I shouldnt have to hide myself because people like you can’t control yourself. I hope you never have to experience the horrors of rape but if you do maybe you’d finally shut the hell up
Hey, little boys get raped by priests. INFANTS get raped by sick men.  Hell, animals get raped by sickos. I guess they ALL asked for it.
How dare that cute baby wear nothing but a diaper?  I guess it’s rape time!
DON’T APOLOGIZE FOR RAPISTS! the only one at fault is the rapist!!!
You’re a troll.  Wise up, people.
your comment made me so angry!
so i guess that its your fault if i (fill in the blanks) you!
you have some serious problems…
You’re absolutely right. Because no woman wearing a burqa has ever been sexually assaulted.
Fair Game: I know I shouldn’t feed the trolls here (read: you) but I’m going to anyway because I have nothing better to do.
A) What does it mean to “dress like a slut?”  Is it the showing of skin that makes you think she must have too much sex (which is what I assume you mean by “slut,” a woman who has more sex than you deem appropriate)?  Or is it the too-much-sex issue itself?
B) Calling a woman a slut is silly, because what constitutes a slut varies depending on the perspective of the person doing the slut-shaming, but worse than silly, it’s a means of silencing the legitimate concerns of women.  Women are called sluts for what they wear (even if they’re virgins,) they’re called sluts if they have monogamous sex with one partner (if they’re the wrong person,) they’re called sluts if they have the audacity to have had multiple partners BY CHOICE.  None of these things make it ok for that person to be raped.  Women aren’t “asking” to be raped if they dress in revealing clothing.
C)Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women, along with women of every ethnicity and religion around the world are raped daily, regardless of what they wear.  One reason this is allowed to continue is because of the prevailing views that rape is the fault of the victim and not of the rapist.  When a woman gets raped, every sexual experience she’s ever had, her clothing, whether or not she chose to imbibe that evening, and whether or not she chose to go somewhere alone, are all dragged up and used against her.  None of these things have any bearing on her rape- whoever she chose to have sex with in the past has no bearing on this rapist.  As a matter of fact, whether she’s had consensual sex with the rapist in the past has no bearing- anybody has a right at any time, regardless of sexual history, to not give consent to engage in sexual activity, and the only one to blame for the ensuing rape is the rapist.
You’re right. about the last part. it’s the perpetrator who is at fault, not the woman. it’s not the woman’s fault the perpetrator is a raging sociopath.
what an incredible double standard. society love women that dress like “sluts.” we see it everywhere, from movies to commercials to ads, all to appeal to the male gaze. but it’s immediately jumped to as an excuse for rape.
not to mention, a very small percentage of rape is the “stranger in the bushes on the wrong side of town at night.” Most rapes happen in the victim’s or rapist’s home and they almost always know eachother.
you’re an idiot.
Attitudes like this do nothing to dispel the problem. Women (and men and transgender folk) of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, levels of intelligence, and physicalities experience rape. Research has largely indicted that rapists are not necessarily attacking others due to an insatiable sex drive, but because it’s a way to exert control. Instead of victim-blaming, perhaps we should focus our energies into educating people to not become rapists. I, for one, feel that the officer’s suggestion only perpetuates the attitude that it’s up to the potential victims to avoid getting raped, rather than that it’s a person’s responsibility not to rape.
In no way is a woman responsible to dressing to deter rape. This is nothing but victim blaming and as  a social worker who worked with victims of sexual assualt I can assure you that the women who are assaulted are of all shapes/sizes and appearances. It has little to do with sex and more to do with power and control of another person.
Women get raped often in more nylon countries where the burkas or niquabs are mandatory so your assumption is inherently wrong.
While I agree with your views about the current objectification of women in our society, I completely disagree that the way in which she dresses means that she is a justified target of sexual assault. I’m sorry, but no.
A woman has the absolute, undeniable right to walk down the streets of Toronto completely naked without having someone assault them. A woman has the right to walk around dressed head-to-toe in full snow gear without being sexually assaulted.
Point is, no matter what a woman is wearing, now matter how much or how little she is wearing, she has a right to not be sexually assaulted.
Perhaps she invites people to treat her with a certain attitude (ie. treat her like a slut) if she dresses in such a fashion, but in NO WAY is that an excuse for her to be violated. No way, no how.
I was raped when I was asleep in my bed, where I SHOULD have had every reason to feel safe. Obviously you don’t know shit about this subject, women in every manner of clothing and every situation get raped. It doesn’t matter what you where you where you are, the rapist is the one who did wrong.
Actually there’s nothing to prove that. Most rapists know their victim. What she chooses to wear on any given night has nothing to do with the attack. In fact, some rapists will even target women who dress more conservatively. Women in burkas are raped all the time. As are women in long skirts, fatigues, jumpsuits, ballroom dresses, shorts, pajamas ratty bathrobes and curlers. Furthermore, the term “slutty” can mean different things. To some people it means nothing but boots and to others it means visible wrists. Telling a group of women that they can avoid rape by not dressing slutty even aside from the fact that it’s a huge insult doesn’t add anything constructive. There is nothing a woman can wear that wouldn’t be considered provocative by someone. Responsibility needs to be shouldered by those responsible. A victim of rape is not a slut. They are a victim.
Fair Game, I know rape is scary and not something you want to face, but it’s cowardly to blame the victim. And if a guy really can’t get any without raping or can’t control his impulses, then he probably is not mentally equipped to be having sex in the first place. That’s his problem. It’s not the victim’s fault and I think it’s a little weird that you would side with such a loser.
Sorry, Fair Game, sexual assault is not a crime of passion, but one of violence. Read the research; all types of women, including fully covered women and women in their 80’s are assaulted on a regular basis. Stop trying to blame the victim.
I agree.  These canadian women are dressing too much vulgar.  In india, women are more traditional and we do not have such things.  but here i seeing many women dressing like sluts (not that i am wanting to complain).  at school, indian girls are dressed conservative and theyr not experience rape but other girls who dressing vulgar and showing body are teasing people.  police man said a good point in my opinion.
Can you explain why old women in nursing homes have been raped by male nurses?
Or why children are raped?
I seriously doubt elderly women or children “dress like sluts”. And saying Hindu,Sikh and Muslim women wouldn’t be raped? Please explain why thousands Hindu and Muslim women who actually *report* being raped to authorities never receive any justice?
I guess those ladies traditional clothing was just too….ah, traditional? And that is why they were raped?
I guess I’m just too much of an ignorant woman to understand any of this.
I am deeply disturbed by this line of thinking. By your point of view, I (a human being, as well as a woman) should be blamed for the choices and actions of others whom I have absolutely no control over, because of how much fabric is covering my body! Does this not seem outrageous to say the least? If you were to leave your house carrying a wallet and there is some indication that that wallet is presently on your body, does that give someone the right to steal it? If someone were to tell you that it’s not the pickpocket’s fault, because you enticed him by taking the wallet out of your pocket to pay for whatever it is you buy, would that be acceptable by your standards?
This makes me sick to my stomach. Men are not treated in this fashion, so what in this world that you seem to live in gives you the right to judge women like this?
FYI: sexual assault is a crime of power, control and violence, not because the assailent is so turned on they have to sexually assault someone and people who observe religious conduct by covering themselves also are victims of sexual assault you are an ignorant person who has no idea what you’re talking about.
I am always amazed how victim blaming can be so one sided… Would you ever blame a victim of a hold-up? What about of a car-jacking? A break and enter? Of course not, it is patently absurd; however, if police officers have the ignorance to blame rape survivors then they should also hold these other groups partially responsible in motivating their own attacks:
Perhaps the man who is robbed for his rollex should be held accountable. He dared to ‘show-off the goods’ (ie: his material wealth) and so he should expect to be robbed… right?
What about the old lady driving the $100 00.00+ luxury vehicle? She deserves to be car-jacked. How could she drive around in a car like that and expect not to be car-jacked?
What about the nice couple who worked hard and bought their dream home? Should they be held accountable when they are victims of a home invasion or burglary?
If we take the same logic offered by this Toronto officer than it follows that he would recommend that all these other groups should avoid wearning expensive jewellery,driving nice cars, and owning nice homes in order to be less likely to be victims of robbery, car-jacking, and burglary. OF COURSE THIS IS ABSURD!!!! THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE IGNORANCE AND MISOGYNY INHERENT IN BLAMING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. USE YOUR BRAINS PEOPLE…
You are completely wrong, most rape victims are introverted, slightly desperate looking, who are alone, rapists dont go for confident people, they are scavengers that look for easy prey like cowards… only really charismatic sexual predetors/cereal killers go for pretty/slutty confident girls but they have a certain something they are looking for….
those cereal killers will Trix you, Corn Pop you in the kneecap, rob you of your Life, and all the witnesses will be able to say is “I didn’t get a good look at his face, he just shot the guy and Bran.”
I apologize to everyone who is nauseated by puns.
I was going to say “I hope you never have daughters” but I’m almost more scared of what you’d teach your sons!
Rape is not a compliment, you fucking asshole.
Fair Game, show me the statistic that proves Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women “in their traditional clothing” are raped less than other women.
You show a lack of understanding of sexual assault and society in general. You express racist and sexist idealogies. The majority of rapists do not even remember what their victim was wearing. Your comments are uneducated and offensive to both men and women. You imply that men cannot control their minds and bodies, you demean women young and old. Women should not have to fear violence and degredation. Think of your mother, sister or daughter – if she walked down the street naked and was raped could you tell her to her face that she ‘deserved’ sexual violence? The only people who can stop rape are rapists.  Nothing a human being wears, says or does justifies sexual assault.
You’re an idiot. By your logic if some pervert that’s into feet sees someone wearing open toed shoes he has the right to rape her? I don’t care if a woman is walking down the street naked, that doesn’t give anyone the right to sexually assault her. Just because *you* (or whoever) deems a woman a slut doesn’t make her so.
How DARE you, FairGame!
I was drugged, and gang-raped by 6 men I trusted. I WASN’T drinking alcohol, I WASN’T at a club/party, and I WASN’T “dressed like a slut”.
I was on a field trip, in front of a motel in the middle of the wilderness, at a bonfire. I was dressed in sweats and a sweatshirt. How does that scream: “Rape me! I’m slutty!” I’m not even that good looking, and I’m certainly not afraid to admit that! I’m not one of your Top Models, nor do I dress sexy.
I was raped because I’m an independent woman and I don’t conform or allow myself to be peer-pressured or manipulated into doing things. They saw me as a challenge, but knew my character enough to know that I would fight them, tooth and nail, if they tried anything. Which is why they drugged me. Made it easier for them to violate me.
You’re a misogynistic pig! I bet you hate women–which must mean you like men. If you like men that much, leave us women the hell alone and go back to that rock you’re living under. Sure, you’ll have to look for a little while, because it’s back in the Dark Ages.
While I agree that many women dress too provocatively, that has NOTHING to do with rape.  I was definitely NOT “eye candy” when I was raped; I am overweight and dress to hide it!  Some people are just sick, whether it is a man or a woman attempting the rape.
Hey fair game it is a womens god given right to dress how ever the fuck she pleases.  What kind of man are you that you don’t like to see women in provacative clothing?
Not everything the police or the government feed you is right.  Go on thinking that you fucking drone.  OBEY, SLEEP, CONSUME, REPEAT.  Follow those orders and you’l be a model citizen
Dear Fair Game,
What does it mean exactly to be ‘dressed like a slut’? Even if you were somehow able to come up with a clear cut definition, what gives you the right to determine it for the rest of society? Moreover, does getting ‘treated like a slut’ entail sexual assault – are you advocating that those who dress ‘like sluts’ ought to be sexually assaulted? This is absolutely unacceptable, and quite a dangerous comment; what’s next, telling women they shouldn’t wear high-heels because they will get sexually assaulted?
Furthermore, as Canadians, we all share this society – no matter what religion, gender, and race you are from. Surely, in the 21st century, we have all come to realize the importance of the freedoms and civil liberties we enjoy; to shoot them down, and argue – in your case – for something that is completely a matter of personal taste is not only appalling, but quite barbaric. I certainly agree that our society has problems, and you are correct in pointing out how the media portrays women in advertisements, and how sex appeal is used to sell goods in the market – but that is an entirely separate issue, for which sexual assault victims should NOT be blamed – It simply has nothing to do with them.
What could you possibly mean by ‘the evil terrorists’? Surely you are not implying that those who perpetrate sexual assault are terrorists; as wrong, and as guilty, as both activities are, they are simply not related. Please take care to understand the different terms, the motivations lying behind such activities, and the purposes for which they are conducted.
In addition, when an officer of the law – whose job it is to protect citizens, prevent crimes, and arrest criminals – is taking part in a safety information session, he is not representing his own person,  personal values, nor his personal moral outlook on society; he is representing the Toronto Police Department. As such, his flagrantly misogynistic, sexist, and simply revolting opinions should be kept to himself, until such time that he is no longer representing a public security organization, whose aim is to protect individuals, not punish the victim of crimes.
Lastly, if you took care to read, and study about such phenomena, you would understand that they dynamic that underlies sexual assault is not at all similar to what you have described. Please take care to become more informed, because your utter arrogance and ignorance can only assume the role of a burden for a fine society such as our own.
rape is wrong. even if she dressed like a ‘slut’, a ‘slut’ is  NOT asking for rape, she is asking for consensual sex (and to be paid for it).
It seems as if sluts don’t believe in personal responsibility. These poor cops have to deal with sluts who refuse to grow up: http://goo.gl/ODyno
Let’s address a few of your comments. Let’s pay attention to all victims not just the one’s you may secretly covet. Are you saying elderley woman are eye candy? Little boys are eye candy? In fact there is absolutely no correlation between rape/ molestation and what the victim is wearing! I have stats to back this up. Do you honestly belive Hindu, sikh & muslim women are not sexually abused?!! It’s just not reported because those women would be blamed & punished for it. In many middle eastern countries its legal for a man to rape his wife! Are you excusing a violent act & abuse of power? Is that not like saying his car deserved to be stolen because he drives a BMW? That house deserves to be broken into & robbed because they have a nice tv? Rape/molestation are NEVER the victims fault!! It doesn’t matter what they wear/drink, which family member/uncle/teacher the trust or where they walk/work! The criminal is crossing a line & violating someone else because they are selfish, immature, have no control, have no honor, have a corrupt religion etc. Perhaps what you’re saying is that if you’re to choose a victim you would go for eye candy? You threatened, frightened & are not able to handle sexy women as your equal so that would make perfect sense. (It’s often about control & power issues not about sex.) I may not agree with the use of women in advertising in N.America but I’m glad I am free to dress & express myself as I wish. My final thought: Sex should be enjoyable, sacred, spiritual, sensual, fun and CONSENTUAL for both partners. I hope for your partners sake that you at least come to accept that. Women have just as much right as men to find pleasure in their sexuality without fear or rape.
rape is a war tactic, all who take part in it are therefore barbarians. people were raping before there was such a thing as “dressing like a slut”-and hindu, sikh, and muslim women get raped every day. is you support rape-and you do, according to what you’ve written (no bs one-line disclaimer at the end can hide that, just as no burqa can hide a woman from a rapist) than you are a moron, and anyone who is not blatantly against rape is FOR the metaphorical rape of his own people (rape historically was inflicted upon women with full knowledge that to destroy an entire group, one must destroy the women which are the core).
Rape is not about being turned on, nor is it about pepsi. It is about inflicting power upon another human being. It has nothing to do with outfits that turn people on-if it did, than cops would be raped all the time.
“Fair Game”, I am a Hindu and grew up in Mumbai. I wore ‘decent’ Indian clothes – salwar kameezes, fully covered my arms, legs & the rest of my body – except my face. I was molested in public transport on a daily basis. Men would feel me up and stare & say lewd things.
I am not the only one who faced this on a daily basis. Every girl I know who grew up in India and stepped out of her home was harassed.
Will your next suggestion be to stay at home & avoid going out, if you’re a woman?
You’re an ignorant misogynist and a clueless privileged man who has never had to face the humiliation of being touched or treated inappropriately.
How about this phrase: “Men can avoid sexually assaulting women by not sexually assaulting women.”
@Fair Game, “You can avoid acting like a misogynistic neanderthal by not acting like a misogynistic neanderthal”.
LOL @ women getting sexually assaulted due to the way they dress. Nothing but ignorance and hate.
You’re right – women ask to be raped. WHAT AN IDIOT. It’s people like you who make it hard for victims to ever ask for help .
So why is it that men who walk around public parks bare chested, only shorts on aren’t asking to be “raped”?!
We are all human, In our country, in this day and age we still have a major double standard!!
Yeah, because women who dress in their traditional clothing never suffer violence from men, except for honour killings, and forced marriages to old men, and being executed in ‘traditional’ societies for being raped (because all they were was their cherry, so when you have garbage you might as well throw it away, right?) while their rapist(s) gets the lash. Of course no one commits incest where ‘traditional’ values rule. No one’s gay either. We’d know if anyone did or was because those societies are so frank and clear eyed about such things. Those societies are not founded on a retrograde and backward superstitious idiocy.
and this is without getting into all the prepubescent girls who get raped, the old ladies who get assaulted, often in their own homes…
no, its all about the sluts you miserable stupid arse.
There have been thousands of Muslim and Hindu women worldwide who have been raped.. covered or not. The amount of ignorance infused in your comment is the reason people give up on society. Do you really believe that only women showing skin get assaulted?
It’s people like you who have taught this officer and other impressionable public figures that it’s okay to generalize people like this. A whole lot of you seem to take offence when someone tells it how it is though, so I expect you to be pretty upset with me at the moment.
TROLLLLLLLL!
Get back under yer bridge where you belong!
Well put… I also want to add that the officer isn’t implying that they deserve to be victims… Or that the perp shouldn’t be punished… He is simply stating that in order to avoid putting yourself in a situation of risk… Tone it down a little…. !  Much as a zookeeper might advise that you don’t strap a steak to your body and enter the lion cage!   Use your heads ladies….!
Several women who were fully clothed have been brutally raped you fuck wit.
Rape is about control not women dressing in “slutty” outifts.
What is your problem? women should be able to dress however they want?  They do not dress like sluts for men to rape them.
And exactly, everyone dresses this way now, does that mean everyone deserves to be raped or assaulted?
When making such ignorant comments think of your mother, sisters, nieces, grandmothers, etc.
You sir are a dumbass.  🙂
Are you serious? I have dressed in very modest clothing all of my life. I thought not dressing provocatively and not going out at dark hours would leave me safe. Was I safe? NO!  I still ended up being sexually assaulted.
I also completely agree with the cop. Matter of common sense, really.
You’re an idiot. My best friend was raped in her Marine Corps Mess uniform; she was covered in head to toe with her damned rank on her shoulder.
You owe every man on the planet an apology for being so insulting. Men are completely capable of controlling their sexuality. No real man needs to rape a woman because he thought her skirt was sexy. Sure women dress to attract mates ,as do men, it is not an invitation to take something that without consent. I’m sure you know that .
Here again we see institutional feminism confronting society in an obnoxious, spoiled brat kind of way. I can hear the truckload of  DONTATE NOW buttons hitting the webistes  — This is such a ridiculous joke — I can’t wait for Harper to cut all funding to this nonsensical educational directive that is womens studies et. al. – a more divisive topic has never been adopted by our school systems and I’m terrified for any young man who has to live under the police state that these feminist architects have implemented. Stop giving court to these nutbags who wake up every morning determined to be offended…
But it is that the victim is being blamed. Men who say that are just trying to pass the blame onto the victim- ‘Oh you wore a miniskirt well it’s your own dang fault then’. It’s pathetic. Most girls who are raped don’t dress like sluts. Rape is entirely the fault of the rapist. I mean, do people want girls to walk around all day dressed like nuns and never go out at night? We shouldn’t need to do that. Men should be able to control themselves. Men aren’t accused of ‘dressing like sluts’ when they wear short shorts and walk around with no shirt.
women of all shapes, sizes, colors, ages, and dress get sexually assaulted. men should learn to control their anger and learn to treat people with respect. the real problem is men who believe they have the right to take what ever they want from women when ever they want.
your comment is so incredibly misogynistic, unfounded and dangerous. it is so far from depicting the realities of sexual violence and works only to perpetuate the myth that some how survivors of sexual violence (female or male) are responsible for their perpetrator’s actions.
sexual assault is defined by a lack of consent. period. no consent = sexual assault. no where in that legal definition is there any sort of wiggle room around dress, skirt length, traditional clothing, attitude or relative “sluttiness.”
and i’m going to go ahead and call bullshit on your claim that women who wear traditional clothing are not targets of sexual violence. talk to the women who walk into my office daily to share their stories of intimate partner violence. or the men who experience violence in their own lives.
also – it is unfair for you to make broad sweeping generalizations about “girls today” and the “whole lot of them taking offence.”
sorry if this comes off as curt, but you seem to be someone who appreciates people “telling it like it is.”
Fair Game, I happen to disagree with you. “You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? That’s beyond ridiculous.
And what’s up with men choosing their “victim” based on how they dress? Do you really believe “hindu or sikh or muslim who was covered in their traditional clothing” don’t get sexually assaulted? It is evident from your illogical statements that you need some intense training on this topic.
“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? ”
great comment. It really doesn’t mean anything, just a thoughtless comment from somebody who doesn’t even think about what the implications of his words are. I know of women who were sexually harassed who were very conservatively dressed. As well, for some Muslim fanatics if a women shows even her face that is a justification to do whatever they want, because as in the previous comment “dress like a slut you will get treated like one”.
You are a disgusting excuse for a human being, and a poorly educated, socially ignorant one at that.
Anyone who knows the first thing about sexual assault is aware that it is a crime of power and has nothing to do with “eyecandy”.  In fact, most victims of sexual assault know the perpetrator intimately – whether it be a family member, friend or other acquaintance.  Are you going to tell me that children, the elderly and otherly abled women are assaulted because they are dressed like “sluts”?  Did you actually just argue that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women aren’t victims of sexual assault?
Let me educate you a little bit about what a “fair game” entails.  A “fair game” is one in which a person feels safe walking around regardless of their gender, creed, religion, ability, sexual orientation or the way in which they choose to adorn their body.  A “fair game” is one in which a victim of a heinous crime feels comfortable approaching a police officer – who, after all, is paid to protect citizens’ safety – without feeling judged or reproached.
Kudos to you for being one of the most ignorant and simple-minded people I’ve ever encountered.
Hey Fair Game,
I was raped . . . by my boyfriend. Your move.
I’m so sorry. Thank you for being brave enough to use your story to stick up for other women against insensitive jerks.
My ex attempted to rape me while retrieving belongings he had left at my house (fortunately, my dog is super protective and started biting him).
I was also sexually assaulted while wearing a long-sleeved, knee-length dress with a cami that hid my cleavage, my hair in a bun, heavy black stockings and ballet flats. Hardly slutty, didn’t stop five guys from surrounding me and groping/grabbing and trying to violate me until my friends caught them and kicked them out of the restaurant we were in.
Your dog is a better person than Fair Game will ever be.
I’m very sorry about the things that bad people have chosen to do and try to do to you. The last thing anyone (even worse a law enforcement officer!) should do is pretend you somehow made it happen, whether you were wearing a miniskirt or a burqa.
Women are raped in middle eastern countries where they cover up, too.  Did you think of that?
Rapists attack people who are vulnerable.  That can mean children and elderly people, too.  Women with disabilities are more likely to be raped than those who are able-bodied for that reason.  It’s not about provocative clothing.  Rapists act out of a desire to hurt and humiliate their victims, and to have power over them.  Isn’t this a whole lot more worthy of criticism than women’s clothing?
“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” definitely implies that the victims are responsible for crimes against them, and is a disgusting statement that I can’t believe anyone would utter these days.  Clothing is not consent for sex, as everyone knows, and “no” is not a hard word to understand.  Arguing that rapists can’t understand it is a huge load of crap.  After all, “no” is one of the first words we learn as children…so there’s no excuse for rapists regardless of what the victim was wearing.
It’s sad that people like “Fair Game” feel the need to criticize the victims rather than the violent criminals who abuse them…
There are so many things wrong with this statement but here are the things that really bother me:
1) The onus is NOT on the woman to not get raped, it is on the rapist to NOT RAPE. NO ONE ever deserves to be raped, and it is NEVER a woman’s fault that she was raped. NEVER. Even if she was dressing in a way that you don’t personally approve of.
2) Rape is not about sexual attraction, it is about POWER. Just because a woman is more covered does not mean that a man who is going to rape, will not rape her. It sounds AWFUL, and it IS AWFUL, but rape is not about “eyecandy”. It is all about power and trying to attain power by forcing someone into doing something they don’t want to.
Well when the rapists start listening then hurray for you, till then I suggest you take it upon yourself to help prevent rape. If you are raped it is no way your fault but again can’t help to reduce the chances.
This is the same way I take measures on not getting murdered. Yes the onus SHOULD be on the murderer to stop killing people I do however in the meantime not pick up hitchhikers.
I’d also like to point out that I also do not agree with Fair Game but I do agree with the officer in the article UNTIL I find evidence that is not a quote from the woman who took offense to the statement that the officer was implying that the women are to blame for the rape.
If the officer was simply saying not dressing like a slut can reduce the risk of rape (from opportunistic rape) then by all means he should be able to say that. Yes there will still be rapes on covered up women and “ugly” women but until the rapists decide to stop raping you’ll have to take the responsibility to help not get raped. Which again DOES NOT MEAN you take responsibility for getting raped if you do. RAPE IS WRONG REGARDLESS OF WHO HOW OR WHY IT IS DONE!
If you are trying to make a helpful or constructive point you’d be doing everyone a favor by not. Traditional Muslim women suffer rape. Nuns suffer rape. Grandmothers and little girls suffer rape. Dressing like a “slut” has nothing to do with it.
Of course no one wants to get raped and tries to avoid it!!  No one wants to have their house robbed either! Just imagine your house is robbed & things that are special to you are destroyed.  Imagine the police show up assess how ‘nice’ your garden looks. Now imagine they make you feel guilty (or even worse blame you) for attracting the thieves. They tell you it’s your fault. (seriously you’d be pissed!) No one would accept that! Are you picking up what I’m saying? Let’s realistically assume what attracts one thief to one house may not be the same as what attracts another thief to another house. Would an arbitrary authority telling us how to decorate our house so they all looked a certain way be effective? We can take all the precautions we can afford (deadbolts, bars on the windows & alarm systems) but if a thief still robs you would you not agree it’s not your fault?   
We have the right to decorate & enjoy your home anyway we want! You may not agree with your neighbors idea of what looks ‘nice’ but you must agree you both deserve the same right to be protected? The thief should receive the same penalty regardless of how we each decorate our homes? The thief is at fault!
 
 You’d also get pretty pissed off if a judge sentenced the criminal to 1month jail time because she thought your garden looked shitty but sentenced your neighbors thief to 2 yrs because theirs was nicer looking in the judges eyes!! Thats not how our system works! It shouldn’t work like that in rape cases either!!   
How do sluts dress?  Do I deserve to get raped because I’m wearing a skirt? How about if I tell you it goes past my knee, do I still deserve it now? If I’m wearing a long sleeved sweater, is that okay? Or does it have to be a certain degree of baggy before it passes your “shouldn’t get raped” standards?
Saying things like “dress like a slut you will get treated like one” is EXACTLY the kind of statement that contributes to the rape culture that makes men think rape is okay, and it’s wildly misogynistic – what, exactly, should MEN avoid wearing so they don’t get raped?  Oh, there’s nothing? Men can wear whatever they want?  But women have to dress with a degree of modesty defined by the individual minds of every man on the planet, or hey, it’s her fault.
And by the way, douchebag, women in hindu, sikh, and muslim cultures get raped ALL THE TIME.  There’s a well-documented history of family members MURDERING women from those cultures who are raped, despite their “traditional clothing.” So, as it turns out, forcing women to cover up not only FAILS to protect them from rapists, but also dehumanizes them even further, by implying that after being raped, they’re not even worthy of life.
The way to stop rape is for RAPISTS TO STOP RAPING, not for women to swaddle themselves away from male gaze.
Well put sister. Agree on all fronts, glad someone is able to articulate exactly what is so offensive about this comment without relying on name-calling.
I don’t agree.  I’ll have less hotties to look at >=(
Your comment reeks of ignorance.  Women who dress provocatively are not the only women who get sexually assaulted.  And there is no law against dressing in a way you think will attract the opposite sex.  The idea that the way you dress is what gets you raped is beyond ridiculous.  You and the police officer in question need a bit of education
Except that the thing about rapists is that *they rape people*
They rape women who are fat and they rape women that are thin.
They rape women who are tall and they rape women that are short.
They rape women of colour and caucasian women.
They rape women wearing snow pants and a parka on a winter day, or they rape a woman wearing a short skirt.
They use rape as a tool of war in war-torn countries.
They rape children, and they rape men.
They are family members, coworkers, police officers, doctors, bosses, students, teachers, friends.
So instead of trying to punish some women for being sexually active, or blaming them for the terrible thing that happened to them.  You can encourage people to respect consent and bodily autonomy and *not* rape people.
Excuse me “Fair Game” you have no idea what you are talking about. How about you get educated and then talk. It doesn’t matter what women wear. Assault happens because people like you choose to focus on the victim rather than the perpetrator. “I’m sure” doesn’t carry much weight. Women should be able to wear what they want either way. That is not a reason. Assault is about power, it doesn’t matter whether she’s “eyecandy”. I suggest you take a course from Women’s Studies before you continue with your sexism.
I imagine you must dress like an ignorant misogynist because you certainly sound like one! Perhaps instead of choosing a “slut” to rape, the men responsible could just not rape anyone! What a crazy idea.
Fair Game, you sound like a real class act.  Are you seriously under the impression that the only women who get raped are “eye candy”? I can’t think of a more ignorant comment you could have made.
Clearly you are a man who hates seeing women in control of themselves, and would prefer if we were all veiled to keep men from getting excited.  I pity the women in your life. I’m sure you’d be really sympathetic if any of them were ever raped, but, hey, it would be their own fault if the rapist found them attractive, right?
Actually, no. It has been well established, time and time again, that rape has nothing to do with how someone is or isn’t dressed. That is a myth used to excuse rapists and blame victims, like what’s happening here. And even if there WAS a correlation, it would STILL be disgusting to blame victims for being raped, because it STILL wouldn’t be their fault.
The Toronto police officer’s comment is truly disturbing because he blames the victim for unwanted, forced sexual violence. Blaming the victim means that you hold the person who was attacked responsible for that violence that they suffered. It implies that the victim coulda, shoulda, woulda avoided the attack and therefore was partially responsible for what would inevitably happen.  Sadly, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Rape is regularly and consistently used every day by men all over the world as a way of asserting power and dominance over women.  It is a system of control moreso than a sexual act, and therefore it really doesn’t matter what the woman is wearing.
It’s really sad that the police officer who made this comment is in a position of any kind of authroity. With flagrantly sexist and mysogenistic attitudes like that, women in Toronto are certainly less safe. He should be fired or resign from his duties.
You ARE aware that rape is rampant Hindi, Sikh and Muslim women, yes?
I cannot believe the last post. It is people like you that are the problem with society today! I am a male, and regardless of my gender I think that the victims of sexual harrasment should NEVER be to blame.
Do you think the way a woman dresses, really changes the perspective of a predator. How small minded are you? Have you not been reading about the recent events in egypt, where even women in traditional muslim clothing are being sexual harrassed?
Just an FYI, you and your opinion disgust  me.
Hey, Fair Game.
News flash. Sexual assault is a crime of violence, not sex. It’s a power issue, not one of sexual attraction. When I was raped, I was wearing a winter coat, an oversized sweater and baggy jeans – what’s so slutty about that?
I’m sorry but what you wear has NOTHING to do with it, a lot of sexual assaults happen to women who are in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Or to women that have been watched for weeks or even months, and ‘Fair Game’ I bet you any money they don’t always look like sluts.
& just so you know, Muslims and Sikh women who do wear traditional clothing are just as much at risk if they’re in the wrong place, walking in dark areas and alone.
You and this officer disgust me.
The safety tips should have been general:
Avoid being alone late at night.
Stay in well lit areas.
Actually, there’s zero correlation between rape and how someone is dressed, even if you discount the fact that most assaults are committed by relatives and partners. Outside of the societal myths that support rape culture, there’s nothing linking costume, conventional attractiveness, health, fitness, weight, or any other physical trait with rape, completed or attempted.
None.
I also admit to being curious whether you actually believe that cultures which shame women into covering their bodies more fully are magical rape-free zones, which is what you seem to be suggesting.
You can’t have it both ways – either you’re blaming the attacker, or you’re suggesting there’s something the woman could have done to avoid being assaulted. There’s no middle ground there, at all. To say that women should expect to be assaulted and should modify their lives accordingly is to support the belief that women should be contained, covered, and chaperoned. It also infantilises men, suggesting there’s no chance that they could learn not to rape.
Rather than wasting time victim-blaming – and that’s what you’re doing, even with your mealy-mouthed proviso to the contrary – spend your time asking yourself exactly how we’re going to pound it into assailants’ heads that rape is bad, it is not excusable, it is not acceptable, and it is not ever anyone’s fault but theirs.
Superbly put, Judith. I could not agree with you more.
Are you fucking kidding me?!?! Cause everyone who gets sexually assaulted MUST be wearing something slutty
Fucking ignorant idiots 😐
You know nothing about the anatomy of rape, do you?
The elderly and babies are targeted, along with people anywhere on & off the gender spectrum, of all shapes, sizes, colours, creeds, wardrobes.  It’s not about them looking pretty, hot, sexy, nor slutty.  It’s about power.
The main purpose of rape is power for the rapist, not sexual gratification.
False false faaaalse. Are we fucking done with the sexism and rape apologism? Women do not get raped because of what they wear, but because a disgusting human being RAPED them. 80% of victims know their rapist, so quit it with the ”stranger in a dark alley raping a young woman with a short skirt” trope.
Muslim women are raped all the time. Ugly women are raped. Fat women are raped. Actually, 1 out of 6 women will be raped in her lifetime. You are an ignorant misogynist.
perhaps we should tell men who are victims of crime that it’s their fault too. maybe they should be advised that if they travel or go out at night, they’re just asking to be mugged or robbed. because they are after all just making themselves eye candy to the thieves.
You’re honestly calling women who are dressed like sluts “Fair Game” for being attacked? That gives someone fair reason to sexually assault a woman? Using your flawed theory, that gives me the right to attack you because you’re going around flaunting an opinion I don’t like. Same concept, there is no real logic behind it.
You sir, have your morals backwards. I also don’t understand why you are referring to it as ‘your’ Society like you are not a part of it too. You are a part of the so-called problem of half-naked women selling pepsi and coke and people purchasing it.
Use your head, innocent people have no right to be attacked.
Short version of Mr. ‘Fair Game”s comment: “women who don’t adhere to my religion should be raped.”
I’d say you just need to get laid, but, really, men like you need to be castrated. You’re encouraging violent criminals – if you’re not one yourself – and you’re giving the rest of us a bad name.
Work on your self-loathing, kid. Here’s a hint on where to start; women aren’t to blame for it. Stop punishing them because you’re afraid of their bodies and your own.
I hope you do some growing up before you really damage someone.
Well said George!!  Great assessment of fair game’s personality! I’d say you got it exactly right!  Hopefully he gets some help with his issues around sexuality and insecurity.
To the person who commented that if a woman dresses slutty, she is therefore to blame for any unwanted sexual advances/assaults should probably get their head examined. Completely backward and illogical thinking when it comes to womens’ issues like sexual assault is asinine and it’s that out of touch thought process that scare women off from reporting these crimes.
And the motivation to sexually assault a woman has been rarely reported as a result of what the victim is wearing compared to a crime of convenience (victim was easy to access and isolate), a result of the perpetrator’s upbringing (bad childhood/was assaulted as a child) ,societal pressures, etc.. A lot of these men also have social/behavioral issues, as well.
Lastly, women are assaulted everyday, whether they’re wearing a parka in the dead of winter, or short -shorts in the middle of summer. Neither are acceptable and neither is your comment. It’s actually quite disgusting and ignorant. It almost feels as if you think they DESERVE to be raped because of what they’re wearing. Personally, I think YOU deserve a smack upside the head for even writing any of that.
Much as I hate to admit it, the first comment does have a point. We live in a time when if you go to our ‘universities’ (our esteemed institutions of learning), all that the people are doing in the hallways, benches, under trees, in every place one looks is doing everything but having the actual act of sex. In such a pornified society as this where its all about flaunting what you got on a beach or at a university…people may not realize the attitudes that are fostered towards them when they act as ‘sluts’.
And yes its true that rape is not the exclusive domain of western foreigners, it still is a sizeable occurance as compared to other countries in the eastern part of the world (saudi arabia)-not saying that it doesn’t happen- but that its much much much less on a ratio basis even taking into account people who won’t report it because the same thing happens here in canada and the USA.
@Thinking about #1, too bad rape is not about sex then, and actually about power. Rapists rape people who are vulnerable, which has nothing to do with anyone’s perceived “sluttiness.”
Yea, the difference between what’s going on at the universities and what’s covered here is that one happens between two consenting adults and the other one is a CRIME.
So if you get married, have kids, so everyone knows decisively that you’re most definitely NOT a virgin, does that mean we can now declare a rape open season? OBVIOUSLY *NOT*.
It is immoral and illegal to force something upon another person, ESPECIALLY something as violent and degrading as rape!!!!!
personally, I feel people who wear a certain brand of clothing are all idiots but that doesn’t mean I now have a license to assault anyone wearing that brand of clothing!
You are full of it, “Fair Game” — and frankly seem to be getting a little too much enjoyment out of the idea that people “deserve” to be raped. Rape is a crime of power, to suggest it’s primarily sexual attraction that motivates it goes everything we know about the subject. You’re also full of it re: “traditional clothing” as we know damn well the rape culture that exists in some of the societies with very traditional dress. Seriously, look in the mirror, you are expressing some very backward and honestly borderline evil attitudes. This Officer was WAY out of line.
If you knew a single thing about sexual assault and rape you’d know it’s about power and dominance, not about ‘eye candy’.
You are completely correct.
Muslim women are obviously never the victims of sexual violence.
Sound logic.
A woman should not have to cover herself from head to foot to feel safe.
I blame the officer for being so crass, but it’s not like this is an isolated issue. This society fosters a rape culture, where it’s on the potential victim to hope they’re not picked out by some rapist tonight. It’s a society which makes women afraid to go to the police because they’re “asking for it” by dressing or acting a certain way.
Fair Game,
you’re a disgusting misogynist. Educate yourself.
Most women aren’t sexually assaulted because of how they dress. They’re usually assaulted by men that they know personally.
‘You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. ‘
So you’re justifying rape now, you pathetic scumbag?
‘That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. ‘
That doesn’t even make any sense. Are you justifying Muslim terrorism because women wear tank tops and dresses that don’t cover their knees? How stupid are you?
‘They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.’
So women need to be fully covered up to avoid being raped? What kind of sexist double standard is that? As a man I find you’re comment an insult to me personally. You’re treating men as if they’re animals who can’t control themselves. What a ignoramus you are.
And here’s a newsflash: Women don’t need to justify their worth to you by dressing the way you prefer them to dress. If you’re so small-minded that you’d judge a woman negatively not by her character and actions but by how much skin she shows, than you’re the one who needs to change.
Hey Fair Game…
My soulsister was sexually assaulted by a man at her synagogue when he drove her home. She wears long sleeved shirts, jeans, and never wears makeup. She’s one of the least “slutty” girls I know. Also, most cases of rape/sexual assault are done by men that are close to them such as boyfriends, husbands, relatives…
And of course, we haven’t touched upon same sex or female-on-male sexual assault.
That cop is a pig.  Sexual assault should never be a frightening cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim “looks” like.
He’s also an idiot. Everyone knows that pigs who rape women or who expose themselves or whatever else, have serious mental problems that go way beyond their “weapon of choice.” Just because they can’t keep it in their pants, doesn’t mean it has ANYTHING to do with actual sex.  Anger, rage, hatred, revenge and jealousy are the main reasons men rape.
Toronto Police are NOT educating their members!  (Pardon the pun).
The policeman does not have to issue the apology. He has not done anything wrong. It is just a suggestion people. Dont make such a big deal over this! If you do not dress like sluts, then ignore the suggestion. Why bother to get so offended?
Dressing slutty at night is like wearing a redsuit when a stupid bull is around. Smart people will avoid dressing in red. Do not give rapers an incentive by not dressing slutty, trust me, it will help you alot. (Althought it has been proven that colour red does not anger a bull)
After all the policeman just voiced his thoughts – freedom of speech – and if you do not like it, then ignore it.
Lastly always look around when you are alone 🙂
It’s not just a suggestion, and women covering up won’t suddenly make rape go away or stop assaults.  Not only is it an ignorant comment that the police officer made but the fact that he is a cop makes it worse because he is supposed to one of the “good guys” who will help the victims. As well, the definition of “slutty” can be almost anything. Maybe the pants were not baggy enough, shirt not baggy enough, should of wore a jacket, should of wore a veil….how far do you want to go? There is never a justification.
P.S. freedom of speech also involves the right to voice dissent against ignorance.
@Fair suggestion, It is absolutely wrong to spread misinformation like that because it leads to the perpetuation of a culture in which women are held responsible for a crime committed against them. It is absolutely NOT TRUE that promiscuous dress “attracts” rapists. Please educate yourself:
A Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only 4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior (“sluttiness”) on the part of the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple as a glance). Additionally most convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.
The policeman should issue an apology, though the explanation should be prepared by the police service and be to the effect of, “We did not properly educate this officer on the subjects he discussed.”
The logic you use is astounding. First you suggest there’s a relationship between rape and time of day, and then in one breath assert that one should not wear red around a bull while in the next seem to suggest awareness of the fact bulls are colour blind…
Lastly, awareness isn’t the best way to protect yourself. The average rapist is known to the victim, and spends time grooming said victim. If there’s not a previous relationship, the perpetrator takes steps to circumvent his victim’s awareness and preparedness. There is, frankly, no way to completely avoid being a victim. Rather it is better to make oneself a harder target.
No, what the policeman is doing is blaming the victim and in so doing he is creating an atmosphere in which rape is seen as being more acceptable because it really “not the rapist’s fault”. Unless this kind of crap is stamped on every time we hear it we will continue to have a society where women can’t even answer their own front door without the fear of rape.
No one asks to be raped, unless it’s a fantasy of yours. Period.
Freedom of speech isn’t quite the same thing when you’re in a position of formal public trust and wearing the uniform of a sworn service. Stop making stuff up.
People are making a big deal of this because you fundamentally DO NOT GET IT and are advancing a very dangerous line of reasoning. You are ENABLING the problem. You and your attitudes are PART of the problem. Listen and learn, stop being so pig-headed. This stuff counts.
People could cover every inch of skin, lock themself in a house, master self-defense, carry a knife, carry a gun, wear a locked metal “chastity belt”, and still get raped. We can take measures to protect ourselves, and still get assaulted. Sometimes sexual assault happens long after a person has been made a victim.
Sometimes the people who commit the crime are the ones we turn to for protection, the ones we think will never hurt us. Sometimes it can happen where we feel the safest. Sometimes it happens when we least expect it.
Subjectivity aside, what the police officer said is worse than unhelpful. If a person were to believe him, were to believe that by dressing conservatively s/he could avoid or discourage rape, they might believe they were safe.
That police officer is terrible. This whole “dressing like a slut” business actually has nothing to do with a woman’s preference of clothing. “Dressing like a slut” is an EXCUSE used by perpetrators to justify hurting another person.
To say that a woman who dresses how she wants to dress deserves to be raped is like saying that you deserve to be hit by a car if you’re around a road. It doesn’t matter if you’re at a crosswalk or have the pedestrian right-of-way or even on the sidewalk – you’re near the road, so I’m going to run you over with my car. Sure, I could CHOOSE not to and keep going on my merry way, but because you’re close to a street, it means you’re “asking for it,” right? I mean, if you didn’t want to become a victim of vehicular homicide, surely you would NEVER go near a road.
Everyone needs to chill out and take a look at this UN crime survey before we keep bashing the guy who made the first comment and the police officer in question:
http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_percap-crime-rapes-per-capita
It is shown that the majority of the top 20 nations with the highest prevalence of rape in the world are those with the greatest female civil liberties, which includes the freedom to dress as they please. (South Africa, Australia, Canada, USA, France, UK, etc.) The others are mostly impoverished nations with weaker law enforcement established. (Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Dominica, Venezuela, etc.)
It is shown that many of the the bottom 20 countries surveyed are predominantly governed under Islamic Law or with a legal code modeled after Islamic Law, with far fewer female civil liberties. (Azerbaijan, Yemen, Indonesia, Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc.) Rape is actually found to be the least prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where many foreign observers find women to have the fewest civil liberties.
This information was found in about 2 minutes, which suggests that the people most in need of education are those blindly criticizing our friend who made the first post. His point is valid and so is that of the police officer, statistics show. However, the officer probably should have exercised more tact in his choice of words, which by the looks of them suggest that they have been taken somewhat out of context, in my non-expert opinion.
Please, before anyone tells me that I am placing the blame on victims, read the following: Rape is against the law and I do not condone it. The tragic fact is this: people are going to rape people no matter what. There is nothing anyone can do to eliminate it without revoking our civil liberties to extreme degrees.
The biggest problem with numbers and estimates on rape has to do with a severe under-reporting of these incidents, due in large part to cultural issues such as this one. If a woman feels embarrassed or worries that she won’t be taken seriously when reporting a rape (e.g. being told she looks slutty and was probably asking for it), why would she bother making it worse on herself? Embarrass the victim, protect the rapist. Not to mention how many women in other nations will get stoned to death for being an “adulteress” or having sex outside of marriage when someone (yes, even a family member) rapes them. There’s a lot of incentive to keep your mouth shut when someone violates you.
There are a lot of nuances here, and it’s hard to trust the numbers. Not that they should have anything to do with this–rape is rape, regardless of religion, dress, geographic location, sex/gender, age, or any other demographic someone should happen to pull out in defence of ignorance.
That site clearly says:
“DEFINITION: Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”
The actual prevalence of rape IS NOT reflected in this chart, the website itself says so. This is a collection of reported rapes, not real prevalence.
In many Middle Eastern countries women who are rape victims can be publicly punished with lashings, killed by the family members or shunned by their community. Therefore, reporting is low. Try reading all the information before trying to use these statistics to your advantage.
I just want to point out that statistics like that are based upon REPORTED crime, or government estimates. In some countries being raped can lead to you being condemned to death, I’d say that’s a reason to keep it quiet. In countries with more equal rights for women, women are more likely to report crimes against them. In countries where rape is understood as a crime of power, and victim blaming is slightly less of a problem, more people will come forward. Even in the US, where I’m from, most assaults go unreported.
Look at the caveat on the survey you just posted: “Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”
In countries governed by Islamic law, rapes are vastly under reported precisely because the victim is often blamed for somehow soliciting the assault. In many cases, when the victim is a woman, the victim is then charged with adultery. A man’s word counts more than a woman’s so the rapist can simply claim the woman seduced him to avoid a rape charge. Naturally, this reduces the number of recorded rapes because 1) it’s not recorded as a rape if it’s recorded as adultery and 2) who the hell risks reporting rape in a country where they’re more likely to punish the victims? This is precisely the reason why all of us are mad at rape apologists like Fair Game and the policeman in the article. They enable rapists by blaming the victim for the crime.
Also @Edgar Graham, shame on you for pretending to state the facts while at the same time confounding correlation and causation.* They are not the same. If you don’t condone rape, please don’t inadvertently contribute to rape culture by supporting rape apologists and not reading your own sources correctly.
*An example: While red hair and freckles often occur together (correlation), it does not necessarily follow that red hair CAUSES freckles (it doesn’t).
@mynameisbutters
Excellent comment but unfortunately too many people are so uneducated in science and basic statistics that they can’t separate correlation from causation.
There is research showing correlation between teenagers who have breakfast with family and sexual activity at a later age.  An idiot would claim breakfast cereals have the magical ability to make kids more “moral” but in reality, it’s because typically, children who have breakfast with their family come from more close-knit families with more attentive parents.
These statistics don’t show anything about whether “dressing slutty” makes you more likely to be raped.  I’d go so far as to say that countries where women’s freedoms are greatly restricted don’t create an environment where it’s easy for women to report rape in the first place.  Rape is very prevalent in many African countries, for example, but do you think that society there provides recourse for victims, or even acknowledges that a crime has taken place in most cases?
You’ll notice the DRC isn’t recorded, where rape is used as a weapon of war. Also, many of those countries at the bottom of the list don’t consider marital rape a crime.
As the majority of responses to your post have pointed out, this is a report on sexual assault that is reported or otherwise recorded. The relationship between reports of sexual assault and the civil liberties women have in that country cannot be over-emphasized; it is far easier to report a sexual assault in a country which will take your report seriously. The report in question does not define “rape” or take into account the differences in definition by region. I prefer the term sexual assault, as it encompasses many different aspects of the term than just forced intercourse.
In many of the countries you reference as being in the bottom 20, reporting a sexual assault is a fast track to ostracism on the nice end of things. Can you imagine how difficult it must be for a woman to disclose sexual violence to the men who think her ankles are to be hidden? I know from travelling to some of these countries that women are blamed for many types of sexual assault, including being groped or frotteurised on public transit; these women should not be in public surrounded by men is the logic used. It does stand to reason that in a country where women are “allowed” to say no, they will report a man who doesn’t respect their use of the word or their attempts to protect their civil liberties and personal safety.
I don’t think you are necessarily placing blame on the victim, however, I do think it’s a good idea for you to look into the subject a little more thoroughly.
A few things the officer in question, as well as most of the comments, seem to disregard include male on male sexual assault, or even what dressing “like a slut” entails. The word is, after all, a misogynist insult in itself. If a young boy is assaulted, is it possible he also dressed like a slut? Or perhaps it’s more to the point that in justification of his actions a rapist will say he was overcome by feelings of lust based on his victim’s attire rather than say the truth: he is a violent offender who will take whatever excuse he can create to be violent toward his preferred victim.
Naturally countries where the legal penalty for having been raped is stoning have fewer rapes, not less reporting.
So if you have sharia law in these societies, then you have a situation wherein a woman’s testimony in a court of law is worth only half a mans. So if two men hold a woman down while a third rapes her, and then she goes to the police, her testimony counts for nothing against that of her three rPISTS, NO?
So how many fucking rapes do you think are likely to get reported in these shitholes?
Okay, here’s a serious question.
Is it okay or not okay for advertisers of products and makers of pop music video clips to use semi-naked models in slutty clothes and make-up?
There have undoubtedly been hundreds (if not thousands) of graduate theses on this very subject–I think the resounding answer to your question is, “The jury’s still out.” Or, at the very least, it will remain a contentious issue for a very long time (if not forever).
What is the bigger consideration to me is the definition of the word “slut” and its implied meaning. It’s a tired observation, but it’s still true–guys who sleep around are seen as manly and deserving of respect for their sexual prowess, whereas girls who have the confidence to enjoy their own sexuality while behaving the same way are completely disrespected and dismissed as tramps. Where’s the equality in that? Even when men get called sluts and whores in popular culture, the connotation is a positive or non-serious one.
Rather than do an overhaul on advertising practices, I’d like to see a complete rewrite of cultural understanding and acceptance when it comes to female sexuality. You can’t shame sluts if the concept of being a slut doesn’t exist.
Last I checked, dressing provocatively is part of their job description so I don’t really see your point!  Part of their job description is also to be more attractive than the vast lot of us (except me because I’m gorgeous LOL LOL)
Come to think of it, you’ve posted more than one random non-issues that no one but you think is a thought provoker here.
If I were you I wouldn’t go around calling myself “clear thinking” because it’s an embarrassment.
Let us remember, people, that rapists are sick people; they enjoy violent and brutally having sex. How a woman dresses play very little in a rapist committing the act or not. Seriously, do you think that because you are wearing long jeans and a sweater you risk no chance of getting rape?? I have big news for you!
Pretending that the way women dress is a direct consequence of what men will do to do is actually both offensive for men and women: it seems to suggest that women who are covering more their body will not be victim of rape and it also suggests that men cannot control their actions (1) and that they enjoy brutally and violently forcing a women into having sex (2); i’m not sure how many men would enjoy this characterization of themselves.
@fairsuggestion
Women get raped every day by people that they know wearing almost anything.  The last thing a victim needs to hear is that they gave the rapist an incentive to rape them.  You have obviously never been raped, or else you wouldn’t utter something so ignorant and one sided.
When you tweet this; make sure to cc @torontopolice
Who here suspects that Fair Game is indeed the police officer, further running his mouth??
First to comment…? Sounds fishy.
I’m not making accusations, just wondering.
The biggest problem with this situation is that the officer will likely not have to suffer the consequences of his actions (the parallels to victim-blaming are astounding). My guess is a brief suspension with pay at worst, though a light slap on the hand in the form of a forced public apology is the most likely outcome.
While people recognize these kinds of comments as wrong, society doesn’t care about women enough (yet) to follow through on making examples of people who are in positions of authority, but who clearly shouldn’t be. By not taking this issue as seriously as it should, the police department is merely acknowledging public frustration with the officer in question rather than taking responsibility for the situation. True, you can’t control everything coming out of an employee’s mouth, but public servants have a responsibility to ensure that the people walking the streets are educated and sensitive to such damaging events.
As far as I’m concerned, the police representative’s PR spinning is just as bad as the cop’s comment. What are you investigating? He said it. People heard it. Time for justice. It’s almost as if they’re saying, “If women didn’t get raped so much, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with providing tips on how to stay safe. And then this issue would have never happened.”
Are you kidding me?
To all of you on here who are blaming the victim for dressing too ‘slutty’ or ‘sexy’.  Has it occurred to all of you that this argument cheapens men as much as women by asserting that guys have absolutely no control over their instinct and that instinct will always trump our higher thought processes?  By the same logic, those who wear expensive clothes were just asking to get robbed because nobody can control themselves, right?
Dressing provocatively may not be an invitation to rape but it IS an invitation to be treated as an object. Please note that I haven’t specified a gender.
It makes me sad that one moronic police officer can say something like this and makes the whole force look like misogynistic assholes. As a victim of sexual assault who DID go to the police, they aren’t all like this and I would actually say most of them aren’t.
I would like to know why this particular officer was chosen to speak on this issue when he has no understanding of it and is therefore clearly not qualified to do so. It isn’t as if there are no police officers in the city who have two brain cells to rub together, so what gives?

Black enclaves – urban settlements with an inherent sense of both cultural and ethnic pride – are known for being separate from the societal social and economic mainstream. Little emphasis, however, has been set on their origins: a series of beginnings mainly built on race.
Eglinton West is also known as “Little Jamaica”. John Tavares
Both historically and presently, black enclaves have been a contested urban space. When we look at North American black enclaves – settlements such as Africville, Jane and Finch and Eglinton West – we are visibly engaging in spatial histories which may be unnoticed.
The births of these “ethnic enclaves” are imbued with strong, racial undertones that connect racial identities.
Looking back, black enclaves, such as Nova Scotia’s Africville, Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Ontario’s Wilberforce Colony, have been nationally understood as an embodiment of black pride and community. Yet their formation was involuntary, because slavery and racism enforced lines of demarcation, drawing out an urban space for blacks to live and hindering them from settling in desirable spaces.
The forced nature of these black enclaves embodied oppression, because whites owned most of the land, exerted power and domination, and dictated where blacks would fit within the urban landscape – but these communities were nevertheless successful in building black solidarity.
Retrospectively, these spaces have fostered a sense of spatial emancipation and liberation from their white counterparts.
Now black enclaves are becoming voluntary spaces; the dynamics within them are liberating, empowering and uplifting, and build a sense of residential solidarity through community building.
Jane and Finch, just south of York University, is a black enclave with a bad reputation. (John Tavares)
Eglinton West and Jane and Finch stand as examples of community-building urban space in Toronto, Ontario. Eglinton West is called “Little Jamaica,” and is characterized by retail Jamaican shops, authentic Jamaican cuisine, barbershops and salons.
The black identities that make up this space have allied together to strengthen themselves as an economic, communal whole; however, the arrangement of these urban settlements, especially that of Jane and Finch, have become associated with stereotypes, clearly polarizing the city’s social, economic, political and cultural makeup.
That’s why Jane and Finch area has been labelled the home of the impoverished, disadvantaged or, more clearly, the urban poor, over-generalizing every identity within that space because they reside within that enclave. The politics of representation co-exist with the urban politics of the space when it comes to black enclaves, thus perpetuating not only an urban identity crisis, but re-instilling structures of hyper-segregation, racial discrimination and urban apartheid.
Black enclaves, whether thought of as voluntary or involuntary, are still oppressive, because as more blacks concentrate in these enclaves, they further remove themselves from the mainstream. What this mechanism does is reinforce a lack of economic opportunity, which continues to pave the way for both residential, community and entrepreneurial poverty.
The people in a neighbourhood reinvest their income back into their community. In situations of blatant poverty, neighbourhoods do not have that reinvestment coming back to them, stopping them from building the fundamental institutions that cater to community building. For the most part, the little sense of economic development these neighbourhoods once had quickly ceased; poverty creates crime, leaving the economic value of these businesses threatened.
(Illustrated by (Cola)nothy Humphrey.)
Businesses thus move out of these areas. High insurance means businesses are forced to increase the price of their products, but the high crime rates do not allow for longevity and economic profitability, thus reinforcing discrimination and segregation, leaving the black enclave socially and economically stigmatized to development and growth.
Even though black enclaves are also seen as voluntary spaces, they continue to be the epitome of racial segregation and economic divide. They are notoriously characterized as unattractive spaces with a high rate of poverty. They are affiliated with joblessness, insurmountable teenage pregnancies, out-of-wedlock births (emphasizing discontinuity between black male and female relationships) and female-led families people assumed are welfare-dependent –  and all of this against the backdrop of high crime rates.
Whether black enclaves are understood as involuntary or voluntary, these places have been sensationalized within the city. Black enclaves have become ghettoized, to the point where it’s almost taboo for blacks to live out in the suburbs. The ghettoization of these black enclaves perpetuates a sense of stagnation, affecting the identity of urban youth, both within the enclaves and outside of them.
Intangible structures such as racism, racial segregation and discrimination lead to urban segregation, and create a politic of identity that intentionally captures and emphasizes difference and limits social and economic integration for those identities within black enclaves.
This robs people in these spaces of the ability to create identities for themselves; instead, they become neglected, subordinate and dependent on dominant groups. If we can utilize this historic transfer – black enclaves premised on a racialized connectedness – then we can create a holistic approach to community building, not only visibly to the mainstream, but also internally, within ourselves, the foundation for a nationalistic sense of independence.
There needs to be a holistic approach to reclaiming the identity of our communities and to embody that nationalistic spirit of residential solidarity, community building and economic independency.
When we understand black enclaves were formed via a racialized connectedness, we can examine that shared history – a history of communities formed both involuntarily and voluntarily, premised not only in racism, discrimination and segregation but focused on community formation and restructuring.
This understanding will allow us to take better steps to form a nationalistic approach in rebuilding black solidarity within and outside black enclaves.

Despite a student-organized protest, the controversial documentary Iranium was successfully screened on campus Feb. 11.
The screening of Iranium, a film that explores the history of Iran as well as the idea of Iran as a nuclear state, was sponsored by a number of student groups on campus, and was monitored by 11 Toronto police officers.
David Elmaleh – an executive member of Hasbara Fellowships at York, one of the groups sponsoring the event – said the screening was intended to draw attention to Iran’s reported ambitions to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons, which would threaten the entire globe.
“A university […] is exactly the place that you should be discussing these issues,” said Maleh.
The screening, however, caused an uproar among many York students. A crowd of just under 100 protestors showed up with homemade signs and chanted “No more lies” and “No war, no Iranium.”

Noah Kadish, co-president of the Jewish Law Students Association at Osgood Hall, said the protest would not do much good.
“It’s a little odd that one of the groups protesting is the Iranian Human Rights Society (IHRS) when the Iranian government is perpetrating human rights abuses against the Iranian people,” he said. “They should be hoping to also put the spotlight on these abuses.”
But Hanieh Bahmanpour, an executive member of IHRS at York who was at the event protesting the film, expressed her concerns over the screening.
“We felt that [Iranium] portrays a lot of false information,” said Bahmanpour. She said all the film would do is spread propaganda.
She also pointed out the commentators in the film deliberately mistranslate the Farsi language to make the dialogue appear more violent and threatening.
“It was not an issue about supporting the regime, but it was an issue about spreading false information and promoting war and propaganda on campus,” said Bahmanpour.
Dishy pointed out many Iranian students on campus were supportive of the screening.
“There were a lot of random Iranians that came up [to the tabling for the event] and were very supportive of it,” he said, specifically referencing the “Iran Human Rights Activists Association of York University” listed as a sponsor on the group’s Facebook page.
The association is not an officially registered student club, and according to Bahmanpour is composed mainly of Iranian students. It was founded by Sara Akrami, a former IHRS member who left for undisclosed reasons.

IHRS member Niloofar Golkar said his group was particularly offended Hasbra@York had hired 11 police officers for the event in response to the student protest.
Adir Dishy, president of Hasbara@York, said his group never requested any police officers, and that the number of officers at the event was determined by York Security and Toronto police.
“Regardless of what we want, that’s how many [officers] that have to be there,” he said, adding Hasbara@York is unable to afford 11 police officers. The group was charged for the cost of two officers, he clarified, since clubs that sponsor an event requiring security must bear partial security costs.
Rob Kilfoyle, director of security services, confirmed the police were paid duty officers and that Hasbara@York would be covering some of the costs.
When it comes to protests, Kilfoyle said York Security Services dialogues with student groups.
“We meet with student groups [to] let them know they’re free to express their ideas as long as it’s done safely and respectfully,” he said. “We encourage open dialogue.”
Unfortunatly, the demonstrations distracted more than a few nearby students, some of whom were writing exams for a second-year software tools course.
Though the professor stated he didn’t think the demonstrations overly disrupted the exam, some students claimed otherwise.
“It affected us so badly,” said second-year computer science student Ahmad Aseeri. Wizda Nisar, a third-year in the same major, complained “we couldn’t focus.” Third-year fine arts student Prina Wong was particularly irked.
“It was really annoying because I was trying to focus on the test,” she said. “I probably failed.”

If negotiations go according to plan, passengers who take the Viva Orange route on York Region Transit (YRT) could be shuttling down the TTC’s express route as early as this coming spring.
The agreement signed by the YRT and TTC will let Viva buses ferry passengers between York University’s Keele campus and Downsview station and will hopefully free up space on the often-crowded TTC “Rocket” buses.
Though the express route was specifically meant for TTC vehicles, an August pilot program that saw Viva buses use the lane resulted in increased ridership. Viva has shuttled over 38,000 commuters down the route since then.
The $38-million, six-kilometre bus lane – paid for by the city of Toronto, the province and by Ottawa – was designed to shuttle TTC passengers more quickly to and from Keele campus and Downsview station until the 2015 subway extension launches.
The express route cut the usual 20-minute TTC bus ride by approximately four minutes. Though the Viva Orange bus shuttles between the same two destinations, it usually travels in regular traffic, so it takes longer.

Passing by the recently installed information desk in the middle of Vari Hall, York University students looking for the transitional RED Zone program may have noticed a sign redirecting them to an alternate location in the Ross building.
The university has confirmed that the info desk closes if the temperature drops below 18 degrees Celsius.
“We have had extreme temperatures this winter, so we have had days where it’s gone below 18 degrees,” said York spokesperson Susan Webb.
She added that while the temperature issue was considered while Vari Hall was being renovated, the university believed the heat barriers in place could maintain the temperature necessary to keep the desk open.
Webb, however, said the concern is not necessarily over safety, but rather over the possibility of the temperature going below the university threshold.
Nevertheless, she indicated the university is aware the current barriers in Vari Hall do not adequately retain heat.
“Now that [the administration] has discovered that we could have extreme temperatures below the 18-degree threshold set by the university, [the administration] will be taking additional steps to remediate that,” said Webb, noting installing door sweeps is one of the measures being considered to better insulate Vari Hall.
Krisna Saravanamuttu, York student union president, said the information desk should be opened up to student organizations on campus that may want to use that space during the winter period.
“It seems to me that the information desk is becoming a huge waste of resources, especially during the winter months, especially if the university has no intention of using it,” said Saravanamuttu, noting members of the Student Community & Leadership Development (SCLD) are primarily using the desk.
Saravanamuttu also maintained the renovations to Vari Hall were intended first and foremost to quell protests.
“I’m of the opinion that the university’s utmost desire to clamp down on protests in Vari Hall may have trumped any other logistical, financial or administrative concerns that they should have thought about,” said Saravanamuttu.
While Webb insisted the renovations to Vari Hall were simply to promote student space and not to stop protesting, Saravanamuttu referenced vice-president students Robert Tiffin’s comment in an issue of Excalibur which stated the renovations were to ensure protests did not take place in the area.
 


Opening up the info desk to student clubs is a good idea. Just stipulate in the university space application form that the SCLD cannot be held responsible for weather effects, basically saying that “if you want to table, go ahead, but it might be cold and you’ll have to handle it yourself.” We’re all adults, I’m sure we know how to dress appropriately.
As someone part of a campus club, I would love the opportunity to use the info desk for club recruitment/promotion. Certainly beats putting all your stuff on a single table!

Would you ever publish your diary? York graduate Vanessa Grillone did.
“This is what I did. This is all mine,” says Grillone as she flips through her recently published book, My Pen, My Voice. Grillone is a 22-year-old writer who graduated fromYork University’s English program in 2010. Faced with the “real world,”  Grillone wanted to follow her dream and publish a book. She had been  keeping a diary since before she was twelve and knew that she had a story that should be told. Upon  graduation, she decided there was no better time to pursue her dream of  being a writer than now, while she was still young.
She sent out manuscripts, but received no replies. Most publishers  rarely look at unsolicited manuscripts and Grillone did not have a  literary agent. After a few months, though, she found some hope when a publisher vacationing in India promised to look  at her work after she returned to Toronto. Grillone waited eagerly, but her hopes were crushed when she found out the publisher fell  ill on her trip and passed away. Grillone lost not only a friend, but also her only connection to the publishing industry.

Grillone was convinced publishing the book was simply not meant to be. Her parents were determined to see their daughter succeed and suggested self-publishing. She researched her options and decided to go with a self-publishing package from iUniverse, a company linked to Chapters.
The self-publishing package suggested writers hire a copy editor and line editor–but Grillone didn’t. Instead, she used the skills she learned in school to edit her own work. It worked out great, she said.  The finished book is her real diary, filled with  her “raw emotions.” While some editors suggested she tweak it in some parts — changing  some prose to poetry, for example — Grillone kept it the way it was because she didn’t want to alter the reality of the diary.
The result is a book that’s all hers — from the words on the page to the choice of cover. It illustrates her improvements in her writing abilities and her growth as a person.
Grillone wants people who are thinking about self-publishing to “make sure they are ready.”
Her book recounts her life from when she first began writing it at age 12, before she’d ever considered publishing it, even revealing  the minutaie of her relationships and notes on a hidden tattoo most people didn’t know she had. It feels odd for her to hear strangers talking about the details of her history.
Grillone's self-published book. (Courtesy of Vanessa Grillone)
There were some reprecussions to revealing that much about herself, though–for example, her family’s reactions.
There is one reason Grillone is glad she revealed her diary to the world: her 16-year-old cousin. When Grillone looks at her, she sees herself–a shy teenage girl struggling with growing up. Grillone is not a conversationalist, and feels the best way  for her to communicate to teenagers is through writing. “That’s  her — and my — thing. She likes to write.”
Grillone hopes that this book can help her and other teenage girls relate to someone just like them. She feels that today’s society is making it increasingly difficult for young girls to be confident and independent. “I want to encourage  teens to not only be comfortable in their own skin but to find their  voice, whether it be through writing, or music, or actually speaking. Nothing will change unless you raise your voice.”
Vanessa Grillone will be having a book singing on April 16, 2011 12pm-2pm at Chapters Woodbridge 3900 Hwy 7 West, Unit 1 Woodbridge.

2012-01-30,York,India,"Blogging and social media have positive psychological impacts, study finds
Samantha Osaduke

New research says blogging may have psychological benefits for teenagers suffering from social anxiety or low self-esteem.
The paper, “The Therapeutic Value of Adolescents’ Blogging About Social–Emotional Diffculties” by Israeli researchers Dr. Boniel-Nissim and Dr. Barak,  says writing a blog about social and emotional difficulties, having the blog open to responses, and interacting with readers leads to the biggest psychological improvement.
Blogging, the study says, is beneficial to teens and young adults in dealing with emotions. Contrary to cyberbullying fears, the blogosphere provides teens “with a safe area for self-exposure.” Blogging can “improve self-image, increase self-confidence, and gather friends.”
The study says blogging is considered ideal for anyone who is stressed, depressed, and anxious.
Psychologists have recommended writing in the past as a method of emotional venting and problem solving. Writing, the authors of the study say, “influences the emotional state, as well as the social behavior of the writer.”
But blogging is different from writing in a journal. “Online writing enables free expression, easy rereading and editing, and convenient communication with others,” the study goes on to say.
Bloggers are in control of the interpersonal conversation online. Teenagers can modify their thoughts and decide if they would like their blog to be open to other peoples’ posts. The interpersonal sharing with others helps teens reduce their social stress.
“The virtual environment gives [teens] a feeling of privacy and a sense of protection from exposure[…]or physical contact,” the study says, “which might be threatening in face-to-face encounters.” Bloggers can hide personal information from family and friends, but can engage in conversations with strangers who can give them advice.
Generally, teens are confident sharing their feelings online due to the anonymity and invisibility of the internet. Instead of seeing others’ reactions by sharing their problems publicly, they can focus on the content.  Because of this, blogging is a bigger release for teenagers.
In the study, a total of 161 teens participated, with 124 girls and 37 boys. They were asked to rate themselves by their level of self-esteem, peer relationship, and interpersonal activities. During the study, experts evaluated “the participants’ social–emotional condition” by reading their blog posts.
In total, participants were rated on 30 posts. The first and second group posted messages in their blogs on “their thoughts and feelings concerning their social circumstances and interpersonal relationships.” The first group opened their blog to others, the second did not. The third and fourth groups wrote “about any subject they wished.” The third group opened their blog to the public where the fourth group did not. To balance the study, a fifth group served as a control by writing entries in their personal diaries.
Unlike diarists, the study shows that, “online writers describe their writing process as a dynamic dialogue.”
Blogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter combine public and private worlds. Writers can construct identities online. By constructing their own identity, teens can manage the intimate details they choose to share or withhold from others.
Bloggers, the researchers imply, are in control even if their situation is spiralling out of control-—a comforting thought whenever a blog is updated.

The work of four illustrators visits the Zacks Gallery at Stong College with Fat Lines: A Drawing Exhibition 
Sarah Ciantar
Contributor
 

Fat Lines: A Drawing Exhibition showcases the work of four illustrators. John Janas, Ron Maloku, Alex Curci, and Mike Mclnroy present a shared ability to use the media of illustration, animation, and drawing to create powerful, interesting, and ultimately effective works. The exhibition, currently running at the Samuel J. Zacks Gallery, presents works with an expressive, attention-grabbing style.
Co-director of the gallery, Stas Guzar, explains that what interested him in hosting this exhibition was to bring recognition to up-and-coming artists.
“I feel as though drawing and illustration don’t get the attention they deserve, and can get lost amongst the other mediums,” Guzar explains. To him, each artist’s work is special in its own way.
Comic-book-style pieces are among the works Guzar focused on for the show. He was drawn to the works of Curci because of his ability to use this style and present, as Guzar describes it, “a duality in the image of technology and raw organics.” Located along the western wall, his ink and watercolour work presents many abstract concepts and depicts futuristic technologies.
The works of Janas, located along the southern wall, consist of pop-cultural icons in watercolour and comic book visual narratives. The calm colour scheme in contrast with the vibrancy of the bold black lines appeal to the viewer.
Mclnroy’s work further adds to the show’s atmosphere with his cartoon style and effective use of bold black ink. He presents interesting and humorous subjects in his works, including a modern-day take on the Three Little Pigs.
Presented along the northern wall are captivating images produced with India ink in an expressionistic style. The works of Maloku are powerful because of the unsettling feeling they create within the viewer.
“I particularly like the raw emotion these images create,” comments Guzar. “I find them effective in creating this raw emotion as a result of the loose stylistic essence Maloku used to produce them.” These works are powerful and appealing as a result of the grotesque images which captivate and intrigue the viewer.
Guzar describes the exhibition as “more conceptual than visual.” The works as a whole are effective because they are relatable on a universal level. This show allowed for a spotlight to be put on works that are bold and intriguing.

There will be some major changes to York’s administration come June 2012.
Rob Tiffin, vp students, will be stepping down from his position to take “an early retirement,” he said in an email dated January 24.
“A lot of people are sad,” says Rheza Evangelista, executive assistant to Tiffin.
Tiffin has been at York for about ten years, and was appointed to his current position in 2005. He began his post at York in the position as assistant vp enrolment management, coming to the job with about 30 years of experience on post-secondary education administration. He has served in a number of senior positions at the University of Western Ontario and at Brock University in addition to York.
Tiffin had been reappointed to vp students in July 2010, and was expected to sit in the position for five years.
“I leave knowing that we have a team that will play a pivotal role in supporting our students and the achievement of new goals,” wrote Tiffin.
According to Tiffin, the search for his successor will be undertaken shortly.

She could blame her name, her first name. Eke.
No one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.
What parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.
Room 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.
From the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.
The campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.
Her pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off.  Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.
She heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”
“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”
“No, she never goes anywhere.”
“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”
“Did you notice in English lecture…?”
Eke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.
“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.
She blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.
During her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.
“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.
“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”
At six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.
His arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.
Eke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.
Joining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.
But this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.
“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.
With her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.
“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.
Her hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.
Knock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.
The door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.
“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”
“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.
“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.
“Do I know you, girl?” he said.
She grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.

Cozy contentment seeps through the night as cars slosh along the slick streets. Mom sits at the dining room table with a phone pressed to one of her large ears. She runs through a list of birthday guests, talking loudly in her overexcited Filipino way. The warm wind flutters the blinds and the smell of cassava cake drifts under my nose. The TV blares from the living room. My eight-year-old sister Naomi—Ate, meaning big sister in Tagalog—makes arts and crafts upstairs. I play with my sister Jillian, who will turn three tomorrow, May 20. I will turn seven in October.
Together, we created a game we call “Rocketship.” I lie on my back with my arms and legs in the air, bent at strange angles, like a dead beetle. Jill clambers onto my shins, pressing her feet against mine and holding my hands for balance. Her long, thick hair tickles my arms. Her small hands are squishy and her brown eyes are bright.
“One, two, three!” I say, and catapult her off of me onto the green and white linoleum. She lands clumsily on her bum.
“Again!” Jill beams, her teeny teeth gleaming. She climbs onto the launch pad and prepares for blast off. I count.
“It should be backwards,” she says matter-of-factly.
“Yeah, okay. But that means you should be backwards, too,” I say. This time I hold her feet and she holds mine. “Ready? Three, two, one!”
This repeats for a while, but then Mom’s patience runs out. She slams her hand over the receiver and turns to us, her sleek black hair flying.
“Kezia! Es-stop making noise! I am on da pone! Go up stair!”
“Okay Mommy. Cuddle time for-a-miiiiNUTE!” Jill sings, throwing her arms around Mom.
“Sandwich!” I screech, falling on top of Jill. I poke the mole in Mom’s eyebrow. Mom pats us both.
“Now go get ready por bed!” she says.
Jill and I pivot and bolt out of the kitchen, streaking through the dim living room between the huge TV and a dozing Dad. His moustache quivers. We galumph up the grey-carpeted stairs on all fours like dogs. The china cabinet rattles. We enter my room and flop onto my small bed, which creaks and groans under the weight of two bodies. Posters of puppies cover my walls. I shift aside a heap of blankies and stuffed animals and lie down in the dead beetle position. Then I fling Jill off my legs and she soars through the air before she lands on her knees at the foot of my bed. She throws her hands out in front of her, her face dangerously close to the rails. My purple Doodle Bear fixes her with its button-eyed stare.
“Wait!” I say. I place a pillow beside my bear, against the white bars that almost smashed her face. “Now you have a target.”
This time, the rocketship lands on the landing pad. We giggle and squeal with delight.
“ES-STOP ES-SCREAMING!” Mom yells from downstairs. We ignore her and continue our game. Jill climbs onto my legs again. This time, I hurl her off of me as hard as I can.
Time slows down.
The pillow shifts.
And then red spurts everywhere.
I lock eyes with Jill, her sweet face pale and contorted and covered in blood. Her dark hair sticks to her cheeks, tangled. My eyes bulge. An infinite second of stunned silence stretches on.
Suddenly, Ate stomps out of her room, a foam slipper in one hand. She throws out her chest importantly and irritably pouts out her lower lip.
“Will you guys be qui—MOM!” Her eyebrows shoot up higher the longer she holds the word. I wait, frozen.
Mom is already in the doorway, her eyebrows contracted and her eyes wide and worried. Her eyes sweep over the scene, over the blood on my sheets, on my clothes, on my pillows. Blood gushes from a gap in Jill’s mouth where three of her top front teeth had been. Tears form in Mom’s eyes as she grips fistfuls of her hair and screams. She steers Jill out of the room. As if I’m sleepwalking, I shuffle down the hall after them. Dad strides into the bathroom to help clean Jill up.
My vision blackens and blurs as I watch the sink water turn pink. Mom lets out high-pitched, hysterical sobs. Her hands tremble as she moves around the cramped bathroom. Jill fidgets. Dad keeps his calloused brown hands steady as he slumps over Jill.
He wipes the smears of red from Jill’s face and puts rolls of gauze in her mouth. Dad’s eyes are weary and his curly hair has lost its shine. Jill finally starts to cry. The gauze gives her squirrel cheeks. Dad murmurs to Jill and pets her hair.
“I kanat beleeb it. It’s nine o’clock at night and we’re going to da hospital,” Mom rages to Dad.
I hobble back to my room and sit on the edge of my bed, dizzy and clammy and shaking. Mom follows me. She screams and scolds with unintelligible words, and I cower. Tears slip silently down my cheeks. Flecks of red splotch my Doodle Bear, complementing the blue scribbles.
For a long time afterwards, the three black X’s in Jill’s gums haunt me every time she smiles. The stitches float in the darkness behind my eyelids, disembodied, glowing white.

For those who missed it, on February 18 there was a shooting in the York community. A shot was fired inside an apartment residence on Assiniboine Road, and fortunately, the grad student inside was unharmed.
What bothers me is the lack of security we have in our community. For a campus of almost 65,000—a population big enough to rival small towns—we don’t have a police department on site.
Yorkton, a tiny city located in east-central Saskatchewan with a population of roughly 17,200, has a better source of protection than students here; they have the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) nearby. It’s honestly surprising that York doesn’t have a detachment of Toronto police, given our notoriously problematic location near Jane and Finch.
With an active police force on campus, we would surely see a dip in crime. I acknowledge that we have the York security patrolling the entire community alone, but they cannot do this alone. With the added extension site of Toronto police, they would offer far more presence to our community.
Let’s face it, we’re basically a city with a shopping mall, but even in my hometown of Mississauga, we have a police station—it’s located within the shopping centre of Meadowvale. Then there’s another two in the area to boot. So why can’t our community benefit from another form of protection?
We have the emergency towers dotting the campus and York security, and if we don’t have Batman or any similar vigilante, we should most definitely have a Toronto police branch on site.
I don’t fear many things, but as an individual incapable of stopping bullets with my face, I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m going to fear a person with a 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Unless York offers bulletproof vests to students with our tuition, I regretfully fear that without vigilantes or armed security, our rather large community will continue to suffer through its ongoing trend of crime.

Louis realized he was staring. His gaze drifted through the bent spider web in the windshield, down the hood, and off into the twinkling embers on the plains below. Over the lake, another anvil flickered silently and the sun seemed to shear off the air itself. Calvin was down there, watching the coverage of his dad on TV. Louis had done a bad thing and now his son and the rest of the city were learning of it in high definition, with surround sound. Far away, his story was
interrupting sitcoms.
“Now what?” he said, for the sound of it. Aluminum and iron, injectors and water pumps, all ticked and cooled beneath deep, dented green. Nothing. Nothing to say, nothing worth saying. He sat and wondered in his car on that tarmac ledge between the caves of damp coniferous and the vast potential below. He couldn’t stay here; he was prey. He’d ditched a chopper, for Christ’s sake. No one ditched the chopper.
The road hugged the edge of the escarpment, damming up the heavy moss of the forest. The moaning trees twisted in the grip of the cold front, pushing the storms east. A dandelion seed barrelled in through the window and settled on the dashboard. It probably wanted an autograph.
Soon he realized that he needed to piss. He might have held it all day—he hadn’t been paying attention. He slithered from the car, his cartilage creaking as the rear strut did. The sheet metal there deflected inwards to conjure police-issue ram bars. He tried to cross the wire fence that girdled the ditch but it was loose with age and wavered as he stood
on it. He imagined falling and shooting himself and the image brought hints of irony to his mouth.
He’d never owned a pistol, and he was wary of it. He also noted that wedging it in the front of his pants was probably not helping, but it stayed.
Leaping, he pushed his foot into the post and it crumbled under his soles. He started to swear then hit the ground hard. Finishing the curse and tossing in several others, he brushed the mud and needles from his hands, revealing the fine wisps of scarlet meteors across the butt of his palm. The throbbing pain along his side persisted but he repressed it, breathing deep to pull in the howl of the wind and chill the blood that wept from his hand, stigmata of an unconvincing Christ.
He moved into the forest until the rush of it surrounded him. If the car were spotted, he at least wouldn’t be caught with his fly down. By now, the warmth of his body had begun to flow back into the grip of the pistol and the metal seemed to fuse with skin until he pulled it out to avoid shooting his dick off.
As the sodden evening shivered, he loitered. The smells of exhaust, gunsmoke, and blood were gone from his nose but they were dusted across his brain. And suddenly he was strolling in the woods.
Sitting on a dry log, he thought about smiling and stared some more. The storm had saved him
earlier. Lucky break. Now the humid air chilled him and drew his thoughts to warmer places. He thought about shooting himself, for prudence’s sake. There wasn’t really a choice but he held up the gun anyway, taking it in his hand and cycling the action. The unused bullet flew silently into the moss. As he levelled the sights, the setting sun risked a glance through the ragged clouds and dripping leaves, igniting the crooked birch and forging little diamonds on its paper dress. Fate, babe. Bang.
There were holes in the back of the Mustang. Little ones where the patrolman had aimed. He doubted that it was protocol to open fire during high-speed pursuits, but the holes had no comment. He had a thought and dove to the pavement to check for leaks: clear, red, green, brown. Now would be too soon—he’d made it this far and he wasn’t done yet. Satisfied, he wiped the oily road water from his palms and lowered himself back into the leather bucket seat.
“You’re still with me, right?” He was talking to a car. The breeze sent the little fluff of dandelion flying out the window. Some sign.
Calvin had called the Mustang Stacy. He realized again that he hadn’t said goodbye. He muttered something under his breath that shook past a lump.
In time he took a breath and placed his hand on the key and turned. The eight cylinders grunted to life. She was ready. He was ready. Easing out the clutch, he headed off to die. 

 
 
 
spotted on campus • Blueberry Hill, one of York’s old eateries over yonder in York Lanes, is due to close April 30. However, loyal Blueberrians showed that they would not give up without a fight. Several supporters were seen strolling around campus wearing posters reading “Save Blueberry Hill.” What does fate hold for Blueberry Hill?

Debate boils down to quantity versus quality

According to a survey, most students would rather enrol in a four-year program than a three-year program.
A February 21 report released by Higher Education Strategy Associates revealed that, from a survey of at least 850 people, 94 per cent of university students agreed that they would rather study in a four-year program than a three-year program. In fact, half of those students were taking extra years to finish their studies.
Some York students, like sixth-year theatre and English student Garett Oliver, disagreed with the idea of a three-year undergraduate degree program, saying that the quality of education would only suffer as a result.
“That hasn’t really worked in the past,” he says. “They did it with high school by removing grade 13. It’s looking at it more as getting a piece of paper with your name on it saying whatever program you’re in rather than actually learning something, which should be the function of post-secondary education.”
On the other hand, several students commented in favour of a condensed three-year undergraduate program, saying they would rather jump-start their careers and save some cash on the way.
“It would be done faster. I can get out of here and start my career. I’m a musician,” says Cecile Eugene, a third-year music major. “As soon as I’m done, I can get on the road and tour. But because it’s a four-year program, I have to stay here for four years instead of three. Plus, all these extra courses I have to take—like humanities and social science—won’t help me be a musician.”
Some students have actually seen how the three-year programs work overseas, and are quite taken to the idea. Venessa Lao, a second-year accounting student, sees the move as a good thing for students. She says that in countries like Australia, a lot of her friends finish their studies abroad in three years.
 “It would be a benefit for students financially,” she says. “I have friends who are basically taking loans that they have to pay off the minute they graduate.” 
But who ended up with the harder job?

President Mamdouh Shoukri swapped his suit and tie for a letterman jacket and backpack, joining the throngs of students on the Square One GO bus to York. This day marked York’s—and Canada’s—first-ever President for a Day event.
The lucky York student who won a day in Shoukri’s presidential seat is Rabia Sajun, a third-year biochemistry and education student whose winning contest entry included three ideas for improving student life: expanding Steacie Library, reducing class sizes, and enhancing campus safety.
“It’s been super busy,” Sajun describes her day. “I’ve been in a lot of meetings. I met vp Rob Tiffin about disability. I’m interested in accessibility services for all students. I met vp Brewer about campus safety.”
She also talked to vp academic and provost Patrick Monahan about class sizes, and about improving student engagement in classrooms.
While Sajun sat through several meetings, Shoukri spent his day in a lecture on molecular biology and in a physics lab. Sajun serves as the co-president of the Chemistry Society, and Shoukri sat in for her office hours, selling students old lecture notes and professor-approved sample copies of old tests for $15 a packet.
“I’ve had a chance to talk to students there, learn more about the university and about their concerns,” he says.
The one negative of the day for Shoukri, however, was when he visited a very crowded Student Centre for lunch. The lineup for the microwaves especially dismayed him.
“I wouldn’t do that if I was a student. I’d give up on warm food,” he remarks. “To be honest, maybe building a new Student Centre will take time, but doing something about the microwaves should not.”
For Shoukri, the event was a way of engaging with the student population, something that he didn’t expect would happen on such a high level.
“Fact is, I walk through campus all the time and talk to lot of students,” says Shoukri. “But they want to talk to me more now, probably because I’m not wearing a suit, I’m wearing this—” he gestured to his letterman jacket—“They’re probably more comfortable seeing me trying to reach out to them.”
Sajun highly approves of the President for a Day campaign and believes it should be a recurring event.
“I think this idea was a really interesting experience to get a behind-the-scenes look into what is involved in implementing something,” she says. “The admin is doing its best to better student life, and this gives students a better behind-the-scenes look.”

The world-famous TEDx talks are about to begin their second round at York.
The Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED) Conference is set to take place March 10 at York’s Glendon campus.
The talks are part of a number of globally-occurring conferences that are owned by the private not-for-profit Sapling Foundation, which began in 1984 and aims at addressing a number of issues within science and culture.
“There’s been a terrific increase in interest this year,” says Ross McMillan, one of the co-curators of the event.
McMillan adds that the event has already received many more applications from students eager to participate in the talks than the 100 spots available.
Some of the speakers set to present at York include a student talking about her research on domestic violence and aboriginal women, and a York vice-president presenting his take on how universities are changing to meet the demands of the future. Past presenters in the talks include figures such as Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, though they were not at York campus.
All speeches fall within the overall theme of this year’s conference, “Impact Matters.” Speakers are encouraged to highlight their stories about making differences in their communities.
Ross calls the event a “one day symposium,” where participants will spend the entire day listening to the twelve speakers and watching two performances.
“It’s really a cross-section of the York community,” says McMillan, who notes that organizers are looking to cultivate an audience from all walks of life that can not only attend, but also engage in talks with other participants who they would not normally interact with.
The last day to send in an application is February 29. For those unable to attend in person, the event will also be streamed online. 
CUPE accuses employer of continuing to ask for concessions from union
Jacqueline Perlin
Assistant News Editor
 @jackieperlin
Four months of negotiations and a total of 34 agreements.
That’s the number of motions that have been agreed upon by York management and the Canadian Union Public Employees (CUPE) local 3903, but the negotiations have reached a turning point with about 120 proposals still remaining on the table.
CUPE 3903 has made the first step towards putting the union in a legal strike position by filling for conciliation with the Ontario Ministry of Labour on February 15, asking for a government-appointed conciliator—or third-party individual—to help facilitate and attempt to enable the two sides to reach an agreement.
While the union emphasizes that it hopes to reach an agreement with the university through the conciliation process, it is also lashing out against the university, stating in a website update that “given the Employer’s reluctance to recognize our members’ needs and their unwillingness to bargain on a proposal-by-proposal basis thus far, the Union has no choice but to begin preparations to hold a strike mandate vote and set a bargaining deadline.”
Karen Walker, chair of CUPE 3903, explains that conciliation is the step before holding a strike mandate vote, which would determine if the Local will strike.
A strike or lockout of the Local, however, can only occur 31 days after the conciliation process has begun, which should be starting in the coming days.
Walker also explains that the university has failed to address each proposal made by the Local, and is instead offering a total compensation package of two per cent, encouraging the Local to accept the package and divvy up the money at their discretion.
While Walker notes that in past years CUPE has received a package of five per cent and that initial offers made by the university are usually low, her concern is that most of the items that have been negotiated upon thus far have been inconsequential.
Walker says that while the Local has given hundreds of proposals to the employer, the employer has only made six counter-proposals to the original package and are unwilling to budge on many of the important ones, including refusing to move on the “sign back deadlines,” where the Local is contesting the new deadlines given to teaching assistants to sign back their contact.
“Such deadlines are a not-so-subtle attempt to place the blame on us for the fact that they were late with September pay for 1,400 members […] despite the fact many of these contracts were signed in June and July!” states the update.
Walker says the majority of proposals agreed upon thus far have been items proposed by the university and accepted by the employer, not vice versa. For her, the actions of the university are impeding upon the negotiation process causing no agreements on key proposals.
“Without this leverage, we are concerned that the Employer will continue to stall through conciliation, talking in circles while our contracts continue to be eroded by inflation,” states the update. “Rather, the Employer’s stance remains unchanged: reduce your demands to fi t within our financial mandate and maybe then we can talk on some of these issues,” it continues.
Robert Castle, senior advisor to vp fi nance and administration, is adamant that the university is doing everything in its power to reach an agreement with the union and says that negotiations thus far have been positive.
“We’ve had good work done with the union,” he says.
Castle notes that the university received over 170 proposals from the union in November of last year, so it is only reasonable that the process is taking time.
“There’s been a lot of work done through our negotiations […] it’s hard to see how we’re not taking this situation seriously,” he says.
Castle also says the university is pleased to go into the conciliation process.
“We’re perfectly happy going into conciliation and we don’t see the conciliator as leveraging for either party. It’s a third party independent voice to help us to get to an agreement,” he says, adding that the university does in fact expect a detailed review and discussion of all the proposals.
Once a conciliator is appointed by the Ministry, the individual will reach out to both parties to continue with the negotiation process. Nevertheless, CUPE says that having a strike mandate does not mean that the union will strike.

2012-11-14,York,India,"Rushdie can’t cut from his 450-page book and destroys Midnight’s Children in the process
Deepa Mehta’s Midnight’s Children is a storytelling catastrophe.
At two-and-a-half hours long, the film based on Salman Rushdie’s 1980 Man Booker Prize-winning novel, is the story of Saleem Sinai, born on the midnight India gains independence from Britain.
In a “private revolutionary act,” as Rushdie likes to call it, a nurse at the hospital swaps Saleem, son of an impoverished street musician, with another child born into wealth and great expectations.
So Saleem, a boy who was meant to be poor, grows up with privileges that the boy whose life he stole, Shiva, can only dream of. As a child, Saleem discovers he has the special power to bring together all the Indian children born in that same hour and that they each have their own gift.
Shiva is a fierce fighter, and Saleem’s closest friend Parvati is a witch. The children’s stories are inevitably “handcuffed to history,” playing out against the uncertain backdrop of cultural divisions and civil war.
The problem is that by the time we get to this story, we’re exhausted. The tale is buried under an hour of recounting how Saleem’s adopted grandparents and parents meet. Rushdie, who wrote the screenplay himself, makes the fatal mistake of trying to cram the entire 446-page novel into the movie, making it a tedious, unrewarding experience.
Along the way, we’re introduced to an extensive list of characters that are completely forgotten by the end of the film, and this is perhaps where Midnight’s Children’s biggest flaw lies.
By the end, so much precious time has been wasted on introductions to new characters, that we haven’t grown to care for or empathize with the main characters at all. All the moments that are supposed to move us don’t because a connection with the hero just isn’t there.
An all-around bad casting job doesn’t help the situation as most of the cast, and especially the Canadian-born Anita Majumdar who plays Saleem’s beautiful but selfish Aunt Emerald, deliver cringe-worthy, awkward performances, struggling to bring Rushdie’s quirky humour to life on the screen.
The cost of Rushdie’s highly literal, page-by-page on-screen translation is sacrificing a deeper exploration of the best and most affecting stories within Midnight’s Children. What motivated the nurse’s actions? What has filled Shiva with so much rage? There are so many unanswered questions.
The story of the “midnight’s children” is a perplexing one if you haven’t read the source material. The purpose of their meetings, orchestrated by Saleem, is confusing, and the divisions and tensions that exist within the group are never justified. But how could they be when so much time is thrown away on the story of Saleem’s parents who are long gone, and serve no purpose now?
I’d imagine the conflict is tied to the chaos that is India’s political situation at the time, but Rushdie decides to skip over history in favour of unimportant subplots.
Mehta hasn’t completely lost her touch, though; having described the book as “Salman’s love letter to India,” her adaptation of it is a love letter of its own kind.
With bright colours, dream-like visuals, and a fantastic score, she captures the magic and beauty of India’s streets.
This isn’t an unfilmable story. But Rushdie is incapable of being ruthless when he needs to be, keeping scenes that ought not to be there, and leaving out the ones that should. Perhaps it’s his deep understanding of the book that is actually Midnight’s Children’s downfall, keeping him from seeing that some things don’t work in movies.

Signing of the memorandum of understanding marks milestone in Canada-India relations 
On November 6, a memorandum of understanding was signed between York and the Defence Research and Development Organization in India, which will facilitate collaborative research in the area of defence technology.
VK Saraswat of the DRDO and Robert Hache, York’s vp research and innovation, signed the MOU in the presence of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
“It should make it easier for our colleagues to access research funding available in India for international partnerships,” writes Janusz A. Kozinski, dean of the Lassonde School of Engineering, in an email to Excalibur.
York will link its researchers with potential partners in India, fitting with Harper’s focus on strengthening bilateral relations during his India trip. However, it will be up to individual researchers whether they want to collaborate.
York will also not offer individual, stand-alone funding for research projects, Kozinski says.
Several collaborative projects are possible in areas like chemical-biological defense, advanced materials, and nanotechnology.
The DRDO, India’s military research and development agency, also funds much of the research done in top Indian universities.
“It’s important to clarify that India does not have an equivalent to the Canadian Tri-Council granting agencies,” writes Kozinski, referring to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, which fund most of the research in Canadian universities.
Currently, York is not collaborating with DRDO on any projects, but a number of initiatives were discussed at two workshops in 2011, on which the MOU is based.
Kozinski mentions the Early Warning and Advance Response Network [e-WARN] project, designed to detect, identify, and neutralize chemical and biological agents released in public buildings. The e-WARN system would save lives in events like the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995.
In March 2011, the e-WARN response time was seven seconds. Researchers at York and DRDO both want to decrease this time by 0.5 to 1.5 seconds.
York and DRDO officials hope the MOU and future collaborations will benefit both nations in years to come.

2013-03-11,York,India,"This supplement started out as a critical look at how far women have come. It was going to ask, considering it’s the year 2013, is feminism still even necessary?
But I noticed a pattern when the first drafts of the articles started coming in.
I realized they were all about questioning what a woman was, and what a woman was supposed to be. The stories examined the expectations society sets for women, and the expectations we set for ourselves—the ones that tell us we should be thin but curvy, ladylike but sexy, career-oriented but dedicated mothers, smart but not too smart; certainly not smarter than men.
The stories in this supplement challenge these assumptions. Some of them feature women testing the boundaries of what is considered appropriate “feminine” behaviour, and others are about women pushing back at these boundaries when they get in their way.
So that is where the theme, “De/constructing Feminism,” comes from. It means both taking apart what a woman is supposed to be, while simultaneously constructing new, diverse images and ideas about women.
I’ve thought a lot about what I want to achieve with this supplement. And the truth is, I don’t want to make some grand statement on feminism or offer a sweeping solution to any of the questions mentioned above.
What I want is for people, women and men, to ask questions. I want to inspire a dialogue that questions what it means to be a woman in today’s society, and if one singular meaning is even possible.
And I want people to question the boundaries and rules set for us—that govern the way we should dress, the way we should speak, the way we should act, what things we should like, and even in what fields we should work, and for how long.
Because that’s the thing about boundaries. Once you know where they are, they become easier to cross. So, happy crossing.

This is what a filmmaker looks like 

While most stag shops are designed to service the needs of men, Good For Her finds its niche with female customers
“[As a young girl], even though I was thin and white, I didn’t see anyone in the media that looked like me,” says Carlyle Jansen, owner and founder of Toronto’s leading female-friendly sex shop, Good For Her, located at Bathurst and Harbord Streets.
Jansen felt she never looked good in long hair or girly clothes, so she compensated by wearing loose clothing, to hide her body, and cut her hair short.
Like many girls in their teens, the now exuberant Jansen not only felt uncomfortable with her body, but her sexuality as well. When she went through puberty, she found the thought of sex so repugnant she postponed engaging in sexual intercourse until her early 20s.  Even then, she says her discomfort never dissipated, and throughout the course of her sexual exploration, she found she could not reach orgasm with any of her partners.
Destitute and beleaguered, there seemed to be no solution for her sexual ineptitude. At age 28, she reached rock bottom when her then-boyfriend left her because she could not have an orgasm. But Jansen saw this moment as a calling that sex no longer be merely a complex assortment of gestural rhetoric.
Soon after, Jansen began to educate herself in the art of sex. Through workshops, literature, sex toys, and self-exploration, she became the guru of self-love, and found that she could reach climax with the aid of sex toys.
During her sister’s bridal shower, she taught her sister’s friends the mechanics of sex toys. Jansen says at that moment, she realized there were a multitude of women like her, who felt so uncomfortable with expressing their sexuality that they suppressed their desires, and became completely ignorant of all the possibilities of their sexuality.
In 1997, Jansen recognized this untapped market and decided to promote sexual education for women through the creation of her very own sex shop.
Designed to promote comfort and openness for its female customers, the shop resembles a humble home. Besides having a selection of sex toys that cater to every need, from 15-inch dildos to nipple stimulators that resemble mini-serrated pizza cutters, the shop also holds workshops for a variety of subjects, from learning how to talk dirty to how to give erotic massages.
Jansen also mentions that they have women and trans-only hours, from 12 to 5 p.m. on Sundays because female customers often feel uncomfortable buying products in the presence of men.
“As a women and trans-friendly shop, it is a key resource for people exploring their sexuality. It’s a non-judgmental space,” says Michael Jackman, a sixth-year media and sexuality student and PhD candidate.
“Most sex-shops are geared towards men and are not inviting for women. But Good for Her provides that space where women feel safe.”
When asked what the source of this discomfort is, Jansen says from a young age women are socialized into thinking sex is immoral and their genitals are ugly. When it comes to intercourse, she says women often feel guilty about asking for what they want in bed and that they are boring their partners.
Jansen believes all the pressures placed on women to be successful, look perfect, and be good mothers, partners, and daughters can cause women to shut down sexually, and consciously stop thinking about things like being good lovers because they’re so busy trying to be everything else.
Jansen says many of these unrealistic pressures experienced by women are visible in mainstream pornography because the actresses all fit into a single mold—thin, hairless, white, large-breasted—and are capable of reaching orgasm within minutes. Also, much of the sex in these movies is tailored to the service of men, while the focus on authentic female pleasure is very minimal.
As a proprietor solely interested in the sexual education of women, the inclusion of mainstream porn in her shop would be extremely detrimental because it homogenizes female desires, promotes violence against women, and centralizes the penis. Jansen argues that ultimately, mainstream porn fails on every level as an educational tool.
Sixteen years ago, she says there was not a lot to choose from in the market of female-friendly porn. As the industry grew, however, Jensen says the production of porn was no longer an elitist practice, and more and more marginalized groups like women and transsexuals began making their own porn.
The feminist porn offered in the shop depicts genuine female pleasure, agency, and desire. It celebrates the plurality (ethnicity, sexual orientation, body type, and age) of all women, and operates mainly through an anti-oppressive framework. But most importantly, it promotes the equal treatment of women, as well as safe sex practices.
A few years ago, Jansen even decided to create an event to award these female-friendly porn stars, directors, and producers.
Dubbed the Feminist Porn Awards, the event garnered so much attention from a variety of workers in the industry that it spawned a recurring annual celebration for female, race, gay, lesbian, transsexual, and inter-sexual-friendly porn.
Heading into its eighth year, the event has grown substantially, spanning two days: the first day, a showcase of directors’ work at Bloor Cinema, and the second, the gala award ceremony.
Apart from the Feminist Porn Awards, Jansen also intends on participating in Vajanuary, the female equivalent for Movember, which requires that one’s pubic hair not be shaven until the end of the month, with the proceeds going to towards charity.
Though the war for recognizing sexual equality and education for women is not one that can be won overnight, Jansen believes that her utopia is attainable.
The key to this empowerment, says Jansen, is “celebrating your body and desires as they are, not comparing yourself with other women, educating yourself, accepting who you are, and not trying to make yourself like everyone else.”

While most stag shops are designed to service the needs of men, Good For Her finds its niche with female customers
“[As a young girl], even though I was thin and white, I didn’t see anyone in the media that looked like me,” says Carlyle Jansen, owner and founder of Toronto’s leading female-friendly sex shop, Good For Her, located at Bathurst and Harbord Streets.
Jansen felt she never looked good in long hair or girly clothes, so she compensated by wearing loose clothing, to hide her body, and cut her hair short.
Like many girls in their teens, the now exuberant Jansen not only felt uncomfortable with her body, but her sexuality as well. When she went through puberty, she found the thought of sex so repugnant she postponed engaging in sexual intercourse until her early 20s.  Even then, she says her discomfort never dissipated, and throughout the course of her sexual exploration, she found she could not reach orgasm with any of her partners.
Destitute and beleaguered, there seemed to be no solution for her sexual ineptitude. At age 28, she reached rock bottom when her then-boyfriend left her because she could not have an orgasm. But Jansen saw this moment as a calling that sex no longer be merely a complex assortment of gestural rhetoric.
Soon after, Jansen began to educate herself in the art of sex. Through workshops, literature, sex toys, and self-exploration, she became the guru of self-love, and found that she could reach climax with the aid of sex toys.
During her sister’s bridal shower, she taught her sister’s friends the mechanics of sex toys. Jansen says at that moment, she realized there were a multitude of women like her, who felt so uncomfortable with expressing their sexuality that they suppressed their desires, and became completely ignorant of all the possibilities of their sexuality.
In 1997, Jansen recognized this untapped market and decided to promote sexual education for women through the creation of her very own sex shop.
Designed to promote comfort and openness for its female customers, the shop resembles a humble home. Besides having a selection of sex toys that cater to every need, from 15-inch dildos to nipple stimulators that resemble mini-serrated pizza cutters, the shop also holds workshops for a variety of subjects, from learning how to talk dirty to how to give erotic massages.
Jansen also mentions that they have women and trans-only hours, from 12 to 5 p.m. on Sundays because female customers often feel uncomfortable buying products in the presence of men.
“As a women and trans-friendly shop, it is a key resource for people exploring their sexuality. It’s a non-judgmental space,” says Michael Jackman, a sixth-year media and sexuality student and PhD candidate.
“Most sex-shops are geared towards men and are not inviting for women. But Good for Her provides that space where women feel safe.”
When asked what the source of this discomfort is, Jansen says from a young age women are socialized into thinking sex is immoral and their genitals are ugly. When it comes to intercourse, she says women often feel guilty about asking for what they want in bed and that they are boring their partners.
Jansen believes all the pressures placed on women to be successful, look perfect, and be good mothers, partners, and daughters can cause women to shut down sexually, and consciously stop thinking about things like being good lovers because they’re so busy trying to be everything else.
Jansen says many of these unrealistic pressures experienced by women are visible in mainstream pornography because the actresses all fit into a single mold—thin, hairless, white, large-breasted—and are capable of reaching orgasm within minutes. Also, much of the sex in these movies is tailored to the service of men, while the focus on authentic female pleasure is very minimal.
As a proprietor solely interested in the sexual education of women, the inclusion of mainstream porn in her shop would be extremely detrimental because it homogenizes female desires, promotes violence against women, and centralizes the penis. Jansen argues that ultimately, mainstream porn fails on every level as an educational tool.
Sixteen years ago, she says there was not a lot to choose from in the market of female-friendly porn. As the industry grew, however, Jensen says the production of porn was no longer an elitist practice, and more and more marginalized groups like women and transsexuals began making their own porn.

Using The Devil Wears Prada as an example, Olivia Chandler points out the breadth and depth of power the fashion industry holds

A scene from The Devil Wears Prada features Andy (Anne Hathaway) chuckling at Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the Editor-in-Chief of “Runway Magazine” (a thinly-veiled allusion to Vogue), when she is trying to choose between two cerulean belts.
Miranda does not hesitate to tell her, “You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select… I don’t know… that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. That blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs, and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff.”
Her words are certainly true in today’s world. But while fashion has the ability to destroy a woman’s self-esteem, it can also empower her.
The relationship between feminism and fashion has been, and still is, a tumultuous one. During the second wave of feminism, the New York Radical Women’s group protested at the 1968 Miss America Pageant and tossed items associated with femininity—high heels, false eyelashes, makeup, tweezers, curlers, girdles, fashion and beauty magazines, corsets and bras—into the “Freedom Trash Can.”
It is difficult to argue against critics who say the fashion industry objectifies women and upholds beauty standards unattainable for the average woman. The industry sends messages that influence us, telling us how we should value ourselves and determine our self-worth. Instead of valuing ourselves based on our accomplishments, intelligence, and personal strengths, we are instead told that our self-worth is measured by our material possessions.
In the case of fashion, it’s what or who you are wearing. Women are continually pressured to contribute to this vicious cycle and wear the latest trends. We are told we need to own that glamorous $2,000 Chanel handbag most can’t afford.
But fashion touches the lives of women every single day. The argument of being “anti-fashion” for anyone, feminist or not, would be hard to support.
Consider this: fashion is integral to society; we make decisions about what clothes to wear every single day. A person generally wears six to 10 articles of clothing a day, not including accessories. This forces women to make a choice every day. We can either choose not to care what we look like, which some don’t, or we can choose to conform to what the industry standards are, which most of us do.
Women have the ability to use fashion to their advantage and reclaim it as a form of empowerment, and not destruction. We can use it as a form of resistance against the socially constructed norms that dictate the “proper” way to dress.
Fashion should be used creatively and as a form of self-expression. If there was no fashion industry, we would not have any diversity. We most likely would have to conform to wear the same things, and who likes conformity? How boring.
Fashion is also another form of communication; we use it to communicate our personality, mood, beliefs, social or political views, and cultures.
Ultimately, fashion is a personal choice. Feminist or not, it is a powerful tool that has yet to be used to its full potential.
But in order for women to use fashion for social change, we must first change among ourselves. We have become too critical of one another, especially when it comes to what we wear. Instead, we should rise up to encourage and support women who go against fashion norms.
Whether you love fashion or don’t, whether you love to wear sneakers or eight-inch heels, whether you like to show a little more skin or enjoy covering up, fashion should not be used as means by which women judge each other. No woman should feel as if she is setting back feminism if she loves fashion,
As Minh Ha T. Pham wrote in the January issue of Ms., a feminist magazine, “If feminists ignore fashion, we are ceding our power to influence it.”

Film and television create ambiguous sexual expectations by not explicitly showing consent being given

In the second-season premiere of Girls, there’s a moment where one of the characters, Shoshanna, is having a dispute with her lover, Ray. It escalates. She’s walking away. He grabs her and pulls her back, forcibly kissing her. She relents. They have sex.
This is a question that was posited to me a few weeks ago, and has since been turning over in my head: how often is sexual consent given in film and television? And extending from whatever the probable answer is (hint: almost never), what does it mean?
What’s shocking is the lack of statistical documentation about this. There hasn’t been a single study done on approach and consent in film. It’s simply there, and taken for granted, which is intensely troubling.
I’ve been trying to think of films and shows in which a kiss is approached with consent, and I have trouble listing more than five. There are more than a few scenes I can think of that can easily be counted as rape, the aforementioned one in Girls being one of them.
It’s a sign of a society in which sexism has, because of the reductive processes of equality, become more subtle, an ingrained behaviour rather than an active decision, and this is one of the ways it manifests itself.
We’re often primed to reject violence, while love and intimacy are expected. The cues for sexual behaviour are taken from our own social learning and what we absorb from the media. This is only strengthened as we age and are fed the same concepts. From watching the Prince kiss Snow White,all the way to watching Booth Jonathan aggressively accosting Marnie in Girls, expectations develop around the way things occur, especially in the power-tipped patriarchal side.
It’s from these expectations that we get things like nice-guy syndrome and rape culture. For all its sophistication, mass media operates in almost storybook terms when it comes down to simple intimacy. Even worse, it normalizes the idea that not asking for consent yields positive results. It’s these small, significant ideas that are omnipresent, constantly holding back gender equality.
All of this comes down to the idea of responsibility in entertainment. Director Mike Figgis once said, “All films are science fiction films,” which is true, to an extent. They posit situations, scenarios, and people out of nothing, leading us to lives that, no matter how unremarkable they are, always operate on heightened levels of reality.
But to say that a film isn’t informed by the culture at large would be ignorant. Girls demonstrates a close-to-life aesthetic and has become something of a cultural trend-setter, both in how it speaks to the emotions of people in its target audience, and how it informs the programming that has come afterwards. It’s a show that prides itself on having realistic depictions of sex scenes. So then, why can’t it have realistic depictions of physical communication and approach?
Of course, Girls is one piece of entertainment out of countless others that do this. It’s the norm in most media portrayals of intimacy. The show demonstrates a lack of awareness and illustrates how far we still have to go to become egalitarian. It’s…something to work on.

The sexual assault of Jyoti Singh sparks protests in demand of women’s rights

News of the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman, Jyoti Singh, on the streets of Delhi, India’s capital, outraged the world this past December. More importantly, it has caused Indian society to question its treatment of women.
“I feel disgusted calling myself a man and not being able to help that girl who fell prey to those animals,” says Chirag Thakkar, a political science student at Delhi University.
“However, I see immense hope in the protest-scape of India. Twelve thousand charged and angry youngsters outside the president’s house crying for justice is not an ordinary event. It definitely brought the complacent and power-mongering statesmen to come out of their slumber and respond.”
Thakkar is referring to the mass protests that started in New Delhi as news about the rape case reached the public through news and social media. Thousands protested at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the location of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president of India. The protests soon spread to other parts of India as well as abroad.
This massive public outcry led to the creation of a special commission and a fast-track court being commissioned. Currently, five men stand trial for the rape and murder of Singh.
Significant change, however, requires a consideration of India’s history and culture.
In the year 1947, with the end of colonialism and the formation of a nation-state, a new chapter started in the story of an ancient civilization. Today, 65 years after independence, 21st-century India is caught up in the debate between tradition and modernity.
Gender inequality is deeply entrenched in Indian society, but this runs counter to Hindu values. According to Hindu traditions, goddesses are worshipped because they bring wealth, wisdom, and strength.
However, today the very practitioners of Hinduism look down upon girls as financial burdens for families, who must marry off any female children and pay their dowries.
Mitra Joshi, news reporter for CNBC TV-18 in Mumbai, reflects on these contradictions.
“On one hand, we worship Durga [a Hindu goddess] and her numerous forms in the temple, but when it comes to women in the house or the womb, she is treated as an unwanted commodity. All our society needs is a son. Why?” asks Joshi.
“Unless, and until, women themselves stand up against these atrocities, nothing will change,” says Joshi. “But women are told to keep quiet and endure the violence, or else they will be stigmatized by the society.”
Today, the Indian judicial system is adapting to seek justice not only for Singh but also for every Indian woman who has been a victim of gender-based violence. But there are no quick fixes to end the injustice.
“All along, we have been denying the noise this issue deserves. The anger had to pour out on the streets, at protest sites, in cyberspace, and in the media,” says Thakkar.
“I believe that some seeds of change have been sown and that they shall germinate. The tree shall bloom, not by living in denial, but by being constantly at war with patriarchy.”

2014-08-27,York,India,"Fashion’s job is, simply put, to tell you how you want to dress before you know it, but that is definitely not limiting. With something this season for everyone’s personal style, I’m here to give you the insider’s scoop in summer fashion so that you what to expect, stay ahead of the game and look good while doing it, too.
For boys who enjoy dressing a little more conservatively, the trend this summer was something functional to keep you cool, while looking fashionable with a touch of nostalgia. This look is very easy to achieve with light cotton and linen shirts.
Many spring collections include short-sleeved button-down shirts with bright, fun, cheesy, and lovably nostalgic patterns and prints. Pair one of these breathable cotton shirts with a light t-shirt underneath and you have a versatile look for endless outdoor occasions. Linen is also the go-to look this summer for men as it is famous for being extremely light and breathable. A long-sleeve linen shirt is a great addition to any wardrobe as linen is generally sold in neutral colours that are effortless to pair with other items.
In terms of bottoms, the signature look of summer 2014 is denim shorts above the knee, cuffed or rolled up at the bottom. If you aren’t afraid to step a little bit out of your comfort zone, patterns and specifically floral patterns are this year’s hit for men.
Florals go great on pants, shirts, jackets, and everything in between. They give your outfit a non-traditional look that will surely separate you from the rest. With such a bold pattern, try to focus it more on one item at a time. If you wear a floral shirt, avoid wearing other patterns: you want the focus to be on that pattern without over-doing it. There are so many ways to wear a shirt, and they all have a different effect on your appearance.
Crew necks and V-necks are fun and classic looks, but it’s definitely time to try something new, boys. Rolled up sleeves are a great way to emphasize your arms. The sleeve ends a tad higher than regular t-shirts, giving you an opportunity to show off some definition. A longer length t-shirt that ends a few inches lower is a unique way to emphasize your height if you are on the taller side.
Finally, if you’re in the gym often enough to have achieved a chiseled chest, a grunge scoop t-shirt is an awesome way to show off your hard work. It’s essentially a regular crew neck t-shirt, but the neck is wider and deeper, showing off your trapezius and pectoral muscles.
Some new trends that are (believe it or not) making a comeback are crop tops and short shorts. Sometimes boys want to show off a bit more skin and if you’re confident in yourself, you could definitely try this look out for a summer outing to a beach or pool party, barbeque, or a day in the great outdoors. Crop tops were popular in men’s fashion in the 90s, as you can see in many high school shows. The classic snapshot is the high school quarterback having a serious conversation on his pastel yellow landline phone with his big haired crush. All the while sporting a jersey cropped to the navel, showing off his core and especially giving the audience a peek at his V-lines.
Ladies, summer is a great time to experiment with new fashions. Don’t be afraid to try something different! Many companies are focusing on bringing tropical culture to chilly, old Canada this summer, and that includes brining back maxi dresses. They are a perfect addition to every closet. They are flattering to every body type, and are impeccably easy to dress up or down for any occasion.
Most maxi dresses come in simple cotton-blend materials such as jersey, and this makes them fantastically comfortable and very easy to care for. For an effortless yet elegant look, pair a neutrally coloured maxi dress with a thin belt at the waist and matching wedges to achieve the perfect look for that beach or garden party you’ve been planning. Take that same dress and throw on a denim jacket and flashy accessories and you’re ready for those summer nights that top off the perfect summer days we are all longing for.
If you’re not into one-pieces, take a maxi skirt pulled up past the navel paired with a crop top for a sexier look that shows off just enough skin while keeping you cool. A lot of focus is brought to tropical prints and draping fabrics this year, and these prints are a great way to try something new. Try a light cardigan with a tropical print over a basic t-shirt and denim shorts for that Miami Beach look. Keep an eye out for fringes. Simply put, a fringe is a line of fabric with dangly strings all lined up, like the fringe of your hair.
Sheer shawls, purses, cardigans, necklaces, and even hoop earrings all seem to present opportunities for designers to add a fringe, and this is nothing but perfect. A fringe is a genius way for a designer to add movement to a piece. Any shift in position, every step will make this fringe naturally move on the garment and this looks simply amazing.
That being said, it seems like one of this summer’s trends for ladies is movement. Focus on wearing items that move on you, such as the famous fringe, light and sheer draping fabrics that will be picked up by the find and flutter in the breeze, patterns with lines and shapes that mesmerize an onlooker with every step you take like an optical illusion.

The Ontario government failed to allocate any additional graduate student spaces to York over the next three years in its recent strategic mandate signing spree with colleges and universities.
The government had been signing agreements with Ontario’s 45 post-secondary institutions, requesting that they provide lists of 10 programs they consider their strongest and five programs they wish to expand.
The decision to sign the agreements, otherwise known as “strategic mandate agreements” was allegedly made to end the duplication of programs and to move towards a more specialized system.
Regarding additional graduate student spaces, the University of Toronto will receive 580 new spots, Ryerson will receive 256, and York will receive none for the periods of 2014-2015 to 2016-2017.
In an article in the Toronto Star, York president and vice-chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri said he believed York was penalized in regard to graduate funding allocation because most of its current graduate students are not Canadian or permanent Canadian residents.
“On the one hand, the government tells us to take in more international students, then they don’t count them because they don’t fund them,” said Shoukri.
Rhonda Lenton, vice-president academic and provost says it is important to note York has one of the largest graduate student
populations in Ontario. “We continue to advocate for recognition and funding for international students, along with our colleagues in the sector.”
May Nazar of the communications branch at the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities says York was not given additional graduate spaces over the three-year period because eligible graduate enrolment has been under York’s targets in recent years.
According to the SMA between York and the MTCU, York was 341.18 under its target for the 2013-2014 period.
“York University still has room for eligible graduate enrolment growth, as its current enrolment remains below the target confirmed as part of the process,” says Nazar.
In its SMA, York identified engineering and science, bilingual programs, arts, digital media, performance and design, business/management/administration, and healthy individuals and communities as its proposed programs for future growth.
The SMA also notes a medical school on the horizon for York by 2020 in its vision statement.
Nazar, however, says at this time the ministries of Health and Long-Term Care and Training, Colleges, and Universities are not predicting medical education expansion over the short and medium term.
“We remain open to the future possibility of establishing a medical school,” says Lenton.
Lenton says in addition to focussing on York’s five designated programs, York will continue to set the foundation for a medical school.

Well, what do you expect?  With all the negative publicity recently about York U. I am surprised that they didn’t reduce funding for the University!   Crime Wave, Shootings, Sexual Assaults on Campus, Anti-Semitic incidents, SAIA hate-fest,  you think no one on Parliament Hill reads the papers – including THIS ONE?
Let me explain further, the Ontario government is, in effect, saying: “Read My Lips” to the University Administration.
They may not be up front about it, but they are communicating their displeasure about what is going on here… and in a very effective, attention getting manner, right in YorkU students pocketbook. 
Toronto police are investigating the Immigration Watch Canada posters which appeared on York’s campus and the Village in August.
The posters in question display the York logo and target immigrants at York.
“If mass third world migration continues, White Canadians will be reduced to a persecuted minority,” the posters read.
Joanne Rider of York media says the posters were removed because there was no permission granted to post them. Official notification was sent to Immigrant Watch Canada instructing the organization to cease and desist using York’s logo and photographs.
“Diversity and inclusiveness are core values of York University,” says Rider.
According to Jenniferjit Sidhu, a media relations officer for Toronto Police Service, they received a radio call regarding the posters on Friday, August 1. York Security also provided a copy of the poster to the police.
According to Sidhu, the TPS Hate Crime Unit is reviewing the posters to confirm whether they constitute as potential hate propaganda. She also notes similarities to the posters which appeared in Brampton on April 22. However, it was determined after consultation that while the posters may be considered to be racist and offensive, they do not meet the threshold of the hate crime criteria in the Criminal Code of Canada.
“Why would we not distribute them at York?” says Dan Murray of Immigration Watch Canada. Does York deserve some immunity from exposure to free speech? Does the material in the flyers conflict with York ideology?”
Various campus groups and students have spoken out regarding the offensive posters.
“No one should be subjected to such hateful and offensive messaging on their campus or in their community,” said Mithilen Mathipalan, vice-president equity of the York Federation of Students in a press release.
 “Students deserve to live, work and study without fear of discrimination or harassment.”
“There is absolutely no place for this at York University,” said Mathipalan.
“We commend the administration for acting so quickly in removing these posters,” said Tamara Caplan, director of Hillel @ York.
“Hillel embraces multiculturalism and diversity on campus, and we encourage all students to speak out with us vigorously against acts of bigotry.”
Sidhu of TPS says each appearance of the flyers is investigated separately.
“We encourage anyone receiving these or any similar flyers to continue to report them to the police,” says Sidhu.
No criminal charges have been laid at this time.

The launch of the Toronto-York Spadina subway extension could be further delayed due to a lawsuit filed by the TTC against the contractor of Vaughan’s subway station.
The $10-million lawsuit argues that the contractor, Arup Canada failed to meet scheduled dead-lines, use “skilled, competent staff,” and to meet building and electrical codes.
It’s currently unknown if this alleged breach-of-contract will affect the current date of completion, and which subway sites will be impacted.
Although Andy Byford, TTC CEO, would not comment on the lawsuit to various media outlets, he said the plan to open the line remains set for late fall 2016.
“We do know that is going to be a challenge at a number of the sites. My project team is working with the contractors to see what’s possible,” said Byford in a CBC article.
According to Brad Ross, executive director of corporate communications for the TTC, lawsuits like this one against Arup Canada are common.
 “We have many contracts that we take action against to protect our interests, so this is not an unusual thing,” he says.
In an article to The National Post, Byford also revealed that the timeframe of the expansion has been difficult since the beginning.
The line extension has already been delayed once, as the completion was originally set for December 2015.
The TTC blamed this delay on contractor performance and the amount of time spent on obtaining funding approvals. The blame has also been placed on the time it took for the contractor to reach an agreement on station designs, extensive work needed to relocate utilities, and the death of a construction worker at the York construction site in October 2011.
For the time being, it is unknown if the project will be delayed further due to the lawsuit. The TTC maintains it is working to avoid this.
“I have no information to suggest that the project will be delayed because of this,” says Ross.
Andrew McAlpine, principal of Arup Canada, says the lawsuit is general in nature and was filed over six months ago.
“While we are responding in due course, we remain confident of an amicable resolution and continue to keep our focus on delivering a successful project.”

York student Annie Truong-Le’s passing at this summer’s Veld Music Festival shocked Toronto and surrounding communities.
Truong-Le, 20, was studying to complete her BA in political science.
She died suddenly after allegedly ingesting unknown party drugs at the two-day music event held on August 2 at Downsview Park.
The student’s family has been understandably heartbroken by the event, with Truong-Le’s
friends and family lashing out at media outlets via Twitter as a result of the news coverage.
Truong-Le interned for City Councillor Anthony Perruzza, helping constituents with their municipal issues. She also helped organize special events,community meetings and assisted with and organized community advocacy.
“Annie was a smart, charismatic young woman full of life, full of purpose with a great future,” says Perruzza.
“Her sudden passing is a terrible loss for all of us. I will miss her.”
According to Perruzza, she spent a great deal of volunteer time assisting others and asking for nothing in return. She had a bubbly, infectious personality and was the kind of person many could not help but like.
Truong-Le was also very active with a local community agency called MATA (Mentoring Arts Tutoring Athletics), which helps youth by providing guidance and mentorship. The program aims to promote post-secondary education and betterment of youth in marginalized communities.
Regarding the consumption of drugs and alcohol, the university has a number of initiatives to prevent irresponsible consumption at this year’s frosh, regardless of the incident.
The National College Health Assessment statistics regarding campus alcohol consumption breaks through the illusion of York students heavily consume alcohol.
Based on the study sample, people thought only 4.7 per cent of York students abstain from alcohol. But according to the study, 28 per cent of York students refrain from the use of alcohol completely.
Health Education at York also supports the delivery of Alcohol EDU, an alcohol teaching program to all first year students living in residence, as well as varsity athletes, orientation leaders, and other peer leaders from across the university.
According to Leah State, coordinator at Health Education, York is currently in the process of rolling out a bystander intervention program.
New students are urged to use the multitude of York safety initiatives, including the safety app which, to date, has been downloaded almost 13,000 times.

After much deliberation, York in cooperation with Seneca College, has chosen Markham as the preferred location for the potential new York campus.
Markham, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, East Gwillimbury, and Aurora in collaboration with Newmarket originally delivered proposals to York and Seneca.
The new campus was shortlisted for Vaughan, Markham, and Richmond Hill in April.
York announced on June 23 it would be working in collaboration with Seneca College to submit a proposal to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities to build a new campus in Markham Centre.
“The Markham Centre site is located in the heart of a vibrant new urban centre, close to Ontario’s ‘Big Move’ transit investments and other amenities for students,” says Rhonda Lenton, vice-president academic and provost.
According to Lenton, the size and design of the proposed campus have yet to be determined.
Within five years of opening, the university aims for the campus to hold 5,000 students.
Over the next 20 years, the campus is expected to hold between 10,000 to 20,000 students.
A report to the Board of Governors meeting on June 23 states the new campus is estimated to need 2.4 million square feet at capacity and is predicted to be a $300 to $400-million project.
Lenton says York’s collaboration with Seneca for the project will take York’s strength in student mobility and flexibility to a new level that will benefit new and current students.
“We are thrilled with the opportunity in Markham Centre and it is just the beginning of our plan to be in more locations across the region over time,” said York president and vice-chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri in a YFile article.
Lenton notes the new campus will allow the university to better serve the York Region, which she says is one of Ontario’s fastest growing major urban areas.
Dave Barrow, mayor of Richmond Hill, said in a press release that although he is disappointed the campus will not be in Richmond Hill, he is excited about the possibility of having a campus so close to the town.
“We look forward to working with our neighbours to the east and with the entire York Region community in supporting York University’s bid for a campus in our region.”
Tim Simmonds, executive director for the city of Vaughan says the new campus will create jobs and become a catalyst to future development across the region.
“From an education, economic, and social perspective, this campus is a positive for the entire community,” says Simmonds.
The city of Markham was unavailable to comment on the proposal.
Lenton says the university is working closely with Seneca, the city of Markham, and York Region to submit an “outstanding” proposal that addresses the criteria outlined by the MTCU by the deadline date, September 26.
A decision is expected to be announced in early 2015.

A proposal has been put forward to add a new wing to the Schulich School of Business, according to a memo included in the Board of Governor’s agenda package this past summer.
The proposal was for BOG to approve-in-principle, a new project on condition of the successful fundraising of 75 per cent of the anticipated $40-million project.
The expansion will be designed to accommodate the growing number of MBA and PhD students, many of whom arrive from international destinations and have different social, cultural, and intellectual needs.
According to the BOG memo, “Internal growth pressures are severely taxing the current building and external pressures are derived from several sources, including increased competition from top international business schools at the graduate level.”
Since the Seymour Schulich Building opened in 2003, the undergraduate population has grown by 25 per cent beyond what was originally planned.
Upwards of 60 per cent of MBA students now come from outside of Canada. As stated by the memo, The Schulich School of Business, India, when opened will further accelerate this trend.
“I’ve never felt that’s been an issue,” says Jessica Gill, a third year international bachelor of business administration student.
“I think Schulich has done a pretty good job of accommodating all students. I do believe there has been an increase in incoming students, so perhaps it’s getting difficult for them to manage it.”
York administration provided a signal that they will endorse the proposed expansion with the approval-in-principle, and according to the memo, they will fully collaborate with the project.
It’s expected that enabling the site plan approval in parallel with the fundraising exercise will shorten the project’s path by an estimated eight months.
The Schulich student body remains largely unaware of the proposed building expansion.
“I’m not sure exactly what resources the expansion will bring, but I’m sure it will definitely enhance the MBA program,” says Gill
According to York advisor and deputy spokesperson Janice Walls, “It’s very preliminary at this point so there’s no more information available beyond what is in the Board of Governors’ package.”

Head Start at York helped new students understand how to communicate their academic needs and accommodations to professors during the annual event hosted by Mental Health Disabi-lity Services.
The summer transition program aimed to help students learn from peers, faculty, and industry experts on how to navigate York’s resources, and how to interact with professors when requesting academic accommodations.
Dr. Jennifer Lund of Trent University spoke at Head Start earlier in the week.
“Accommodation for students with mental health disabilities looks a bit different at each university and college,” says Dr. Lund. “However, there is consistency in that the mandate of our offices is to provide access so students can be successful in their studies.”
Dr. Lund openly talks about living with bipolar disorder and specifies that, most importantly, for those who live with mental health disabilities, is the option, with supporting medical documentation, to be registered as equivalent to full-time when they choose to take a reduced course load to prioritize health and maximize academic strengths.
Students registered with disability services are required to hand in their accommodation forms to professors early in the semester. Although, students may often find the process difficult if professors are not understanding.
This event helped students utilize specific resources related to mental health, and how they can interact with professors to communicate their needs.
“If you are nice to people, you are more likely to get what you want, and this is true to any aspect of life,” says Associate Professor Jennifer Kuk from the School of Kinesiology and Health Science.
Kuk presented students with information on how to become more familiar with the accommodation process and how they can discuss their needs with their future professors.
“Teaching is only one-third of your professor’s responsibility,” she adds.
“Professors do care, but sometimes they may not know how to accommodate or have the time to accommodate in the way you want. Let us know what you need early so we can better accommodate in a fair way to you, the other students, and the professor.”
Kuk’s opening comments at Head Start specified how she was hired for her research background and had not been traditionally trained as a teacher. At this point, she was not familiar with York’s accommodation process.
Like many professors, Dr. Kuk learned about disability services and accommodations for students as she taught. She often required students to explain what their specific needs were.
MHDS offers the three-day program ‘Head Start’ every August to students who identify with having a mental health challenge.
“Accommodation is always confidential – this is also key,” says  Dr. Lund.
“Meeting with a disability/accessibility counsellor is key to feeling heard, understood and validated.”
“I can’t tell you how important my counsellor at MHDS at York was to me during my doctoral degree. I can state unequivocally that her confidence and faith in me was instrumental in my completing my degree.”
“My challenges as a student was feeling confident that I would be seen as competent while registered with a disability,” says Dr. Lund.
“I learned to address the shame that I felt and learned to ask for what would make me successful academically. I learned skills in self advocacy through MHDS which have served me in all areas of my life, particularly in requesting accommodation as a university employee.”
Students often struggle to navigate the accommodation system, including the alternative exam centre, which has specific criteria for registration. The alternative exam centre has allegedly changed their registration requirements since the winter academic season.
“The Head Start program was a good way to get a jump on the upcoming school year and feel better prepared,” says one student who chose to remain anonymous.
“It was really helpful to learn more about all of the services CDS, MHDS and LSS provides and how to easily access them. The guest speakers and peer mentors were very relatable and informative. Also, it was a great opportunity to make connections with other students.”

You’ve arrived at York and so we tip our metaphorical hats to you. By now you are more than likely lost and afraid, and you may or may not have dropped close to $400 on textbooks for one class. It sucks, we know.
But for now welcome to our frosh issue where we’ve done our very best to supply you with tips and tricks that will help make your transition into York life as easy as possible.
It’s not easy being a student; you are probably in some sort of debt and will most likely walk into the wrong lecture hall several times. As you step into the wrong crowded lecture hall, I will chuckle to myself and smile as your gaze of confusion glistens, and close to 300 students stop taking notes just to look at you.
I will be honest with you, university isn’t easy. Unless you’re a genius, you will need to put legitimate effort into your studies. That means going to class, taking notes, and actually speaking up in your tutorials. Those participation marks can really kill your GPA. Take a look at your syllabus, you might lose close to 10 per cent of your mark if you pull off the silent treatment gig. Tutorials can be legitimately scary, and it might make you pee a little, but every other new student is in the same position as you.
You can do it, we have confidence in you. If you are actually lost and confused, there are many places
to turn to for advice. I’d suggest getting involved with one of the many student associations and clubs across campus. There you will meet students who have a
bit more experience than you, and can often answer those stupid questions you are dreading to ask. There are endless intramural programs to join, and your respective college has it’s own student government who would love for you to get involved.
Excalibur is the same, we want you to stroll in and get involved with the paper. As an institution, we are constantly in need of volunteers. No experience required, just a good attitude and a smile here
or there helps quite a bit.
Not to mention the school itself has many programs and counselling services to help you enjoy some
of the best years of your life.
Whatever your interests are, from Nintendo to self-defense, Pokemon to Harry Potter, there really is something for everyone here at York. It’s a great way to make some new friends and feel all the more comfortable during your time here. No, you won’t need to study everyday, and yes, you will have free time. So make the most of it, deal? Deal.
Have some fun this frosh and be yourself. Your parents aren’t watching and it’s time to not only get your degree, but also go through some personal growth and become the person you want to be.
Please, don’t be afraid.

As the forthcoming school year looms, Excalibur recommends a break from reality and an escape into the realm of cinematic ingenuity with this year’s Toronto International Film Festival.
Canadian films are better than ever, with Quebec native Xavier Dolan leading the charge at the tender age of 25.
 Al Pacino will be featured in a one-on-one conversation at the Festival Kickoff Party. Comedic treasure Bill Murray, in a year being dubbed “the year of Bill Murray” will also be celebrated on September 5’s “Bill Murray Day.”
 So ditch the books and take a look at our five pre-TIFF choices, before the late nights and caffeine-induced mania kick in.

Foxcatcher
Directed by: Bennett Miller
Stars: Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Steve Carell
 The film revolves around the true life drama of wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz. The brothers find themselves in an unfortunate situation following promises made by millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) to bring them fame, wealth, and glory.
 Dubbed “Team Foxcatcher,” the brothers get caught up in the dysfunctional lifestyle of rich, gun-crazed, and eccentric du Pont, who suffers from severe paranoia. The three characters end up colliding at the peak of their Olympics venture in Seoul.
 Early reviewers are citing great performances by the trio, with Oscar buzz surrounding the film’s acting, directing, and writing.

The Imitation Game 
Directed by: Morten Tyldum
Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley
 Norwegian director Morten Tyldum makes his English debut with the biopic The Imitation Game.
 Critics are raving about Benedict Cumberbatch and his Oscar-worthy performance as the genius mathematician, cryptanalyst, and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing.
He was the one who spearheaded the technical charge to decode German naval communications during World War II.
 Turing’s efforts not only helped shorten the war, but also inspired technological advancement to the point that computers could first
be imagined.
Aside from the war, Turing also faces difficulties with his homo-sexuality, during a time of impossible acceptance by society. He finds support through his colleague and friend Joan Clarke played by
Keira Knightley.

Two Days, One Night 
Directed by: Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne
Stars: Marion Cotillard
 Starring French beauty Marion Cotillard, the French-language Two Days, One Night revolves around the tale of Sandra, a young Belgian mother who finds out her colleagues have opted to receive annual bonuses in exchange for her dismissal.
 In trying to institute a vote against the decision, Sandra has only a weekend to convince her co-workers to save her from being dismissed.
This heart-wrenching drama brings out the best and worst in working lives and friendships, with Cotillard leading in what many believe to be her best performance yet.
 The Belgian directors have won two Palme d’Ors and a Grand Prix in Cannes.

Winter Sleep
Directed by: Nuri Bilge Ceylan
 Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan is famous for his films Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011) and Distant (2002), winning the Grand Prix, Best Director, Grand Jury, and Palm d’Or at Cannes.
Winter Sleep is set in central Anatolia in Turkey, and follows a hotel during its offseason in a half-empty small village, along with the life of its owner and local celebrity actor Aydin.
The director utilizes magnificent cinematography, meticulous dialogue, and striking landscapes.
 Winter Sleep has already won the Palme d’Or this year, and been chosen as Turkey’s submission for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars.
The emotional and psychological spectrum of Ceylan’s
films require patience and an active audience.

Mommy
Directed by: Xavier Dolan
 At the age of 25, Montreal-based filmmaker Xavier Dolan earned himself the Jury Prize with the
film Mommy in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.
This kid has every right to be crowned the king of hearts in Canadian filmmaking and this year’s TIFF is sure to hold him in the highest regards.
Mommy encircles the rocky relationship between a single mother and her troubled teenage son.
 The emotional drama includes spontaneous sex, intense depth, and some serious Oedipal comedy.

2015-09-25,York,India,"The spotlight turns on Available Light and four MFA students in York’s dance program. September 24 marks the premier of this year’s I Am series, featuring solo autobiographical dance performances that shed some light on four students’ journeys. The solo performances mark a transition for second year master’s students, who after a year of choreographic study are able to present their works on a public stage. This particular performance, held at the McLean Performance Studio, is titled Available Light. Carol Anderson, creative director of the I Am series, says the show was named due to the performances being presented in whatever available lighting they have. “It seems an apt metaphor for the way in which artists work with the resources that they have at hand, and in mind and heart, at the moment of creative expression,” said Anderson. Available Light spotlights students of diverse backgrounds, including Nikolaos Markakis, Allison McCaughey, Suma Nair, and Michelle Silagy. Having survived their first year in their master’s program together, the quartet of dancers regularly collaborate and together comprise a diverse show. Markakis, who is dancing to live music, drew inspiration from folklorish and contemporary dance for his performance titled Ithaka. The title comes from a Greek poem that transcribes the 10-year-long journey from Troy to the island of Ithaka. “I am using Ithaka as a metaphor for my journey from my past to my present and hopes of my future,” added Markakis. McCaughey, a former chorus dancer, named her solo Third from the Left, a play on her position in a chorus line. A more commercial performance, the solo is meant to represent how the business of entertainment is an all-consuming aspect of dance, particularly McCaughey’s experience. Nair incorporates traditional Bharatanatyam Indian dance into her contemporary piece Belong.Influenced by personal narratives and cultural memories, this dance performance is a re-imagining of traditional dance to a contemporary audience. Silagy’s solo, titled …at the end of a stem, is a piece inspired by nature and a garden, environments which often influenced her MFA research. “It becomes a portal through which to pursue a fine attunement of my relationship to air, exhalation, respiration, impulse, nuance, gravity, and the natural world,” said Silagy. The I Am solos are one of three research components that the students go through, which culminate to a self-produced thesis concert in collaboration with York’s theatre production program. The public performances are open to all, and allow for students to embody their critical research into physical practices in front of an audience.

2015-11-27,York,India,"This list brings you the now-no-longer marginalized voices to your media player! It’s time to broaden your musical horizons with some of the most interesting LGBTQ+ acts out there today, from L to Q! Sex, drugs, music-a-go-go!
L.
The Con by Tegan and Sara 
An emotional rollercoaster of an album. Songs ranging from bubbly and poppy, to poignant and melancholy, the Canadian twin sister duo have been making music for almost two decades. This album, while managing to be sonically beautiful, expresses love songs devoid of pronouns, making it universal for anyone to listen and associate with. After all, everybody has felt love, and everybody’s felt it when it’s gone.
Favourite song: “Dark Comes Soon.”
G.
The Plague by Big Momma:
         It doesn’t matter as much that Big Momma identifies as gay as much as it matters that this gay gangsta-rapper is criminally underrated. Bringing hardcore rappity-rap flows to your ears, Big Momma touches on dark and often morbid issues. The Plague packs such a punch that it manages to flip all of the tropes typically associated with oversaturated phallocentric themes found in gangster rap and flips it on its head. The weather is growing grimmer and darker by the day, so maybe adding this horror-core artist to your music-playing device may not be a bad idea.
Favourite Song: “Denata.”
B.
Fabulous Muscles by Xiu Xiu:
Xiu Xiu is definitely bringing some of the finest avant-garde music to the table, and weirdest at that. Fabulous Muscles is bold in its experimentation and fragmentation of typical lyrical structure, as it documents on lead singer Jamie Stewart’s personal experiences, masquerading behind beautiful, sentient, and original poetry. Xiu Xiu is definitely an acquired taste, but the title track on the album is one of the most simultaneously sad and beautiful songs ever written, revolving around an abusive same-sex relationship.
Favourite Song: “I Luv the Valley, OH!”
T.
Transgender Dysphoria Blues by Against Me!:
Against Me!’s latest effort Transgender Dysphoria Blues is both catchy and the band’s first release since lead singer transitioned from Tom James Gabel to Laura Jane Grace. A lot has changed in the band’s thematic content, however what came off as muffled gender displacement in their old songs transformed into full-blown transgender anthems, both celebrating and facing gender dysphoria. This album catapulted a mainstream act that celebrated the transgender way of life and made some tough-as-nails art out of the confusion.
Favourite Song: “Osama bin Laden as the Crucified Christ.”
Q.
 Thee Official Limp Wrist Discography by Limp Wrist
         Queer straight-edge hardcore bands sure are strange. It’s not because they identify as queer, or because they abstain from drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. It’s because they managed to form a band where all members identify with these things and managed to play all the instruments required for a band. Often honoured as one of the best hardcore bands of all time, Limp Wrist’s brand of punk is abrasive, played with intense breakneck speed and humor. Thee Official Limp Wrist Discography has over 40 songs but only runs for about 35 minutes. Listen to it on your lunch break, although you won’t be satisfied when its done.
Favourite song: “Does Your Daddy Know?”

Arthur Inkheart was very excited.
“Tonight’s our first dance!” he told Keegan excitedly, springing alcohol from beneath his bed. The boys jittered in their dorm.
“We’ll be each other’s wingmen!” Keegan said sappily as they sipped the alcohol.
Absalom Catholic Academy, although a prestigious boarding school for grades 6 to 12, preserves its social functions for grades 9 to 12. It’s a big deal for first-timers.
When they had enough liquid courage, the boys departed. The dance quickly devolved into a slimy crotch massage, as was the custom of the times.
You’d think Arthur would be more interested in his potential virginity thief. Oh no! There was a drunken train wreck called Keegan to watch.
Like a chivalrous knight, Arthur peeled off his partner and ran to the rescue.
“How are ya bud?” Arthur hollered over the pulsating, mechanical music.
“Good – I’m – I might – be sick.”
Arthur guessed what he said and peeled off Keegan’s dance partner.
The duo passed the teachers who were entranced by the horny horde of teenagers. They were, as the Germans say ‘angepisst’ – oh, they were very angepisst!
Arthur brought Keegan back to the dorm.
“Did ya see her?” Arthur asked.
“Who?”
“That one chick.”
“No.”
“I didn’t either. She kept turning her butt to me. You were on booty duty Keeg.”
“What! Oh, I bet she was real skunky. Arthur, you saved me from a hot mess!”
“Maybe,” Arthur said, lowering him to his bed.
Suddenly, Keegan bear-hugged Arthur, dragging him onto the bed.
“You’re my best friend,” said Keegan, within intimate space of Arthur’s face, lying beneath him in a drunken embrace.
“You’re mine too – now would ya mind –”
“I’m so happy! ‘Cause you are – you are my best friend.” Keegan’s soft hands cherished Arthur’s sides.
“That’s great, but…” Closer and tighter together Keegan towed them.
“You’re my best friend,” Keegan whispered in his ear. They were a kiss’ distance away. Keegan motioned for Arthur’s cheek.
“This is bad,” Arthur swerved his head away.
Soft, warm, honey sweet lips caressed Arthur’s neck as a soft, sensual breeze titillated his face.
“This is worse.”
Keegan’s lips were touching, just touching, Arthur’s neck as Keegan giggled. “Oops.”
“That’s enough!” Arthur jerked away, “Go – good night, Keegan.”
“I’m not even that drunk, Arthur,” Keegan said before he passed out.
Arthur twitched. He tossed and he turned; he turned and he tossed. He could not relax.
So he carved out his heart with a pen and let it bleed unto the page. He wrote:
I can’t relax because of Keegan. Sometimes he gets me so worked up I can’t sleep. You know how some people get you going so much you shake? And your memories of them are so intense they’re all you think about?
Jesus. I just read that last part. Listen, I know how it reads, it isn’t what it seems! God, that makes it seem worse!
Listen, please hear me out. I know how it reads, and I know what you must think of me. Oh, it rattles me. It feels like there’s bugs under my skin!

But listen to me!
It’s more complicated than that. Look at how I love Phoebe. I do love Phoebe. If you put the heat of a June sun, all the innocence of a kid, all the songs the morning birds sing – if you put that into one person it would be Phoebe Belle!

I know I have … things to figure out, but I’m only fourteen! Who’s really done figuring that out at fourteen? It eats at me!

Not that I’m against it.

For the longest time, shopping in the plus-size section of any store left you with minimal options. Skinny jeans became mom jeans, and little black dresses became black ankle-length dresses. Forget finding a just a plain black shirt, because let’s face it, it is not plus-size unless it has a floral design.
“I can remember trying to find an outfit for a semi-formal in high school and only able to shop at one store. This store tailored to women over 40 years old and was terrible,” says Victoria McGroarty, owner of Gussied Up, a plus-size clothing boutique in Toronto.
At one point, you had to sit and wonder, did fashion designers know that there are people whose thighs just don’t fit in a size six dress? Who made this universal rule that plus-size women were not allowed to wear skinny jeans?
“Plus-size clothing has always been a taboo subject among fashion designers. Although the average woman wears a size 14, designers and even regular stores refuse to carry anything above a size 12,” says McGroarty.
When the average woman wears a size 14, it doesn’t make financial sense to ignore this segment of the market, she says.
Based on the terrible conventions that were associated with plus-size women, shopping has become somewhat of a taboo for McGroarty and many others.
“Finding clothes that were fashionable, affordable, and yet still managed to flatter my body seemed impossible,” says McGroarty. “It is assumed that anyone who is above size 12 has given up on all things fashion and prefers to wear matronly cover-ups.”
Stores who only cater to a size chart that stops at a size large greatly limits the amount of consumers that walk through their store on a daily basis. These stores send out a negative message to anyone who cannot fit into their size-eight dresses: you are just not skinny enough to shop here.
This distinction of body types alienates body types that are not the “ideal.”  If men’s stores can make sizes that go up to XXL and women’s store that have sizes starting at XXS, why can’t they make sizes that go up to XXL for women as well?
There is a clear market out there for the larger sizes, yet a lot of the stores won’t carry them, says McGroarty.
The reasoning behind this logic becomes unfair. It creates a binary in the shopping world while simultaneously dictating what certain body types can and cannot wear. If a woman of a larger body-type wishes to wear her little black dress, she should be allowed. She should not be stopped or discouraged by retail stores who say this is just not possible.
This is why it becomes important to pay attention and credit stores that carry clothes that cater to all body types. Stores such as Gussied Up, Forever 21, H&M, and Old Navy all offer clothing sizes that exceed your traditional size large.
“We have spending power but feel completely neglected by the industry. We are curvy, we are beautiful, we want fashion to catch up,” says McGroarty.
Gussied Up offers clothes that go beyond floral prints, mom jeans, and flowy shirts.  They welcome the little black dresses, skinny jeans, crop tops, and pencil skirts. These clothes are affordable, comfortable, and most importantly, fashionable.
The ability to feel comfortable in your body is not always an easy adaptation. While fighting off societal expectations, your confidence may plummet and your own personal critique can make becoming comfortable with your body a tiresome and evergoing process.
However, when you walk into a store and see that bigger sizes are offered, you feel elated. At last, someone has recognized that voluptuous girls deserve to feel beautiful in the clothes they wear and in the way the feel.
The fashion world is developing. It is going from being super inclusive, to exclusive, recognizing that there is not just one body type, but many, and every body type deserves clothes that fit their unique figure.
The world of plus-size shopping does not have to be as intimidating and stressful as it once was. Slowly but surely, the fashion world is opening up the realm to women of all sizes. The nightmares of walking into the shopping mall and leaving empty-handed have turned into magical real-life dreams.
So, go ahead ladies, rock that little black dress or your big comfy sweater. Always know it is you who dictates your fashion worth, no one else.

For those of you counting down the days to long lectures to come to a halt for the break, the good news is that the end of the first semester is just around the corner.
On another note, you’ve probably been quick to realize that this offers very little relief. The sad and agonizing reality for the majority of us is that the worst is yet to come.
York’s exam period begins Wednesday, December 9th and goes through to the 23rd. You can literally see the panic and stress on all the sleep-deprived faces of students on campus.
Perhaps you’re part of the small percentage of students who aren’t burdened with any exams, but rather a slew of assignments. After all, misery loves the company of end-of-the-term projects, essays, presentations, and assignments.
“I don’t have any final exams this semester but I do have a lot of projects that I think are even more time consuming,”  says Sara Qarizada a second-year graphic design student. “Projects take so much of your time and it’s a whole drawn-out process.”
Whatever your situation may be, there are some things you can do in the upcoming weeks that will make your life a little easier. So listen up. As university students we are no strangers to all nighters. In fact, they happen far more often than anyone would like to admit.
The best thing you could probably do for yourself and for your grade is to set up a schedule.
“It’s important to make a study schedule you feel you can stick to and make sure not to break it,” says Abrahim.
As the old saying goes, motivation is what gets you started but habit is what keeps you going. This applies very well to developing good study habits, he adds.
Reward yourself and take breaks. Not hour-long breaks, but 15 minutes usually does the trick. That way you are able to process what you just learned instead of trying to stuff your brain full of things you won’t retain by the next day.
It’s important to ensure that you have enough study time, enough leeway time, and enough self-care time, says Abrahim.
When it comes to taking the actual exam, too many people make the mistake of underestimating multiple choice exams or tests. The problem is that most of us will learn to recognize instead of actually understanding the information.
This tends to lead us into the mindset of thinking that everything is a trick question and any of these options could be possible. This also means that we take the shortcut and try to recognize the answer by keywords we think will stand out during the exam.
However, when it comes to an application type of question where you’re required to apply whatever concept or idea you learned, you’ll have no idea where to go next. Rather than memorizing, it’s important to actually try to understand the material.
“For the content that you feel you care about, you should try to understand it. Your grades will reflect that and you’ll feel better earning those grades as well,” says Abrahim.
Whether that means looking up an explanation or a YouTube animation to break down the topic for you, make sure you have a good grasp and understanding of the topic at hand.
When someone asks you what you’ve been learning, don’t brush it off like it’s a stupid question. Explaining a concept or theory to someone who doesn’t know will help you understand the material better and help you focus on the key points you need to hit.
Figure out the way you study best: cue cards, notes, reading, mnemonic devices, repetition, speaking out loud, or have sticky notes everywhere.
As for studying in groups, it does not always guarantee that studying will be accomplished, however groups are good for bouncing ideas off each other and testing one another.
“Group versus self-studying can be class dependant. If the material is dry, group studying is probably better but you need someone there to keep the group on track,” says Abrahim.
However, if the material is interesting it might be better to self-study regularly and then only group study for the major tests, he says.
There you have it, what you need to know to survive the next few weeks and come out on top. Good luck, scholars.

It has been an up-and-down start to the season for the Lions men’s basketball team, who lost back to back games in their season home opener at Tait McKenzie Centre this past weekend, first to the Brock Badgers on Frida,y and then to the McMaster Marauders the following evening.
Before hosting the teams from Hamilton and St. Catharines here in Toronto, the Lions were on the road, losing to the Queen’s Gaels before taking hard-fought wins over Nipissing and Laurentian University. In these games they showcased their offensive ability, quickly rising to fourth place in Ontario University Athletics scoring rankings. The same kind of offense kept them in their games against the Badgers and Marauders, despite both opponents being two of the top teams in the country.
In Friday’s game, both teams were hot from the start, exchanging successful plays and ending off the first quarter with a 18-17 lead for the Lions. In the second quarter the Badgers came fighting back and took a 43-38 lead, despite the Lions’ three-pointers raining down at their end of the court. The second half was similar, with the Badgers taking a dominant lead and the Lions fighting to keep up. In the end, the Badgers took away a 86-71 victory.
On Saturday, the Lions once again had a strong first quarter, narrowly leading before the Marauders pulled ahead in the second quarter to lead by 49-39 at the half. The Lions’ hopes of recovering the deficit were dashed in the third quarter, in which the Lions outscored the Marauders 22 points to 14 but were unable to catch up with their opponents. The final score of the game, largely due to the Marauders’ efficient three-point shooting, was 88-74.
“I feel like those were both games in which we had multiple chances to take control down the stretch and we let them get away,” says new Lions’ point guard Shane Reader, adding that it was good learning experience for the team. “I think our biggest challenge is our complacency. We know we’re as good as any team in the country but we don’t always play our game for a full 40 minutes.”
Reader led the Lions’ effort in both games, recording 16 points, four rebounds, four assists, and three steals on Friday, and adding another nine points and four assists on Saturday. He is currently ranked second in the OUA in assists per game.
Despite tough losses at home, Reader remains optimistic about the rest of the season. “I’m very excited for the rest of the season, as are the rest of my teammates,” he says. “The season has had its share of ups and downs so far but I’m confident that we’ll be able to get things rolling and hit our stride when it matters most in February and March.”

The Lions women’s basketball team fell in their season home opener to some of Canada’s top teams this past weekend. The Brock Badgers defeated their host team by a score of 68-52 on Friday, and the McMaster Marauders proved too much for the Lions the following night, taking them down by a score of 86-45.
“It’s been a challenging season for us thus far as we are still trying to claim our first win,” says guard Ishanaa Seupersadsingh, who is one of the Lions’ top performers. “In saying that, I’m very proud of my team’s effort as we do compete with top teams, and we’ve been in a few very close nail-biter games where we just couldn’t come out on top.”
In Friday’s game, the Badgers dominated at the Lions’ end of the court right off the bat, ending the first quarter with a 22-9 lead. The Lions fought back in the second quarter, outscoring their opponents 16-11 in a team effort that narrowed the Badgers’ lead to 33-25 at halftime. The Badgers, who are ranked the seventh best team in Canada, came out even stronger in the second half of the game, outscoring the Lions in both the third and fourth quarters to take away a 68-52 victory.
The Lions’ Seupersadsingh and Nina Guzina put up a strong effort to lead their team in the tough contest, together scoring 31 of 52 points. Seupersadsingh also contributed two rebounds and two assists to the game, and Guzina scored an efficient 5-of-9 off the floor.
Saturday’s game against the Marauders, who are fourth in the national rankings, turned out to be even more lopsided. The Marauders took a dominant 32-2 lead in the first quarter, and though the Lions fought hard to cut it down during the rest of the game, they failed to do so. Seupersadsingh once again led the effort, putting up a team high 11 points, four rebounds, and four steals. However, the Marauders took the victory with a score of 86-45, leaving the Lions with a 0-4 record so far in the regular season.
Nevertheless, the Lions are looking forward to improving their games and competing, if not always winning, in the rest of the season. However, to do that they will have to overcome the challenges of being a young and inexperienced team guided by a new head coach, as well as developing their offensive ability.
“The biggest challenge we face right now is staying consistent throughout the whole game,” says Seupersadsingh. “Defensively we’re pretty solid, it’s just offence that we need to work on in terms of making it flow more and converting shots.” Guzina feels the same way, adding that improvement in offensive play will be “all about the little things, and taking it one step at a time.”
Come what may, the team appreciates the undying support of the York community. “Every home game the stands are filled with fans cheering us on,” says Seupersadsingh, “it really helps motivate me and pump me up.”
“One of the best things about being a Lion is knowing you have that moral support from your Lion family and we couldn’t be more thankful when they come out,” emphasizes Guzina.
Moving forward, the players are looking to their next two games as an opportunity to end off the first part of their season on strong footing. “I’m very excited to get a win, as these are two teams that we are very capable of beating,” says Seupersadsingh, referring to the upcoming games against the Waterloo Warriors and Laurier Golden Hawks.
Come 2016, the Lions are eyeing the Ontario University Athletics post-season. “There are one or two pieces that have to come together and once that happens I’m very hopeful that we’ll be competing in the playoffs,” says Seupersadsingh.
“I am very optimistic for the rest of the season,” adds Guzina. “There’s still a lot of basketball to be played and I think that people will be surprised to see what we’re capable of!”

The Lions hockey teams were on fire on the ice this past weekend as they won three of their four games, including two shut-out victories and two upsets for their competitors. The men’s team fell to the Waterloo Warriors on Friday by a score of 4-1 but came back the following evening to upset the McGill Redmen, the top-ranked team in Canada, by a score of 3-2.
Meanwhile, the women’s team earned a 4-0 shutout against the Ryerson Rams on Saturday and followed it up with a 1-0 shutout victory over the UofT Varsity Blues, who are ranked the second best team in the country.
The men’s team stepped out onto the ice with determination in Friday’s game, launching the puck towards the Warriors’ net twice in the first two minutes of the frame only to have it hit the crossbar each time. The Warriors dominated the first two periods of the game, with their goalkeeper Mike Morrison turning away all 23 of the Lions’ shots coming towards the net.
Going into the third, the Warriors had a 3-0 lead, but the Lions finally got on the scoreboard when Trevor Peterson took advantage of his team’s 5-on-3 advantage due to penalties and got the puck past Morrison. The Warriors returned the favour, and the game ended at a score of 4-1 in their favour.
Saturday’s game was even more challenging, as the Lions had to face off with Canada’s top team at home. The Lions themselves are ranked 10th, but smarting from the previous day’s loss, scored two goals in the first period in a span of less than two minutes, giving their team a 2-0 lead. The Redmen fought back, pressuring the Lions’ defense, but in the second period they were only able to get the puck into the net once before the Lions followed it up with their third goal, bringing the score up to 3-1. The Redmen then rallied to score once again, leaving the Lions to defend a one-point lead.
Neither team scored in the third period, though the Redmen pushed relentlessly to even up the score and the Lions valiantly defended their end of the rink to keep them from doing so. In the end, the Redmen ran out of time and the Lions achieved a hard-fought 3-2 victory, ending the Redmen’s nine-game winning streak. This was the Lions’ fifth win at home this season and it updated their record to 8-2-3, making them the top team in the Ontario University Athletics West standings.
The women’s team, meanwhile, was even more dominant over the weekend, defeating both of their local competitors in Toronto and not allowing them any goals at all. On Saturday, the Lions brought down the Rams with two goals in the first period and one each in the second and third. It was a spectacular team effort, as nine players worked together to secure a 4-0 victory. Goalkeeper Megan Lee blocked all 25 shots taken at her to keep the Rams scoreless, and perhaps give a preview of her amazing performance the following day.
Sunday’s game was a tight one, as the women’s team battled with the Varsity Blues through all three periods as well as in double overtime, but the score remained deadlocked at 0-0. The game was finally decided by a shootout, during which Lee successfully made the last of her 41 saves in the game, and the Lions’ Dana Somerville and Kristen Barbara both found the back of the Varsity Blues’ net to give their team a 1-0 victory.

Inspired by true events, Nirbhaya, a play written and directed by Yael Farber, is playing at the Nightwood Theatre in the Distillery District. The award-winning play was sparked by the events of December 16, 2012 in South Delhi, India. A group of six men brutally raped a woman and assaulted her male companion when the two boarded a bus on their way home from the movies. Jyoti Singh, whose name was prohibited from being released by the press at the time of the rape, became known as “Nirbhaya,” the Hindi word for fearless one. Singh later died of the severe injuries sustained from the rape and beatings. Media outlets all over the world covered the assault, inspiring thousands of people across India to break the taboo of silence and discuss the reality of sexual assault, violence, and abuse in India.
Nirbhaya uses the rape of Nirbhaya as the framework for the play, focusing on the experienced sexual violence of five women. As these women take turns sharing their lived stories, Nirbhaya is always present in her white gown, singing and haunting the actors and audience. The five other characters speak of marital abuse, molestation, and violence with the rawness of lived knowledge so that no one in the audience is left untouched or comfortable.
Nirbhaya’s richness and power as a play resides specifically in its unplay-like nature. Yes, Nirbhaya has many formal qualities of a play, a theatre setting, stage, lighting, props, and costumes, yet it rejects the notion of actors performing. These women have performed silence and submissiveness their whole lives, unable to speak of the violence done to and around them. However, when on stage, these women speak without apology or restraint for what they have gone through. As theatre-goers sit in rows, compelled by these horrific and moving stories, they empathize simultaneously with the real experiences.
Nirbhaya documents the specific horrors of violence that many Indian women have gone, and continue to go, through, yet also speaks to the condition of all victims and survivors. These people who have suffered violence, injustice, or indecency have been wounded, but that wound is what lets the light in. The bandage of silence is insufficient and the bondage to social taboos is suffocating. The women have chosen not to be scared by the darkness around them. They are not scabbed in silence, choosing to shine the spotlight on social injustices, allowing for change to occur.
Nirbhaya welcomes other people affected by violence to not mark themselves by the actions of others. Though it may hurt, survivors must peel back their scabs and deal with what lies beneath. Wounds come in all shapes, sizes, colours, and degrees of pain. They’re not discriminatory in that sense. No one can choose how they are wounded, but everyone can choose to allow wounds to fester in hatred, silence, and darkness, or heal in knowledge, sharing, and lightness. 
I want to tell you,
I want to tell you
But I don’t know how.
Please if I tell you,
Promise me
You won’t leave me now.
It’s a simple phrase to say
Don’t let me lead you astray.
But it won’t make you
See as I see
Hear as I hear
My words will fall like the lame
Don’t tell me something different
We cannot feel the same.
It’s not your fault,
There’s nothing broken.
I don’t know what to say
Because I’m searching for a way
To make you see as I see
Hear as I hear
Fix you so you’ll walk
This lonely path with me.
But there’s nothing to fix,
There’s nothing broken.
So I sit with shut lips,
And I grasp for words far above me.
I want to tell you.
I would tell you,
If I only knew how.
This poem takes its first line from the Beatles’ song “I Want to Tell You” which is about an inability to communicate. This poem continues the theme with a narrator who is impotent in the presence of the subject. It is purposefully written in a vague manner to ease empathy with the narrator’s solitude, but also provide space for open interpretation. The narrator is lonely because of his/her inability to connect with a person of another sexual orientation, superficially on a romantic level, but also on a deeper, empathetic level. This is not stated however, to avoid advocating the stereotype that LGBTQ+ people’s problems solely arise from their sexual identity.

In Canada, only one in five people struggling with mental health receive the help they require. Of these five people, it is statistically less likely that a man will report abuse or seek help during a period of distress.
On November 18th, Jack.org at York, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization that aims to eradicate the stigma surrounding mental health, invited performer Elliot Maxwell and director Ray Jacildo to perform their multi-perspective show about male sexual abuse. The play, Water Choke, was followed by a discussion among Maxwell, Jacildo, and the audience.
As mental health week took over York on November 16, it seemed like a logical time for second-year sociology student Maya Ameyaw to organize the interactive event for her club.
“Stigma is one of the main things we try to tackle. We hope that people leave questioning the traditional views surrounding male identity, and the very real struggle of men who have endured abuse,” says Jacildo.
Oscillating between four different stories of men struggling with sexual abuse, the performance allowed viewers to identify with a multitude of personalities and struggles. The one-man show emphasizes the stigmas surrounding male abuse that prevent the victims from seeking help, particularly the stigma that men are sexual beings and should enjoy sexual interactions, consensual or not.
In conjunction with stigmas surrounding abuse, the show features themes of suicide, trauma, struggling with identifying as a traditional male, and feeling alone as an abuse victim. With some viewers crying and others holding someone next to them, it was clear that Water Choke was not only an artistic piece, but an influential work of growth and finding help.
“When you see someone who has successfully battled their problems, you realize that things can be different and that there most certainly is hope in overcoming your obstacles,” says first-year undeclared science student Nancy Truong shortly following the performance.
If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health concerns, York provides resources, including Personal Counselling Services. Mental health is not separate from health, and as a community, we can remove the stigmas and ensure people get the help they need.

Lions swimmer Haseeb Tariq won a bronze medal for Pakistan in the 100-metre backstroke at the 2016 South Asian Games on February 10th, setting national records on his way to the podium.
Tariq swam the men’s backstroke in 1:02.93 to qualify for the finals. In the finals, he improved on his timing and finished at 1:01.04, but that was not enough to beat P.S. Madhu and Sethu Manickavel, both representing India, who won the gold and silver medals respectively. Tariq also competed in the 50-metre freestyle, the 200-metre freestyle, and the 4×100-metre freestyle relay. In the first of these, Tariq set a national record for Pakistan with a time of 2:01.84. He set another record for Pakistan by swimming his leg of the relay in 54.30 seconds.
“I’m really happy and proud of all my achievements at the SAG 2016,” says Tariq. “To scoop up a medal among some really fast competitors makes me extremely satisfied with all the hard work I had put in prior to the Games.”
Tariq shares the credit with his training at York, where the finance student has been swimming for three years. “Training at York is the sole reason for all my achievements,” he says. “Coming back from the trials just a month before the actual Games, I did not really think I had more room to improve in such a limited amount of time, but it did end up helping me a lot.”
The South Asian Games, which are held every other year, feature athletes from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka competing in a variety of sports. The 12th South Asiam Games were held in Guwahati and Shillong, India.
“This was my second opportunity to represent Pakistan,” says Tariq. “It’s always a proud moment to hear your name with the name of your country. However, there was a greater responsibility for me to do well as we were competing against our neighbour countries and had a reputation at stake.”
There is often more than just a reputation at stake in any relations between South Asian nations. Tensions between Pakistan and India in particular have been rising in recent months, but Tariq believes that events such as the Games are a way to dissipate those tensions to some extent.
“Such events improve relations,” he says. “Going into the Games, I thought the Indian public would be hostile toward us Pakistanis, but I was stumped by their welcoming nature. Such events are really important to erase misconceptions about other countries.”
Tariq believes that the Lions competitive club for swimming should be turned into a full-scale varsity program, but he encourages members of the York community to try swimming. The pool is “a great place to make some good friends,” he says.
“Swimming definitely makes me focus more on school and of course, physically, it’s the best sport to play in my opinion as it engages all of your muscles, keeping you fit and active.”
Tariq quickly returned from South Asia, bronze medal in hand, to represent his university in the Ontario University Athletics championships in London. There, he made it to the final round of the men’s backstroke, in which he came in at 13th place, and in the 50-metre he broke his own York record to set a new record of 26.63 seconds.
In the future, he hopes to compete in the upcoming 2016 FINA World Swimming Championships in Windsor, and in the 2020 Summer Olympics.
Tariq has made Pakistani students at York proud. “We are extremely happy to see our member Haseeb Tariq accomplish such a milestone and set a record for others,” says Muhammad Nisar, president of York’s Pakistani Students Association. “We encourage him to work harder and accomplish all the goals that he wishes to succeed while representing himself as a proud Pakistani.”

At my first month at the Alliance for South Asian Aids Prevention, it was hard to orient myself and process what was happening around me. I saw a South Asian man next to me eat Indian food with his hands, a man that looked a lot like the ones my family would invite over for dinners, except for the fact he was queer, just like me. 

That image stirred an emotional reaction in the bottom of my stomach. I had two images before my eyes that I could not reconcile: queerness and my own culture.

Last time I remembered being at a South Asian gathering, I was carefully dodging aunts in the hallway who bombarded me with numerous questions regarding marriage, short hair, and lack of saris in my wardrobe.

This time though at ASAAP those aunts instead asked me about my preferred pronoun and talked freely about queer issues. Never would a young South Asian queer transboy imagine such a place existed.

These days, I run a queer program at ASAAP called Lassi, yes, just like the South Asian drink, except that it is a support space for young queer South Asian men who like men from ages 16-29.

During biweekly Lassi sessions, young queer South Asian men gather together to socialize over games, music, and food. These men can be desi and queer at the same time.

There is, however, some controversy on why spaces like Lassi, exclusive to only queer-identified South Asian men, still exist.

When so many open queer support groups are sprouting up in the vast city of Toronto, why have one only for queer South Asian men?

When a South Asian individual comes out as queer, they find themselves not in conflict not only with their family, but also with their culture and identity.

Every tradition and every cultural practice they were taught are all challenged by a simple announcement of one’s queerness.

It is hard to reconcile those aspects of oneself when one is taught to believe that queerness does not exist outside of the Western culture.

ASAAP was created when a South Asian couple passed away from AIDS-related illnesses and were not able to get resources and treatment due to linguistic barriers and stigma within South Asian communities regarding HIV/AIDS.

Similarly, these South Asian youth feel deep isolation and shame regarding their sexuality and identity.

With culturally specific groups, these men can freely share their love for South Asian culture, songs, dances, literature, and food once again, as well as find resources and support with a reduced cultural or language barrier.

Youth can also seek confidential one-on-one peer support where they can freely ask questions regarding sexuality, sexual health testing, or just personal concerns. They will be respected for their identity and not be turned away due to their sexuality or gender identity, which is a great concern for many South Asian queer youth.

Lassi also strives to provide free TTC tokens to groups in regions such as Scarborough to help attendees come to the space, regardless where they live in Toronto.

There is definitely a need for cultural-based programs such as Lassi to reduce this isolation and stigma, to help young racialized youth embrace their cultural traditions, find pride, and have a familiar support space to the one they thought that they have lost and one that looks and feels a lot like their home.

Three members of the Lions wrestling team headed out of the province once again this past weekend to compete in the 2016 Canadian Senior Wrestling Championships in New Brunswick. The team hustled through a very successful tournament, with Maddy Delle-Donne picking up a bronze medal and Gurnek Tak and Alexandria Town both bringing home gold.
Town headed to the tournament fresh from her bronze-medal victories in the 55-kilogram division at both the Ontario University Athletics and Canadian Interuniversity Sport championships. Carrying over the momentum, she easily won all of her matches in the first round.
“I had three matches that day,” says Town. “The first I won by pinfall with a score of 12-0, the second was 13-2, and the last was 10-0.”
She had her gold medal match against Laurence Beauregard of Montreal, which turned out to be an almost instant win for Town. “She wasn’t able to score a single point on me,” Town says. “I finished all of my attacks and countered every one of hers.”
Lions’ rookie Tak also had a successful weekend participating in the Junior Men’s Greco Roman Canadian Championships where he won a gold medal.
“It was my first national competition for wrestling,” says Tak. “The biggest challenge was that I had to go up a weight class and I got completely destroyed in freestyle wrestling. But I came back and won the Greco Roman wrestling championship.”
His final match in the men’s 60-kilogram category was against the Western Mustangs’ Eric Renaud, whom he dominated with a score of 2-0. But Tak is not gloating. “I learned that no matter how good you are, you can only get better,” he says. “There’s no limit to what you can achieve.”
Meanwhile, Delle-Donne worked her way up to a bronze medal in the women’s 82-kilogram category, which adds to her achievements after her gold medal at the Ontario Junior Championships earlier this year.
This marks the end of the season for the Lions wrestling team, which finished off with multiple victories. However, the hustle is far from over for most of the team members.
“I have a new sense of confidence in my abilities and an even stronger sense of confidence in our program,” says Town. “We sent three wrestlers out to New Brunswick and returned with three medals. And to top it all off, most of us are within our first few years of eligibility. It’s all very exciting for the team.”

To share and promote the values of Sikhi on campus, the Sikh Students Association organized Sikh Awareness Week, which took place from March 14 to 17. Students and professors from different ethnicities and religious backgrounds participated in the events throughout the week.
The week began with Bedtime Sakhis hosted by Tejnoor Kaur. The magical evening consisted of Kaur taking the students back to 1469 by recounting the sakhi (story) of the first guru of the sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev ji, while cookies and hot chocolate kept participants warm.
Next was the prayer night. Approximately 20 students gathered in the Student Centre to collectively recite Sri Rehraas Sahib, the evening Sikh prayer, followed by kirtan where everyone sang hymns accompanied by a harmonium and tabla.
The annual Dastaar Day, one of SSA’s most popular events, took place on March 16 in the East Bear Pit in Central Square. Over 200 students and staff had turbans tied and learned its significance in Sikhi. Sikhs wear turbans as a symbol of royalty, to take care of their unshorn hair, promote equality, and preserve the Sikh identity.
“We received a really nice response from students here at York University,” says Sukhman Singh, co-president of SSA. “It was very humbling and inspiring to see people wanting to learn about something new.” Various members of SSA helped make the event a success and ensured all participants had the opportunity to take part.
“I look forward to this event all year,” says Balpreet Gill, a first-year kinesiology student.
“Although I don’t wear a turban regularly, I make sure to get one tied as it makes me feel connected to my roots.”
The week concluded with The Amazing Race: York Edition, an event executed for the first time by SSA. A race with several checkpoints and short Sikhi-related challenges took place at different locations on campus such as the Student Centre, Bethune College, and the Health, Nursing and Environmental Studies building.
Teams of two people were in a race against the clock in search of the locations on the York map, which was turned into the map of Punjab. Each challenge was unique as the location that was associated with it represented a historical event, which had taken place in Sikhi.
Activities at stations included chapatti-making competitions to understand the concept of selfless service and langar in Sikhi. Langar is a community kitchen in every Gurdwara (Sikh place of worship) where visitors are served free food regardless of their background, religion, colour, or caste.
Everyone sits on the floor together to enjoy a free meal, which represents equality. There were eight stations in total and the pair with the fastest time was rewarded a tablet each.
“We were really happy with the turnout of the event especially that so many non-Sikhs participated,” says Simreet Kaur, executive member of SSA and key organizer.
If this sounds like a good time, look out for the celebration of Holla Mohalla, a Sikh festival held at the Scott Religious Centre on March 31 at 5:30 p.m.

What’s in a story? Stories have a way of connecting us, despite racial, cultural, or national differences. The art of storytelling is universal.
Apparently, Dan Yashinsky and Erin Rodgers think so too. For the past few years, Yashinsky, director, and Rodgers, producer, have worked to bring the Storytelling Festival to the city, which truly lives up to its name. The festival, which will be hosted at various locations across the city from April 1 to 10, gives storytellers centre stage to share their tales.
Storytelling styles vary from place to place, giving the festival a unique element as it brings the globe to one stage with diverse storytellers.
“In African and West Indian cultures, storytelling can be very animated and participatory. In First Nations traditions, the storyteller can be quiet and intimate. The one thing every storytelling style shares is that the teller has to make the listener want to know what happens next,” says Yashinsky.
This year’s festival will be bringing a lot more to the table than previous years. Alongside Harbourfront Centre and TD, the festival will be offering two days of family storytelling. There will also be collaborations with Aga Khan Museum and Ismaili Centre Toronto.
One thing that this festival does is bring the art of storytelling to life in a way that everyone can enjoy.
There is an opportunity for everyone to get involved. Before the festival kicks off, the Storytellers’ Camp from April 6 to 8 will host workshops, performances, and story talks for participants. Festival goers can get face-to-face with some of the storytellers and learn about their art in an intimate setting.
“I am especially excited for the life-changing afternoons with Ron Evans and the Telling Life Stories workshop with the brilliant and multi-award winning author and performer Ivan Coyote,” says Rodgers.
“I was also thrilled to watch attendees who had never told stories before discover their love of this art form. I’ve seen several of them onstage since and it’s been wonderful to see them captivate an audience.”
This year, stories will be closer to home. Storytellers Coyote and TUUP (Godfrey Duncan), will be coming to Seneca College on April 6 at 12:00 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., as part of a co-production with Seneca College’s School of of Arts and Science.
Coyote shares life stories, has won awards for their writing and performances, and has travelled across the globe on tour. Coyote’s most recent work was a collaboration with musician Rae Spoon titled Gender Failure.
TUUP (The Unorthodox, Unprecedented Preacher) brings stories from his Guyanese and African roots and has performed all over Europe, North America, and Africa. Along with his stories, he incorporates music and dance into his art.

Featured image: Climate change experts agree that progress was made at the conference, but there is much more work to be done.
York philosophy professor Idil Boran led an official panel at the Bonn Climate Change Conference earlier this month as a call to action for building trust and inclusiveness in non-party stakeholder engagement in global climate action.
The panel, “Marrakech Partnership: Building Trust and Inclusiveness in Non-Party Stakeholder Engagement,” was held on Saturday, May 13th in Bonn, Germany as an official side event of the UN climate change conference.
Boran organized the event in partnership with Colorado State University, collaborating with York science professor Dawn Bazely.
“[Boran] frames climate change in an ethical context, wherein human values, governance, and political processes provide the larger picture beyond scientific research,” says Bazely.
She stresses that the warnings of 1990’s climate change research are indeed already coming to pass, with ice sheets melting in Antarctica and the Arctic.
“The world’s most vulnerable are already being affected, and they will be impacted far worse than the wealthy,” she says.
“Climate change is, in truth, an ethical issue. This panel centers its solutions on this.”
The Bonn panel brought together several researchers and regional government representatives from Canada, the U.S., India, and Germany, where they all discussed the role of multi-stakeholder dialogues under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Action.
Kenneth Shockley, an associate professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, shares his own approach to his portion of the panel. “I am interested in the different ways that we understand ‘working together,’ and I wanted to impress upon the audience the importance [doing so] in a way that fosters trust among all parties,” he states.
“This collaborative approach gives a productive way of listening to other parties, working in a manner that is focused on the problem at hand, and not any individual parties’ preconceived— and therefore biased—notion of how we might solve that problem.”
Sander Chan, adjunct assistant professor at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development at Utrecht University and researcher with the German Development Institute, focused on similar themes.
“I was invited to speak on a conference I organized called ‘Interconnections,’ which discussed how the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement are connected,” he says.
“Discussions focused on the role of state, non-state, and subnational actors, who could help deliver on both agendas.”
Although the sustainable development and climate change processes are politically separate, they contribute to the same reality.
“There is much interest in connecting climate action to sustainable developmental goals,” said Boran.
The panel participants were pleased with the headway of the Bonn panel, but all agree that more action and research is still necessary.
“Idil and I, and our colleagues involved in this work, plan to move onward with a collective, broad, and interdisciplinary research that will take us into uncomfortable places, as the solutions to climate change require difficult decisions to be made,” says Bazely.
Shockley insists further research should be pursued to look for points of synergy between the different non-state actors (states and provinces, financial actors, and NGOs) to make sense of the new international policy landscape.
Chan, meanwhile, offers a starker truth.
“We have only 45 years before our carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius warming will be used up,” he comments. “Before [we] have a research project funded, conducted, and that can present final results, it’s probable that we [will have] already passed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.”
“Building interfaces between decision makers and researchers is, in my view, more urgent, to bring knowledge and solutions into the decision-making space,” he adds.
Starting her sabbatical research in July, Boran will spend three months at the German Development Institute, then two more as a researcher in residence at the Centre for Excellence at Goethe University in Frankfurt/ Main to continue work on her study manuscript.
She aims to develop a political theory of climate action on a global public sphere.
 


the biggest contributor to human caused climate change is animal agriculture. The biggest change you can make in your life to help this issue is to become a vegan or at least avoid animal products in your life. which is very easy. 
why this issue s not brought up by these experts is surprising. we can see in some countries already 5% or more of the population are vegan. hopefully they will continue to help others make the change and other forms of human caused climate change will be reduced or eliminated soon. 
The rise of materialism and consumerism is not helping either. Check out  Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret or earthlings. these films are a real eye opener.

It’s time to pack up the winter coats and boots and break out the beachwear now that summer is here and we’re finally starting to thaw.
During the summer, as temperatures rise and the days become longer, our skin becomes more susceptible to damage from the sun’s harmful UV rays.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS): “In Canada, sunlight is strong enough to cause skin cancer, premature aging of the skin, and harm to the eyes.” The reason that Canadians are more vulnerable to this is because we are exposed to the sun for longer periods of time, and due to the sun’s angle, its rays are better distributed in Canada, in comparison to other northern countries like Russia or the United States.
CCS adds that “skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, and it’s also one of the most preventable. UV radiation causes about 90 per cent of melanoma cases.” Additionally, cases of melanoma have increased significantly over the past 25 years, according to CCS.
The reasoning for this is because the sun transmits three types of deadly rays, which are, in large part, reflected back into space due to the ozone layer. The three types of UV rays are: Ultraviolet A (UVA), which “make up most of the sun’s natural light. They can penetrate deep into the skin, causing wrinkles and premature aging of the skin;” Ultraviolet B (UVB), which “are the main cause of sunburn. They are nearly 1,000 times stronger than UVA rays;” and Ultraviolet C rays, which are “short-wave radiation that never reaches the earth’s surface, because the atmosphere filters them out.”
The ozone layer is deteriorating due to pollution and accumulation of CO2 emissions—thus, causing more harmful UV rays to penetrate the earth’s atmosphere and increase its harm to all living organisms.
In the case of skin protection from the sun, water-resistant sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or above are recommended, as they have a broad spectrum of protection against both UVA and UVB rays. However, it’s important to thoroughly read the warning label on all products, as some medicines and skin care products may also increase the skin’s vulnerability to UV damage.
The potential for sun damage is at its worst from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., so it’s best to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun’s rays during these times, or cover up exposed skin.
It’s also important to check for skin abnormalities, which will help when it comes to detecting early signs of skin cancer, which increases your chances for survival. After all, it is better to be safe than sorry.

Some artists make art solely based on the stillness of an object or a view, while others are inspired by their fascination with movement. Artist Derek Liddington seems to be the latter. He created a solo exhibition around the performance of two photographic stills from the Ballet Russes’ productions of Ode and Apollon Musagète in 1928.
It is being staged back-to-back at the Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) in the Accolade East Building and the Southern Alberta Art Gallery. The exhibition at the AGYU is called the body will always bend before it breaks, the tower will always break before it bends.
Liddington’s new exhibition is a powerful and humanistic statement that utilizes 3-D clay caricatures and works imprinted or painted in fabrics and on walls. He also produced a video in which dancers perform in each other’s company, which is the product of a co-commission video shot by Toronto filmmaker Chris Boni. The short video was done during a time spent with students from York’s dance department in the summer of 2016. The dancing style used in the short is presented in a slow, graceful, and even an athletic manner, seeming to show the audience that the movement in dance is the embodiment of the intricacy of human movements, and the tensions of the human anatomy.
Not only that, it also presents the fluidity of our operativeness, despite our anatomy being constituted with rigid bones and firm muscles. Overall, Liddington shows the strength of the human form in an abstract manner.
The artist also makes sure that each exhibition uses the “performance still” (or production shot) as a dramaturgical framework for the development of its score and mise-en-scène. He attempts to capture the essence and authenticity of the Ode and Apollon Musagète, and not just to make art that looks aesthetically pleasing.
He makes sure that each gallery is a sample of Gesamtkunstwerk, wherein each component is operating at the intersection of dance, theatre and the visual arts. Liddington wants his audience to feel as though they have been to the theatre, an art gallery or dance performance, all in one visit.
According to Emelie Chhangur, the curator of the exhibition at the AGYU: “Liddington animates the space in-between performance and image as a point of departure for his ongoing investigation into the relations between narrative (meaning) and abstraction (aesthetics).”
He intends to cultivate a story out of his artwork. Audiences can interpret the drawings on walls and on free flowing curtains as symbols of the unlimited flow of the human body. We are free to move in any way we want, and yet, the marble sculptures represent load bearing joints of the human figure, and the clay sculptures portray our limitations in terms of movement.
With the exhibition, the audience doesn’t always get clearcut representations. It instead shows two sides of a story, which goes back to Liddington’s mission to intersect both meaning and aesthetics. He wants to create a world that displays both the significance of the body’s movement and our environment— in both positive and negative ways.
The main theme of this exhibition remains intact, being that the body will always bend before it breaks, the tower will always break before it bends.

I remember when I moved into residence my first year. I was bombarded with introductions and overwhelmed by my multiple roommates and dozens of people flooding the halls.
I remember feeling lost and what it felt like to know no one. I remember how I timidly wandered around during orientation week, constantly encouraged to participate, and I remember repeatedly saying my major and shyly chiming in on conversations.
Now, three years later, those roommates are my best friends. I have been one of those overenthusiastic orientation leaders, and I am constantly talking about my major and how attending York has been one of the best decisions I have ever made.
York’s reputation borders on controversial and maligned. York is often portrayed in a negative light by the media, fueled by confirmation biases and powered by many perpetuating misconceptions.
The media is often biased against York, streaming headlines of assaults and crimes, constantly inferring that if it happens around York, it must reflect the university. York is persecuted and ridiculed for their location, however, for a university, York University Heights is ranked 19th out of 140 Toronto neighbourhoods for sexual assaults, a much lower rating than both U of T area (second) and Ryerson (11th). Yet it is “York University” that is often linked with “violence” and “assault.”
Security bulletins are sent out when incidents happen in and around York from things such as suspicious activity to actual incidents. These updates are sent out briefly after the incidents are reported and are intended to keep faculty and students informed and safe.
York is Canada’s third-largest university, with an incredibly diverse population and program selection. York has one of the leading internationally recognized educational institutions for the faculty of business studies, as well as a unique space engineering program.
There are constant improvements being made around York to accommodate and enhance our experiences, yet we still have retorts, declaring that this progress is taking too long and there is too much construction.
The people are part of what makes York so great. They come from all over the city, not to mention the world, with different perspectives that really do open your mind. I met my support system here. Those people I warily talked to during my first few weeks here, the ones I awkwardly met by chance, and the people I continue to meet, are part of the reasons why I care so much about York.
York’s reputation depends entirely on who you ask and the experiences they’ve had. Everyone always says some reiterated version of, “it’s what you make of it,” however, somewhere along the way I feel like we’ve forgotten that.
There is this romanticized idea that someone else’s school is better than yours (the grass is always greener on the other side, to use a cliché). We’ve started blaming everything on our school, discrediting it and putting it down.
But it’s your experiences; it’s the people you meet, how you approach situations and the opportunities you allow yourself to have, York is just the place that it happens. It’s your time—to take responsibility.
Get involved. It’s not just something to say, it’s actual advice because there are more opportunities and resources than you may realize. Utilize your time here and respect the education you are receiving and the institution you are attending.
Your degree is a piece of paper; your education is what you make of it. York was the fresh perspective that I needed and the choice I’m glad I made.

This spring, Toronto sports fans had the chance to experience something that hasn’t happened since 2002: the Maple Leafs and Raptors making the playoffs in the same season.
Although the two Air Canada Centre tenants have each had their brief stretches of success over the past 15 years, Toronto sports fans have been deprived of enjoying them at the same in April. Furthermore, in six of these 15 years, Torontonians have not had the opportunity to cheer for either team come playoff time.
This April finally brought an end to this trend, as both the Maple Leafs and the Raptors successfully made it to the playoffs in their respective leagues. The city saw a playoff fever that thousands of youth and young adults had not experienced in their lifetime.
This fever was especially present on York campus, where hundreds of students showed their support by watching the games, posting on social media, and wearing Leafs- and Raptors-related gear.
“The playoff fever in Toronto has a huge impact on York’s campus since people are more willing to go to campus bars to watch the games,” says third-year theatre student Maddy Fisher. “I’ve gone to Shopsy’s more in the past month or so just to watch sports with friends than I have all year!”
York students jumped on a ‘hype train’ by sharing pictures at sports bars on Instagram, sending videos of the mayhem at Jurassic Park/ Maple Leafs Square on Snapchat, tweeting their brief thoughts about games, and giving their detailed opinions about games via Reddit.
But among everything else, the feeling that was most prevalent through the April playoff run was national pride.
“When Toronto makes it to the playoffs, people become extremely patriotic to not only the sports team, but also Canada,” adds Fisher. “I see an increase in various swag items that reflect both the sport and Canada as a whole. It’s definitely a sense of pride for most people.”
Looking at York Lions teams, one cannot help but wonder about the effect that a similar sense of support would have on the performance of our teams. The inspiration that a passionate York crowd can give has been known to work wonders in the past.
“There is a huge difference between a normal regular season game and a playoff game,” says Fisher. “The crowd is always more vocal and is willing to go as far as they can to ensure a win for York. Some fight the other team, some fight the referees, and others pray.”
Unfortunately, not every team benefits from a rowdy York crowd voicing support for their team, especially the Lions’ teams that fall outside the popular soccer and football sphere. When asked about his experience supporting the York men’s basketball team, second-year environmental studies major Abdeali Saherwala remarked on a vastly different experience when compared to Fisher’s hockey experience. Saherwala was disappointed with the atmosphere at the game, and felt the cause was directly related to a lack of attendance.
“I believe that hype and crowd support can really boost morale for players, who are trying their absolute best to win. But without the support from the York community, it is difficult to draw emotional strength and resilience,” he adds.
So this year, why not take the time to support your Lions? Whether it is a men’s soccer championship game or a regular season basketball game, any support will be needed in the upcoming 2017-2018 York Lions season. Your cheers will yield noticeable results on the field, pitch, court, or rink, so I hope to see you there this year! 
 


Awesome! Love Sherlock!

Featured image: Black Panther has garnered positive response from viewers, receiving praise for its portrayals of the black community and Wakanda. | Rowan Campbell
Black Panther is the upcoming film everybody’s talking about; the movie that’s sold out in every theatre in Toronto thus far; the movie that’s prompting people to dress up in African garb to showcase their pride. That’s Black Panther, the movie that is so deeply important.
Black Panther is so important that it makes the liberation from Transatlantic slavery and the Civil Rights Movement look like a fairytale. Malcolm X, who? Martin Luther King, where? Barack Obama, when? The release of Marvel’s Black Panther is now the most critical moment in black history.
All jokes aside, everyone is pumped to see this film. This movie is expected to top the box office this weekend, making $165 to $170 million in its opening weekend, and the lines will be wrapped around the corner with Marvel fans itching to watch it.
I’m also expecting to see black people thrilled about watching a black superhero in a prosperous black country. A couple weeks ago, the hashtag #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe was trending on Twitter, and responses varied—from the portrayal of black people, to being represented on the big screen, to the portrayal of Wakanda. One user, @TerryTheWriter (NoDell Beckham), tweeted: “Finally, seeing BLACK people ruling their BLACK country on their BLACK continent, minding their BLACK business, thriving with their BLACK dollars, and BLACK resources. #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe.”
That tweet alone summarizes Black Panther in a nutshell. Black Panther is the epitome of black nationalism, which is the same form of nationalism Marcus Garvey advocated for in the 1920s, which he referred to as Garveyism. Black nationalism revolves around the notion that black people are a nation who must seek to develop and maintain a black identity. Black nationalists support political, social, and economic empowerment for the black community. In short: black nationalists are pro-black, in every sense of the word.
In comparison to black nationalism, Wakanda is a racially homogenous nation of independence, self-preservation, and self-determination. T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is on guard for his Wakandan people, and does anything to fiercely protect Wakanda at all costs. One instance of this is when he infiltrated the Avengers, assessing their potential threat level to Wakanda; or when Black Panther kept up the facade of Wakanda as being a third-world country, so that outsiders would stay away from their wealth.
When watching the trailer, the protective nature of Wakanda is very much recognized. Not too many that have visited have made it out alive, except for their arch-nemesis Ulysses (Andy Serkis), who is seeking the vibranium that makes the country so technologically advanced.
Wakanda is the nation Garvey would have dreamed of. As Beckham puts it, Wakanda is a nation that thrives on its own efforts, with no help from anybody.
Noticing the admiration on social media shows that black nationalism is not a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with putting your people first or defending your nation, like T’Challa does.
Those watching Black Panther will be embracing black nationalism, whether they know it or not—and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.

I’d tell you my name but you probably won’t remember. There are various reasons for that, but I’d rather avoid that conversation. I decided to write this to bring awareness to those of us who are still blind to the world we live in. I also wrote this for my friend Reuben. I haven’t heard from him in years but there are reasons for that. I hope that he’s lived a very good life and was able to enjoy his youth.
I.
My parents always told me that Reuben and I got along really well. So they weren’t surprised when Reuben and I were around each other all the time. Even as children if we ever did get into a disagreement, it was always over within a matter of minutes. I never saw it as anything. I just figured we were two young boys who wanted to play video games and eat junk food all day.
I wasn’t naïve, but I think I was in denial. It was the summer time; Reuben and I were excited about going off to middle school. We’d finally be able to walk and not have our parents drop us off in the mornings. Reuben and I walked to the convenience store. I remained outside. As I wiped my forehead on my T-shirt, a tall White man appeared in the distance. He was leaning against a dark blue Buick and had a toothpick in his mouth. I paid him no mind and continued standing under the shade.
I hear the bell ring over the door as Reuben barges out.
“Here, I got you one too.”
I look at Reuben and then the freezy in his hand.
“So now my shirt is gonna be dirty.”
Reuben laughs and replies: “I saw you wipe sweat on your shirt…who cares, just take the freezy!”
“HEY!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?”
I could already see that this man was going to be trouble. But poor Reuben, he didn’t understand.
Reuben shouts back: “WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?”
The tall White man yells: “DON’T YOU KNOW THEY CAUSE A LOT OF TROUBLE? YOU BETTER RUN ALONG BEFORE YOU FIND YOURSELF IN SHIT!”
Reuben looks at me and shrugs his shoulders. I jump onto my bike and begin leading the way.
The tall White man answers back: “A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU SHOULDN’T BE HANGING AROUND A BOY LIKE THAT!”
Here is where I saw the issues of our skin. I can say that being a Black person in this world leaves you with little-to-no-options on how to feel about race situations. Being too calm makes you look oblivious and/or in denial, while displays of anger only feed into what they expect. What options are we left with?
II.
Reuben and I were now in high school, and we didn’t miss any action. I did well in sports and was always asked to return, but my heart was in fixing things. Reuben, on the other hand, wasn’t the best in sports, but made teams because of his wealthy parents. It still worked out well for the both of us; I got the benefits of a funded team and Reuben got to experience first-class treatment. Everyone came out a winner, and we enjoyed it.
‘Joy Ride’
It was the summer Reuben and I graduated from high school. His parents bought him a green 1999 Mercedes-Benz-E-Class. I was even happier when he insisted he take me out for a drive. Like I said, Reuben and I were always close. Despite his family being wealthy, Reuben got the emotional attachment from my family. Both of our parents respected each other and we all enjoyed each other’s company.
Reuben and I were driving down Neffe’s avenue when I saw the sirens flashing in the rearview mirror. Reuben pulls over and asks me: “Did I do anything wrong?”
I shake my head.
The police officer exits the cruiser and walks over to Reuben’s door. Reuben rolls down his window and asks: “Hi officer, do you mind telling us why you’ve pulled us over? I was watching my speed limit and my tail lights work.”
The police officer doesn’t say a word but I can feel him looking at me. I continue looking straight ahead. “Let me see your driver’s licence.”
Reuben is oblivious to what is happening right in front of him. As he pulls out his wallet, the officer sticks his head in the window and asks: “Where were you two headed?”
Reuben answers, “Oh we’re just testing out my new car. My parents bought this for me.”
The police officer ignores Reuben and points his pen at me.“What’s your name, boy?”
I remember my parents’ voice in my head. They’ve already warned me about this, and even though it’s wrong, they said that I should always be respectful. Before I can open my mouth, the officer interrupts: “So do you have a car of your own?”
I shake my head and answer: “No sir, I do not have a car of my own.”
The officer removes his head from the window and walks over to my side of the car. Reuben looks confused and pulls out his cellphone. “If I’m the driver, then why are you questioning him, officer?”
The officer ignores him and taps on the glass for me to roll down the window.
“So you’re saying that you don’t own a car of your own…then how do I know that you aren’t going to steal your friend’s car? How do I even know this is your friend? Maybe there’s a gun in the car and you’re holding him hostage until I leave.”
Reuben begins to get annoyed and interjects.
“Officer, what you’re doing isn’t the law, and I will ensure my dad will have your badge.”
I ignore both of them and answer the accusations as calmly as I can.
“There is no gun in the car and he is my friend. He offered me the ride and I decided to take it.”
“You ever been arrested, boy?”
I reply: “No, I haven’t been arrested.”
The police officer answers back: “You must be one of the lucky ones.”
Reuben interrupts again: “Officer I just want to let you know that I’ve warned you, and I will now be calling our lawyer.”
The officer leans into the car again, but this time smiles at Reuben.“Now why are you gonna go and do that? I’m just talking to your friend here…we’re all adults now.”
Reuben ignores the officer. “You leave me no choice.”
The officer makes eye contact with me and doesn’t smile.
“So where do you live?”
“I live not too far from here, officer.”
“Do you have any kids?”
“No, I do not have any children.”
“Are you married?”
“No, I’m not married.”
The officer removes his head from the car and begins stretching. Reuben calls his dad’s office and tells his secretary where we’re located.
I overhear the officer say: “Your people don’t believe in marriage, but you people multiply at a rapid rate. It amazes me.”
The officer takes out his notepad and begins writing down the licence plate. He removes his sunglasses and looks at me.
“I’m going to run the info on the car. Don’t move.”
As the officer walks back to his cruiser, Reuben and I sit in silence. I can’t describe how I feel but I know it’s nothing good. I just continue to play my parents’ voice in my head because I know that if I say the wrong thing, this officer will definitely put me behind bars.
Twenty minutes later, Reuben’s dad arrives with his lawyer. Reuben’s dad approaches our car and the lawyer approaches the cruiser. Blake is a successful public relations representative and spoiled Reuben with gifts. He’s a lot older than Reuben’s mom, but you could tell that he really loved her. He was dressed in a tailored brown suit and had his grey hairs freshly trimmed each week.
“Are you guys okay?”
Reuben speaks for the both of us: “That cop is an asshole. He’s been interrogating us for almost thirty minutes.”
Blake scratches his beard and pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket. He motions Reuben to pass him a pen. “It’s assholes like this that make our country a living hell.”
The lawyer walks back over to us and hands us a card. “This isn’t over. Just wanted to let you guys know that if this ever happens again to contact me—”
The rest of the conversation becomes a blur to me. What does he mean by this isn’t over? What about if this happens again? The question is…will this random stop ever happen with Reuben in his car by himself or with his group of White friends? This was just a chapter in Reuben’s life, but this is and always will be my life. This wasn’t my choice, but I knew that Reuben would never be able to understand. A good lawyer isn’t the issue, it’s my skin.
Reuben’s dad drives behind us. When Reuben pulls into my driveway, I don’t have much to say.
He asks: “Tomorrow?”
I reply:“Bet.”
As I leave the car, I tell myself that this is the last time I’ll see Reuben. He and I don’t see colour, but the world we live in does. His skin is politically correct, while mine is urban and cool. We’re on the same side instead of playing against each other; to them we shouldn’t have anything in common. To them, this picture doesn’t make sense. Reuben will always be identified as a White man first, and I will always be his unanswered boy.

Society has painted black beauty as “ugly.” It has been imprinted into the minds of little black girls that wearing their natural, kinky curls is something to be ashamed of. We’ve hidden this shame under countless straightening until our hair starts to break off; we spend hundreds of dollars investing in long 18-inch Brazilian hair because we want to meet society’s demands. This is ruining young black girls’ psyche, because our “kinky curls” are considered “not pretty.”
I spoke with entrepreneur Jacintha Wallen-Charles, and I asked her if little girls are taught to be ashamed of their curls. “Not only society, but the black community itself. It’s small things that we don’t recognize, like ‘you should sleek back your edges,’ or ‘what are you going to do with that hair?’,” she says.
“Having baby hairs in its natural form is frowned upon by other black girls, because it is seen as ‘not doing your hair.’ Moreover, people of other races often look at our hair and ask: ‘What are you going to do with it?’ as if its natural state isn’t adequate enough to wear in public.”
I remember when I got my first weave—it was an Onyx, 18-inch, straight, 1B. When I strutted down the aisle, about to graduate, with my weave sewn into my head, I felt beautiful. I no longer felt uncertainty. It gave me an identity. They called me a weava-diva! I could get any colour, style, and length.
Weaves allow black women to feel beautiful; it allows us to hide from what we were given with. Ask a black woman if she’d rather wear her natural kinky curls or a Tokyo Stylez, custom made, 20-inch, Indian Remy hair, and see what she says.
The thing is, we have become so comfortable in the shell that we’ve grown up in, that it gets harder to break out of it.
I spoke with a fellow employee, Jaya Hance, a black woman who often wears her hair straight. I’ve never seen her hair in it’s natural, kinky state, so I asked her why. “When I was growing up, I was moved from a mixed-culture school to a pure white school, and they didn’t understand my different hair. Because of this they made me feel different, and always pointed it out. This little boy even told me my hair looked like poop,” she says.
Even if we come from different ethnicities, there should be a boundary where parents should teach their children right from wrong—and they don’t. Due to the bullying, Hance felt ashamed to wear her hair in natural braids, or out in an afro.
We have been criticized by the media, by society and even by our peers. But now the media, society and our peers want to take credit for African beauty and culture. Let me educate everyone. When Miley Cyrus started wearing what many called “Space Buns,” it got a lot of hype.
These Space Buns, however, are actually called Bantu knots, a hairstyle said to originate from Zulu tribes in southern Africa. When the Kardashians started donning what everyone called “Boxer Braids,” it became a hot new trend. Boxer braids are called Cornrows, and have been found in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara, dating as far back as 3,000 B.C., particularly in the Horn of Africa and West Africa.
These hairstyles are not new fashion trends that Miley Cyrus and the Kardashians came up with out of the blue. It shows the twisted way that, on a black girl, it’s seen as ugly—but on a famous white person’s head, it’s seen as trendy and new.
How are they going to look down on black beauty, then try to take credit for it? The problem is giving recognition to black women who’ve had these styles forever. Don’t rob us of that recognition. Don’t rob our culture from us.
Black women have started to become comfortable without the wigs, sewn-in weaves, and the constant straightening, because we’ve realized that we are beautiful; that we should not care about society’s opinions.
Wallen-Charles stated Viola Davis and Lupita Niyong’o, who are both Oscar-winning black actresses, show their natural hairstyles on the red carpet with confidence. We are seeing the beauty of the curls. We shouldn’t feel different nor ashamed, and instead, feel liberated and proud.

On January 27, the ROM opened a new exhibition titled Here We Are Here: Black Canadian Contemporary Art. The exhibition brings together nine Canadian contemporary artists to create an exhibition that best represents the deep-rooted histories and presence of black culture in Canada. Here We Are Here explores and challenges the struggles that blacks often face in Canadian culture.
Josh Basseches, the ROM’s Director and CEO, explained: “Here We Are Here: Black Canadian Contemporary Art is an important exhibition that grapples with current and historical interpretations of black culture and identity in this country.
The work represented in this exhibition not only encourages visitors to re-examine their idea of what Canada is, but offers a broader telling of the Canadian story through the black Canadian experience.”
The entire exhibition portrays a certain image that best represents the artists’ black-Canadian experience. Artist Sandra Brewster composed a piece reflecting her parents’ experience as newcomers to Canada. The York alumna’s “Hiking Black Creek” shows a “meditation on the emotional labour of belonging, of connecting with one another and one’s surroundings,” as the ROM explains.
Brewster’s work has been exhibited internationally, and conveys themes of identity and representation. Her work reflects how intersectionality works with immigrants, as well as those who are deemed the minority.
Michele Pearson Clarke’s video installations “Suck Teeth Compositions (After Rashaad Newsome)” is about the everyday oral gesture shared by black people and how the sucking of their teeth often has negative connotations. Clarke tries to break down this stigma and stereotype by normalizing the gesture with the video.
As for Charmaine Lurch’s “Being Belonging and Grace,” her focus comes down to expressing belonging and invisibility. Lurch is another York alumni whose large-scale gestures express emotion and ease; the conflict between trying to belong yet feeling invisible in the community—both in her own black community and the white community.
Meanwhile, Sylvia D. Hamilton, Bushra Junaid, Esmaa Mohamoud, Dawit L. Petros, Gordon Shadrach, and Chantal Gibson’s respective installations all convey a sense of reflecting the history of trade and slavery, stereotypes, and the feelings of being “displaced” and “disappeared’ in Canadian narratives.
While I explored the exhibition, I felt a sense of connection. As a Canadian immigrant, I know what it means to feel out of place; to feel awkward in transitioning into the Canadian standards while still upholding my own cultural beliefs. I have felt the wish to belong, yet still feel invisible in the eyes of my own people and the Canadian people.
Each of the artists’ works are relevant in today’s society and issues. Each create conversations that not many people are aware of. The ROM’s Here We Are Here explores the idea of being black in Canadian society, and helps evoke a powerful response from visitors to challenge the norms and the stigmas that are still prevalent today.

When you listen to Kanye West or Jay Z, or any rapper for that matter, listeners always hear a prominent theme in their respective songs: men should be the misogynistic materialists, while women are often sexualized into nothing but objects.
At the same time, in most hip-hop music videos, there’s always the rapper rapping their songs with 10 girls with big butts in the background dancing provocatively. Lil Wayne best described this theme in his song “Love Me” by rapping: “And all she eat is dick/ She’s on a strict diet/ That’s my baby.”
Don’t get me wrong, I love hip-hop. It’s my go-to genre because it always puts me in a good mood and hypes me up whenever I need it.
However, hip-hop is also very controversial. It conveys many demeaning themes and meanings that could easily affect people. Yet what gives hip-hop music so much more influence in mainstream media is its portrayal of black culture and black people.
Hip-hop is is a genre that conveys more stereotypes among a certain race than any other. Think about it: there are rappers that often say the n-word when it isn’t necessary, music videos often convey black men only wanting to have sex and money, while black women are sexualized.
I don’t see a lot of white women prancing around in a hip-hop video. In fact, it’s often black or light-skinned women that are disrespected in hip-hop.
There’s also the image that hip-hop artists often convey to the public in the way they dress and act, promoting the ideas of these artists (who are mostly made up of blacks) as “ghetto,” criminals, aggressive thugs, and drug dealers who only come up from the hood.
When people hear and see this, obviously they react to it: most of this is positive, making people believe that it is okay to degrade women, especially black people and those who are light-skinned, or saying the n-word, or believing in the stereotypes that people of colour are all about drugs and violence.
“Rap can be seen as aggressive and loud, which could make others see blacks in a similar fashion,” Emmanuel Shakur, a third year Sociology major says.
“Some rappers may rap about drugs, violence and the street or a lifestyle that not many blacks can relate to, but listeners may think is the norm with black people.”
Having the kind of power that hip-hop music holds can be dangerous, especially when dealing with worldwide recognition. When people all over the world listen to the genre and the kinds of diction it often uses, many may assume the stereotype is correct, creating a very wrong and misinformed image about blacks.
This can create a lot more hate and anger than there needs to be.
Yet, what we don’t get more of in mainstream hip-hop is the political songs that Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, A Tribe Called Quest, or Schoolboy Q makes.
Instead, we hear the degrading kind, the dangerous kind. And this should be stopped because we don’t need any more drama or hate or stereotypes circling around about the black community.
What we need is more empowerment and the truth about the socio-political issues pinned on blacks in America and the rest of the world.

This year’s YFS election saw an 11 per cent turnout voting rate. With last year’s 12 per cent turnout, the question remains: what went wrong?
When asked why she didn’t vote, an anonymous third-year student replied: “I didn’t know anything about the election, I didn’t know who was running or the parties involved.” A response that seems to be the general consensus among the student population. Some students hold a ‘what would one vote do?’ attitude, while others seem to genuinely lack interest entirely.
If those reasons don’t seem to hit the nail on the head, then it’s not from a lack of interest, but more from a lack of knowledge in the political happenings of the school that led to a lackluster election. An anonymous third-year Schulich student didn’t vote because she said nothing ever changes. Last year, YFS’ biggest accomplishment was the procurement of a Fall reading week—something that felt inevitable given the fact every other all post-secondary institution has one.
During the three years I’ve been at York, YFS has been promising a fight for free tuition, with no progress made. The unrealistic goals of the student government not only deter students from participating in school politics, but makes student government seem like a hoax. It seems they spend the year planning for a welcome-back concert that ends with a last-minute obscure artist, who most students have not heard of and have no interest in seeing. They spend a compounding period promising to eradicate tuition. Not only is this a far-fetched dream that is both unreasonable and highly unattainable; it’s a mockery of student government.
By championing themselves throughout the year as the voice of students dedicated to making a change, but having no concrete results at the end of the year, shows no progress. How can students become more interested, when there’s nothing for them to see?
Voting during election period is also a hindrance as there’s no access to online voting. In the age of technology, not providing a means for online voting is almost as counterproductive as promising free tuition, only for OSAP funding to be cut.
The YFS does not publicize debates, which effectively keeps students in the dark. No one really knows what’s happening behind the scenes. YFS has been contacted numerous times, but without fail, have always refrained from speaking to the media. How can students be informed or aware of what’s happening in their own student government, when the government fails to disclose such information?
The fact of the matter is, we don’t really know what goes on behind closed doors—where our tuition money goes, or whose pocket it goes into. Unfortunately, that just seems to be the way it is. Nothing is permanent and everyone comes and goes (just recently, the University of Ottawa’s administration terminated their agreement with the student union due to corruption).
So here’s hoping the new student government does better—while we accept that things will very likely stay exactly the same.

A student financial peer support team, established through the government’s Mental Health Services Grant, has helped thousands of students with their financial woes.
Established in September 2018, the service is run by students trained to help peers with their financial concerns. According to Advisor and Deputy Spokesperson for the university, Yanni Dagonas, the team has had a significant impact on helping York students.
“So far this year, the team saw more than 5,700 queries related to student finances during the fall semester, and have been incredibly impactful in helping York students navigate their concerns in a peer-to-peer setting,” he says.
Students were trained during the last two weeks of August with Student Financial Liaison Officer, Sylvia Spizzirri, and Financial Aid Trainer Mary Santoli.
“The team has been extensively trained on issues related to student financial services so they can provide helpful advice,” Dagonas says.
“They work closely with York’s student financial advisors to address a variety of questions related to student accounts and OSAP queries, and to provide information and support regarding scholarships and bursaries,” he adds.
According to Dagonas, the team is comprised of six student leaders this year: Isabela Bibulovic, Joanne Ong, Sarah Labib, Lorenzo Panate, Ilia Azari, and Hammad Saif.
The university is currently hiring next year’s student financial leaders (SFS) team. With changes to student funding through OSAP, concerns with how students will handle the stress of finances are being addressed by the service.
“Training will take place every summer before the start of the academic year and will reflect the policies and procedures of the OSAP program,” Dagonas says.
“York is committed to a mentally healthy campus, providing access to a variety of resources, services, and programs to help manage life’s challenges and enhance well-being,” he adds.
In a statement, Ong describes her experience working with the SFS: “It’s been so rewarding to work with students to help them navigate their financial questions. Over the semester we’ve really grown as a team, and not only been able to help students, but also learn more about finances for ourselves.”
The support team can be found on the first floor of the Bennett Centre each week on Monday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Tuesday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Featured Image: Students will now have the choice to opt-out of paying certain ancillary fees this September. | Dylan Stoll
Last week, a meeting regarding the new changes to student tuition and ancillary fees was held.
Business Manager at Excalibur Publications, Eric Rail, attended the meeting. No decisions were made, and everything is still to be determined; however, important information was shared about how opting out of the ancillary fees will work for students.
“Students would have a chance to opt-out only in September. They wouldn’t be able to opt-out or opt back in at a later date. The number of students who did opt-out would be known early in the school year to allow student organizations to plan accordingly,” says Rail.
However, opting out of these fees will affect a lot more than just the university newspaper. Services such as the Food Support Centre, which helps students who are struggling financially to feed themselves, are funded by student ancillary fees.
In a recent interview, outgoing YFS President Rawan Habib expresses her concerns for the negative impact the now optional ancillary fees can have on student services, specifically the Food Support Centre.
“Every month we see more students registering. It’s something they desperately need,” Habib says.
However, some students are thankful for a chance to be able to choose where their money goes.
“I appreciate the choice. A lot of students have existing coverage, such as dental and health, with our parents. So, it’s an expense I can avoid,” says fourth-year health studies student Maria Marquez.
Other students feel differently about how these ancillary fees affect student life, and whether they use certain services or not.
“If you think about it, by paying to increase the quality of life at York and funding these services, even if you never use them, you in turn improve your own school experience because everyone around you will be positively affected. So, I guess it’s probably a good thing to keep it mandatory,” says fourth-year art history student Sara Amoosoltani.
At this time, Rail cannot confirm whether or not it is absolute, but he says students may be able to pick and choose what fees they wish to opt out of.
“It appears that organizations would be listed individually, so that students would be able to pick which ones to fund, as opposed to picking groups and opting out of funding every organization under one group. Because funding to certain student groups would be curtailed, events like Frosh Week, for instance, would not run for an entire week but perhaps one or two days,” says Rail.
These changes can only be seen going forward in the following school year. For now, many student organizations funded by ancillary fees are simply waiting for the ball to drop.
“In any case, it’s a tough call because by making these fees mandatory, we are asking students to pay for university services they may never use. But at the same time, these services benefit the student body and their quality of life at York as a whole. So the real question is more along the lines of the interests for the individual versus that of the collective,” says Amoosoltani.

Ali Kazimi, an associate professor in the department of cinema and media arts has won the Governor General Award, one of the most prestigious lifetime achievement awards in Visual and Media Arts.
“These are the most prestigious prizes in Canada for career achievement in visual and media arts, rewarding accomplished artists that have left their mark and changed art history,” says Tara Lapointe, director outreach and business development at the Canada Council for the Arts.
To receive this award, an individual in the field of media and visual arts has to nominate someone based on their achievements, accolades, and projects throughout their life. Karen Tisch, an arts consultant and incoming executive director for the Koffler Centre of the Arts, nominated Kazimi for this award.
Individuals in the field of media and visual arts must have an outstanding national presence in order to attain this symbolic award.
“The Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts are given to individuals for outstanding contributions to the field and are arguably the highest honours bestowed to Canadian artists working in these disciplines,” says Tisch.
A couple of his most notable projects are Narmada: A Valley Rises, Shooting Indians: A Journey with Jeffrey Thomas, and Runaway Grooms. His work has inspired change throughout the world by informing and shifting public opinion in order to create more galvanized efforts to improve an issue through concrete political action.
In her nomination package, Tisch stated: “Kazimi’s larger project of elucidating the often-underexposed histories and experiences of racialized peoples, exploring complex intersections of colonialism, racism, and immigration through the moving image, and has significantly contributed to Canadian cinema and video art.”
Kazimi was surprised to learn he was selected for the Award for Media and Visual Arts.
“I was pretty overwhelmed, and I was shocked. I knew that I had been nominated. I had to prepare a packet of my work to be sent to the jury. But, to actually get a call that I was one of the selected was very overwhelming,” Kazimi says.
In order to win, you have to “be yourself, be bold, work hard and pursue your passion, no matter what,” says Lapointe.

Featured Image: The critical disabilities studies program is moving from HNES to Stong. | Fatema Ali
With the topic of York’s accessibility at the forefront of many students’ minds, a move has been made to transition the Critical Disabilities Studies Program from the Health, Nursing, and Environmental Sciences (HNES) building, to Stong College.
The move, which was scheduled to happen this summer, has brought concerns to staff and students within the program.
Russell Rozinskis, a third-year PhD candidate in critical disabilities studies, says Stong is less accessible than HNES, due to the size of the hallways and the lack of elevators.
“Stong wasn’t constructed with accessibility in mind. It’s an older building; many of the door frames are narrow, and some of the offices are not big enough for wheelchairs to fit inside. Also, there is only one elevator which was built after that fact, and the washrooms are smaller,” he says.
Rozinskis adds: “As far as we can tell, there is no gender neutral-washroom. We have also found out there is a mold problem.”
Professor Geoffrey Raume says the fire doors also cause major accessibility issues. “The fire doors do not have accessibility buttons, which is absolutely essential,” he says.
Rozinskis also points out that this change could create accessibility issues for those who take Wheeltrans. According to him, Wheeltrans drops students off near Vari Hall, where the program has an accessible classroom. Should the program move, he says, WheelTrans could move to dropping students off near the Aviva Centre.
“Wheelchair users can only use the front door of Stong. If WheelTrans is dropping people off close to Stong, they might be dropping them off close to Aviva Centre,” Rozinskis says.
“To get to campus walk, you have to find the elevator in Calumet to take up to campus walk, but it’s not very well marked,” he adds.
Referencing the issue of accessibility during snowstorms, specifically that of Ali Imrie, the Osgoode student who posted a video of herself struggling to get her wheelchair across campus following a storm, Rozinskis also points out that the slope going down to Stong College could pose some safety issues, especially with ice. 
“That slope is slippery if it’s not properly maintained,” he says.
In a response from the university, Chief Spokesperson of Media Relations Barbara Joy says the Dean of the Faculty of Health has taken steps to organize a meeting with students and staff after receiving an open letter regarding the issue.
“York is committed to principles of respect, inclusion, and equality of all persons with disabilities across campus. The university is committed to preventing, minimizing and removing the barriers to participation by persons with disabilities in the activities of the university, including employment, study or social activity,” she says.
Faculty of Health Dean Paul McDonald could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.

E-cigarettes may be leading younger users to illicit drug and alcohol use. With the help of a 2017 study conducted by Statistics Canada and Health Canada, researchers at York’s Faculty of Health found links between alcohol and drug use with e-cigarette use today.
“Given that among all age groups, Canadian youth and young adults have the highest prevalence of e-cigarette use, the objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with e-cigarette use among this population, and to specifically examine the association between alcohol, marijuana and illicit drug use,” says MSc candidate in the Faculty of Health and lead author of the study published in BMC Public Health, Vrati Mehra.
The study concludes that more than six percent of young Canadians, aged 15 to 24, use e-cigarettes within the month; 23 percent of which reported to have used an e-cigarette everyday. Almost one in every four of the same age group have reported trying e-cigarettes.
Mehra, who worked on this research with York’s professor Hala Tamim and psychology professor Yvonne Bohr, also reported that over 70 percent of youth that have vaped received their e-cigarettes through friends or relatives. The top reason these users tried e-cigarettes was simply to enjoy the flavours.
The debate over vaping and e-cigarettes began when serious cases of youth being hospitalized occurred in America. As of September 23, the American death toll for vaping has increased to nine. Health Canada has also warned Canadians that with vaping and e-cigarette use comes the risk of pulmonary illness. Although there has yet to be cases involving pulmonary illness in Canada, the US reported several.
“Until now, no single substance or e-cigarette product has been consistently associated with illness,” reported the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the end of August.
The CDC has reported approximately 530 cases across the US. Whether or not vaping and e-cigarette use causes pulmonary illness in most cases, the CDC has advised people not to use vaping products.
As a response to these new cases, Deputy Premier of Ontario and Minister of Health Christine Elliott issued an order under section 77.7.1 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act. Now, public hospitals in Ontario will be required to give statistical and non-identifying information of vaping health incidents to the Chief Medical Officer of Health.
“This information, not previously available to the Ministry of Health, will be critical as we continue to engage with leading experts to identify evidence-based solutions that protect our youth from the potential dangers of vaping,” says Elliott.
For now, government health agencies and officials are discouraging first-time vapers from using vapes and e-cigarettes, especially youth. Health reporter for the Globe and Mail Andre Picard says that this issue is just too new.
“Smoking is like jumping off the hundredth floor of a building. Vaping is like jumping out, we just don’t know which floor yet,” says Picard.

Featured Image: One of the Conservative Party posters found on post-secondary campuses.
Last week, York’s Keele campus saw posters by the Conservative Party of Canada calling students to volunteer. However, the rhetoric used by the posters caused frustration to boil on campus.
“Because you can only hear the same left-wing talking points from your professors so many times,” the poster states.
Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer replied to the remarks over the poster by saying he does not mean anything regarding his influence over who gets hired in post-secondary positions.
“It’s a way to get people engaged on campus and it’s meant to be a launching pad for discussions and debate and hearing other points of view,” Scheer says.
But this type of rhetoric can be detrimental according to professors at post-secondary institutions.
“There’s a Conservative message going out that somehow colleges and universities are these indoctrination centres, that they’re more like campuses in Paris in 1968 than they are currently,” says Executive Director of the Canadian Association of Teachers David Robinson. “They are diverse.”
Some students agree with this sentiment. Second-year journalism student James Mackin could not find the humour in the poster.
“I just think he’s pandering to people who were already going to vote for him no matter what. But it’ll probably vilify left-leaning students against him as well,” says Mackin.
However, as most students may believe that the posters painted professors as left-wing advocates, there are others who agree with Scheer’s humour.
“I do not find professors are professional. I can only think of a handful of professors who haven’t passionately expressed their political views. Of the ones who have declared themselves, only one was right-wing. Universities are indoctrination centres,” says third-year student Celia Lewin.
Lewin adds that the posters are meant to mobilize conservative students and recruit volunteers, rather than attracting new voters.
“Students are a hard demographic to reach, especially because the schools are governed by people who have a personal interest in keeping those students from getting involved,” Lewin says.
However, YFS Director of Environmental Studies Abdeali Saherwala disagrees with Lewin’s opinion. He believes that such an assumption could prove dangerous that social issues and education are all left-wing.
“I feel that most universities are left-wing. But that is not the institution’s fault nor are professors chosen for their political beliefs. I think with education on history, feminism, equality, equity and racial issues, people become left-wing or people who want to teach become left-wing,” Saherwala says.
York University Acting Chief Spokesperson Yanni Dagonas provided a statement from York saying that the university is committed to providing a non-partisan environment and would never comment on the activities of a political party during a federal elections.
“York considers the privilege afforded by freedom of speech as vitally important to robust and respectful dialogue. York values the expertise our faculty has accrued through robust research, data and evidence gathering. Academic freedom is fundamental to the mandate of universities to pursue truth, educate students and disseminate knowledge and understanding,” says Dagonas.

Lilly Singh, who graduated from York’s psychology program in 2010 and lived in Scarborough recently began hosting a late-night show on NBC. The show is called A Little Late with Lilly Singh and it premiered on September 16.
Singh is known to most of her fans through her YouTube channel “||Superwoman||”, which has amassed almost 15 million subscribers since she started posting videos eight years ago.
“At the time, I wasn’t even totally aware of what YouTube could become. I didn’t think it could be a career, I didn’t think I could make a lot of money from it, I didn’t think it would be sustainable by any means. I just had an idea and wanted to creatively express it somehow,” Singh said in an interview in 2015.
Singh’s content consists of original skits, interviews, and monologues about everything from pop culture to her experience as a child of immigrant parents. She became so influential that in 2017 she was on Forbes’ list of highest paid YouTubers.
Her fame only increased with the publishing of her book, “How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life.”  She has also worked as an actress, appearing in the films Fahrenheit?451, Bad Moms and Ice Age: Collision Course.
Singh’s show on NBC has replaced Last Call with Carson Daly that had been on the air for 18 seasons.
“Lilly Singh brings her unique perspective to late night as she hosts celebrity interviews, talks current events, performs musical and sketch comedy, plays games, and more,” as described on the official NBC website.
In an interesting move by NBC, A Little Late’s first-ever episode was streamed on YouTube a few hours before its television debut. According to the CBC, this was done on purpose “to try to tap into the online fan base Singh steadily built over the last decade.”
“Lilly is truly a star and we’re thrilled to welcome her to our NBC family,” said Executive Vice President, Special Programs and Late Night, for NBC Entertainment Doug Vaughan in an NBC media release.
“She is a multi-talented performer who will surely have a great rapport with not only all her guests but also with our devoted late-night audience.”
“An Indian-Canadian woman with her own late-night show? Now that is a dream come true. I’m thrilled to bring it to life on NBC,” Singh said.
About three years ago, Lilly Singh visited the York campus and brought her positivity with her.  She stood on stage and said to the eagerly listening crowd of students, “When you graduate from this amazing school, you can do whatever you want to do. I would never have imagined in my wildest dreams I would be texting The Rock and going to the White House and doing all these things.”
“I’m really going to encourage you that, whatever you want to do, don’t just believe it, you gotta work really hard to achieve it.  You can all do that.  I truly believe you can all do that,” Singh added.

Featured Image: Gingivitis is very common, affecting 50 per cent of adults. | Courtesy of Pixabay
Recent evidence suggests that gingivitis, the first stage of gum disease, and Alzheimer’s disease are linked by a particular bacterium.
The bacteria in question is Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), an oral anaerobe that is involved in the development of periodontitis. Periodontitis — the stage after gingivitis — results when so much bacterial plaque accumulates on the surface of the teeth that subgingival pockets are formed between the tooth and the gum. With time, the tissue and bone that hold the tooth and gum together deteriorate until the tooth falls out. In those who have reached this stage, P. gingivalis is highly prevalent.
Fascinatingly, researchers have also found the bacterium in the brains of people who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease.
Leading the research behind this bewildering connection is a pharmaceutical company called Cortexyme. Using mice, they have shown that the subjects given the bacterial infection of P. gingivalis suffered neurological damage — the kind seen in human Alzheimer’s cases.
 Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, P. gingivalis, and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis,” said Dr. Stephen Dominy, co-founder of Cortexyme and lead author of the paper.
“This demonstrates the potential for a class of small molecule therapies to change the trajectory of disease.”
As strange as this may sound, there have already been a few studies conducted that link oral and mental health. In 2016, a study was conducted that determined those with both Alzheimer’s and gingivitis experienced a more rapid neurodegeneration. Even more astonishingly, the Herpes Type I virus, an STI, has also been linked to Alzheimer’s.
It should be noted that more research is required before it can definitively be determined that one disease causes the other. Though an individual may have Alzheimer’s, he or she may also have been avid brushers; though an individual may have lost all of their teeth, he or she may be in perfect mental health.
A list of preventative measures that one can take to avoid developing the neurodegenerative disease can be found at alzheimers.net. Some of the suggestions include: quitting smoking and drinking; engaging in social activities; giving your brain daily challenges, exercise, a good diet, and managing stress effectively.
Remember, this may seem like a possible problem too far in the future, but the bad habits you develop as a young adult may stay with you into your later years. It’s better to be in the know now than regretting your ignorance later.

Featured Image: Microdosing is defined as the act of taking very small amounts of a particular substance to improve mental well-being. | Courtesy of Pixabay
A peculiar new trend has caused more than just a stir in the medical community lately. Microdosing is the act of taking drugs such as acid, DMT, mushrooms (psilocybin), or MDMA in very small quantities over the course of a period of time. This method has become the new form of treatment in the fight against depression and anxiety.
Many are hailing microdosing as the miracle cure, but how can one be sure that one isn’t just needlessly subjecting the brain to mind-altering drugs on a daily basis?
In spite of what the general consensus may be, the information behind this phenomena is slim to none. A review in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, written by a team of researchers hoping to define and analyze medicinal microdosing (specifically that of psilocybin) more sufficiently, found little in the way of actual solid data. As such, they feel that it is too early to say anything definitive on the subject.
Dr. Kim Kuypers of the Maastricht University in the Netherlands, the first author of the study, told MedicalNewsToday:
 Patients might feel attracted by those reports to try it but may actually not be helped by it. We try to emphasize the lack of scientific proof that microdosing is indeed effective in combating certain symptoms and hope that this will give impetus to new lines of research in this area.”
But what is microdosing exactly? Professor David Nutt, the Edmond J. Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, is the senior author of the review. After researching the ins and outs of microdosing, Nutt and his team define the phenomena by three main characteristics: very low doses that neither cause perceived change in the imbiber nor impair any normal functioning; multiple, scheduled dose times over a period of time; and a desire to enhance one’s self though microdosing. The amount itself, the ‘microdose,’ is defined as “approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth of a recreational dose.”
As for the lack of information related to microdosing, Nutt told MedicalNewsToday that the legalities of the substances are the main deterrent to gathering relevant data, but he and his team hope that the recent publicity will be of use in removing the red tape.
Kuypers holds the same sentiment: “This review is timely as a lot of hope is generated by positive media reports about alleged effects of microdosing.”
So, before you pop a few mushroom caps to write your next exam, remember that the data simply isn’t available yet and anecdotal evidence is hardly evidence at all without an empirical approach.
As Nutt and his team put it: “Rigorous, placebo-controlled clinical studies need to be conducted with low doses of psilocybin to determine whether there is any evidence for the claims of microdosing.”

The holiday season can be far from winter nights sitting by the fireplace sipping hot cocoa. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a medley of holidays or none at all, December is often regarded as the “ideal” time of the year. It is a month typically free from university classes and full of non-stop gift-giving and quality time with family and friends.
However, for some, this period is far from being “the most wonderful time of the year” – but why is that? Why is this time of year, synonymous in society with glee and relaxation, often not experienced by many in such a joyous way?
Some may categorize themselves as having the “holiday blues” during the holiday season.
According to Gordan Flett, Personality & Health professor, the holiday blues is “the idea that a substantial proportion of people feel sad and depressed during the holidays. It also suggests someone who is quite lonely and isolated from others.”
Woo Kim, International Student & Scholar Services associate director at York, says the holiday blues may be experienced for various reasons for some international students in particular.
Kim describes that an international student may be in a mundane mood because “they may not be going home over the December holidays and won’t get to see their family and friends. This may lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, at least temporarily.”
Aparna Mehta, third-year English student at York, explains how she was impacted during the past holiday season when she was unable to visit her family in Delhi, India.
“The holiday season tends to be a time for family. As I was unable to travel back home and be with my family last year, I did feel a little unhappy and homesick.”
Kim also explains how “for other students, this may be their first, or one of their first, winter. If they’re from a country where the weather stays fairly mild or hot in winter and stays sunny, the early darkness and grey winter days may cause them to feel less energized and ‘blue.’”
Sarah Irwin-Gardner, York’s Graduate Student Wellness Services manager, lists some factors that generally may impact students’ well-being during the holiday season. One factor Irwin-Gardner mentions is “feeling pressure to produce or experience a ‘perfect’ holiday.” Cassandra Carcasole, third-year English student, describes how she feels this expectation Irwin-Gardner describes.
 The holidays do cause some stress for me because there are so many things on my mind. I also feel like I need to buy everyone the perfect gift, so there’s always some pressure there,” Carcasole says.
Brian Villa, third-year Business Administration student, also has experienced this type of pressure. “My stress derives more from what to do on Christmas so that everyone will be happy.”
Irwin-Gardner discusses how the holiday season may affect a student because they tend to “manage multiple demands on one’s time.” Such demands may include balancing time for holiday shopping and social gatherings with time for final exam and assignment preparation, on top of working a part-time job.
“Other than being a student, I work two part-time retail jobs. Right now, it’s definitely a lot. I don’t have any days off,” Carcasole says.
“I am able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments, but it is not easy and definitely not the ideal situation.” Villa adds.
Charles Matthew Mishiyev, second-year history student, explains how becoming accustomed to a hectic routine is his key to balancing a hectic season.
“I am somewhat able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments because I have worked in retail during the holiday season for two years and have adapted to it,” Mishiyev says.
Adelaide Dolha, third-year Devised Theatre student, recalls her experience working in retail during the holiday season.
“Last year when I worked in retail, I had more hours due to more people being needed and these were 5 a.m. shifts. I even had one on Christmas Eve which made me tired for the rest of the day.”
Another factor Irwin-Gardner adds to the list of potential reasons for stress during the holidays is an “increase in academic pressure and the effects of working intensely leading up to the holidays.”
“I am able to balance my schedule as I usually start preparing for the holidays only once exams are done,” Dolha adds.
Irwin-Gardner also lists “feelings of isolation or feelings of loneliness” as a contributing factor for one’s holiday blues. Silsila Bahrami, fourth-year communication studies student, shares her feelings of discontentment with this time of year.
“I do not typically enjoy the holiday season. I am not a fan of the cold weather and I usually feel left out of the festivities, as my family does not celebrate the holiday season. I try to keep myself busy during this time period, but it is difficult when most people are away and/or celebrating while I am at home.”
Other factors listed by Irwin-Gardner include: “Distance from loved ones; increased financial demands/pressures; change in routine; missing loved ones who are far away or no longer alive; seasonal effects on mood (SAD), and difficult or distressing family dynamics.”
If you feel as if you may have experienced, or are currently experiencing, the holiday blues, there are other students at York, and in the country, who share your discontentment. But, how many students do the holiday blues impact?
Unfortunately, there has not been any research conducted that has established a relationship between the holiday season and an increase in stress and unhappiness among students, according to Flett. Nonetheless, there are still students who may feel a sense of unhappiness at one point during the holiday season due to the aforementioned potential factors.
 I look at the holidays as a time for relaxation and enjoyment for some people, but potentially hellish for others. It is a difficult time for any student who is preoccupied mentally and emotionally with not having done well in the fall term or who is returning to a less than optimal interpersonal situation or who is just feeling isolated and lonely,” Flett explains.
Flett also further supports the factors listed by Irwin-Gardner as to what could contribute to the holiday blues.
“It is more stressful for those who are focused on happier times in the past and why aren’t they so happy now. Or, for someone who is overly focused on comparing their holiday experience to the idealized accounts of life over the holidays provided by other people. Also, some people really buy into the notion of the perfect holiday season and they can exhaust themselves and others by trying to live up to an idealized image of how it should be or could be. Others are disquieted because they are so work-obsessed, they don’t know how to respond during times when the focus should be on rest and replenishing oneself.”
Louise Hartley, York’s Psychology Clinic director, comments on how marketing is also a contributing factor for those experiencing the holiday blues. Marketing has surrounded us with a narrative of how the holidays “should be,” despite it being unattainable for some.
“The holiday season can be difficult for anyone because there are these expectations built in through the excessive advertising – that this is a ‘happy’ time of year.”
So, how can one cope with the holiday blues?
Mayo Clinic shared 10 tips to coping with stress and depression during the holidays. The Mayo Clinic staff recommended that if you are experiencing the holiday blues for any of the aforementioned reasons, you should try to do the following: “acknowledge your feelings; reach out; be realistic; set aside differences; stick to a budget; plan ahead; learn to say no; do not abandon healthy habits; take a breather, and seek professional help if you need it.”
If you often feel lonely during the holiday season or you feel yourself feeling in such a way in the next few weeks, registered psychologist, Dr. Ganz Ferrance explained to CTV News that “if you are isolated from your family, find other ways to connect with people. Make time for friends or volunteering to help combat loneliness.”
Kim provides information on how York students will be able to connect with other students staying in the city to avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness this holiday season.
“International students who aren’t going home and staying in Toronto may want to connect with other international students staying over the break or with domestic students who live locally. This year, York International will be running a few events and outings in the city for any international students staying in Toronto so they can connect with other students staying over the break.”
The Mayo Clinic staff put it best: “Don’t let the holidays become something you dread. Instead, take steps to prevent the stress and depression that can descend during the holidays. Learn to recognize your holiday triggers, such as financial pressures or personal demands, so you can combat them before they lead to a meltdown. With a little planning and some positive thinking, you can find peace and joy during the holidays.”
It is very important to reach out for support if you have concerns about your mental health or wellness during the holiday season or at any point during the year. York University’s Student Counselling & Development Services offers walk-in counselling Monday to Friday between 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. More information can be found at counselling.students.yorku.ca
The Good2Talk Helpline is a free, confidential helpline for post-secondary students in Ontario that is available 24/7 as well.

The struggle between youthful rebellion and mature reasoning among us university students can be seen by the protests that occurred on Wednesday, November 20 against the IDF soldier.
History and society idealizes images of young rebellious types who, through strong (and mostly violent) acts of defiance, challenge the status quo and change their countries for the better. Images of students marching to American Embassies or toppling statues of some tyrant comes to mind when we think of student activism. This is inherently wrong.
In young students who, for the first time, hear their voices in society, they develop an impulse to correct the oppressive ways of the old. Our education, which bores us to death, does not fulfill us intellectually; this produces a loud and boisterous beast of a mob that overtakes all rationale.
Western civilization owes its success to free discourse and debate. In fact, this is the exact notion that universities should aim to do — this is the only value that we as students should learn. If someone honestly believes in a cause, or in the case of the events of last week’s events, against a cause, they should not chant and try to silence others. This will only regress us to the barbaric past we are trying to avoid.
If you believe someone’s message is wrong and/or detrimental, then prove it. Set up a booth, and call people to hear the facts.
There needs to be a shift in the understanding of student activism. Let’s change hoisted fists as logos for organizations (cough, YFS) to pens and microphones. Let’s take up booths rather than banners, as this and nothing else, will drive us forward.

With protests surging in Hong Kong, many residents have had their lives put into danger. Some of these residents are students who are there on exchange programs from Canadian universities.
As a result, York and other Canadian universities have requested that the exchange students come back to Canada out of concern for their safety.
After Hong Kong was returned to China after being a British colony in 1997, Hong Kong still maintained a certain level of independence as a separate entity from China.
Since June, protests have escalated as Hong Kong has put forward a bill which threatens to have criminals from Hong Kong extradited to China for punishment.
The protests have gradually become worse. They have been characterized by Chinese officials as riots and have led to many protestors being killed, injured, and detained.
“I think it is reasonable for them to call back the students,” says Kevin Gu, first-year language student. “The protestors have attacked the universities,” he adds, emphasizing that the severity of the protests were putting Canadian students’ lives in danger.
One student, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of a reaction from the Chinese government, had a different outlook.
 Canadians are safe in China. Canada has always been viewed positively by the Chinese, ever since Mao. This is all being blown out of proportion. China doesn’t see Canada the same way as other Western countries,” says the student.
“If the protests continue to grow more violent, based on history, it could lead to a civil war, and Canadian students could be caught in the crossfire,” says third-year history student Eric Solomon.
“I don’t know how bad it actually is, but studying abroad is stressful enough, having this going on would take a toll on one’s mental health,” adds Solomon. “Even if Canadian students aren’t being targeted, they’re getting affected one way or another. Everybody is hurting. No one wins.”
First-year interdisciplinary studies student Katherine Mu challenged whether the overall concern from Canadian universities was for the best of all involved.
“Are we valuing some lives more than others? Why don’t we focus on creating a safer environment for everybody rather than just calling these students back? For any university or country to only call back their people from a situation like that shows they are valuing some lives more than others,” says Mu.
Despite being across the world, many students at York are engaging in discussion and protesting around the current situation in Hong Kong. For now, all students can do is hope for the safety and well-being of those affected by the conflict.

Amnesty International at York invited students to write letters to advocate for human rights across the globe.
The event, held on November 19 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., saw students arrive throughout the day to write for a variety of specific issues.
“Amnesty International holds Write for Rights every single year, where they pick ten cases — different cases around the world in different countries,” says third-year law and society student and Vice-President of Amnesty International at York, Nada Abdel-Maksoud.
These cases will often involve political prisoners and human rights injustices, according to Abdel-Maksoud. Then, students and supporters will come together and write to the governments who are committing said human rights violations to try to invoke change.
The event garnered a good amount of attention last year, sending out just under six million letters and messages from over 200 countries.
“The past years, we’ve had to send out over a hundred letters,” Abdel-Maksoud says, discussing the York extension’s impact. “In the years I’ve seen the event happen, it has attracted a lot of attention, so we’re glad about that, and it really helps because it seems like such a small thing but it makes a big difference.”
And the event has made a difference. In 2014, film director Oleg Sentsov was arrested by Russian authorities on charges of plotting terrorism acts. Amnesty International, alongside other human rights organizations, took to his side to defend him and label the accusations by the Russian court as fabrications.
After being released on September 7, 2019, Sentsov thanked activists and people who wrote letters during his incarceration.
“I brought two bags. The second contained 22 kilograms of paper, mostly letters. I did not throw a single one out. I brought them all and kept them, as they are so dear to me. There are books, notebooks, a big pack, 15 of them. They are completely filled with writing.”
Abdel-Maksoud says the letters are not directly connected to the remediation of these human rights violations; however, they could be a factor that help individuals around the world.
“Those letters, because they are so personal, you can write them to the people facing that injustice or the government itself. It really makes a difference because people get to read, people that are in solidarity with them, and governments get to see how much people want these injustices solved,” says Abdel-Maksoud.
York students attended for their own personal reasons, and explained how they were touched by specific cases that Amnesty International was working on.
 I, myself, wrote to the case about people arrested for helping refugees in Greece. They volunteered for a rescue mission, and were arrested. Although they’ve been released on bail, they are pending charges,” says fourth-year communication studies student, Olivia Graham.
“This seems like such a small thing, and people always seem to think that writing letters and signing petitions are small actions. It’s the most basic form of mobilization for your rights and the rights of others,” says Abdel-Maksoud, urging others to attend the Write for Rights event.
The official event by Amnesty International will take place on December 10.

As a Halloweenie, you can imagine my disappointment in finding out that the most exhilarating time of the year was rendered obsolete by the COVID-19 — which, for me at least, is the scariest Halloween yet. However, one of my all-time favourite traditions every year was a different kind of scare: haunted houses! Casa Loma’s Legends of Horror, Screemers, terrifying escape rooms — name it and I was there. Granted, if you ask my friends they will tell you I shriek my lungs into pneumothorax every time, but I live for the experience! This year, however, I’m indulging in a virtual, at-home experience including online escape room games (yes, they are a thing, and yes, there are creepy ones best played with the lights off), and horror movies in the dark with friends (or while carving pumpkins)! As long as I get my Halloween fright this year, the holiday may not be completely dead (pun not intended) after all. 
SPOOKY, BUT LOWKEYVictoria Silman, Managing Editor

Every year around this time, I am usually in the works of planning a Halloween bash. My roommate and I would probably be returning from Value Village or the Dollar Store, where we would pick up all the things we need to decorate. We’d be changing the lightbulbs to black, green, and red, and we’d be decorating the apartment to the nines. We’d be sending out invites to all our friends, and researching the best bar to go to around 11 p.m. to save our neighbours from all the noise. And, we’d be preparing the best jello shots you’ve ever had. Last year, we celebrated on the weekend prior to Halloween, and we made our way down to Clinton’s at Bloor and Christie. On Halloween, I was in Mexico with my mom, dressed in a shark costume and handing out candy to children (as they sang Baby Shark to me, which made me regret everything). The next day, I also had the honour to celebrate Día de Muertos with the local Mexican community. But, this year we will create new memories, even if they are toned down. We might play some horror video games, or, perhaps watch some scary movies, carve some pumpkins, and bake some of those delicious Halloween Pillsbury cookies. Halloween is one of my favourite holidays, and even if it may look different this year, we can still make it special.
LONG LIVE SPOOKY SEASONJonathan Q. Hoidn, Copy Editor

Alas, Spooky Season is coming to a close, and it’s time to reflect on the spookiness in our souls, the horror on our home TVs, and the darkness within the depths of our own minds — wait, you don’t do that on Halloween? What DO you do on Halloween? That’s what this article is about, discussing what we do on Halloween? You’re telling me that people treat Halloween as a one-day thing and NOT a month-long spectacle like it deserves? Did the event’s in the movie Trick or Treat ever actually happen? Is The Nightmare Before Christmas not based on a true story? Do people watch scary movies ONLY on October 31st and not year-round? Is Spooky Season even a real thing? Am I going crazy or is my whole life just a lie!?
Jokes aside, I watch Halloween with my family every year.
— R.I.P. Spooky Season 2020. You will be missed.
MET GALA HALLOWEENSakeina Syed, News Editor
Is it just me, or did the word “Halloween” have an apostrophe in it before, as in, Hallowe’en? I’m not sure where the apostrophe went, but it was one of the things that fascinated my eight-year-old self about the holiday. It just seemed so mysterious and magical…what purpose did an apostrophe in the middle of two of the same letters serve? No one knew. Where is the apostrophe now? No one knows. Spooky. 
At any rate, everything about Halloween — clearly including grammatical minutiae — has always enchanted me, as someone who doesn’t personally partake in the festivities. With my cultural background, trick-or-treating wasn’t really something my family chose to participate in. The idea of taking candy from strangers is something that scared my Indian grandparents far more than any costumes we could ever come up with! So for me, Halloween is like the Met Gala — I have the most fun judging everyone’s costumes and envisioning elaborate ones of my own. (And enjoying the discounted candy the week after).

Living in Northwestern Ontario, Halloween has always been a testament to how long you can bear to walk in the sludge outside, and go trick-or-treating in snow before calling it quits due to frostbite and numbed fingers. Despite all that, my frozen Halloweens are some of my favourite childhood memories, even when I had to wear snow pants and a parka over all of my cute costumes. Over the past three years, with living in Toronto, I’ve gotten the chance to experience a warmer, more social Halloween at York. You can walk outside in your insufficient costume without being camouflaged with snow, and you can wear heels outside without worrying for the safety of your toes. Because of COVID-19, I am back in my snowy town, surrounded by an incredibly disappointed family. Halloween was always my family’s favourite holiday; we’d dress up our house like it was a Blumhouse set. We’re all disappointed that we can’t live it up spooky this year, but we’re admittedly happy that I am home to be able to experience a good ol’ fashion below freezing Halloween. 
A HOMEBODY HALLOWEENShivam Sachdeva, Health Editor

Halloween has been a pretty eventful time of year for me since as early as I can remember. Whether it was the innocent days of dressing up in a costume I’d planned months in advance or being taken trick-or-treating by my parents, or even all the fleeting memories captured inside bars and house parties years later, the 31st of October has always been far from dull. This year however, as we all know, the usual celebrations won’t be possible. But rather than sulk about what cannot be, I am trying my best to accept the situation simply for what it is: a pause on life. The more social activities of Halloween have gone on for years before this pandemic and there’s no reason to think they won’t continue once we’re out of this mess. This year, I’ve put up some Halloween decorations around the house to keep the spirit up as much as possible, but the holiday will likely be a lot more laid back and family-oriented than it has been before. Scary movies, board games, and lots of candy will likely be on the agenda. And though it isn’t what I would have expected going into this year, I am looking forward to all of it.  
HALLOWEEN CANCELLED…TWICE!Sergiy Slipchenko, Sports Editor
Halloween was not something we celebrated or even heard of in Ukraine. When my family moved to Toronto, in October of all months, I had quite the puzzling experience. I was suddenly immersed into the spooky atmosphere already well underway at school. I was already frightened of school as I didn’t know English and everything seemed foreign to me — the fact the walls were plastered with paper cutout witches, skeletons, and gravestones was not helping. Eventually I understood what the holiday was about so I was able to relax and enjoy the traditions — pounds of free candy were certainly persuasive. Although I enjoyed the holiday, it never caught on as a yearly tradition. Many years went by and I have yet to properly go trick-or-treating, until this year — or so I thought. 
My three-year-old daughter was excited to go in her Elsa dress (after some negotiation I got picked as Kristoff instead of Olaf). We planned to go out and reap free candy, and quite honestly I was excited to go out for the first time as well. Unfortunately, the news of COVID-19 resurging crushed those dreams and I was dreading how to explain to a three-year-old that it may not be safe to go this year. However, just a week before Halloween, fate did its thing and disappointment was avoided…kind of. After watching a “scary” Halloween episode of her favourite cartoon, she has condemned “Lalloween” (as she calls it) and decided we will be skipping it in favour of Christmas. So while you celebrate at home with pumpkins, scary movies, and candy, you now understand why my living room has a christmas tree, christmas music, and a strict ban on all Halloween paraphernalia. Hopefully next year the allure of candy will outweigh any fear and I will finally get to go trick-or-treating.
MY SPOOKY SEASON BIRTHDAYCéleste A. LaCroix, Arts Editor

While Halloween has been cancelled around the world, it seems like my roommates didn’t get the memo. I’m not sure if it’s their Halloween spirit or if they’re just trying to make my Halloween birthday feel special, but the second our Friends-giving dinner was over, they turned our whole house into a miniature Halloween Haunt. Believe me when I say it, theatre kids do not take decorating lightly. Halloween happens to be only a day away from my birthday, so naturally, I’ve hosted the Halloween parties every year since I stopped trick-or-treating. The only difference this year will be the size. Instead of inviting over half my program and filling my house with strangers, I’ll be celebrating both my birthday and Halloween with my roommates and girlfriend. We’ve been planning activities like pumpkin carving and costume contests because apparently the global pandemic is no match for Spooky Season. I have no doubt that this year will be different, but certainly not less special, as my friends made sure of that. 
FROM WALLOW’S EVE TO ALL HALLOWS’ EVEBhabna Banerjee, Creative Director

Fairly new to the country, the excitement of this day didn’t quite strike me for the longest time. Perhaps, it was because the holiday coincided with my father’s birthday, or that it coincided with the largest festival in my culture — each Halloween spent here meant that I was missing the two most important days of my year, thousands of miles away from my family and friends. And no surprise there, but pretty much every year, I chose to wallow. It’s clear that in my short time here I haven’t created any traditions, but after three years of avoiding this day, last Halloween I finally gave it a try to spend the day with my friends rather than alone on my couch (even though this might have been the spookier option). I commuted an hour to attend a good ol’ Village Halloween party that a group of film kids religiously hosted, and not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was also transported to the most extraordinarily decorated house (apparently film kids too, do not take set decoration lightly). To stay on-brand, we spent the night dressed as and talking about film characters, and I left quite happy after having a chance to channel my inner Cher Horowitz. Granted, this year I’ll be back to my old ways of spending the holiday cooped up on my couch alone, spooked out by absolutely everything going on outside. I now have fond memories of this holiday to hold on to, from a time that was spent here, with a new (and pretty amazing) family.

Schulich professor Murat Kristal, director of the master of business analytics program (MBAN), and director of the master of management in artificial intelligence program (MMAI) has been awarded a Minister’s Award of Excellence from the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities, for his work in developing a global COVID-19 analytics dashboard. 
The dashboard traces the dynamics of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, and is able to predict numbers of COVID-19 cases both globally, nationally, and regionally. It has allowed for a greater insight into the projected spreading of the virus, and has allowed authorized individuals to make policy and health decisions based on the evidence provided by the dashboard, which can be accessed here. This analytics dashboard projects numbers up to five days ahead of time, and is updated daily during the current pandemic. 
“We felt that it was important to provide the general public, health care professionals, and other decision makers with an analytical tool that is updated daily to provide them with accurate numbers into the near future,” Kristal explains. “We use the data that is publicly available and we update our models and results on a daily basis in order to provide an accurate picture of what’s happening around the world and in Canada.” 
The dashboard was created by Professor Kristal, Dr. Hjalmar Turesson, and David Elsner. Turesson and Elsner are both also involved in the MBAN and MMAI at Schulich School of Business. Kristal acknowledges that the recognition for both him and his team was warmly welcomed. 
“The most important thing in such a project is the team spirit, and I feel very lucky to be working with great colleagues such as Elsner, and Dr. Turesson,” says Kristal. 
    “The analytics dashboard not only helps policy makers, healthcare administrators and public officials make informed decisions about COVID-19’s spread, but is also an example of the type of cutting-edge research taking place at Schulich in business analytics and artificial intelligence.” 
Interim Dean of Schulich School of Business Detlev Zwick extended his congratulations to the minds behind the dashboard for their cutting edge work, and for their acknowledgement from the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities. 
“On behalf of the entire Schulich community, I wish to congratulate Professor Murat Kristal on receiving an Award of Excellence from the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities for the development of an analytics dashboard that provides daily insights into the spread of COVID-19 in countries around the world,” Zwick says. 
“Congratulations as well to the team at the Schulich Deloitte Cognitive Analytics and Visualization Lab, including Deloitte scientist Hjalmar Turesson and instructor David Elsner for their role in assisting with the development of the dashboard,” Zwick adds.
“The analytics dashboard not only helps policy makers, healthcare administrators and public officials make informed decisions about COVID-19’s spread,” Zwick says. “But is also an example of the type of cutting-edge research taking place at Schulich in business analytics and artificial intelligence.” 
The dashboard is now used globally, and Kristal’s goal is that it helps not only government and health officials, but also the general public make informed decisions about the ongoing pandemic. 
“I hope we are able to provide some insight to the people who are using our dashboard in these difficult times,” Kristal says.

2021-01-29,York,India,"The same monotonous routine of moving from your bed to your desk every day is a daunting thought that, this time last year, no one would have guessed to be the reality of the majority of our community only two months later. But alas, here we are — more exhausted than ever (mostly because of the mentally draining life of stagnicity), and stressed about the economy, our health, and our well-being.
Talking about mental health is now, more than ever, critical for our population. For students like Wasifa Noshin, a third-year theatre production and design student, mental health has been a prevalent concept throughout her life — something that I’m sure many students find relatable. 
“My perspective on mental health has changed quite a lot over the past few months and years,” Noshin says. “When I was younger, I would always put my mental health on the back burner even though I was simultaneously struggling with multiple mental health struggles of my own and I chose not to prioritize it.” 
With Noshin’s perspective on mental health shifting throughout her life, it begs the question of whether mental health is more prominent now, or whether it’s just talked about more. 
Assistant Professor Jeffrey Wardell, who specializes in substance-use behaviour, says that some mental disorders, such as depression, may be on the rise.
“There’s some debate as to what might account for apparent increases in the prevalence of mental disorders — it may be that the mental health issues are becoming more prevalent, but it may also be that more people feel comfortable talking about their mental health and are more likely to seek out a diagnosis and treatment because of increased awareness of these issues,” Wardell says.
In addition to this, Wardell notes that mental health disorders may be more easily recognizable than they used to be — even the definition of mental disorders has changed over time. “Overall, it’s complicated,” Wardell says, “but at the end of the day I do think there’s a greater recognition of the prevalence of mental health issues and more public discussions of these issues, which is an important change.”
“I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”
In regards to reducing stigma, Professor Marina Morrow of the faculty of health says that, in a positive sense, perhaps the reason for higher diagnoses is the “decreasing stigma around mental health for some forms of mental health problems,” most prominently with depression and anxiety. In addition to this, Morrow notes that the more normalized the language, the higher the possibility that people are “always influenced by our social and economic context,” where “people are more likely to use the language of mental health as a way of expressing any kind of distress.”
Echoing these sentiments, Professor Megan J. Davies of the department of social science, who is also involved in Madness Canada, adds, “I see a whole new focus on and interest in mental health and addictions. Though for sure there is a widespread distress now during the pandemic, I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”
For Noshin, mental health troubles stem from her busy life — something she says she has developed through societal values. “Part of the issue I think stems from the culture that I’m a part of: the hustle and grind culture — this culture promotes ambitions, yet with a huge flaw. The flaw is that our ambitions, accomplishments, and success comes at the cost of our health and mental health.
“We live in a world where being a part of this culture has resulted in me compulsively checking my emails, social media, and phone notifications at 12 a.m. instead of getting proper sleep — the stress of living up to my bar of accomplishments and having to increase it every time by coming up with new and more innovative ideas,” she adds. “Meanwhile my mind was struggling beyond repair and I just started losing it in my downtime, and lashing out at the wrong people for no reason.”
In a statement from Active Minds at York University (AM@Y), a student-run organization dedicated to providing students a safe space to talk about mental health, they say that society definitely seems to be more comfortable talking about mental health.
“Mediums like the media are normalizing mental health issues and talking about it, so that makes people more willing to talk about it as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that at the same time there is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect,” they state. 
Regarding the last year, one parched of serotonin, AM@Y adds, “Because of COVID-19, people are feeling more isolated, and this is affecting their mental health. So we would not say it is one or the other; both of these go hand in hand. There is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect and we are more willing to talk about them due to the stigma being reduced.”
Alongside this, according to a media release published by the Canadian Mental Health Association in June 2020, “the pandemic has caused intense stress and disruption for all people in Canada, and is causing pronounced mental health concerns, including suicidal thoughts and feelings, in various subgroups of the population.” 
The Canadian Mental Health Association adds that in 2019, 2.5 per cent of Canadians said they had thoughts or feelings of suicide, while in May 2020, that number rose to six per cent.
Alongside concerns of suicidal thoughts, substance abuse may be on the rise. “There is some research showing that alcohol and other substance use increased among certain individuals early in the pandemic, but again this is mixed,” Wardell says.
Wardell’s research from the early stages of the pandemic suggest that sound people decreased their alcohol consumption, “probably because they were staying home instead of going to bars and parties,” but also others increased consumption to deal with the stress of the pandemic.
The CBC recently reported that Canadians overall have increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, something that Canada’s chief of public health, Dr. Theresa Tam, noted in a statement released on December 31, 2020. 
Wardell adds that research has indicated the increase in alcohol consumption has resulted from “depression and social disconnection, as well as being a parent with young children at home, were associated with drinking to cope during the pandemic.”
He adds: “There are definitely some risk factors that may make certain individuals more susceptible to experience drug or alcohol problems during COVID-19.
In addition to the pandemic’s increased strain on Canadians, a poll conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found that the mental health of women has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. 
Morrow notes that even the women in her life are experiencing increased hardships as a result of the pandemic. “I even see it amongst a pretty privileged group at the university with my colleagues. Many of them have to be in these meetings all day long and they’ve got small children they’re trying to look after. Their partners may not be working outside of the home or may not be available to support them. They might be single single moms,” she says.
Morrow adds: “Statistically we’re seeing a lot. I think in regards to Canada, women are giving up their jobs more readily than men and more likely to take on the family responsibilities — and not just at home, but the elder care piece, I think is huge in this as well. The fact that we’ve got a heightened anxiety around our older population, it’s no doubt that women have taken on the care and the concerns on this piece.”
“Women are giving up their jobs more readily than men and more likely to take on the family responsibilities.”
But, Morrow states, other marginalized communities have also borne the brunt of the stress the pandemic has put on the population. 
“I think if you start to look at race and class into that conversation more, there’s so many people who just don’t have the option to work from home,” she says. “Many of those are women who are working in the health care sector or working as migrant workers in the fields and in agriculture, or in factories. Most sectors are also being terribly impacted, but I think it’s important to look at all those different factors to best understand the impact of the pandemic.”
Davies adds that our elderly population has also faced increased hardships, pointing out the issues of for-profit long-term care homes (LTC) in Ontario. LTC homes have been a huge topic of conversation in the media over the past year, with detrimental issues coming to light amid COVID-19. 
“Think about how elderly people with dementia are doubly disadvantaged, and consider what they might do to treat these elders like human beings,“ Davies says.
On the other side of the world, Vipul Singh, an international student remotely studying documentary and non-fiction media production at Seneca@York from his home in India, says that COVID-19 has had profound impacts on his community. 
With less regulation and more exploitation, Singh says that life has continued as normal due to fear of people losing their livelihood. 
“Most of the people were very, very stressed out and in fear of what they might lose, such as their jobs — my father included,” he says. “There is this one mindset that goes around and it’s that we have to die anyway, but it’s better to die with COVID-19 than from having an empty stomach. Some of the people I know went to work even during the lockdown.” 
Singh adds that these people would say: “If I have to die, I left because of hunger. If I do not go to work, I lose my job. And if I don’t have my job, I won’t be able to feed my family.”
With this, Singh says that his community has returned back to normal. “It does not seem as if there is a pandemic going on. There are crowds on the street, nobody actually cares about a  pandemic anymore in the area that I live, in the state that I live, because everywhere I’m going I see a lot of crowds”.
But with life returning back to normal in his community, Singh still attends classes via Zoom, despite the frustrating complication of having an unstable internet connection due to his remote town.
Singh says with his remote location, his internet isn’t necessarily strong enough to get the full experience of a successful Zoom lecture. “If somebody asks if I had to choose between offering classes in person or online classes, I would absolutely go for in-person classes because it has more benefits,” he says.
With a lack of social interaction taking hold throughout the world, Children’s Mental Health Ontario has reported that there are increased issues with youth mental health and the pandemic response. 
When asked about increased issues of mental health in students on campus, the AM@Y states they cannot be certain about the effects on the rest of the community, but note their own experiences have proved to be difficult.
The members of AM@Y have also noted uncertainties have increased their stress and anxiety levels. “We speak purely from our experiences. A lot of us feel an uncertainty due to COVID-19. There is a suspense that makes people anxious. COVID-19 is like a traumatic experience and the uncertainty of it is more likely to make us feel anxious and depressed,” they say.
“A lot of us feel an uncertainty due to COVID-19. There is a suspense that makes people anxious. COVID-19 is like a traumatic experience and the uncertainty of it is more likely to make us feel anxious and depressed.”
“There will definitely be a long-term impact to the mental health of individuals once COVID-19 is over. And like we said, people feel more of a disconnect that makes them feel isolated which affects their mental health,” AM@Y adds.
For some students, such as Noshin and Singh, studying from home hasn’t necessarily been more taxing, but it does come with its challenges.
“It has slowed me down a lot, but that’s a good thing, I think,” Noshin says. “It has really allowed me to step back from the hustle and grind lifestyle. I can really go at my own pace now and it really allowed me to spend time by myself in a productive way.”
Singh adds that, despite issues arising with online learning, staying home still hasn’t proved to be too taxing.
“In the past two or three months I have become a very relaxed person,” Singh says. “I’m the kind of person who hates to be at home everyday — so I’m used to traveling a lot, whether it is going to my friend’s house or any other place. Being at home I became lazy, to be honest.”
With the difficulties of living in a virtual world, AM@Y says working remotely has made it difficult to gauge the impact COVID-19 has had on the York community.
“There have always been mental health issues, and because of COVID-19, there have been more factors that add on to pre-existing mental health issues,” they say. “However, we cannot speak with certainty that students have been facing more mental health issues as we have not been able to reach students that easily because of the online system.”
Davies says that moving forward there is still room for improvement, in language, such as the stigmatization of the word ‘crazy,’ but also treating those with mental health disorders better. 
“I think overall the greater openness to talking about mental health is really helpful. The stigma is less, but the discrimination against people with mental health differences is no less at all,” Davies says. “They are still largely excluded from the labour market, have difficulty finding housing, and don’t even get me started on how we treat our elders with dementia.”
AM@Y adds that, going forward, they ask the community to be more open in the conversation about mental health. “People should know they are not alone in the issues they are struggling with. Another thing to point out is that if you are speaking to someone it is important to be empathetic towards others’ experiences and not to be judgemental or insensitive. It is important to be open and accepting,” they say.
“Also, it is important to understand that just even letting people know you’re there for them is such a big gesture. Everyone’s experiences are valid and real. Some mental health issues can present very differently in different people,” they add.
Noshin concurs, adding that everyone is facing their own battles, “and they may not be vocal about it.”
With everything moved online, Noshin says she dedicates some personal time to help relieve her stress. 
“Some of my outlets include journaling, reading, and catching up with friends,” Noshin says. “I really just try to do things that put a smile on my face and ease my mind.”
Singh adds that to relieve stress he catches up with old friends, and tries to stay as busy as possible. “I play games, and I started reading a book. I research a lot of books, and then I start reading them.”
While students may have some outlets for relieving stress, there are still resources available for those who need them. 
Wardell encourages more open discussions about mental health and addiction, as it “is important to raise awareness and decrease stigma around these issues. 
He adds, “I would want readers to know that if they are struggling with their own mental health or substance use that they are not alone. For students who need someone to talk to, I would recommend the Good2Talk helpline, which provides confidential support services for students dealing with mental health concerns. They can be reached 24/7 at 1-866-925-5454.”
Stephanie Chung, policy, program evaluation, and data analyst for Student Counselling, Health & Well-being, says their services, while online, are still available for the community. 
“Student Counselling, Health & Well-being continues to provide service online since the shift to remote service provision in March of 2020,” Chung says “Our reception staff are available on a live phone line, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to support students with general inquiries and setting up meetings with counsellors. Students can access workshops, support groups, and individual counselling sessions through a confidential and secure audio/video platform.”

Chemotherapy is the most common and widely known type of cancer treatment. It is, however, not always the best approach for all patients. Dr. Sergey Krylov, a chemistry professor and researcher at York, is conducting groundbreaking research into chemoresistance, which would help predict whether or not cancer patients will resist chemotherapy and tailor their treatment plans to match.
Some patients may have a pre-existing resistance to chemotherapy, or their tumour may develop a resistance to it over time. Ways to predict this chemoresistance have been sought after by researchers for decades, but there simply haven’t been many reliable methods for most types of cancer. Krylov’s research may be part of the answer.
Research into predictors for ovarian cancer is where Krylov begins. “The reason for choosing ovarian cancer is that we anticipate great potential benefits for patients. Currently, near 3,000 women are annually diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Canada,” he says. 
According to Krylov, most of these women are treated with a chemotherapy drug called platinum-taxane, which also has severe side effects. As of now, 25 per cent of the women treated with chemotherapy experience chemoresistance.
“Ovarian cancer is a very deadly disease, and chemoresistance is an important contributor to the low survival rate of patients in the advanced stages. Developing methods to detect chemoresistance will help doctors choose the appropriate treatments for patients,” adds York biology professor Chun Peng, who is working in collaboration with Krylov.
Their research has determined the best strategy to measure the population of drug-resistant cells. Determining the amount of cells in the body that are drug-degrading and drug-extruding will provide a better understanding of how to treat someone with ovarian cancer. 
Currently, the research is undergoing a feasibility study to determine the likelihood of completing the research successfully. 
Krylov’s future plans are to apply his research to a clinical setting. “We will apply this technology for identification and validation of a predictor of ovarian cancer chemoresistance to primary platinum/taxane chemotherapy, which is the first-line treatment for all patients with advanced ovarian cancer.”
Krylov and his team have been carrying out this research for 10 years, and his team has made major advancements. Working with the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, they have the opportunity to study and apply their research to tissues from various ovarian cancer patients, which will play a role in further developing predictors. 
While the predictors for ovarian cancer patients are major discoveries, they are not applicable to other types of cancers. However, they hope to change this soon.
“We are developing a new technology for development of chemoresistance predictors. It will be applicable to all cancers, in which chemoresistance is driven by drug extrusion from cells and drug degradation,” says Krylov.
Krylov and his team’s research could be revolutionary, but he warns that the process will be a group effort. In an interview with Brainstorm, Krylov urged other researchers to join in: “I hope I can convince a good group of researchers to join us; I hope to create a little wave, and that the wave would grow, and more and more people would join this effort.”

2021-02-25,York,India,"The endangered species list unfortunately gains a new member, as conservationists warn that the milking of the Sonoran Desert Toad is threatening the survival of the species. 
This enchanted toad, also referred to as the Colorado River toad, is typically found in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. This peaceful, stone-like creature usually lives between 10 to 20 years and can grow up to 19 centimetres, making it the largest toad in the U.S. The psychoactive excretion found in the toad is so strong that dogs who have attacked one have suffered paralysis and even death. 
The property found in the secretions that results in the desired effects is known as 5-MeO-DMT — a potent hallucinogenic compound that produces intense effects such as euphoria and powerful auditory and visual hallucinations. Some studies have even suggested long term use of the compound can help treat anxiety and depression. 
“I think it’s really interesting that a lot of psychedelics are now being brought into the mental health field. Anxiety and depression are very common issues for people of all different backgrounds, and I would love to see more expansion into issues such as PTSD,” says fourth-year health studies student Ameek Singh. 
The psychedelically-inclined have also been orally ingesting toad secretions for quite some time now, with the term toad licking being coined to describe a dangerous phenomenon.
Toad licking dates back to 1983 when a man named Ken Nelson, who supposedly was the first person ever to consume the compound in this format, did so and circulated a pamphlet detailing his experiences and the effects the drug had. This soon sparked interest in others to try it as well, and it slowly gained popularity. 
Some claim the slime found in the toad was used in various Mesoamerican ceremonies and rituals, yet direct and reliable evidence for this has not found its way to scientists, who generally agree that Nelson was the first human to consume it. 
The toad’s habitat has been greatly threatened in recent decades by those seeking a psychedelic experience, resulting in the species disappearing almost completely from California. The seeking of an otherworldly experience by our fellow human beings is resulting in toads being overmilked, jeopardizing their survival.
Glen Kelly, a third-year electrical engineering student who has dabbled in a psychedelic experience, does not see why it would be hard for people to put the toads’ lives first before they think about indulging. 
“There are so many other psychedelics out there for those insisting on the experience — I really don’t see why anyone would get hung up on specifically wanting 5-MeO-DMT from a toad, especially if they’re being endangered.”
Hope is not lost, however, for those still vying for the effects of 5-MeO-DMT. As it turns out, the compound can be manufactured in a laboratory as a synthetic alternative. A fairly recent study in the ACS Omega Journal shows us that the new method for synthesizing the substance is 99.86 per cent pure. 
So, if you happen to one day find yourself stumbling on the Sonoran Desert toad for whatever reason, take a moment to admire it, maybe even get a picture — but for the sake of the species and even yourself, please don’t lick it.

Licking the toad is not how it’s consumed. That’s not how it’s described by Nelson in his pamphlet and it’s not how it’s used widespread today or ever. In fact that method of injesting the secretion is extremely dangerous, as it contains cardiotoxic steroids. These are burned off when it’s smoked, which is the manner in which it’s used. Guess you should stay in college a little longer. Or maybe learn how to research. Regardless of your intentions of this article, which may be well and good, your blatent disregard of the truth could very well result in someone’s death. Congratulations.
The mistakes in this article can literally kill someone if they take it seriously.. Licking toads is not a real thing and will get someone harmed or killed.
Please understand that you have not done your due dilligence in research on mesoamerican usage of the toad. It is obvious as you are repeating the last guy’s article. There is proof thousands if not millions of years of proof. Please be a journalist not a repeater.
It’s not orally active moron. 
In September 2020, the Parliament of India passed three bills that aimed to reform the country’s agricultural sector. These laws were protested by farmers’ unions mainly due to the lack of provisions for a minimum support price — a policy that guarantees farmers a minimum price for their produce, unaffected by market demand. Since then, massive protests consisting of thousands of people have been organized by agricultural workers, demanding that these bills be repealed.
These protests have so far claimed the lives of many people and resulted in frequent internet shutdowns and hundreds of arrests by the government. The Indian government’s response has raised concerns regarding the erosion of democratic institutions in India and the curtailing of press freedoms.
The Indian community, including the Indian diaspora in Canada and elsewhere, have had varied reactions to the protests, indicative of the increasing polarization of Indian politics since the ascension of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in 2014.
S.H., an Indian international student who requested to remain anonymous, says the protests have further amplified political divides and have even cost them a few friendships.
“Thanks to the brainwashing done by the ‘Godi media’, meaning lapdog media, a lot of my Indian friends believe that protesting is an anti-national activity, and speaking against a party is speaking against India and its people.” 
S.H. adds they are often on the receiving end of hate and slurs when they speak out against these policies.
S.H. further explains they were surprised that Sikhs in particular were being targeted by the government, “Despite seeing last year’s anti-CAA NRC protests, which were protesting Islamophobic laws, being met with violence and brutality. I was surprised that even the Sikh minority would be a target of vilification,” they say. 
As the majority of the protests have occurred in the states of Punjab and Haryana, home to majority of the country’s Sikh population, Sikh farmers participating in the protests have been branded separatists by government officials, threatening to undermine support for the farmers. 
Sikh-Canadians, who make up a sizable minority of the Indian community in Canada, are worried that this rhetoric may lead to anti-Sikh violence. 
“I know a Sikh who regularly goes to protests and helps feed the old farmers. She’s has been speaking out about how people online have been calling for genocide against her people and calling her slurs,” S.H. says.
“I remember how horrifying it was seeing my university peers using ethnic slurs during NRC-CAA protests, it is not pleasant at all,” they continue. “This just shows how the ruling party’s niche likeable group gets smaller and smaller depending on the situation, and any opposition is hated with ferocity.”
“There’s a big fear that this protest or this agitation could end up like 1984,” B.C. resident Sukhdeep Singh told Global News, referencing the massacre of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Similar protests have sprung up in Canada in solidarity with the Indian farmers. Sikh-Canadians across the country with ties to Sikh farmers in India have called on the Canadian government to take further action and support the protesters. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has affirmed the farmers’ right to protest. “Canada will always stand up for the right of peaceful protest anywhere around the world, and we’re pleased to see moves toward de-escalation and dialogue,” Trudeau said according to CBC News, which may complicate an already tense relationship with Prime Minister Modi.

2021-05-17,York,India,"International students have faced increased uncertainty since Premier Doug Ford announced his call to close Canada’s borders to them in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
While the measure hasn’t been put in place, the B.1.617 variant, which originated in India, resulted in Canada halting flights from Pakistan and India, impacting international students from those countries, including Vipul Singh.
Singh, a documentary and non-fiction media production (DNM) student at Seneca@York was due to arrive in Canada to complete camera and sound training in person during the summer semester. However, due to the shutdowns, he remains in India. 
“We have spent so much money and time, and students choose a Canadian college or university so that they can experience the campus life in Canada,” he says. “The majority of students will not be happy taking the online classes, myself included.”
Like many other international students, Singh pays higher tuition to attend school. “I don’t want to pay $25,000 to study online,” he adds.
Oshee Johri, also a DNM student, arrived from India shortly before the shutdowns began. Her biggest concerns before coming to Canada were mainly financial.
“I was going crazy until I came here because there are too many monetary implications,” she says. “The mandatory three day hotels we have to quarantine in will never refund the money in case our flight is cancelled or the government bans travel. That’s crazy — $1,400 is around ₹1,000,000 for us. That’s a huge loss.”
Singh agrees, stating, “International students go through so much stress and risk by paying increased college fees, putting money towards a Guaranteed Investment Certificate, and paying for the 14-day mandatory quarantine.”
According to a joint statement provided by Ford and MPP Ross Romano, minister of colleges and universities, the Ontario government hasn’t made a formal request to ban international students. “We look forward to the federal government providing solutions to reduce the importation of cases and introduction of variants into Canada,” the statement said.
Johri says while the situation in India is dire, the measures put in place to protect Canada from incoming variants have been extensive. “We are tested three times before we are allowed out of quarantine,” she says.
However, Johri agrees the situation is hard to gauge, with some reports of the B.1.617 variants going undetected in tests. “It’s really a diabolical situation for countries and their leaders,” she says.
Ford and Romano’s statement adds that they are mainly concerned the current travel restrictions are not enough. “Ninety per cent of all cases in Ontario are caused by a variant of concern,” they said. 
“The variants of COVID-19 driving our third wave are a direct result of weak measures at our borders, which is why we have been calling on the federal government to take a number of additional steps to address this situation.” 
The Ontario government has also asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ban all non-essential travel, implement mandatory PCR testing for interprovincial travel, and close the loophole at the land border with a three-day quarantine.

2021-06-21,York,India,"Ontario continues to report below 400 new COVID-19 cases for the seventh day in a row, with 270 new cases as of Monday, June 21 — the lowest daily count in more than nine months. The Ministry of Health reported over the weekend that this big decline in case numbers has resulted in a provincial positivity rate of 1.4 per cent. 
This relief in cases can be most appreciated within our hospitals, as COVID-19 hospitalizations saw a drop from 378 on Friday to 336 patients being cared for as of Saturday. Of these patients, 335 are in ICUs and 221 are currently requiring a ventilator to assist in breathing. 
“Where I work, critically unstable hematology patients requiring ICU admissions for care were having to be triaged in order for them to receive care, sometimes outside of a formal ICU setting due to all the COVID-19 cases we had to take care of,” says Anju Vyas, a pharmacist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.
“I’ve never witnessed such an acute demand on an already strained nursing, physician and other allied health care staff resource pool.” 
The downtrend of case numbers has allowed us to enjoy some freedoms again, as Stage 1 of reopenings began on June 11. This first stage — afforded to us as 60 per cent of adults received one dose — means we can once again gather outdoors with up to 10 people, visit patios, dine with up to four people per table, and shop at non-essential and essential businesses within 15 and 25 per cent capacity respectively. Additional details on what is currently permitted can be found on Ontario’s COVID-19 website. 
Stage 2, set to begin once 70 per cent of adults have received one dose and 20 per cent of Ontario is fully vaccinated, will expand outdoor gatherings to 25 people and indoor ones to five people while patio tables will see an increase to six people. 
Non-essential retail capacity will also move up to 25 per cent. Amusement parks, town fairs, water parks, sports leagues, and cinemas will be permitted to open during this stage as well. The government states that each stage will be active for at least 21 days before moving onto the next. 
As of Monday, 20 per cent of Ontarians have been fully vaccinated — the mark needed to move to the second stage. The province has also announced that it will be moving up second dose appointments for a number of groups shortly, and by June 28 all adults will have the opportunity to get their second dose. 
What remains concerning, however, is the highly transmissible variants currently circulating around the world. Ontario health officials have identified approximately 400 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 variants, the majority of which appear to be the Alpha variant first discovered in the United Kingdom. 
“With more and more people starting to get vaccinated, I feel safer than I have in a long time. I am, however, concerned with whether or not the vaccines will be able to protect us against the Delta variant,” says third-year health science student Marc Delado. 
The Delta variant, first found in India, also remains at large. Last week, Canada saw a 66 per cent increase in COVID-19 cases attributed to the Delta variant, with case counts totaling just over 2,000 as of Friday, June 18. The Delta hotspot list also has some new additions and now includes Toronto, Peel Region, York Region, Waterloo, Porcupine, Halton Region, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Durham, Hamilton and Simcoe Muskoka. 
“Recent numbers suggest that two doses of the vaccine are still fairly effective against combatting this variant, however, there is still a clear decline in the effectiveness in comparison to combatting the Alpha variant,” says Swar Shah, a first-year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. 
“For example, the Pfizer vaccine has been stated in a recent study to be 92 per cent effective against the Alpha variant, but 79 per cent against the Delta. However, it is undeniable that the progression of vaccination in Canada is comforting, and I would not believe that any additional measures would need to be taken at this time,” says Shah. 
While accelerated appointment availability has been offered to these locations, it has unfortunately not been followed up with an increased share of vaccine supply. 
The Waterloo Region has been hit particularly hard with the Delta variant, with Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang stating that residents should assume it is the “dominant strain circulating in the region.” 
Proxy data for the region has led health officials to believe that 65 per cent of cases between June 6 and 12 were the Delta variant. 
“I believe that our hope in controlling the Delta variant lies in not backing off on our current vaccination efforts, including appropriate allocation to existing and upcoming hotspots,” says Vyas. 
Ontario and Canada as a whole continue to make solid progress in combatting the pandemic, however, factors like the variants serve as a reminder that it is still far from over. The safest course of action remains following health guidelines such as regularly washing our hands, wearing masks, and maintaining social distance while also staying within the current regulations of Stage 1.

2021-07-16,York,India,"Staying hydrated is fairly standard medical advice that most of us have become accustomed to hearing. After all, with water making up around 60 per cent of our body, it would seem only logical. 
But for a select few, water may carry more of a risk than benefit. Aquagenic pruritus is a skin condition “characterized by the development of severe itching on contact with water without observable skin lesions,” according to the Indian Journal of Dermatology.
Aquagenic Pruritus is officially classified as a rare disease. The exact percentage of people with it is difficult to narrow down as it varies greatly between populations, but the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center states that the disease ranges “between 1.4 per cent to 24 per cent across different populations at any given point in time.”
“Rare diseases often don’t get the funding they require in order to research them further because resources are allocated towards conditions that affect a larger number of people,” says third-year health sciences student Akanksha Patel.
“While this is a good thing, it unfortunately means that those with conditions that are far less common often don’t get the answers they’re looking for,” says Patel.
The onset of this allergy typically begins immediately after skin contact with water of any temperature and can last for an hour or more. It can be so difficult for some to manage that it creates a psychological aversion to bathing.
The condition results in intense itching and irritation in parts of the body that come into contact with water. Most commonly affected are the legs, arms, chest, back, and abdomen. The head, neck, face, and hips rarely exhibit symptoms.
This condition may sometimes be a symptom of polycythemia vera — a form of blood cancer that results in the excessive creation of red blood cells by the bone marrow. 
Links have also been found to other conditions such as hepatitis C infections, T-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome among other serious diseases. 
“Aquagenic pruritus definitely appears to be highly represented among those with polycythemia vera. Studies have shown that as many as approximately 40 to 50 per cent of those with the blood cancer also show symptoms of this skin condition,” says Swar Shah, a first-year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. 
As for why such a condition would develop in the first place, though there are some hereditary links, an official cause remains unknown. 
Researchers have, however, suggested possible causes that could lead to more knowledge of the ‘why’ behind this disease in the future. 
Proposed causes include increased mast cell degranulation, which means granules of excessive histamine and other compounds are being released into the body by mast cells (a key cell in the functioning of the immune system).
Another suggestion is the release of acetylcholine, a compound in the body that “sends signals from nerves to muscles and between nerves in the brain.” 
The disease may also potentially be tied to increased skin fibrinolytic activity, during which the breakdown of clots in the skin are accelerated. 
There is no specific test to determine if one may suffer from the condition, and diagnosis is typically based on ruling out other possible conditions. 
Generally speaking, however, if an individual encounters severe itching or burning consistently when in the contact of water, has no visible skin manifestations, reacts within 10 minutes to two hours of exposure and lacks any other skin condition, aquagenic pruritus may be considered. 
As for treatments, there is no singular approach to alleviating one’s symptoms. There have been several treatments used all with varying degrees of success including using skin softeners that repel water, antihistamines and the use of tight-fitting Lycra clothing. 
A full list of possible treatments can be found here.

2022-02-19,York,India,"To Begin — It’s a ‘We’ Thing
“Racism is relational.” 
This is the astoundingly pervasive phrase that Jennisha Wilson, Senior Manager of Anti-Racism Response at University of Waterloo, repeatedly uses during our conversation about progress made in the fight against racism over the previous year. 
Before delving deeper into the discussion of the progress made by York in its fight against racism, as well as the abundant wisdom that Wilson has to offer in my conversation with her, I would like to issue a reminder of sorts, as to why our battle against racism is so important: Racism is not to be taken lightly, for it has taken lives.
As we honour this Black History Month, we must remember that Dr. Martin Luther King did not sacrifice himself to save Black Americans from America’s sins — he was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for himself and his people. 
The same applies to George Floyd: He did not sacrifice himself to offer the world a revelation as to the insidious nature of America’s policing — he was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for himself and his family. He had just taken on a new job and was in the process of turning his life around to better provide for his daughter, whom he so greatly loved.
The same applies to Breonna Taylor: She did not give her life for our enlightenment — she was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for herself and her patients. She was a nurse who had recently taken on longer hours and shifts to aid in the fight against COVID-19 and was killed while in her own home trying to catch rest for her next shift.
I put it to you that Black History Month should not be the designated time only for a celebration of Black people — Black excellence is something to be celebrated all year round. Neither is it appropriate that in this month we only glamorize our efforts to make a change. Instead, we should consider it a time for honest reflection and transparency, to see that our university incorporates the very same systems that perpetuate the oppression of Black individuals all around the world, and this is something that it is actively working to address. 
But when addressing these issues, what should be counted as true progress?
True Progress — A Definition
It is crucial that Black, Indigenous, and racialized individuals be at the forefront of the conversation around racism, seeing as oppression is their story, and no one can speak to what progress is better than those who are most affected by it. 
Wilson identifies as a Black woman, stating that she was born and raised by two parents who are immigrants to Canada from Jamaica, continuing to say, “My dad is Black, and my mom is Indian, and I think it’s really important to contextualize where I’m coming from as a settler — a racialized settler to Turtle Island — to understand what progress would look like in this particular context.” 
In reflecting on the progress made by our own university in terms of enforcing racial inclusivity, it is imperative that we define what true progress is within this context.
When asked about what she considered to be true progress, Wilson states that “racial inclusivity and progress would essentially be summed up when individuals can be their true authentic selves in spaces, feel heard, have really good health and outcomes for their communities, and when conversations around racial justice are not situated around the basic needs that people need to survive in life. 
“If we’re having conversations around basic human rights — which are things that we need to survive — we can’t even get to the place of having conversations around how we thrive, how we build, how we transform spaces in a way that allow our communities to really flourish,” Wilson continues.
York’s Efforts — A Rundown
In keeping with the collective strive that has been made by general society to correct its ways in dealing with race, York has made a concerted effort in the past year to improve circumstances for students, teachers, and staff alike. 
As detailed in a joint statement made by President Lenton and Vice President of Equity, People and Culture, Sheila Cote-Meek, York’s plans to achieve a racially inclusive environment include, but are not limited to “hiring a minimum of 12 new Black faculty members by 2023, creating a new physical space to facilitate meetings among Black faculty, staff and students, increasing funding for scholarships, bursaries and other forms of financial aid in support of Black students, and establishing a new, culturally safe tool for complaints about racial discrimination and harassment, available in English and French.”
These plans were made in March 2021 during what was considered a wildly successful virtual town hall. In keeping with what Vice-Provost of Students Lucy Fromowitz outlined in a summer 2020 statement wherein she implored the York community to “listen closely before we act.” This town hall was held after consultations with over 200 Black community members. 
In the same statement, it is outlined the goals that York has already achieved in this plan, including the following: “Twelve new Black faculty members have been welcomed to the university, with one additional Black faculty member confirmed for 2022, $150,000 has been committed to support Black scholars in 2021-22, and consultation has begun on the formation of a funding program for Black scholars, with the goal to launch by early 2022.” 
The statement added that as part of a $2.25-million commitment over the next three years to advance equity, diversity, and inclusion through community engagement and research activities, “$50,000 per year has been committed to Black community engagement projects and $250,000 per year to Black research and knowledge mobilization projects, beginning in 2022.” 
“The Department of Community Safety has taken steps to undertake a review of services and to explore alternative community safety models,” the statement also said, adding that the The Centre for Human Rights, Equity and Inclusion will continue to offer its Anti-Racism Training to community members.
So, Did YU Do It…Right?
The list of changes that have already been made within our university sounds, to be frank, impressive. 
The very fact that the town hall was held with the consideration of the opinions of 200 Black folks from our university is a sign that York is paying more attention to Black voices, which is keeping with the notion that Black, Indigenous, and racialized individuals must be the ones at the forefront of this conversation.
The hiring of 12 new faculty members means more skilled and talented Black folks getting a stable income — this is money that more than likely gets funneled back into Black families and communities.
The establishment of the Black Excellence at York University (BE YU) mentorship program is also a definite plus as it serves as a safe space for incoming Black students to learn and grow from older students who know what it’s like to be in their shoes. This is most definitely worthy of celebration, isn’t it? 
And let’s not forget the funding of projects within Black communities, as well as the lending of further support to Black scholars — these are all wins, are they not?
While these changes sound — and are — impressive, they cannot fundamentally resolve any issues regarding racism because they are what Wilson defines as “add-ons.” In responding to a question about the changes being made within the City of Toronto, Wilson articulates that “the work that they’re doing there is really important and impactful; it has an impact for the community. But when I think about what’s truly needed to address racism, it requires a transformation of the entire system, not just add-ons.” 
She further proposes that “the reality is that to address the fundamental issues of racism that we’re experiencing, it requires an entire overhaul and transformation of culture and policies, procedures and how we operate.” 
Moving forward, structural changes need to be made, or else the ‘progress’ made will not last.
In an announcement made in September 2020 by York’s AMPD sector titled ‘AMPD’s Commitment to Equity,’ it is detailed that the AMPD department intends to enforce “Diversity in Faculty Hiring, Increasing BIPOC Student Support, Ongoing Anti-Oppression, Anti-Racism Training,” and more. These changes are all well-intentioned, but to what extent have these changes been implemented effectively by the department, and to what extent are these changes even effective to begin with?
A Black AMPD student — who wishes to remain anonymous — gave a detailed response as to what their experience has been at York and within the AMPD department, going as far as to explain how York could make more meaningful improvements. 
The student says that while they can’t speak for all of AMPD, they have felt safe on campus with some of the initiatives made at York in the past years. “For example, the changes made in course materials provide a better-rounded education that is more inclusive of BIPOC theatre history in North America,” they say. 
“But I still think that we have quite a long way to go in terms of decolonizing the curriculum. Combatting racism has to go outside of the curriculum and into the daily lives of students, and part of that is having BIPOC instructors in our learning spaces. Students need to be able to see what their lives could potentially look like, specifically in the production area. I’ve noticed that when first-year BIPOC students are making their choice to stream, more go into acting conservatory or devised theatre, and rarely do they go into production.”
The student adds that they believe an important part of these choices have to do with the lack of instructors that look like them and that they can relate to.
“You see a lot of Black actors and performers in the media, but never really see any who work in the background as production managers or sound designers or video editors. And I think it would be beneficial to have more BIPOC instructors in the space to show them that doing production work is a viable career,” they conclude.
This student’s response echoes the previous motion that structural changes need to be made.
Further evidence of this is the act of vandalism on York’s Keele Campus in January, in which “deliberate damage was caused to Skennen’kó:wa Gamig,” as stated in a York wide email sent out by Lenton. The fact that we are still dealing with racially motivated acts of vandalism on our campus is a clear sign that we still have a long way to go.
We Must Embrace Proactive Strategies
We have added on new initiatives, bursaries, and racialized faculty. We acknowledge that we are visitors on this land and that change needs to be made. We have been responding to the tragedies of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery. 
But responsive strategies can only take us so far.
“The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions.”
There are no two ways about the fact that we have indeed taken steps forward, as a university organization, and as a community. But the only way we can truly make lasting progress from here on out is to embrace proactive strategies.
When addressing the basis of her position as Senior Manager of Anti-Racism Response, Wilson notes that the existence of her job serves as a starting place. 
“The problem with creating these roles is that they often become glamorized. They often become seen as ‘this is the solution to all our issues’ when I — as one person doing an anti-racism response — can never be the solution. The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions. 
“I think that there is value and purpose in these roles needing to exist right now because racism is real; it is hurtful,” adds Wilson. “It is impacting Black people, Indigenous people, and racialized people on a daily basis. However, it’s not the end-all-be-all. So, when someone says, ‘our solution to the problem is to create this role to respond to racism’ that tells me that clearly there is not enough understanding of what needs to happen in order for there to be true transformation to implement anti-racism work and to do that work fully.”
The most proactive thing our university can do is look inward and change its structure so that it truly embraces and enforces the elevation of Black, Indigenous, and racialized students, staff, and professors. 
We as individuals must also embrace the proactive strategy of honest reflection, as it inevitably leads to honest and lasting change. By establishing a lasting change within ourselves and our communities, we can better engage with one another, whether we are the oppressors or the oppressed. This engagement results in the cultivating of meaningful relationships with each other — and isn’t this truly the answer to winning this fight? 
Racism truly is relational, so, hand-in-hand, let’s continue to push forward for better together here at York.
A special thanks to Jennisha Wilson for entertaining my questions and lending her time, as well as to the student who willingly contributed their voice to this article. From one York community member to another, I wish you a reflective Black History Month.

2022-10-21,York,India,"Have you ever turned on the TV and noticed that a white actor is playing the role of a BIPOC character? Or, maybe you’ve noticed that BIPOC characters are not included whatsoever in a story or series where they should be?
This is whitewashing.
Merriam Webster’s dictionary describes ‘to whitewash’ as altering something in a way that favours, features, or caters to white people. As an example, this might be portraying something in a way that increases the prominence, relevance, or impact of white people and minimising or misrepresenting BIPOC people.
“The erasure of Black, Indigenous and Asian people — especially the darker skinned people within these groups — in order to centre whiteness, is something that I have witnessed countless times,” says Aysha Campbell, a masters student in the department of humanities with a research focus in Black studies. Campbell is specialising in the use of sound and space to depict Black life within literature.
Pratik Virwani, a first-year student studying public relations, says that, “whitewashing, I believe, is more common when it comes to politicians and the side that the news channels are inclined towards. The most common cases and widely used scenarios are when a news channel majorly focuses their coverage on an external event if something negative surfaces about the side they support, instigating ignorance.”
Evidence of whitewashing is not difficult to find when looking at the statistics — 52 per cent of the members of parliament in Canada are comprised of white males, while they only make up 36 per cent of the population. In an article published by The McGill International Review in 2020, it was found that less than 15 per cent of staff at CBC were BIPOC. 
“I feel like white washing is very prevalent in historical and contemporary western cultures and media,” says Campbell. “The fact that I read and watched The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo in and outside of school growing up and I never found out that the author, Alexandre Dumas, was a black man until I was an adult is an example of whitewashing.” 
Along with politics and journalism, Hollywood films are notorious for whitewashing. As an example, Mickey Rooney, a white actor, played Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961). The role is described as “horribly racist” through Rooney’s over portrayal of stereotypes. Despite being a white actress, Emma Stone played the role of Allison Ng in Aloha (2015), a character who described herself as being a quarter Hawaiian and a quarter Chinese.
Olivia McClymont, a second-year education student, explains that, “a big example of whitewashing is the overwhelming negative reaction to the new live-action The Little Mermaid being played by a woman of colour instead of someone who is white. Some people are claiming the character as ‘their princess’. The fact that it matters a lot to the community that she can’t be Black is ridiculous.”
The Little Mermaid (1989), a popular animated Disney film about, well, a mermaid, is fictional. Ariel is quite literally a mythical creature who has a tail — part of what makes myths and fairy tales so important is that they become cultural products, reflective of our own social evolution. 
Campbell says that, “the type of erasure that occurs when whitewashing is demoralising to communities of colour because it tells Black people, Indigenous people, Asian people, and other people of the global minority that they are not worthy to be at the centre, to be seen, or to tell their own stories. The lack of representation also hinders the imagination of children of colour when they don’t get to see themselves in the media they are being offered.”
“Less subtle and more overt examples are the use of white actors to play the roles of characters or depictions of real life Black, Asian or Indigenous people in cinema and TV,” adds Campbell.  “More recently with TikTok, we have black creators making viral dance trends and white creators copying them, becoming the face of these trends, and getting the credit for them.”
Sheldon Pearce’s article, “The Whitewashing of Black Music on TikTok” published by The New Yorker in 2020, discusses just how prevalent the whitewashing of Black art, specifically music, is on TikTok. They also consider how “the optics play into a long, infamous history of white appropriation of Black arts.”
Campbell explains that, “the impact that whitewashing has on the financial gains of people of colour can be seen with TikTok and the likes of Addison Rae and Charli D’Amelio, who rose to fame and riches off doing dances and not giving credit to the Black dancers who created them — like Jalaiah Harmon and her Renegade dance —ultimately denying Black creators access to the money, fame, and sponsorship deals they were getting off of doing those dances.”
Along with music and dance, whitewashing can also be found in various fashion or makeup trends, including the “clean girl aesthetic”.
The clean girl aesthetic, as explained by Nena Lezama in their article “Why the #CleanGirlAesthetic TikTok Trend is Problematic” is a tightly slicked back bun with hair parted in the middle. The look is completed by adding simple gold jewellery accessories, such as hooped earrings or necklaces. This look has been garnered by famous influencers and celebrities, such as Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber, and Kendall Jenner.
By becoming a trend, it implies that this look is something new and innovative — but, it’s been rocked by women of colour for decades.
“This phenomenon with TikTok is not new but part of a long history of white people appropriating Black cultural production and getting the recognition and money off it while the Black creators are erased from history,” explained Campbell.
Major fashion companies, such as Louis Vuitton, are exploiting the keffiyeh, a scarf that has become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism, as a high-end fashion item. Meanwhile, individuals are suffering due to political unrest in the Middle East.
Sarah Ayoub, a fourth-year film and media arts student, says that, “I notice in the media how the keffiyeh is being seen. What once was a symbol of resistance for my people is now being portrayed as a fashion symbol that people wear without knowing the meaning of. My family will wear a keffiyeh during the war, but people will wear it as a cool pattern and don’t know why we wear it, nor what it means.”
“In the fashion world, women are able to wear a scarf over their head and it’s seen as peak fashion, but when I wear the hijab, I get called names and people assume I don’t speak English or that I’m oppressed,” adds Ayoub.
What’s more, religious clothing has historically been stigmatised and persecuted. In countries such as France, Denmark, and India, the hijab has been banned while headscarves flooded runways this past spring.
“Whitewashing is harmful because the history of these issues gets erased,” continues Ayoub. “When hijabs become just a scarf and no longer a piece of clothing women use for modesty, and keffiyehs become just a pattern being sold by Gucci and Shein, our history gets erased.”
Whitewashing even goes as far as to impede on the wellness industry.
Reema Kumar, a first-year environmental engineer and biology PhD student says, “I was born and brought up in India and have observed numerous traditions and cultures across the country. After social media took over, I saw a lot of these practices being altered according to the West. Indeed, there is a lot to aspire to, however, certain traditional practices fade away in the masses,” 
Kumar explains that, “yoga and meditation are often ‘sold’ as different products. However, because of the lack of clear understanding of yoga, people are unaware that one is a part of the other. Yoga has been practised in the Indian subcontinent for ages, long before globalisation. 
“There are numerous aspects to it, and it is not just exercising. It is indeed a great practice of inclusion in one’s life, but a thorough knowledge would bring a lot more wonders than picking up just a few points out of it.”
Nabihah Parkar, in their article published by the Huffington Post in 2022, explains how a yoga teacher was banned from using Sanskrit terms in their practices, as well as chanting “Om” or saying “Namaste.” In addition, there is a general lack of representation of BIPOC yoga teachers in Canada.
“Everytime I see these occurrences happen, I experience a mixed bag of emotions: frustration, anger, disappointment, annoyance, and even resignation because it’s been happening for so long and so often,” says Campbell. “Even as I’m discussing this topic now, I’m getting heated because of the harm this racist practice causes Black communities and communities of colour.”
Unfortunately, these examples only scratch the surface of where whitewashing might be experienced. Ayoub further encourages consumers to critically assess items and educate themselves before making purchases. 
“Ask yourself, is this new or have I just seen this on a different skin tone? Is this new or might this have a history behind it, and how can I educate myself?”
“Whitewashing is a way of diminishing the meaning behind something in one’s culture. Everyone’s culture and background matters, so the fact that someone could think that theirs is more important than anyone else’s is wrong, especially when they claim things that are not theirs to own,” explains McClymont.
Kumar adds to McClymont’s thoughts, saying that there is a vast variety of cultures and traditions in the world and many experiences to be had. “If everything gets seen or experienced from one perspective, we lose the authenticity of it. It’s true that we share our experiences but imposing our perspectives as the ultimate truth does injustice to the original experience,” says Kumar.
While adverse impacts of whitewashing are evident in various forms, it is important to have an open mind, stay informed, and to be aware of the harm that it causes.
“People need to gain information from various perspectives, even outside their scope of learning,” says Virwani. “Most things taught during our childhood may turn out to be wrong as there is new research and evidence surfacing everyday, so it is important to keep an open mind.” 
“It is important to develop an understanding about anything you see around you, even if it doesn’t concern you at the moment, it might hold some relevance or connection to a part of your life. Ultimately, and most importantly, don’t judge people or information blindly, negative or positive,” continues Virwani.
We must remember to approach new (and already established) ideas with an open mind, always being ready to learn and to show respect to one another. Experiencing and learning new things outside of your own culture can be extremely enriching and provides a well-rounded perspective on the world. While it’s encouraged to appreciate cultures, it’s not okay to appropriate or whitewash.

2023-01-18,York,India,"On January 18th from 5-7pm, the Office for Student Community & Leadership Development in collaboration with Hillel York will present Intersectional Futures, a speaker series featuring PERIPHERY – Resilience and Power on the Margins with Sara Yacobi-Harris.
Commenting on the series, York alumna and current Student Leadership and Development Coordinator Urshian Khalid says, “The Intersectional Futures speaker series is an exploration of intersectional relationships — with ourselves, with one another, and with the land on which we reside. Through dialogue and conversations around lived experiences, we examine the kinds of stories we often hear about, and the ones we don’t in hopes that a sense of belonging becomes accessible to all”
Dirk Jonathan Rodricks, director of student engagement, explains that, “this second instalment is part of a series that is dedicated to examining the complexity of identities we hold. The series was inspired by the student stories I encountered in my short time at York as director of student engagement and the many conversations I have had with colleagues such as Marian McGregor, the executive director for the centre for human rights, equity and inclusion.”
“And really, the idea was born out of the words and magnificent writing of black feminist lesbian poet, writer, and activist Audre Lorde who said in a speech at Harvard University 40 years ago in February 1982, ‘there is no such thing as a single issue struggle, because we do not lead single issue lives’,” continues Rodricks. 
This Wednesday, the speaker series will feature Yacobi-Harris, a multidisciplinary artist, educator and filmmaker, whose film, Periphery, will be featured at this event.
“Periphery is an evocative film that bears witness to ethnic diversity in the Jewish community of Toronto, Canada. Through dance, poetry, and personal narratives, ten Jews of Black/African, Korean, Iraqi, Indian, and South American ancestry challenge perceptions of who is a Jew. Periphery creates space to look, listen, and learn from participants as they share their experiences and explore ideas of representation, intersectionality, ethnicity, race, and sexuality, all while illustrating the feeling of grappling to belong,” says Khalid.
Yacobi-Harris is also co-founder of No Silence on Race, a non-profit organisation dedicated to creating spaces for multi-ethnic Jews across Canada, which she mentions “is crucial to the vitality of Jewish life and the nuanced way we define who is a Jew.  Whether it be through art, food, tradition, or the cultural differences of how we commemorate life cycle events, featuring diverse Jewish cultures is paramount to our communities in Canada. Periphery was created to be part of how we educate and learn about the diversity that exists within Jewish life in Canada both for Jewish audiences and non-Jewish audiences.”

2023-01-30,York,India,"It is almost too coincidental that Queen Elizabeth II passed away a few days before Canada celebrated its National Day for Truth & Reconciliation. Now as they redesign the toonie in commemoration of her, this article is written in hopes to expose the dichotomy of a   government which acknowledges that the land that their institutions were built on were initially inhabited by Indigenous communities, but continues to hold the very colonial relics in place that took these lands.
Simply put, you can’t apologize to Indigenous communities for the crimes committed against them and then continue to run your government in the name of the British monarch under whose seal these atrocities were carried out. Because, are you really apologizing then?  
Firstly, why do we choose to hold onto the monarchy? There aren’t any economic benefits to being a part of the Commonwealth Realm — a term for countries which acknowledge the British monarch as their figurehead. The Commonwealth is the broader term which refers to an international organization largely composed of the United Kingdom’s former colonies, even if they choose not to acknowledge the monarch as their head. The Canadian government’s website concerning Canada and the Commonwealth  states that the Commonwealth is “a forum for deliberation, problem solving, consensus decision making and action on matters of importance to its membership.”
This goal can be achieved without making the monarch our official figurehead. After all, we are the second largest contributor to the Commonwealth, having spent around $11 million on the organization last year, as reported by the Government of Canada. 
I believe the solution is to run a government in the name of our Indigenous communities.For a start, the constitutional figureheads of our country could be representatives from the indigenous population. So, instead of the British monarch as the nominal head of Canada you could have the ‘Chief’ or any other title that the indigenous communities of Canada settle upon as appropriate. The same should apply to other largely ceremonial positions like ‘the Lt. Governor’ and ‘Governor General’. The term ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be phased out by a new phrase that represents the claim of the indigenous population over Canada. If we had to have a monarch, shouldn’t it be an indigenous person? Or perhaps words like ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be changed to a phrase which acknowledges Canada as the land of all people, but in the language of the indigenous population, to change the starting point of Canada’s history from one based on British expeditions to one that begins with this land’s settlement by the First Nations.
We can simply have Indigenous communities vote for a leader they believe should be the constitutional head of our country and for each of the provinces and territories. Organizations like the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) and Congress of Aboriginal People (CAP) represent the interests of a substantial portion of Indigenous people, and the chief of the Assembly of First Nations is elected by the representatives of its Member Nations. The procedures for elections to the post of a First Nations Chief and Councillors have also been laid down under the Indian Act and First Nations Elections Act. Hence, these elected individuals would be a representation of the will of the indigenous population of Canada and if there is any party who deserves at least a nominal claim over this wonderful country, it is Indigenous communities. 
This also sits very well with our ideas of truth and reconciliation. The relative benefit is representation. How many Canadians know the National Chief of AFN, RoseAnn Archibald, as compared to Queen Elizabeth II? At the very least, this change would bring 14 more members of the Indigenous community to the fore of national politics and the public eye, replacing the Monarch, Governor General and Lt. Governors of the provinces with representatives from the indigenous community. These would be 14 people who have been selected because of their relationships to Indigenous communities and identity, making  it their job to represent the interests of their community with these ceremonial powers given to them, instead of a vestige of a foreign power. It might also make the Indigenous community feel better represented, as they find their place in this diverse nation. The only additional cost is changing the names on the paperwork.  
The island nation of Barbados recently stopped acknowledging the British monarch as their  constitutional head. While King Charles III continues to remain the official head of 16 nations, the process of removing the King as the constitutional monarch of Canada requires unanimous approval by the Senate, the House of Commons, and the legislative assembly of each of the provinces. This is the highest standard of amending the constitution as laid down under Section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
While this is an arduous task, this solution is a far more reasonable take on present day reality.The treaties signed between the Crown with the Indigenous communities many years ago would now be governed by a government structure which places their own heads at the helm, perhaps creating a little more trust in the system. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referred to Canada as the world’s first postnational state in a 2015 interview with the New York Times, even while Canada technically continues to exist under the seal of the “UK”, and public lands are called “Crown Lands”, and the monarch’s face is printed on our money. 
Is this not reminiscent of a more colonial Canada? It doesn’t take into consideration the impact that bearing allegiance to the Queen has on immigrants coming from countries which were also colonies of the British Empire. Doesn’t this solution truly bring Canada into its identity as the first postnational state while also reconciling with its indigenous people? 
2023  is the perfect time for effectuating such a change. Holding on still would be holding onto the vestige of a past that Canadians are not nostalgic about.

Amazing! This seems like a good way to honor the indigenous community.
God save the King.
Interesting idea. However, how do we reconcile the treaty-crown relationships that are foundations of modern government. By removing the crown you also remove the nation to nation relationship shared between indigenous communities and the settler population. Without a solution for this constitutional corner stone, the crown must stay in some form to continue honouring these relationships.

“Strong demand” but “few programs” is how Amin Mawani, Schulich School of Business professor, describes the education landscape for health administration.
But that is expected to change with the Master of Health Industry Administration (MHIA), a new degree program offered by Schulich.
“The MHIA has been designed as a holistic initiative to promote the field of health leadership and management through education, applied research and industry collaboration,” says Schulich Professor Amin Mawani, the program’s inaugural director.
According to the program’s website, the MHIA aims to provide students with skills and training necessary for success in various types of healthcare settings. The 12-month, full-time program covers three four-month terms, with 16 courses on topics like financial management, marketing, organization, digital health, leadership, public policy and more. It will receive its first students in September 2023 and will be open to York undergraduate students graduating by June, as well as healthcare practitioners wanting to work in administrative roles.
The program was approved by York University’s senate in December 2022 and has now been sent to the Ontario government for approval, expected in March 2023.
Traditionally, health administration curricula included topics like finance, marketing and organization. The MHIA program was designed by faculty members in Schulich’s Krembil Centre for Health Management and Leadership, who supplemented traditionally covered topics with emerging fields like data analytics, informatics, epidemiology, and supply chain management.
“We surveyed all Canadian programs as well as successful programs at Harvard, Duke and John Hopkins University,” says Mawani. “The task force also sought input from management practitioners in industry and government, consultants, and industry associations to fully understand the emerging trends and the knowledge requirements for health administration careers.”
In a press release, Schulich School of Business Dean Detlev Zwick promoted his school’s track record in health education: “Over the past two decades, Schulich has been developing health industry leaders through a number of programs, including the health industry specialization in our MBA program, through innovative executive development programs such as our Mini-MBA for Physicians and, beginning in Fall 2023, through our new Master of Health Industry Administration.”
Meanwhile, Mawani believes the MHIA fills a gap in health administration education. “[MHIA] is designed to address an unfilled need in post-graduate management education,” he explained. “There are currently few programs in the field of health administration offered by business schools — both in Ontario and globally.”
The program is being announced in the wake of crippling staff shortages in healthcare facilities across Canada. Many hospitals are calling the situation a crisis and urging government officials to take action. 
At the same time, many publications say jobs in healthcare — and specifically administration — have a strong employment outlook. Job search website, Workopolis, forecasted in Dec. 2015 that the sector would continue to grow rapidly past 2020, and the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics reported strong starting salaries. The Healthcare Management Degree Guide also reports increasing prospects for health administration degrees.

Mental health is a concern for many people, and students often report particular difficulties with their well-being.
That’s the motivation behind a series of seminars, activities and events being held this week in what York University is calling Well-being Week. York University’s website states that the school “prioritizes all interdependent components of wellness – such as physical, emotional and mental health.”
The series runs from Jan. 16 to Feb. 1, both over Zoom and in-person at the Keele campus. There are still many events to choose from, with seminars about improving sleep and promoting mental health, resources on meal planning and health effects of vaping, classes in yoga and cooking, and more.
“I am most excited to attend the webinar being hosted by FGS [Faculty of Graduate Studies] about coping with stress,” says Tina Ranta, assistant director of well-being at York’s Student Counselling, Health & Well-being. “That is open to all community members so that we can learn from one another and build connection.”
Ranta is also “excited to see so many skills building-related events,” which are offered by peer health educators, as well as cooking classes hosted by Food Services. 
Well-being Week is hosted by various organizations at York, and follows a long history of well-being and mental health resources at the university. “Well-being Week is one of the many ways York University demonstrates our commitment to fostering a culture of well-being across our campuses,” said Mary Catherine Masciangelo, York’s assistant vice president of human resources, in a press release.
Ranta similarly explained that “this campaign and events feed directly into the work being led at York in creating a Well-being Strategy that aims to support all community members to be well in this shared environment, as wellness is a necessary precondition to learning and working.”
Masciangelo has also outlined some ideas for destigmatizing mental health, such as education through organizations like the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; engaging empathetically when talking about people’s mental health; awareness of attitudes and behaviours that may affect others’ well-being; and simple respect and care for people in your immediate circle and wider community.

The Oct. 23 robbery, which occurred around 10 p.m., took place on Library Lane near the Health, Nursing and Environmental Studies (HNES) building. The spot is a security risk due to poor lighting, according to a student-conducted safety audit released Oct. 3.
The safety audit, completed by students in the faculty of environmental studies, highlighted the areas around the HNES building that lack adequate security measures to protect students.
The audit suggested the university improve the building’s security prevention measures by installing more appropriate lighting, as well as by defining pathways, fixing broken lights and installing emergency phones outside the building.
Angela Clasadonte, a third-year political science student, agreed with the audit, noting there is not enough lighting in some campus areas.
“I think there should be more lighting. It is very dark at night on campus and I think we need more security at night in places that are not well lit.”
The female student who was robbed at the HNES building was walking with a friend while two male suspects allegedly snatched her purse and fled. Police are looking for two black males, both wearing black clothing and aged 17 to 18 years old.
Tinku Chowdary, a first-year business and society major, is concerned about walking around campus at night and is worried that York security isn’t prepared for the winter. “A lot of people have classes until 10 p.m. and at winter, it gets dark early, so [York] should increase security during wintertime,” said Chowdary.
The most recent incident occurred on Oct. 24 while a male student was walking near the Williams Small Centre and two males grabbed his cell phone and fleed the scene.
According to Toronto police, two suspects were located and later arrested and charged, but police will not release the suspects’ names. Police found a replica handgun on them.
According to York security, another student was allegedly assaulted and robbed by three male suspects Oct. 19. The incident occurred around 8 p.m. on the lower floor of York’s Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) building. A York female community member was sitting on the bench by herself, with her Blackberry cell phone placed beside her. The three males allegedly shoved her, took her Blackberry and ran. Police are still looking for the suspects.
The victim described the males as black and wearing black jackets and baseball caps.
A male student was robbed of his cellphone Oct. 22 while he was waiting for the VIVA bus on the station near the Ontario Archives building. According to York security, the suspect is described as male, six-foot-two, approximately 20 to 25 years of age and wearing black sweatpants.
Toronto police and York security are still determining whether there are any connections between these incidents.
York security has advised students to be more aware of their surroundings and vigilant of people when talking on their cell phone or walking in isolated campus areas.
The Toronto police are looking for male suspects in relation to all the robberies that have occurred.
Please contact York Security Services at 416-736-5333, or Toronto police, Division 31 at 416-808-3100, if you have any information on these robberies.

The Ontario New Democratic Party counted York University among the several Ontario universities allegedly spending public funds – almost $500,000 worth on York’s part – on lobbyists, hired private-sector advocates paid to sway provincial government policy.
According to York, however, that money was not spent on lobbying the government, but on consulting firms to help secure assets and information for future York projects.
In an Oct. 5 press release from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the Freedom of Information request filed by the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) showed York spends more funds on private lobbying groups than any other university in the province.
According to a statement released by York Oct. 6, the university had contracts with three companies registered as lobby groups – the Counsel Public Af- fairs (CPA), the Devon Group and EcoNexus – but hired them as consultants, not lobbyists.
Alex Bilyk, York’s director of media relations, said York hired these firms as consultants because York didn’t have the resources or staff to head these projects.
Krisna Saravanamuttu, president of the York Federation of Students (YFS), said of the money spent on consultants that, since the CUPE 3903 strike, which shut down the university during the 2008-2009 academic year for almost three months, “York has been crying poor.”
“Where in the world did York find almost $500,000 to fund these lobby groups, when really lobbying is the job of the senior administrators and a properly composed Board of Governors?” he said.
Bilyk said that the university has a budget to hire consultants and that York did not go over that budget.
“Perhaps Saravanamuttu has not read [York’s Oct. 6] statement and maybe he does not understand how the university works,” said Bilyk.
According to York, from Jan- uary to June 2010 The Devon Group provided strategic coun- sel and guidance for additional venues for the upcoming Pan Am Games 2015, which resulted in the letter of intent York offered event organizers regarding the university’s willingness to host some of the activities.
The statement further explains that from February 2008 to January 2009, the university worked with the CPA in looking at potentially establishing a medical school at York. Bilyk said CPA helped York put together a business plan for the York medical school.
The York statement also said that CPA assisted with labour relations during that time.
York hired EcoNexus from 2008 to 2010 to focus on creating a research project on climate change and environmental research. The York statement also said that project lead Karan Kraft Sloan is a registered federal lobbyist; however, in this instance, she was not lobbying the government.

Glenn Ulrich remembers when Jordan Hanley generously gave his number four Georgina Ice hockey jersey, which he wore for several years, to his little brother when he joined the team, due to a lack of jerseys.
“That is just the kind of a guy he was – very generous,” said Ulrich.
Ulrich, president of the Georgina Ice hockey club, said that Hanley’s parents, teammates and the whole community is in “utter shock” over the death of the 23-year-old York student. Hanley, a fourth-year kinesiology student and a passionate hockey player for the past four years, died Oct. 11.
Ulrich said that after Hanley died, his family decided to keep him on life support to preserve his body, so that his organs could be donated to the Trillium Foundation.
“Jordan was the type of guy who would come up to you from across the room and say ‘hi,’” he said.
Hanley was also involved with his church in Keswick. Ulrich describes Hanley as an “extremely giving” person who was heavily involved in his community. The funeral took place on Oct.
15 and, according to Ulrich, more than 500 people came out to say final goodbyes to Hanley.
“It was a very moving and emotional day for everyone. Keswick’s community really came together for Jordan,” he said.
Everyone at the funeral was wearing green ribbons to symbolize their support for organ dona- tion to the Trillium Foundation, Ulrich added.
“It’s a big loss for our community of 18,000 people. Everybody knows each other and feels the pain of loss.”

A recent York University study shows that individuals who cannot recognize faces can make up for it by an enhanced sense of voice recognition.
Prosopagnosia, otherwise known as face blindness, is a rare disorder where one loses the ability to visually recognize faces.
The study, published in Neuropsychologia, suggested that human brains distinguish between people and objects in two disassociated parts of the brain.
Jennifer Steeves, an associate professor of psychology at York, lead the study; she’s one of many researchers working at the Sherman Health Science Research Centre, which opened at the Keele campus Sept. 14.
Researchers completed a series of experiments that looked into the recognition level of faces, voices, sounds and objects, and compared individuals diagnosed with prosopagnosia against those without.
Before conducting this experiment, subjects were shown 110 images of female faces that had no visible differences or characteristics. The individuals were also provided with an auditory clip where a 20-second passage was spoken in English.
Following this exercise, the subjects were questioned on the visual and auditory-only models, both separately and in conjunction.
Although people diagnosed with prosopagnosia relied upon the auditory clip to recognize faces, this did not apply to recognizing objects. The study suggested that the human brain uses two separate neurological areas when identifying  people and objects.

CUP ONTARIO BUREAU CHIEF
TORONTO (CUP) – Two Ontario universities are teetering on the edge of a strike, with faculty unions at both schools voted overwhelmingly in favour of walking off the job.
On Oct. 1, the Faculty Association at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont. voted 87 percent in favour of a strike, Helen Connell, the associate vice-president of communications for the university, confirmed. The union represents more than 1,400 full and part-time faculty members at Western.
James Compton, president of University of Western Ontario Faculty Assocation, said the key issue for faculty is a series of proposals put forth by the university that centralizes administrative control over yearly faculty reviews and make them subject to performance management techniques that are counter to scholarly practices.
These proposals would have a centralized board overseeing faculty reviews, rather than the reviews being considered individually within each discipline. Tenured professors who receive a bad review in one area, for instance, could be disciplined or even dismissed.
“This would weaken the role of peer evaluation and collegial self-government,” said Compton. He adds that the proposal would weaken the tenure system, which is a major support of academic freedom.
“Professors that have precarious employment are going to be less likely to speak out and do research and teaching on controversial topics than they would otherwise,” noted Compton.
“And that is bad for the university, it’s bad for students, it’s bad for classrooms, it’s bad for the broader community, because that is the ma- jor public good that’s produced by the university. It’s what separates universities from high school.”
Western also faces the prospect of a staff strike after the union, representing close to 1,200 administrative and technical staff, voted 95 percent in favour of a strike on Oct. 5 and 6, said Deborah Novakowski, the union president.
Novakowski said the staff union’s chief concern is job security.
Meanwhile, professors at Carleton University in Ottawa voted 88.5 percent for a strike mandate on Oct. 4 and 5, the union’s website asserts.
Jason MacDonald, director of communications at Carleton, said the university does not believe that the union has the right to strike in this round of bargaining, however.
MacDonald said that according to the current collective agreement, the union should have filed their intent to reserve the right to strike three months before their contract expired, something they didn’t do.
In the event that an agreement cannot be reached, the parties should proceed to binding arbitration, said MacDonald.
Neither Western nor Carleton would divulge whether or not classes would be cancelled in the event of a strike, which has left many students anxious.
Nicole Lippay, a fourth-year English student at Western, is scared that a strike might prevent her from graduating.
“I’ve worked so hard to get this far,” said Lippay. “And now at the last possible minute they’re going to go on strike?”
Lippay rents a room in a house in downtown London. If a strike does occur, she will have to continue to pay for that room–even if she wants to go home to Uxbridge, Ont. to work. She will also have to scramble to find somewhere to stay if the semester gets extended, as her lease is up at the end of April.
Lippay is concerned that a condensed semester would sacrifice the quality of education that she will receive; however, she also sympathizes with the faculty’s issues around academic freedom.
“Most of the professors I’ve had are very passionate about what they talk about. They talk very freely about what’s concerning them, and they make an effort for students to get involved in the discussion,” said Lippay.
Negotiations at both universities are ongoing. Connell said that Wester has several negotiation dates set, including Nov. 1 and 2, when both sides will meet with the provincial mediator who has been appointed to assist them in reaching a settlement.
“I believe there’s a lot of good will on both sides to reach an agreement,” said Connell.

York student Zina Rakhamilova feels the reason students are stuck waiting for access to the public computers may be because of the new Scott Library renovations, unveiled to the York community Oct. 20.
“I need computers, especially in-between breaks,” said Rakhamilova, a second-year psychology student.
“Before, when we had all the computers here, it was a lot easier [for students].”
According to Mark Robertson, an associate university librarian, the old computers from the second floor have been relocated temporarily to the fourth and fifth floors of Scott Library, as 120 new computers will be set up in separate sections all around the second floor to replace the 100 old ones.
Robertson said that to increase student workspace the layout of the second floor has been widely expanded.
“There will be a possibility of additional renovation that would add even more seats and computers to the library,” he said.
According to Robertson, this particular project is still pending due to lack of funding.
Dale Findlay, a first-year student in the second entry-nursing program, said that she does not feel she was informed about the new changes.
“I’m not too sure what they are doing with the renovations,” said Findlay. “I haven’t really been informed of anything, but hopefully they will be able to expand the study area to make it more suitable for students to study.”
Aisha Mohamoud, a first-year health studies, likes the renovations.
“[Students] have a lot of space to study with groups of people, they have space to eat, space to chill, sit down,” she said.
“I think it’s a good idea. I liked it when I came in.”
According to Robertson, the library is planning to place signs on the second floor to keep students informed about the changes.

Two weeks after York history prof. David Noble mailed a letter to the university’s president, Mamdouh Shoukri, about York’s policies on student club activities, he received an official response from the administration, as well as several unsolicited press releases from on and off campus Jewish groups.
Noble, whose original letter to Shoukri alleged the Hillel@York Jewish student group serves as, “in effect, an agent of a foreign government,” said he was “dismayed” after having gone over the content of the response letter.
“It is the right of any community member to express his or her view within the law and without fear of intimidation or harassment,” wrote Rob Tiffin, vice-president students at York, in a letter to Noble dated Oct. 21. “This extends to the members of a student organization such as Hillel.”
Noble, who is on sabbatical this academic year, is not satisfied with the response. “They’re not answering the question,” he said.
“It’s much more than disappointment. I’m dismayed.”
“[York] is continuing to endorse Hillel’s acting as a de facto agent of a foreign government,” Noble added.
“The significance of Tiffin’s letter is that the university has now moved from a tacit endorsement […] that any state that wants to establish themselves using a student organi- zation as a lobbying agency is now officially sanctioned. That’s what that letter means.”
Tiffin’s letter noted that, according to Presidential Regulation 4, a “student organization” is defined as a group of students who voluntarily congregate with common interest, and may include “organizations formed for purposes of carrying forward a particular activity, cause or project” and not necessarily associated with an academic discipline.
Brandon Crandall, president of Hillel@ York, insisted his club does not work for any governmental organization and is in full compliance with university rules and regulations.
“We’ve been on campus as the primary voice for Jewish life and for non-Jewish students who are interested in Judaism and Jewish culture,” he said. “We hold no political alliances with any parties […] we firmly deny being agents of a foreign government.”
Noble’s take on Hillel@York’s activities was apparently inspired by a Facebook group called “Israel Affairs – Hillel @ York,” moderated by Jennifer Cogan Diamond, who, according to the Hillel of Greater Toronto website, is the Israel Affairs Program Associate for the Toronto organization.
Noble attached a screen capture of the group’s front page to his initial letter. The group’s description begins, “We are the advocates for Israel on York campus.”
When asked about the “Israel Affairs” Facebook group, Crandall explained that the group is indeed involved with Hillel@York, but that their support for Israel is historically rooted in the Jewish faith.
Meanwhile, several Jewish and Israeli groups both on and off campus expressed disdain for Noble’s interpretation of Hillel@York’s activities. Sammy Katz, managing director of the Canadian Network for Israel Affairs and former president of Hasbara at York, felt that Noble was unjustified in condemning Hillel as serving as an agent of a foreign government. “Supporting Israel on campus does not mean that you are acting on behalf of a foreign government,” Katz said in an Oct. 20 press release.
“Rather, students and organizations that support Israel on campus are supporting democracy, human rights, equality and peace.” Aaron Rosenberg, president of B’nai Brith OnCampus York, felt that Noble’s claims were isolating Jewish student groups on campus.
“Numerous groups and a large number of students at York University […] stand behind the democratic Jewish State of Israel,” said Rosenberg in a statement made to Excalibur.
“[Noble] continues to make a mockery of this university’s claimed policies of inclusion. Should this be tolerated at our proudly multicultural university?”
Noble is still pursuing a defamation lawsuit he filed in 2006 against Hillel of Great- er Toronto, as well as several other Jewish groups and the York University Foundation, for $19 million in relation to press releases they’d issued about a pamphlet he’d distributed in 2004.

Minutes after poll booths were closed and ballots counted Oct. 25, Rob Ford was declared the next mayor of Toronto.
Some Torontonians were torn between the two main mayoral candidates, Rob Ford and George Smitherman, but a number of stu- dents, like Jacob Wylde, knew exactly for whom they were voting.
“I voted for Rob Ford because he knows what’s wrong with this city,” said the third-year kinesiology student. “He knows how to fix the city’s [debt] problem. Toronto is in an amazing amount of debt, and no one else who was running talked about it.”
Some remained unsure of who should get their vote until the last minute. When asked before the election, third-year English major Janette Parucha said for her the decision would come down to either Smitherman or Pantalone.
“I’m leaning away from Rob Ford,” she said. “I’ve heard bad things about Ford, but I’m not sure who I’m going to vote for.”
While many students were torn between the three candidates, others expressed disinterest in the municipal elections.
“I don’t really have a reason for why I’m not voting,” said Em- manuelle Bakos, a first-year sociology student. “I’m just not really involved in political aspects of things, so I don’t really know much about what is going on.”
Vanessa Hunt, vice-president of campus life for the York Fed- eration of Students (YFS), said the student union did not endorse any particular candidate, instead opting to educate the student body about the mayoral candidates.
“We provided students with information about issues that we feel relate to students […] related to public transit, sustainability and housing,” she said, encouraging students to be informed about candidates before casting their ballot.
“From what I’ve seen and heard, students are very involved at the municipal level,” said Hunt. “It’s about making sure that you’re informed so that when you go to the polls to make a decision, you really know who you’re voting for instead of just voting for a candidate because you’ve heard of them.”
YFS president Krisna Saravan- amuttu was optimistic about the changes Toronto may see under Ford over the next four years.
“I hope that Rob Ford will maintain the great things about Toronto,” he said. “We hope that […] he will work towards an in- clusive environment for everyone in the city.”

ask yourselves the question
why did the biggest bofoon and ridicule on city councill for the last 5 years get the most votes of any politician in canada…  EVER.
Krisna is not optimistic. He called Ford “a racist and homophobic mayor”.

Once upon a time, the downtrodden and hardworking students of York University had a library.
The library was called Scott, and although it was old and was cursed with a terrible paint job, it was good to the students, and they were good to it.
One day, a magical renovation committee came upon more money than most of the students would ever make in their entire lives, and decided to use it to transform Scott into something new, exciting and focus-group tested.
They toiled – or rather, dozens of unionized workers toiled – for months until a new appendage emerged from Scott; it wasn’t a useful or vital appendage, but it was there all the same.
They dubbed this new area the “Learning Commons” and immediately began planning for the next stage of its development, with a projected finish date of 2012 or 2013, depending on funding.
The Learning Commons @ Scott Library exists at the exact intersection between a mistake and a post-modern mess. It was designed by a group of people that must sincerely believe that the Apple Store, a bright, chairless room, is the height of architectural majesty, and that scrolling red LED displays are the future of information technology.
The computer room has been scrapped; in its place you’ll find a pleasantly lit area containing five booths sitting about eight people each, a random smattering of chairs and a couple of truly confusing arrow-shaped table-chair things.
The arrow forms a circle, and in the middle is a single plastic chair. York U has gone avant-garde, and it has no room for plebeians who cannot understand its newly acquired taste.
Aside from getting rid of the easy-to-access computer room that easily housed the better part of 100 desktops and replacing it with a series of tiny coffee booths, what else has happened in the library?
The Learning Commons included expanded renovations into previously inaccessible parts of the library, with additional seating in rooms with names like “The Salon” and “The Collaboratory.” Coll– wait! You mean, it’s like a laboratory, in which you collaborate? Brilliant! Give these people a million dollars! That already happened? Well played, Scott Library. Well played.
I understand the motivation behind the renovations; our dear university is starting to show its age, and kids don’t like studying in outdated, “unhip” areas. Personally speaking, I refuse to write an essay if I’m not in a limo driven by supermodels.
Public relations is a huge part of attracting new students to any post-secondary institution, and I have no doubt a few ethnically diverse press photos of students laughing and studying in The Salon will help sway student interest.
They wanted to make something new and shiny, and they succeeded. The greatest triumph of the Learning Commons, however, is how it now perfectly reflects the York University experience as a whole.
They took a straightforward, easy-to-comprehend area and turned it into a labyrinth – a convoluted waste of money and resources.
If that doesn’t scream York, I don’t know what does.

Right on Mike!!
I laugh everytime I see that space. What a complete joke. More quiet study rooms might have been nice! This is a library, not a lounge. Welcome to York, leave your common sense on the way in.
Living that awful architectural desecration right now over here at UBC in Vancouver where the Old Main Library was gutted to make this look like something high end casual Oxford. What happens? Now I have students bellowing on phones and playing with facebook because the old serious space has been gutted for something I consider the lowest common denominator where students can hang out and say they were at the library . We get to call ours the Barber Learning Commons. I used the old library for many years and this is a gutting  of  the beautiful thing once known as a library architecturally, spiritually and intellectually. 
Re: “Pro-life students arrested at Carleton,” News, Oct. 20, 2010
What does freedom of speech sound like to you? The abortion debate is definitely one of the most emotionally charged debates that exist, but there’s apparently nowhere for people to hear and learn about the issues surrounding it anymore.
It is frankly unacceptable that several pro-life, tuition-paying students at Carleton University were arrested because they refused to take their protest signs into a closed classroom.
These students have the right to a peaceful protest. A protest, by definition, is an expression or declaration of an opposing view. Protesting in a closed classroom isn’t really a protest, now is it?
University campuses are paid for mainly by the government, and by student tuition. Thus, the campus belongs in part to the students and the government. It seems funny that government-given rights seem to be the ones getting trumped by an administration that is not part of either group.
As students, we are challenged to think outside the box, develop our own opinions and listen to those of others, no matter how ridiculous they may sound to us. Heaven forbid we put this into practice and actually try to spread a message to a broader audience or show our disapproval with something going on around us.
The fact is, the abortion debate is rarely ever mentioned inside classrooms today. As many of my previous university professors have said, they just don’t want to get into something as emotionally charged as that.
If we can’t talk about it in the classroom, and we can’t talk about it out of the classroom, where can we talk about it?

Re: “Pro-life students arrested at Car- leton,” News, Oct. 20, 2010
I am appalled to hear pro-life students were arrested at Carleton University Oct. 4, 2010 after attempting to put up a pro-life display on campus. What is this saying to a generation of students who are supposedly in an environment where education and learning are embraced? Pro-life groups on university campuses all over the country are constantly being silenced while groups of the opposite view are openly embraced. Universities should be allowing an atmosphere where students can freely debate those issues that can be hard to face. Why reject all ideas that are different than those of a popular view?
Just because a view isn’t widely supported in certain arenas, doesn’t mean that it should be swept under the carpet. Canada was built on equality and freedoms. Most take things like freedom of expression and freedom of speech for granted until they are put in a position like these students were. For the sake of this nation, we need to take a stand against this type of injustice.

Re: “YFS Schulich director accused of harassment,” News, Oct. 20, 2010
As a student from the Schulich School of Business, I would like to commend Gregory Kay for his efforts to try to represent our faculty, which is already underrepresented at our university, at the Canadian Federation of Students annual general meeting. I read in the article that Kay tried to apply to attend the meeting and was refused by another member. This makes me question Jeremy Salter’s comments on the lack of tension between him and Kay, especially since there was controversy surrounding the disqualification of Kay and other members during last year’s election process.
In addition to the concerns surrounding Kay’s case, I find it strange YFS board members are not permitted to share information discussed in meetings with non-members. I agree that this demonstrates a lack of transparency in our university’s student union, which is supposed to be working to represent us. I do hope that this issue gets resolved and Kay’s name is cleared, as I have always known him to be an excellent representative who does his best to serve the constituents he represents.

Re: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010
As a Jewish student at York University, I am offended and insulted by prof. David Noble’s remarks against a Jewish student group at York. By attacking and isolating the Jewish student group, Noble is making a campus that’s already toxic and unwelcoming for Jewish students a more poisonous environment.
Being a Jewish student in Canada means many things to me. It means broadening my horizons and gaining knowledge. It does not mean feeling ostracized by students and faculty. It does not mean professors using the classroom as a podium to reveal their personal political leanings. It does not mean Jewish students hiding their religion, ideas and opinions for fear their professor will grade them lower.
It is the responsibility of the administration and faculty to ensure students feel safe, something they have failed to do. York is perceived as unfriendly because of the actions of people like prof. Noble.

Re: “York prof questions Hillel’s advocacy,” News, Oct. 20, 2010
As a Jewish student in York University’s community, I am offended by prof. David Noble’s remarks against a Jewish student group at York. In particular, I disagree with his calling on president Shoukri to end York’s support of Hillel due to the club’s advocacy on behalf of the state of Israel. Comments such as these, especially from the university’s so-called “noble” and “elite,” have no place in any university, and more importantly, incite intolerance and hatred, which is all too common at York University.
Nobility is not something received at birth, it is a virtue earned through the tolerance and respect of others. Prof. Noble, your name may spell it, but you are an individual who is far from noble.

I don’t have much experience with plays, but Soulpepper’s current production of Arthur Miller’s classic Death of a Salesman resonated with me in both its story and performance, especially as someone who has toiled in real estate sales myself.
Soulpepper’s small venue and simple set and costumes make it clear the company doesn’t have the same budget as other big names in theatre. But what their production lacks in special effects and intricate set design, it makes up for in content, creativity and chemistry.
For those who, like me, are unfamiliar with Arthur Miller’s classic, the play is about an overworked salesman, Willy Loman, who places too much pressure on himself and his children to achieve great things. His problem is that the great things are always measured monetarily, and achieving them always rests on a hope and a prayer. In the end, he commits suicide in the faith that his son, who, ironically, realizes what is truly valuable, will do something great with the insurance money.
Soulpepper’s production featured a huge range of interactions between the play’s characters, especially Biff and Willy Loman. Through flashbacks and fast-forwards, we see these two characters in loving embraces, at each others’ throats, and crying in each others’ arms, all within minutes. These transitions were seamless and easy to follow, and the relationship between characters in each scene was as believable as in the next. Soulpepper’s being a family business probably lends itself to that level of chemistry.
Even though it was written over 60 years ago, today’s evolving professional world is the perfect context for Death of a Salesman. Its themes reflects the increasing need for workers to “sell themselves” to employers and the individual and familial pressure that ensues. Death of a Salesman explores this pressure through the salesman, but we can all say we have experienced something similar, either through work, school or a combination of both.
The play also critiques the ambitions of parents who place too much pressure on their children to be great people. Willy Loman has the best intentions at heart when he encourages his sons, but doesn’t realize he is encouraging the pursuit of an unrealistic goal. Willy’s son Biff admits “I’m a nobody,” rebelling against this in a way that resonates with many people’s experiences.
Through a combination of its universal themes and brilliant performance, Soulpepper’s production of Death of a Salesman feels anything but dated, especially in a world where everyone feels like a “nobody” sometimes.
Death of a Salesman is being performed at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in the Distillery District until November 20.
 


Great production. I’ve seen a few Soulpepper shows in the past (all of them great) and they don’t always have small sets. I think the idea with this one was to make the house as claustrophobic as possible while leaving room for the flashback scenes.

Shirley has been doing this for years, there are warnings on the ad’s and before the show. it should be the undergrounds responsibility to make sure their clientele are ready for the obscenity of Shirley who was TRUELY their best event. I’ve attended every bingo in my 3.5 years at york (and regrettably one of the frosh week ones with out Shirley) and am sad that the student center management has decided to deal with the situation they way they have.
I completely agree with everything Shirley did to handle the situation, and I don’t think she should have to apologize for anything. Everyone I have talked to that I brought to Dirty Bingo, saw what happened and feel that she handled things perfectly and the Underground needs to grow the fuck up and realize that we are not a bunch of little children that need to be babysat. If you don’t want to hear that sort of thing, DON’T GO!!! Its as simple as that. Everyone that I go with and have ever gone with in our 4 years here are refusing to attend any Dirty Bingo event that is not hosted by Shirley.
Also, the last time they removed her the person they had take over made the winners make sounds like they were having an orgasm in order to get their prize….that is just disgusting, Shirley handles the event sooo much better and we won’t go see anyone else. She may make fun of you and call you dirty names, but it is all in good fun and she never insults one person, its a free for all on anyone and everyone.
Oh, and in regards to the XXX Hypnotist show, I have been to 1 of them and I won’t go to another. They are extremely disgusting, he has the people stripping and humping each other and other degrading things on stage and its just not fun to watch at all.
Bring Shirley back….and I think this time…the Underground needs to apologize for acting like babies. Really…we are university students…we hear worse crap in the music we listen to.

York University’s administration is hoping mobile and online technology is going to help make York University the number one choice for prospective students.
According to YFile, York’s recruitment and admissions have released a new iPhone application called “YorkU Social Connect.”
A free app for the iPhone available for download from iTunes, Social Connect is used to keep students up-to-date on current information from the YU blog.
The “YorkU Social Connect” application provides recent news, including the York U newsletter, Twitter feed and York’s Flickr stream.
“We’ve been able to tap into the talents of our current students and the whole communications team within recruitment to really change the way we do business,” Donna Cope, recruitment’s director of print and e-media communications, told YFile Nov. 22.

Following the recent walkouts by staff members from the Student Centre, the student hub that gives space to student clubs and activities, three more employees have followed suit and walked away from their positions.
Excalibur reported Nov. 17 that after York University’s Student Centre’s (YUSC) marketing and events manager Saqueeb Rajan was fired Nov. 12, two of Saq’s employees quit their jobs as a sign of protest against Rajan’s firing.
Since then, both graphic designers for the Student Centre, Keith McLean and Kate Hudson, and the programming and events co-ordinator, Sanqeetha Ravi, have quit.
“I can’t stop staff from quitting,” Scott Jarvis, executive director of the Student Centre, wrote in an email. “The work will be taken on by other staff. We rehire each semester anyway, and December is not really a busy month for us.”
Chris Eccleston, who walked out of his position together with co-worker Sagi Mamalider, wrote in an email that one of the reasons he quit was due to team morale dropping dramatically as soon as Jarvis was hired.
“He never seemed to want to get involved in what [the promotional team] was doing, and a lot of our ideas were being shot down,” he said. “I don’t remember him even trying to get to know our promo team on a personal level when he was first hired.”
Jarvis, however, refuted these arguments, claiming his working relationships with current and former staff members have been great.
“That’s not true,” he wrote to Excalibur regarding the allegations. “Staff morale is great.”
Mamalider, who quit Nov. 15, said in an email, “what was once a wonderful workplace where ideas were shared and developed with support became a micromanaged environment where you were asked to take on a task only to be told that the decision was made to go a different direction weeks after having put in effort into that specific task.”
“The daily motivation I came in with to the Student Centre two years ago had disappeared,” he said.

York University president Mamdouh Shoukri and Rabbi Aaron Hoch, who accused Shoukri of supporting anti-Semitism, are currently in the process of setting up a meeting to discuss Hoch’s allegations.
Hoch is a local rabbi who forwarded an email to 700 of his contacts expressing his concerns about George Galloway’s speech at York’s Keele campus on Nov. 16 and encouraging people to protest against Galloway’s presence at York, according to a Nov. 16 National Post article.
In his email, Rabbi Hoch said “Mr. Shoukri has again showed his amazing tolerance for anti-Semitism and lack of vigilance regarding the feeling of safety for Jewish students on campus.”
Commenting on the nature of the upcoming meeting, Alex Bilyk, director of York’s media relations, said “during the meeting we will welcome Rabbi Hoch’s clarification that he did not mean that the president was an anti-Semite.”
In light of the upcoming meeting, Rabbi Hoch declined to comment about what he hoped this meeting would accomplish.
Hoch’s concerns stemmed from the fact that Galloway was forbidden from entering Canada in 2008 after allegedly making monetary donations to the Palestinian Hamas-run government, a group the Canadian government identifies as a terrorist organization.
According to Hoch, the meeting will take place some time in early December.
According to the National Post, York wanted an apology from Hoch, but instead of issuing an apology, Hoch forwarded a copy of his original email, York University’s response, and his response to the university to all of his original contacts.

Allegations of misspent student funds and broken by-laws surfaced against York’s student union in the wake of last week’s visit from former British politician and anti-war activist George Galloway.
Former British MP Galloway spoke on invitation from the York Federation of Students (YFS) to a sold-out crowd of 500 students in Accolade East building about the war in Afghanistan and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after having been previously banned from entering Canada by the federal government.
Gregory Kay, Schulich School of Business director for the YFS, alleges that, in hosting Galloway, the YFS broke the organization’s by-laws because the executives did not receive approval from the group’s board of directors, and thereby acted on their own without authorization.
Krisna Saravanamuttu, president of the YFS, explained his actions were well within the union’s mandate and maintains that no rules were broken.
“To be completely frank, the executive committee is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the student’s union. We report all of our activities at monthly [BoD] meetings through well-documented and well-developed board reports,” said Saravanamuttu.
“In addition, I would respectfully say that that’s an asinine-type logic. If we were to follow that logic, that means I wouldn’t be able to respond to an email or pick up a phone call until our monthly board meeting,” he argued.
Alex Bilyk, York’s director of media relations, confirmed the YFS hired five Toronto police officers at a cost of approximately $3,500 while York provided five of its own security officers for $2,400, a total of $5,900.
Saravanamuttu said he could not comment on the security costs because they have not yet been finalized.
According to Bilyk, in addition to the five officers already provided, Toronto police 31 division made their own assessment and decided to send an additional 15 officers for the event.
Toronto Police Constable Trish Mills, 31 division community relations officer, was not available for comment at the time of the publication.
Kay argued the YFS should never have spent any money in bringing in such a controversial figure to the campus.
“I think the YFS was founded to promote unity and they’re clearly not accomplishing that goal,” said Kay. “They knew this would be very divisive.”
“These aren’t the average views of the York population and for […] the YFS to advance their own political agenda through bringing in George Galloway appals the mainstream student body and is a huge misappropriation of student funds,” he added.
Saravanamuttu maintains that aside from the money spent on security, no student funds were spent to host the event.
“I think Kay may be unaware of or simply choosing to ignore the fact that the YFS made no financial contribution to have Mr. Galloway speak at York University,” said Saravanamuttu.
He also stated the money made from selling tickets for the event were donated to the Canadian Peace Alliance for their upcoming anti-war convention in March.

The Martlet (University of Victoria)
VICTORIA (CUP) – When Cory Dohlen entered the first year of his primary education practicum, he was shocked that there were five other men in his class of 29 – not because there were so few men, but because there were so many women.
Dohlen’s feeling has seemingly become the norm in universities worldwide. The increasing trend of girls outnumbering boys in post-secondary institutions is not abnormal.
Female enrolment in Canada has been steadily increasing over the years, sitting at 58 percent in 2008-2009 according to Statistics Canada.
This trend is escalated by an increasing number of males dropping out of universities worldwide. Tony Eder, a director for the University of Victoria’s Institutional Planning and Analysis, explains the exact number is difficult to track because there is no way of concluding whether it is a leave of absence or a more permanent decision.
Jamie Cassels, vice-president academic at the University of Victoria, believes there’s no answer for this phenomenon.
“For almost 22 years, it’s been like that: a female population that is at about 60 percent versus 40 percent for males. And it varies. It’s interesting that it’s not getting worse. The question for me is, is it even a problem? If it is a problem, are there barriers and problems at the university level or is it happening somewhere else?”
One theory suggests the gap between males and females begins in elementary school due to the fact that the vast majority of elementary teachers are female, and the mentoring position teachers have at such a young age.
“If you look at the [gender divide] of teachers in secondary schools, it’s roughly 50-50,” explained Cassels, whereas in elementary schools, males make up approximately 20 percent of the teaching staff nationwide.
In Dohlen’s primary education program, only 20 of the 140 students were male.
Cassels believes social values and milieus are what influence children to attend university.
“The most important determinant of whether or not a student goes to university is based on what is talked about around the dining room table – essentially, social values,” he said. The second most important, according to Cassels, is the students’ second home – school.
“Those images of what you’re going to do, most of the literature shows, gets fixed in your head in late elementary and middle schools. By the time you’re in high school, you pretty well know what pathway you’re on. So if gendered messages are happening in elementary school, that’s where it’s most likely to be influential,” said Cassels.
Some experts suggest that the solution to this gap is bringing in more male teachers. Based on his own personal experience, Dohlen agrees.
“Sometimes, in the courses I had to take for the program, the instructor would refer to the teacher as ‘she,’ as in ‘this is what she would be doing in the classroom,’” he said. “So the program’s a little more biased that way, because it caters to the majority.”
Jo-Anne Lee, a women’s studies professor, doesn’t believe bringing more males into the education system will change the gender gap.
“Why is education considered a female occupation? We have to address the gender bias in education, which reflects the gender bias in society at large,” Lee explained. “Looking after young kids is seen to be an essential female nature. I think we need to look at popular culture and the messages of popular culture and masculinity.”
Lee explained that while these constructions of gender are at play in our society, the gender of elementary teachers doesn’t matter.
“So what if we put men in primary education? They will become feminized in elementary school — they’re not seen to be ‘real guys’ because ‘real guys’ don’t do that. There’s a culture of masculinity in our culture that tells boys that it’s okay to be jocks, but men today are rewarded for their brawn and not their brain power, at least in high school.”
Lee further emphasizes the gender gap is not the biggest problem facing universities and society as a whole, noting that in Canada, women are still paid less than men for the same job, which she says is a prominent issue in the education system.
Affirmative action programs are a common solution to the gender gap found in universities. To combat the concern, the University of Victoria’s engineering program has a student recruitment program where attracting women is at the top of the agenda. Cassels is clear that this does not include “preferential admission policies or categories” for women, but rather encouragement to enter the engineering department.

The York Lanes Health Clinic, run by Appletree Medical Centre, recently fired the clinic’s last practicing chiropractor, Amy Lavigne, who said she was given no logical reason for her dismissal.
“[Clinic administration] said that [chiropractors] were diverting resources from patients, and that the health care patients are suffering,” said Lavigne.
Appletree is a private medical corporation that took over management of the York Lanes clinic on March 1, 2010. According to a Feb. 10 Excalibur article, the management takeover came after the old management was unable to reach an agreement with York University Development Corporation (YUDC).
Lavigne said she is looking to open up her own chiropractor practice at York but she is running into some difficulties.
“Would I like to stay in York Lanes? Of course. But now that Appletree has the exclusive rights to chiropractor work, they won’t give it to me,” she said, adding she intends to move somewhere close to campus.
Excalibur tried to reach Shafiq Bhanji, Appletree clinic’s executive director, for comment multiple times but Bhanji did not reply as of the date of publication.
Dr. Jantinder Dhillon, former manager of the York Lanes clinic and previously an employee with Appletree Medical Group at their York Lanes clinic, said he was not surprised with Appletree’s actions.
“All the comprehensive services that we have set up, not everything makes money but students need it. And for [Appletree] it’s all about money,” said Dhillon.
Yusuf Mohammed, vice-president of equity of the York Federation of Students, noted the thought it was strange the Appletree Clinic was cutting all of its chiropractors.
“I think it’s pretty weird that they want to cut the chiropractors from the clinic when they provide an essential service to students. I think they should shift their focus towards student needs and not streamlining their budget and saving costs,” he said.
Katie Howard, Lavigne’s patient and a York student, expressed her frustration towards Appletree.
“I haven’t seen any benefit come from Appletree clinic. In fact I don’t go [there] if I have a medical issue – I will wait and go to my family doctor at home. But a lot of people don’t have this option,” noted Howard, adding Appletree’s defence is rooted in their claim chiropractic services are available elsewhere.
“This chiropractor [Lavigne] has a great York student clientele based on the fact that she is in a great student location, and York is just allowing them to come in and shove her out like she’s nothing when she serves their students,” said Howard.
Alex Bilyk, director of media relations at York, said he is no position to comment on Appletree because it’s a private business.
When asked how students can address their frustrations toward Appletree’s actions, Mohammed said he believes students need to speak and mobilize in order to voice their concerns.
“[Students] can more than likely bring this up to Rob Tiffin, [York’s vice president students], and while Appletree is part of the YUDC, at the same time York administration and the YUDC have a working relationship where they can sit down and discuss these things,” said Mohammed.

The Ontario government has come out with a mobile app – the first of its kind – that  allows post-secondary students to track their Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) application processes as well as their loan accumulation.
John Milloy, Ontario’s Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities, said he hopes easier access to keeping track of post-secondary finances will make it more convenient for students.
“It took roughly four months [to develop the app] by the ministry staff,” said Milloy. “Everything nowadays is computer-based, and the app will give students up-to-date information.”
However, Sandy Hudson, chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O), said she felt the government’s efforts could have been directed elsewhere, namely, towards affordable and accessible education.
Milloy urged students to view the OSAP app as a single piece of a bigger plan.
“Obviously there is a concern about the financial part of OSAP,” he explained. “Adding a new app […] is one small step. Take a look at the big package. We are listening to students.”
While some remain sceptical about the effectiveness of the OSAP app, others hope it will help them stay on top of government loans and personal finances.
Sobia Subedar, a fourth-year communications major, said she has been using OSAP for two years and has accumulated roughly $10,000 in student debt.
“I would like [the app] too, just to keep track of everything,” she said, adding that a mobile app would help her stay better organized with her finances.
Milloy said the majority of OSAP-reliant students have two main concerns: affordability and accessibility to information.
“All things were done to make life easier for students,” Milloy said of the several recent changes made to OSAP, including the early availability of applications as well as the waiving of interest fees during the six-month grace period after study completion.
“Obviously an app is a way to reach students and young people are the most familiar with technologies and using them.”
 


Fantastic. Students can know their gargantuan debt with the touch of their ipod or ipad. Perhaps Mr. McGuinty might want to consider a more comprehensive approach to provide affordable education.
Despite what students want to believe, the deficit that the McGuinty government is running is going to affect students. With a growing public debt, the costs associated with financing its debt will increase, thus taking a bigger piece of the budget.
Students should take note and demand their government reduce the deficit and the debt in the long run, to provide a more sustainable Ontario for the future.

With the impending closure of Founders College residence, some students are contesting the decision stronger than ever.
York administration confirmed the residence was set to close after the 2011 winter semester due to revenue loss. Some students, however, are vehemently opposed to this decision.
Robert Cerjanec, president of the Founders College Council, sent out an email early last week to the Founders community. The email outlined reasons why the residence should remain open for at least another year.
Cerjanec pointed out doing so would allow students and the York administration to thoroughly study the consulting report – a report which analyzes York’s student housing statistics – which will only be available in the spring.
“It’ll give a better analysis of housing at York and what York can do to boost the amount of people coming into residence,” said Cerjanec.
However, Gary Brewer, v-p of finance and adminstration at York, said the closure of Founders residence is simply to support an “operating efficiency.”
“At this point, the decision to take Founders off the list [of residences] for the upcoming year was based on the decline in applications for the residence at York,” said Brewer, who pointed out that Founders residence is home to the single largest vacancy level in all of York.
Currently, the vacancies in Founders College residence represent a $1.2 million loss in revenue for the university.
Cerjanec responded by stressing the difference between losses in revenue and a net loss.
“A loss in revenue doesn’t mean a net loss to the university,” said Cerjanec. “It just means they’re not getting in as much revenue.”
Cerjanec said the Founders community is planning on holding an open forum on Feb. 9 to discuss the pending closure. The forum will invite York administration to hear the concerns of the Founders community.
He also added that a letter-writing campaign directed towards the York administration is being organized, saying the community is adamant about keeping the residence open after this semester.
“Our [Founders] community is simply not happy with it,” said Cerjanec.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Sergeant Benjamin Anthony believes war with Iran is certain.
“I firmly believe that the time will probably come when Israel launches a strike on Iran,” said the heavy machine gunner, explaining Israelis are not willing to see Iran become a nuclear power.
“Our actions and deeds have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with politics, they’re merely the consequence of the universal desire to survive.”
Anthony came to York Jan. 24 as a part of his North American campus tour in support of his pro-Israeli advocacy organization, Our Soldiers Speak. He offered the audience his insights into current Middle-Eastern conflicts.
Personal security escorted Anthony to York’s Stedman Lecture Hall and refused to allow anyone to take his photo.
“I was told specifically to watch out for what would happen at York University,” he said; however, no protesters were in sight during Anthony’s speech on the Keele campus.
He said the goal of his speeches were to share the experiences of an Israeli soldier and proudly share his perspective on the Middle-Eastern conflicts with the rest of North America.
“I know precisely what transpires at the front lines of the battlefield,” he said.
“What I do aim to do, with your permission, is to transport you to the human side of warfare and to describe to you what actually transpires there, away from the gaze of the media. For, of course, the media does not live within the situations I aim to describe,” Anthony added.
He described the terror of warfare to students and the horrific wounds he and fellow soldiers endured during engagements like the 2006 Hezbollah rocket attacks in northern Israel.
He believes being an Israeli soldier is not a choice, but a duty.
“Can anybody believe – really believe – that this is a lifestyle we elect?” he said. “There is no glory to be found, and nobody should believe that there is.”

A male York community member reported to York security he was sexually assaulted while in a men’s washroom Jan. 19.
According to a Jan. 21 YLife article, around 1:30 pm, the community member was occupying a washroom stall in the basement level of the Curtis Lecture Hall when the unidentified aggressor allegedly reached under the stall divider and touched him.
The community member exited the washroom without any injuries and reported the incident to York security
The incident was not reported to police. Any witnesses are encouraged to contact York Security Services at 416-736-5333.

York University was ranked highly by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for its vegan-friendly meal options on both Keele and Glendon campuses. The school placed seventh among Canadian universities.
According to Anthony Barbisan, director of YU-card and Food Services, Campus Services and Business Operations, York submits its candidacy every year; he said receiving the rank “was a nice surprise.”
Barbisan told Yfile Jan. 21 that York is currently working out details of a new vegan express program, together with Aramark, the university’s caterer.
As of now, York offers 13 locations where students can enjoy vegan food.

News Department, with files from YFile
 


Interesting addition to PETA’s list although I’ve personally noticed a disconnect between being vegan and healthy. York lacks fresh organic food options and it would be too much to ask that come from our local farmers. Although not eating animals could be considered a healthy lifestyle choice, eating french fries hardly cuts it. 
United Way at York raised $140,000 toward its total goal of $200,000 this past week, and the charity campaign is entering its final phase.
Yvette Munro, York’s United Way campaign chair, told Ylife Jan. 20 that he is confident the York community will come together and reach the campaign goal.
“The amount raised will go a long way toward helping this city’s most vulnerable citizens,” said Munro.
Those willing to donate can do so by emailing uway@yorku.ca. Alternatively, money can be donated by calling 416-736-2100 ext. 44206.

Has the e-book format been a successful medium among York students?
“It’s still frankly a little confusing for students to figure things out and to make the choices. I wouldn’t call it a ‘big hit’ yet, but it’s growing as the market is growing. In other words, publishers are releasing more and more e-books and it’s growing.”
Steven Glassman, director of the York Bookstore
“It’s increased slightly in the past two years, but not dramatically. There is more of an interest now, especially this year with tablet [computers]. ”

Would you ever use an e-book reader to view course texts? 
“I like having the physical textbook for a lot of the classes because I find myself being able to pay attention more. But if it is a math course, where there are a lot of numbers, I don’t mind having it as an e-book reader. If it involves mainly reading, then I would want to have the physical textbook.”
Krishna Modi, first-year biotechnology student
“As long as [the files] don’t self-destruct. I know in the States there are laws against having products that just stop working so you have to buy a new version. It violates consumer law, so I’m not sure how far this is going to go before it self-destructs.”

Taking a walk through the 2011 Canadian International Auto Show? You may want to slap a brace over your chin — unless, of course, you prefer picking your jaw up off the floor every few minutes.
While this year’s Auto Show was admittedly not as big or impressive as previous years’ exhibitions, it is still a ton of fun, with hundreds of hot new cars for the auto buffs, some classics that you’ll stare at for hours and some outright oddities that’ll intrigue just about anyone. Here’re five of the coolest things I saw at the show.
1. Dancing electric car-loving polar bears (Nissan) [above]
It takes some logic to explain what, exactly, the bear is there for (car with no emissions equals no melting ice caps — equals happy polar bear?) but whatever the reason, he sure grabbed the media’s attention at the Nissan Leaf booth. It’s not every day you see a ten-foot mammalian predator hug a hatchback, I suppose.
(Nicholas Maronese)
2. Three-seat 750-horsepower Canadian-made supercars  (HTT Plethore LC-750, in the Concorsa Exotica)
I’m really digging the new Quebec-made HTT Plethore, which’ll be coming out next year. It’s got a three-seat layout with the driver centered in front of the passengers (the scissor doors don’t make it that much easier to get in). If this $495,000 Corvette-powered version doesn’t please, HTT president Sebastien Forest notes there’s a 1,300-horsepower model in the future.
You’ll find the car in the new Concorsa Exotica supercar exhibition on the 100 level of the North MTCC — it’s parked across from the vintage Lamborghini Miura and down the way a little, by the Aston Martin Rapide.
(Nicholas Maronese)
3. 1886 Benz Motorwagen three-wheelers — that work (Mercedes-Benz)
Okay, fine, it’s a replica, but the 1-hp tiller-controlled Motorwagen — recreated to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the automobile, as designed by Carl Benz — is still pretty neat. I’m thinking of taking up Mercedes Canada president Marcus Breitschwerdt’s offer to take me on a test drive — at a whopping 8.8 miles an hour. (“Where we’re going, we don’t need they didn’t have roads!”)
(Nicholas Maronese)
4. Growling V-8 Chevrolets and Pontiacs (Icons: Camaro and Firebird)
The Shelby exhibit last year blew me away, but these vintage and new Chevys aren’t hard on the eyes, either. The spotlight marque this year is General Motor’s Mustang-fighter, the iconic Camaro and Firebird. Examples include the legendary KITT Knight Rider Trans Am; a replica of Burt Reynold’s Pontiac from Smokey and the Bandit; and replicas of the new and old Camaros from the recent Transformers movie franchise.
Call me a car nerd, but I’ll skip those attention whores and go drool over the (also flashy) 1969 Camaro Indy Pace Car, thank you. Mmm, orange stripes never looked so good.
(Nicholas Maronese)
5. Unboring press conferences (now with 400 percent more auto enthusiasts!)
This is really just a peeve of mine: after four years of attending the show’s media days, you sort of begin to memorize the basic script each manufacturer’s executive reads off at their respective press conference podiums. (Unfortunately, they haven’t — a lot of them seemed to use teleprompter-style screens.) Honda started off like that, but then mixed it up by introducing us to four Civic assembly plant workers, including welder Jamie (pictured) who shared his story of what it’s like to work on, drive and tinker with Hondas — no script required. Why don’t more manufacturers just let auto enthusiasts, y’know, enthuse?

There’s nothing like controversy when it comes to trade season with the Maple Leafs.
It’s almost impossible to avoid, and impossible to stop, and with these last few days, for fans, it has definitely stepped up to the plate. 
It all started when Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke announced he was sending defenceman Francois Beauchemin back to the Anaheim Ducks in a trade for Joffrey Lupul, defenceman Jake Gardiner and a conditional 2013 entry draft fourth-round pick. Some turned their heads in anger, but most understood his decision.
And who can disagree?
For one, Beauchemin was expendable. As the roster stood, we already had one too many players like him (i.e stay-at-home defencemen who rarely, if ever, put the puck in the net). When you consider players like Schenn and Komisarek and the stable of very young and eager defencmen in waiting, we could afford to part with Beauchemin. Many people probably adored him personally, but people can get over that.
But this trade was also a steal because we got some great players in return.
In Joffrey Lupul we get a former first round draft pick with a lot to prove. He is anxious to win and is hungry for success after being drafted seventh overall in 2002 with little to show for it. Despite his lack of early success, he is an undeniable threat that’ll give beleaguered coach Wilson a few more options up front.
  Before Lupol, we had a problem: one solid and consistent offensive line, anchored by unsung Kulemin and Grabovski, and nowhere to put Phil Kessel. Now we have two serious threats to opposing teams and a more balanced roster. It was a calculated risk with little downside, and for Lupol alone it was worth it.
  The other upside, of course, is the draft pick and prospect Jake Gardiner. Given the often-publicised sentiment Brian Burke is in the player development business, one could almost be excused for thinking these assets were the real steal in the trade. In today’s National Hockey League (NHL), a draft pick is as good a currency as any, and Gardiner is expected to be top four one day. 
  Overall, the first trade picks were something everyone could agree on, but then Monday came and it was a different story.
  In an apparent attempt to outdo even himself, Burke followed up what many considered a dumb move by trading key off-season acquisition Kris Versteeg to the Philadelphia Flyers for a first and third-round pick in this year’s draft. 
  This trade has sadly been met with mixed results. Many believe Versteeg is an integral part of our team moving forward, and at only 24 and having just come off a Stanley Cup run with the Chicago Blackhawks, it was easy to see why. Unlike the last deal, which seemed to be in line with team policy and a step towards the playoffs, this trade seemed to signal the team’s demise and betray the thoughts of a general manager who doesn’t believe. Philadelphia’s first place positioning means our picks will be on the low end, and that does not help.
  Despite early criticism, though, this is yet another brilliant move, and here’s why.
  Admittedly, I liked Versteeg and had even committed to him being in the Blue and White for some time. Despite the emotional attachment, though, one cannot escape the fact that he wasn’t working in Toronto. 
  Despite his age, potential and early success, Versteeg never managed to find a home beyond the third line, and could never seem to capture the stride that saw him hoist the Cup last spring. Burke recognized this and made a move when Versteeg’s value would arguably never be any higher as a Maple Leaf. 
  Burke essentially called a mulligan on a decision he made last summer. Take solace in the fact the man has a plan and is not afraid to correct even his own mistakes. 
  Despite a season of strife on the ice, this is a step forward for the Maple Leafs. Rest easy, Leafs Nation – we are still in good hands.

“Most troubling”
opinions» jan.12, 2011
Grossly offensive Paul Izdebski
I find it grossly offensive and seriously misleading that my letter carried with it a “familiar stench.”
Adir Dishy is the president of an organization at York that no doubt has a budget larger than most clubs at York; again I bring to the stage the example of being able to afford a large ad in the Excalibur in defence, and in attack of another who protested against Hasbara at York.
Dishy suggests that I am no doubt anti-Semitic as a Polish person, and I find these accusations racist. According to Dishy, only Polish people use terms like “rich Jews” and speak of their de facto control of the media.
He did not take the time to address the questions I raised in my letter and merely played the only card he is familiar with: accusations of a “familiar stench” and anti-Semitism.
I stand by my observations that Hasbara is over-represented, and this is directly related to their funding by not only the university but – as suggested by the late professor David Noble – by the State of Israel also.
Prof. Noble would roll over in his grave after reading your response, Mr. Dishy.

Like daybreak waiting for horizon’s mercy
And the moon…
We all wait for the moon to rise
Just to hold on to a sure thing

Traveling 25,000 miles
To your ready retina
But I am waiting on a truth
From zero distance

With the sheer force of my silence
Not afraid to collapse
Into whatever truth you choose to share
Please write your ink on my road map veins
Place your echo into my mason jar heart

Time eater, night dreamer
I’m tired of being numb to your possibility
Moon dancer, star chaser
 
I’m waiting on a truth
More real than anything I can ever give words to
So lend me your truth
That it may be weaved into the fabrics
Of something so unstable
It will shape shift our moon rock hearts
Into once again believing

A new student group campaign is encouraging York University to divest from companies they think violate international human rights laws, but the administration argue their stake in those companies gives them a voice they can use to change unethical business practice.
A recent report from the Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), “Holding York University Accountable,” pressed York to withdraw its endowment and pension fund investments and refrain from reinvesting in BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, manufacturers of components for Israel’s F-16 Falcon fighter jets; and from Hewlett-Packard, who supply Israel’s military with computers.
SXC.HU
In the report, SAIA says that by investing in companies that manufacture weapons “used to kill and maim Palestinian civilians,” York may be complicit “in the commission of crimes under international law.”
Trudy Pound-Curtis, assistant to the vice-president finance, explained York doesn’t actually choose which particular stocks it invests in, but only selects an investment manager.
“What we do, however, is provide each manager with our mandate,” said Pound-Curtis. “Included in that mandate is that they take into consideration environmental, social and governance factors in their formulas.”
The university’s “best practice” policy on investments, built on advice from major consulting firms, forbids “negative screening” or divesting from particular companies.
“[Mercer Ltd. consulting] believe the best approach to make a difference is through something called ‘active engagement’ where we would have our managers engage with managers in those companies’ behaviours, and we’ve built that into our investment philosophy,” said Pound-Curtis. “If we give up our stock, we have no vote, no say, no anything.”
But SAIA’s Katherine Lapointe thinks the university is using corporate rhetoric to complicate the situation.
“York can, and is indeed under the obligation to, instruct the investment manager to refrain from investing in companies based on defined criteria, including compliance with international law and respect for human rights,” she explained. “York cannot hide behind the fund managers and pretend that there is no problem. It is York’s money, and it is York’s ethical obligation.”
Lapointe said the university’s investment philosophy is inherently flawed.
“As long as our university remains invested in companies that profit from war crimes, it continues to make a mockery of its stated commitments to human rights and social justice,” she said. “‘Active engagement’ is a very
slow and ineffective tool [and it’s] not possible at all when the company’s main business is to manufacture weapons which are, by definition, death machines.”
Omar Dominguez, chair and co-founder of the Coalition of Universities for Responsible Investing, said York is on the right track.
“Issues like military spending are bound to be controversial,” he said. “But if you divest from these companies, it really leaves you out of an opportunity to negotiate with the companies and try to address your concerns.”
Nevertheless, Dominguez appreciated SAIA’s efforts to include students in these discussions.
“We encourage universities to combine the university trustees – who are ultimately responsible for these decisions – with faculty who have expertise on the very issues, to include the views of students, who are some of the beneficiaries, and to include multiple stakeholders,” he said of his coalition’s goals.
Pound-Curtis also pointed out that since they switched investment managers in late February, York is no longer investing in Hewlett-Packard or Northrop Grumman, and that they have not invested in Lockheed Martin since August 2010.
In fact, York is currently invested in only one of SAIA’s four target companies, BAE Systems, via the university’s pension fund.
“We’ve about a million dollars [in BAE Systems] out of our total pension fund, which is $1.4 billion dollars – it’s insignificant,” said Pound-Curtis. “We will have a discussion with our investment manager to ask if they’d considered any of the facts [of SAIA’s report].”
Lapointe emphasized that York has not yet promised not to reinvest in these companies.
“Pound-Curtis has not addressed any of the three demands of our divestment campaign,” she said.
Anne Bayefsky, a political science professor at York University who specializes in international human rights, thinks the campaign is wrongheaded because of its focus on Israel as an apartheid state.
“Israel, like all states, is entitled to the rights of self-defense,” she explained. “Efforts to deny Israel’s right to self-defense are, in fact, the inverse of the declared intention of people concerned with apartheid because it would deny the Jewish people a homeland where they can find protection and security.”
In their report, SAIA compares Israeli policy to apartheid South Africa, citing a study, “Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?” by the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. But Bayefsky thinks the evidence points in the opposite direction.
“Everyone should be concerned about human rights, but we have to take a good hard look at the facts,” she said. “The evidence clearly indicates that Israel – a country where one-fifth of the population is Arab with full democratic rights and representation at the highest levels of Israeli society – is not an apartheid state.”

Am I seeing things, or is there a hideous misuse of the possessive apostrophe in the title?
Hi Harrison! Long time?!
Not a hideous misuse if you pretend that “group’s” is supposed to be followed with “policy”.
Is it just me or does excalibur give wayyyyyyy too little space to any group that stands in solidarity with Palestine in their paper? One and a half sentences from a SAIA spokesperson and half an article of b.s from the admin and blatant lies from a “professor” at York, Who’s obviously working with Hillel.
Is it a prerequisite for editors that they must be in love with Israel? Maronese, in his piece does a bad job hiding his bias and clear attempts to mislead readers. The group in this article is not asking for divestment from companies that they “feel” vioates international law. These findings have been made by experts of International law: academics, UN investigations, Amnesty International, Human rights watch have found Israel’s actions and the bodies that support it are in constant violation of international law.
Excalibur, readers are tired of this open love for apartheid.
I agree, Steve. Just google the professor Anne Bayefsky. She is a pretty outspoken Israel sympathizer. I understand that the writer of the article felt that they were balancing SAIA with this professor, but it’s actually unbalanced.
Using a professor’s (expert’s) comments against a student group’s comments is not leveled. Why not get Dr. Rahnema to comment? After all, he only teaches the most popular course on Israel/Palestine Relations in all of York. Or any other political professor who specializes in Middle East Politics?
The end of this article is atrocious. Bayefsky’s blatant apologetics are just embarrassing and shouldn’t be taken seriously at all. They’re clearly tacked on and they completely divert focus away from rest of the piece.
Also, the most verbose lead in existence
Um… since when is a country democratic when it has already titled itself as a “Jewish State”. The dominating ideology and bias is clear in that alone, and does not in any circumstance create a space for democracy.
I am really glad to see this dialogue at York and online. These are important questions for universities and their communities.
I want to invite you to the 1st national symposium to examine social and environmental issues affecting university investments (June 21, 2011, Victoria, BC).

If you have ever parked in The Village while you dash off to your three-hour class to avoid having to pay York University’s parking fees, one day you might find a bright yellow ticket slapped to your windshield.
Parking by-laws in the streets around The Village at York neighbourhood south of campus changed recently, from a maximum three hours to one hour between 8 am and 8 pm. According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.

The new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.
When the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed
information.
The new by-laws have left some York students furious.
It’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.
“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”
Many students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.
Councillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.
“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.
He urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.
“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”
Peruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.
Students that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.
The university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.
“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.
According to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.
With the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from  8 am and 8 pm.
York currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.

York Federation of Students (YFS)  executive director Jeremy Salter and YFS president Krisna Saravanamuttu are at University of Victoria (UVic) campus this week where, according to a Facebook event titled “The Big CFS Debate at UVIC,” Salter was set to engage in a debate regarding the recent referendum as a speaker for the “yes” side – he would be arguing UVic should not break away from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS).
Gemma Karstens-Smith, Editor-in-Chief for UVic’s student newspaper the Martlet, confirmed there’s a heavy CFS presence on campus at the moment.
UVic’s student union – University of Victoria Students’ Society (UVSS) – chairperson James Coccola noted there are “a lot of people from the ‘yes’ side who have been brought to campus to campaign on this and there’s a lot of resources behind this side.”

The UVSS has officially endorsed the “no” side, implying the current board believes it is not in the best interest of students to continue to be
part of the CFS.
Coccola said he was aware there was going to be a number of people flown out to campaign for the CFS during the
referendum.
“It’s happened at every school [that votes to defederate from the CFS] […] it’s quite common, so it doesn’t surprise me at all that Jeremy’s here,” he said.
Coccola also suggested York students should reflect on the fact their student union executive director had flown out to “campaign on the other side of the country, something that arguably doesn’t affect York students.”
“This is a referendum for UVic students. Why would someone from York be able to speak to the issues that UVic students are facing?” questioned Coccola. “Not all issues are the same across the country, despite what people say.”
When asked about whether the YFS covers the expenses for its members to travel to other campuses during a CFS referendum, Saravanamuttu responded via email, “The answer is no.”
Saravanamuttu couldn’t comment on who did, in fact, pay for the trip.
According to UVic student David Foster, there have been attempts for many years to break from the CFS.
“We don’t get a lot of value for our money, and the money could be better used in another way or even just by putting it back in our pockets,” said Foster. “This year we’re using even less of the CFS services than we ever have.”
He explained that UVic students do not use the CFS health plan, website services, and, since they found a company that could produce yearly handbooks at a lower cost than the CFS, even the handbook service has gone unused.
Karstens-Smith added that the referendum has been a long time coming for the university.
The original petition to begin a referendum was circulated by a number of students and began in 2009, but was declared invalid by the CFS because of a counter-petition started by the former UVSS.
According to Coccola, both petitions were submitted to CFS, which used the second petition to deny a referendum, although there was no way to tell which petition was signed first or whether students knew what type of petition they were signing.
The issue was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada in November, where the judge ruled the petition valid.
Nevertheless, the CFS began claiming the UVSS owed a debt to the CFS from the ’90s to the tune of  $129,000. CFS bylaws state that student unions cannot have a referendum if they owe any outstanding membership fees.
Nevertheless, the court granted and set a date for the referendum on the basis that the debt was released by the CFS two days prior to a court date.
“The judge ruled it prejudicial and said they could not submit the affidavit and that they should’ve done so sooner – they had plenty of time to do so,” said Coccola.
The campaign period for the referendum started March 21 while the voting period started March 29 and ends March 31.
While Excalibur obtained a photo of Saravanamuttu on the UVic campus, Karstens-Smith said that Salter avoided all photos.
“Is he trying to hide the fact he’s here or something? Because we can definitely confirm that he is,” stated Karstens-Smith via e-mail.
Excalibur attempted to reach both Salter and Saravanmuttu by phone, text and email regarding these issues but did not get a comment from them as of publication.
Salter has a very strong tie to the CFS, and received an ‘A’ in a report card-like document accidentally released by CFS-British Columbia about three years ago. The document ranked CFS members based on loyalty, and recommended which members would be well-suited to advocate at universities holding a CFS defederation referendum.
When  Salter was president of Continuing Education Students at Ryerson (CESAR), he helped along the referendum to make CESAR a permanent member of the CFS. He was also the former Northern Ontario Commissioner for CFS-Ontario, while he served as the Lakehead University Student Union president.
 


Jeremy Salter also came to the University of Regina to campaign for the ‘yes’ side last October. We questioned then, how can the Executive Director be gone from work, campaigning in Saskatchewan for three weeks?
Thanks for the coverage, Excalibur! Happy to say that your students will be returning to their home campus shortly, as UVic voted overwhelming to defederate, removing the CFS and their representatives from our campus. Kindest regards from the west coast, from a ‘NO CFS’ side supporter.

TAHIR: Why the name “SlutWalk”? Wouldn’t people find it offensive?
TEEKAH: If folks were to try and bury this story and shove it under the carpet, all that does is replicate and increase the power words like “slut” have. We want to confront this power and change it. By calling it SlutWalk, we are acknowledging his comment – and want to open up dialogue. We can take concepts “slut” points to – women having sex, who should have sex and what kind of women there should be – and completely rework these concepts in the interest of an actual gender-equal world.
TA: What’s the aim of this event?
TE: One of our main aims is to reappropriate the word “slut.” We are also looking for increased transparency, accountability and greater anti-oppression training for police. We are coming to this with a politic that can mean different things for different people who attend the march.
TA: Some might call it an overreaction to blame the entire police force for a reckless comment made by one officer.
TE: When a police officer puts on the uniform of the police force, he is not a lone person. For York and the Toronto police to select this officer to come and speak for “campus safety awareness” events, they are sending him as a rep of the Toronto police. Police officers are the result of police culture and training. Either the culture indirectly supports his point of view, or the training does not do a good enough job to train out of them this ignorance.
TA: How important is SlutWalk Toronto?
TE: We are not doing this event to say, “Fuck the police.” We are looking to have a dialogue with them, to open up real interaction between them and the community they serve. We want to improve their approaches toward minority groups, and make change for the better. This march is one of the steps in that process. We’ve had enough of these cases. It’s time to do something real and tangible about them.
TA: What kind of changes to attitude are you looking for?
TE: It’s easier to blame the victim than to look at the larger picture. Why are we telling women to police their bodies, to stay indoors, to dress in certain ways while men have absolutely none of this “policing” on them? Victim blaming actually works to support the rapist. How can you say that a rapist is ever “justified” in raping? We need to start looking at the larger picture – sexism in different places – and how these sources that spawn things like rape are not being addressed.

People all live with viruses, most of them benign; when these harmful tunes infect the brain, the average listener displays no signs of being completely subsumed by unexceptional music. They’re sort of like the sonic version of the human papillomavirus: symptoms don’t always show up, though the results can be deadly.
But creating public awareness for devastating viruses is not my intention – it’s to establish awareness in regard to the rapid spread of bad music (in most cases anything that falls under the umbrella of “mainstream”) and its ultimate destruction of formerly genuine bands.
Instrumental band Scale The Summit at one of their tour stops in Austin, Texas. (Prosthetic Records)
Let’s scale the summit of reason, shall we? To back up my salvo of accusations and labels, I’ve formed an armada of alternatives, a formidable flotilla of funk and folk that will freak your frontal cortex. My smart bomb comes in the form of an unorthodox, independent-minded group of people that helped build up a genre and simultaneously smash it down with complicated chord progression, sporadic melodies and overall awesomeness.
Scale The Summit is out with their latest album, The Collective.
Formed in 2004, Scale the Summit has peaked on many music charts and weathered many attacks from their perch, but they’re far too high up this mountain of musical mastery to notice the petty criticisms from down here. Ass-kissing, you say? Maybe, but the accolades are well deserved.
What sets Scale the Summit apart from other bands in the same metal subgenre is their lack of vocals. ‘Instru-metal’ is their brand of vocal-free metal, and they make up for the vocals elsewhere. The music literally speaks for itself, and lacks nothing in the frontman department.
Even more astounding is how young the band members are. Their average age is just 22, so they’ve many years ahead to develop as a band. If they’re at this level now, imagine their progress in five, 10 or 20 years.
Their stylistic elements are peculiar and wonderful. The music is hard with moments of softness, always maintaining a level of complexity even in simple harmonies. It maintains a happy atmosphere, something metal bands before them have seldom achieved. Songs like “Gallows” should be listened to on headphones while walking down a sunny street. Certain parts of the songs scream uncertainty, while the mood is cemented in the very atmospheric quality of “Colossal,” the opening track of The Collective.
Whereas many bands have to rely on sound editing to get their cohesive, unified quality, Scale the Summit has it on their own. It’s a quality that makes for outstanding live performances: all of the musicians are constantly on the same wavelength.
Taking time to savour The Collective is a transcendental experience of self-reflection, comparable to the effects of psychedelic drugs. Many fans of the band have described their music as a journey, a form of exploration both musically and personally for the individual; drifting into oneself after listening to the entire album is easy. Scale the Summit’s music lends itself to introspection, and that’s why critics have coined the term “adventure metal” to replace the tired old horse that is “progressive metal.” I’m not knocking the “prog,” but change is good.
Everyone’s level of musical knowledge and fondness is different and we listen to music for different reasons. For those unseasoned listeners, your level of critical listening isn’t the same as that of a professional. You may not pick out the minuscule elements of each song, but you don’t need to be an expert to enjoy expertly performed music.
What is bad music? What is good music for that matter? The subjectivity is the attraction to the medium – what’s certain is that The Collective will take you on a musical journey through passages of the mind rarely ever examined, without ever having to leave the comfort of home.

Nina Arsenault has spent a fortune changing her appearance from male to female. The 37-year-old used to work in the sex trade, but now supports herself as a playwright, performer and motivational speaker to queer youth. Her one-woman show, The Silicone Diaries, recently had a second highly successful run in Toronto, was later performed in Montreal and will open in Vancouver next year.
MCLAUGHLIN: Where did you grow up?
ARSENAULT: In Beamsville, Ontario in the Golden Horseshoe Trailer Park. It was a really tight knit community. My memories of it are just great. But we moved when I was about six to a house in Smithville. It was very difficult to make friends because I was so feminine. Growing up in the trailer park and going to school with those kids, they always knew how girlish I was. With everyone on top of each other you have no choice but to accept people. [Then I moved and] being the new kid it was very, very difficult to make friends. I have been a bit of a lone wolf all my life.

M: In The Silicone Diaries you talk about seeing a female mannequin in a store at age five. What was it that affected you that day?
A: I think just the harmony and symmetry of the face spoke to me. I knew that I was a girl inside but I had this boy body. Then, for my visual gaze to rest upon a face that was a sculpture of a woman’s face, I just seized on that as a child. It affected me, the perfection of it.
M: When did you decide to begin plastic surgery?
A: About age 23, but I didn’t have my first procedure until I was 25.
M: What did you have done?
A: At first, just transsexual procedures to feminize myself. It got to a point where I looked as much like a normal woman as I possibly could; however, I still had masculine features. It was really traumatic on a daily basis to see those features. So I made the decision to really push the cosmetic procedures, knowing I would no longer look natural, that I would start to look plastic and artificial.
M: Like a mannequin?
A: Yeah. But I can’t say at the beginning of the journey I was trying to look like a mannequin or a Playboy bunny. I was just trying to be a woman.
M: Did you literally have 60 surgeries?
A: There were actually more. Some were just procedures, like a lip injection.
M: When was the last one?
A: In 2006.
M: How much did they cost?
A: Upwards of $200,000.
M: How did you afford that?
A: I was working in the sex trade and made an incredible amount of money so quickly there.
M: Men like “shemales”?
A: Yeah. In terms of supply and demand, there just aren’t a lot of us, but there’s a lot of interest. The first day I put my escort ad in the paper, I had 250 calls. I don’t think that’s something that’s spoken about that openly amongst otherwise heterosexual men. I could have worked from morning until night if I had wanted to.
M: What was it like working in the trade?
A: It was physically very tough. And I only did oral, no fucking.
M: A lot of transgender women work in the sex business. Why is that?
A: It’s one of the few places you can get work and feel safe. If you’re visibly transgender you’re going to be one of the most disenfranchised and disadvantaged people in culture.
M: You have two graduate degrees, right?
A: I do. But it’s tough to get straight work. You can’t imagine the amount of transphobia out there.
M: How long have you been out of the trade?
A: About three years. I support myself now as a performer.
M: In the play you mention that you have had your testicles removed. But you kept your penis. Why was that, if your goal was to be as close to a woman as possible?
A: I never knew what would happen to me financially so [if I still had my penis] I could always return to the sex business.
M: What has the play done for you?
A: It has been an incredibly healing ritual. I think I wrote it because I had a lot of emotional angst and suffering that I needed to express, that I needed someone to bear witness to. It makes me stronger every time I perform it.
M: Do you feel 100 percent female now or still a bit male?
A: I’ve always known I was a woman but I was socialized as a male. I have some qualities people see as male – I’m an aggressive thinker – but my core is definitely female.
M: Do you feel beautiful enough now?
A: I don’t work on the outside anymore. I concentrate now on inner work.
M: Any more surgeries ahead?
A: No. Not until I start to really visibly age.

Increasingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, you’ll find doctors and health care professionals turning to the ancient disciplines of meditation to deal with mental health disorders.
Meditation is the most well-known – and certainly one of the most thoroughly studied – forms of medicine practiced by the Tibetan Buddhists for centuries.  Personified by the dignified and solemn Dali Lama for over 25 centuries, meditation has become a method of refining and exploring the inner self, probing and navigating inner space in much the same way we have preferred to examine our outer.
Spending just a few minutes to mediate can help you relive stress that comes from a busy scheduel. (SXC.HU)
“The monks, we believe, are the Olympic athletes of certain kinds of mental training,” said Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist from the University of Wisconsin who, as part of a select group of scientists and scholars, travelled to Dharamsala in 2000 to attempt to dissect problems of distress and human suffering.
He analyzed 150 ordinary brains and compared them to the brain of a monk, and discovered a monk’s brain was simply more active on the left, which represented happiness. “This is tantalizing evidence that these practices may indeed be promoting beneficial changes in the brain,” concluded Davidson.
Zindal Segal, a psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health who uses meditation to treat patients with mood disorders, finds that though we may never be able to reach the same heights as Buddhists who spend 10,000 hours sitting and meditating by just spending time clearing out minds we may be able to feel better.
“We’re talking about paying attention, we’re talking about returning wherever our minds are to this present moment. These are things that we all have. We don’t have to earn them, we just have to find a way of clearing away the clutter to see that they are already there,” said Dr. Segal.
The key to meditation is to slow the mind down and examine one’s thoughts and thinking processes and connect that to the present moment. “[Meditation is] a way of training yourself to pay attention in the present moment without judgement [as] to what your experience is,” said Dr. Segal in a Globe and Mail article.
The health benefits are still very much debated, but researchers have found that meditation is good for relieving stress, and dropping blood pressure. This form of medicine changes someone’s attitude from sour to positive and can go a long way especially in our busy lives. “Meditation is a set of practices that have been around for more than 2,500 years, whose principal goal is to cultivate these positive human qualities, to promote flourishing and resilience […]” said Davidson.
At first glance this may seem simple, but it has been shown to be just as effective as antidepressants in treating and preventing depression relapse, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The next time you are feeling blue, or stressed over exams, you shoulder consider your inner strength before popping a pill.

Final exams may drive you to the edge of sanity, but compared to what Norio Ota, director of Japanese studies at York University, went through at his Japanese high school, our academic lives are a cakewalk.
“When I was going through the entrance examinations, it was called ‘the exam from hell,’” said Ota. “I had to work until two to three in the morning every single day because I had to study for ten or twelve subjects at the same time, and then get up 6:30a.m. and go to school.”
He could tell I was shocked. Ota shook his head with a dismissive smile, “I wasn’t exceptional. Many people had to study the same way. We had a saying: If you sleep for four hours, you will fail the entrance exam. You have to sleep only for three. Seriously.”
It’s difficult for me to imagine an educational culture so different from my own.
“Well, many people went through this in Japan at those times. We thought about dying, and all those things, because the pressure was just enormous.”
“It was okay for me because I thought of it as one hurdle I had to overcome.”
Decades later, Ota still works until 2 or 3 am many days of the week, teaches overtime, trains high school teachers across Canada via videoconferencing, and recently helped coordinate a new Japanese language program at Havana University.
His peaceful smile, balanced demeanour and humility gave me the impression of self-awareness, dedication, and a man truly in love with his work.
“I feel appreciated by other people – I think that’s a source of work ethic for me,” said Ota. “It’s not just culturally ingrained. I love what
I do.”
A certain school of Western psychologists, however, might use a different word to describe his behaviour.
Workaholism.
Work·a·ho·lic (n. circa 1968)
The term workaholic has been used informally to refer to white-collar and public service workers who ‘work too hard’ since it was coined in 1968 by American psychologist Wayne Oates.
However, there has been much academic discussion about what the term actually means in a clinical context, and considerable difficulty reaching a consensus.
Some early studies in workaholism looked at workers’ attitudes toward their jobs, while others focused on their behaviour, i.e. the number of hours worked per year. For example, Mosier (1983) defined a workaholic as someone who works more than 50 hours a week regardless of his psychological condition; Cherrington (1980) defined a workaholic as having an “irrational commitment to excessive work”; Machlowitz (1980) focused on the workaholic’s positive enjoyment of work.
Later studies attempted to place workaholics on a spectrum of “work involvement, a feeling of being driven to work, and work enjoyment”, differentiating between workaholics who enjoy their work and those who resent it.
The ‘Japanese Work Ethic’
The Japanese have a reputation for outworking their Western counterparts. But do the numbers support anecdotal evidence like professor Ota’s high school entrance exam experience? Is Japan a nation of workaholics?
At Japan’s economic peak, the numbers indicated a resounding yes. In 1980, Japanese worked an average of 2121 hours a year while Canadians and Americans both worked just over 1800. To put that in perspective, if you took two weeks of vacation, you would have to work about 8.5 hours every day – not including breaks – to meet the Japanese average.
While cultural collectivist attitudes are sometimes cited, Ota explained there is a clear economic explanation for this phenomenon.
“For a long time, until the beginning of the bubble economy, many [Japanese] worked for the same company until they retired. That was the source of loyalty in the company. These people worked really hard because they identified with the company.”
Overworking was such a serious issue that a word, kar?shi, was coined in the late ’80s to describe death or suicide attributed to work-related stress. Kar?shi prompted the Japanese government to begin research initiatives and enact legislation to force workers to take holidays.
Today, the problem is less severe, but over 10,000 continue to die from kar?shi every year – almost as many causalities as the March 11 earthquake crisis this year.
White collar workers and high level executives are among the most vulnerable. Even pre-university students, who are exposed to high levels of stress, are affected by kar?shi; Japanese students have one of the highest suicide rates for their age group in the world.
Bursting the Bubble
Westerners continue to view Japan as a workaholic society, but the trend may be changing.
In 2009, Japanese workers laboured an average of 1714 hours a week – only 15 more than Canadians – and actually less than American workers, who worked 1768.
This statistic forces us to rethink typical stereotypes about cultural pre-dispositions and look at economic factors in defining trends in
overworking.
“After the economic bubble burst, what happened was that Japanese companies started laying off and firing people, so the so-called life-time employment system has collapsed since then.” said Ota. “Many people felt the same way I did: ‘Why should I spend my whole life working for a big corporation?’ A different value orientation was introduced. Not all at once, but gradually.”
While Japanese workaholism may be subsiding, for Canadians, there are no signs the problem is going away. Since workaholics tend to be high-functioning members of society, their problems often go unnoticed.
Bryan Robinson, PhD., author of the best-selling Chained to the Desk, thinks the subject is, at least in some ways, taboo.
“Cultural attitudes towards workaholism have changed very little,” said Robinson. “In a downturn economy, where people are desperate for jobs, they don’t want to talk about working too much.  Plus, with the advent of wireless technology, electronic devices are invading personal time more than ever before.”
A lot of the problem is awareness.
“People still don’t get how damaging work addiction is. It continues to be praised and misunderstood, especially in a time when many people don’t have jobs.”
According to Robinson, university environments are particularly at risk, and desperately need to take action.
“Universities are notorious for enabling work addiction with huge expectations and very few boundaries […] Universities and any workplace at risk for burnout should be encouraging self-care among faculty, not expect multi-tasking, which only activates the stress response, and they should hold seminars on the dangers of overworking and the damage done to marriages and children.”
Robinson found it hard to think of a North American campus he could hold up as a positive example. “I don’t know of any who are doing it right,” he said.
A Positive Outlook
In a very personal moment, I described my own struggle with workaholism to professor Ota. I spend up to 15 or more hours a day working at Excalibur as a designer, a writer and a manager, an ethic that differs little from the way I’ve approached my work since middle school.
Despite all of this negativity, not everyone views intense commitment to work as a bad thing. The key to staying healthy and balanced for an intense worker, he said, is passion and
humility.
“I used to think I worked for self-satisfaction; it was only after an important person in my life died that I realised, actually, my life is not for myself. When you can feel your life is not for yourself, all negative feelings like anger, jealousy, everything disappears. Once you reach that stage, you keep your peace of mind.”
I told him maybe this was true, but my drive to work sometimes took over the rest of my life.
“You are part Japanese, remember,” he laughs, referring to my one-quarter Japanese background. “It’s in your blood!”

York is changing the way students are affiliated with their colleges.
Under the old regulation, residence students were automatically affiliated with whatever college residence they moved into – if a student lived in Winters College during first year and moved to Vanier residence, their college affiliation would be automatically switched from Winters to Vanier. Even if students submitted a form to maintain their original affiliation, a glitch in the system would prevent the request from being realized.
The university has now fixed that glitch, and students may now successfully choose to remain with their original college after their first year, even if they decide to move residences.
“The bigger issue is after first year, should you still be forced to be affiliated with whatever college you live in or whatever college you choose?” said Founders College Council president Robert Cerjanec. “Under the current system, it almost tells you indirectly that if now you live in Calumet, you should be involved in Calumet. But you don’t have any connection with Calumet. You have a connection [with your original college].”
Vp students Rob Tiffin explained that the student information system would automatically change any college affiliation requests back to the college of residence due to a system pre-programming.
“Even if students could change, or request a change, we discovered it was slipping students back into [the college affiliation of the residence they were living in],” he said.  “We are going to make certain that that doesn’t occur [anymore].”
tudents must go through the registrar’s office to request to change college
affiliation.

York housing is planning a commuter floor in Tatham Hall at McLaughlin College.
The second floor of the college residence will be converted into a floor for commuter students to rent out for a night during the school year.
“[It will] offer York undergraduate students an overnight accommodation option,” said Debbie Kee, director of housing services. “The rooms will be available for students who plan to stay on campus late to study, or for students who are anticipating bad weather and do not want to commute.”
Kee said that the floor would include 16 single rooms and four double rooms, a total of 24 beds. While she said that the cost to rent the room have not been solidified yet, she estimated that it would probably be around $25 a night including tax.

2012-01-30,York,Israel,"Blogging and social media have positive psychological impacts, study finds

New research says blogging may have psychological benefits for teenagers suffering from social anxiety or low self-esteem.
The paper, “The Therapeutic Value of Adolescents’ Blogging About Social–Emotional Diffculties” by Israeli researchers Dr. Boniel-Nissim and Dr. Barak,  says writing a blog about social and emotional difficulties, having the blog open to responses, and interacting with readers leads to the biggest psychological improvement.
Blogging, the study says, is beneficial to teens and young adults in dealing with emotions. Contrary to cyberbullying fears, the blogosphere provides teens “with a safe area for self-exposure.” Blogging can “improve self-image, increase self-confidence, and gather friends.”
The study says blogging is considered ideal for anyone who is stressed, depressed, and anxious.
Psychologists have recommended writing in the past as a method of emotional venting and problem solving. Writing, the authors of the study say, “influences the emotional state, as well as the social behavior of the writer.”
But blogging is different from writing in a journal. “Online writing enables free expression, easy rereading and editing, and convenient communication with others,” the study goes on to say.
Bloggers are in control of the interpersonal conversation online. Teenagers can modify their thoughts and decide if they would like their blog to be open to other peoples’ posts. The interpersonal sharing with others helps teens reduce their social stress.
“The virtual environment gives [teens] a feeling of privacy and a sense of protection from exposure[…]or physical contact,” the study says, “which might be threatening in face-to-face encounters.” Bloggers can hide personal information from family and friends, but can engage in conversations with strangers who can give them advice.
Generally, teens are confident sharing their feelings online due to the anonymity and invisibility of the internet. Instead of seeing others’ reactions by sharing their problems publicly, they can focus on the content.  Because of this, blogging is a bigger release for teenagers.
In the study, a total of 161 teens participated, with 124 girls and 37 boys. They were asked to rate themselves by their level of self-esteem, peer relationship, and interpersonal activities. During the study, experts evaluated “the participants’ social–emotional condition” by reading their blog posts.
In total, participants were rated on 30 posts. The first and second group posted messages in their blogs on “their thoughts and feelings concerning their social circumstances and interpersonal relationships.” The first group opened their blog to others, the second did not. The third and fourth groups wrote “about any subject they wished.” The third group opened their blog to the public where the fourth group did not. To balance the study, a fifth group served as a control by writing entries in their personal diaries.
Unlike diarists, the study shows that, “online writers describe their writing process as a dynamic dialogue.”
Blogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter combine public and private worlds. Writers can construct identities online. By constructing their own identity, teens can manage the intimate details they choose to share or withhold from others.
Bloggers, the researchers imply, are in control even if their situation is spiralling out of control-—a comforting thought whenever a blog is updated.

The work of four illustrators visits the Zacks Gallery at Stong College with Fat Lines: A Drawing Exhibition

Fat Lines: A Drawing Exhibition showcases the work of four illustrators. John Janas, Ron Maloku, Alex Curci, and Mike Mclnroy present a shared ability to use the media of illustration, animation, and drawing to create powerful, interesting, and ultimately effective works. The exhibition, currently running at the Samuel J. Zacks Gallery, presents works with an expressive, attention-grabbing style.
Co-director of the gallery, Stas Guzar, explains that what interested him in hosting this exhibition was to bring recognition to up-and-coming artists.
“I feel as though drawing and illustration don’t get the attention they deserve, and can get lost amongst the other mediums,” Guzar explains. To him, each artist’s work is special in its own way.
Comic-book-style pieces are among the works Guzar focused on for the show. He was drawn to the works of Curci because of his ability to use this style and present, as Guzar describes it, “a duality in the image of technology and raw organics.” Located along the western wall, his ink and watercolour work presents many abstract concepts and depicts futuristic technologies.
The works of Janas, located along the southern wall, consist of pop-cultural icons in watercolour and comic book visual narratives. The calm colour scheme in contrast with the vibrancy of the bold black lines appeal to the viewer.
Mclnroy’s work further adds to the show’s atmosphere with his cartoon style and effective use of bold black ink. He presents interesting and humorous subjects in his works, including a modern-day take on the Three Little Pigs.
Presented along the northern wall are captivating images produced with India ink in an expressionistic style. The works of Maloku are powerful because of the unsettling feeling they create within the viewer.
“I particularly like the raw emotion these images create,” comments Guzar. “I find them effective in creating this raw emotion as a result of the loose stylistic essence Maloku used to produce them.” These works are powerful and appealing as a result of the grotesque images which captivate and intrigue the viewer.
Guzar describes the exhibition as “more conceptual than visual.” The works as a whole are effective because they are relatable on a universal level. This show allowed for a spotlight to be put on works that are bold and intriguing.

There will be some major changes to York’s administration come June 2012.
Rob Tiffin, vp students, will be stepping down from his position to take “an early retirement,” he said in an email dated January 24.
“A lot of people are sad,” says Rheza Evangelista, executive assistant to Tiffin.
Tiffin has been at York for about ten years, and was appointed to his current position in 2005. He began his post at York in the position as assistant vp enrolment management, coming to the job with about 30 years of experience on post-secondary education administration. He has served in a number of senior positions at the University of Western Ontario and at Brock University in addition to York.
Tiffin had been reappointed to vp students in July 2010, and was expected to sit in the position for five years.
“I leave knowing that we have a team that will play a pivotal role in supporting our students and the achievement of new goals,” wrote Tiffin.
According to Tiffin, the search for his successor will be undertaken shortly.

Another voyeurism incident has been reported at York.
Two female students contacted York security to report that a man had been lurking in the women’s washrooms in the Health Nursing & Environmental Studies building (HNES) around 11:45 a.m. The students alerted security at their booth in Central Square and a Toronto police investigator was called to the site.
When asked if the intruder matched the photos and description of the male at the two previous incidents at the Curtis Lecture Halls and Steacie Library, the students said they could not be certain it was the same person.
More to come.

Back-to-class look
Sometimes it is simple to pull on a hoodie, skip the make-up, and run to class. Can we leave this look for exam week when we’re slaving over exceedingly highlighted textbooks and overheated laptops?

Schulich Charity Association dazzles guests with annual fashion show. Photos by Jonathan Kim

Stepping into the Schulich Charity Association’s (SCA) fashion show was like stepping into another world. The green and purple lights, the techno music, and the number of people gathered in the room gave off a futuristic feel, which fit the forward-thinking purpose behind the show itself.
Hosted by the Schulich Charity Association (SCA), the SCA fashion show at The Underground on January 19 showcased the creative talents of York’s alumni and current students.
Jamal Yehia, the SCA’s director of internal logistics, noted that apart from their goal to  ensure that everyone had a good time, the fashion show was there to raise money.
“In terms of raising money, each dollar raised contributes to helping another person’s life,” says Yehia. Every year the SCA, composed primarily of business students, tries to pick one different charity to fund-raise for. This year they picked Ornge, an organization that provides medical transport such as airplanes and helicopters to patients both in the air and on the ground.
Throughout the night, bubbly co-hosts Rob Testa and the current SCA president Lamisse Younis, attempted to entertain the somewhat unresponsive audience, by telling jokes and performing magic tricks. Unfortunately, while the content of their skits was meant to be humorous, the delivery appeared to be highly staged and overly rehearsed. The transparency of Testa’s try-hard quirkiness coupled with the classy sophistication of Younis, however, provided a balance of personalities that made their run-of-the-mill routine satisfactory.
Several local York talents performed during the fashion show: singers Bianca Boldisteanu, Prachi, New Dimesionz Dance Crew, illusionist/magician Rob Testa, Jordan Woods and Sasha Ortega, and the talented and graceful Dia. While most of the acts were forgettable, the only act that really stood out was Dia. Her song and dance routine of “Quando, Quando, Quando” and her rendition of Adele’s “Someone Like You” were absolutely beautiful.
Backstage at the SCA fashion show, things were hectic and busy as half-naked models were running around, trying to race deadline. “It’s crazy back here trying to change,” says one model who was wearing a stunning summer dress designed by the Shweta.
When it came to the fashion designers, the show’s co-directors, James Ious HyunJun Kim and Mariam Siha went for versatile and striking designers.
Upon reviewing the overall show, the performances were unique in their own way. And though there were some awkward moments, the SCA charity fashion show was successful in the sense that it was able to raise money for charity and also in the sense that young local York-bred talents were given the exposure they truly deserved.
Here are the hits and the misses
Mighty Clothing by Richard Park
Richard Park’s collection included a variety of promo unisex T-shirts, which the young designer later admitted that he did not want to originally present at the fashion show. “I gave these shirts to the models, and I’m like ‘Here. Take them. Do whatever you want with them.’”
And his models certainly did whatever they wanted with them. The male and female models came out with different variations of the same T-shirt—ripped, cropped, cut, and tied. Thus, not only was this hot designer’s talent being showcased, but his selected models’ creativity was also under the spotlight. “I just wanted them to have fun with them,” says Park. Park’s line can best be described as comfy, but trendy, with just the right amount of urban flavour, similar to a hipster Drake.
Solace by Shweta Wahi
This adorable and experienced designer wins my award for the most versatile designer of the night. “I’m really stepping out of my comfort zone with these looks! I usually stick to solid colours!” says Wahi. Her work included a vivacious variety of original and colourful designs from cute spring and summer dresses featuring sexy corset backs to more risqué pieces like the leather jumpsuit, also featuring a sexy corset back. This designer managed to capture the perfect Jekyll and Hyde outfits in juxtaposing cute, yet sexy and sophisticated looks. Solace designs could best be described as boho-chic.
Emily Kowalik by Emily Kowalik
The artistic creations of Emily Kowalik were were well-received by several members of the female audience. Her collection included a variety of long and short skirts, as well as blouses with daring and sexy backs. This designer’s strength was certainly her eye for mixing the right fabrics together to create an artsy, yet elegant ensemble. The only weakness is that the designer failed to establish a wide range of colour. Most of her looks were pale shades of pink, brown, and beige.
Sophisticated without being straitlaced, her collection was certainly one of the most original and most classy showcases of the night. Her looks embodied the perfect amount of class and chic. Kowalik’s line can best be described as a feminine/classy American Apparel.
PadinaBondar by Padina Bondar
PadinaBondar’s spectacularly funky, yet classy designs perfectly capture a retro-chic aura. Bondar’s inventive and innovative designs perfectly expresses the term “new age vintage.” Her short and long evening gowns were simultaneously adorable and breathtaking.
The designer demonstrated a wide colour range that very few of the other designers had chosen to pursue. Padina Bondar’s line is part refined, part rave, part flirty, part bold, but a whole lot of fun. Her showcased selection includes highly detailed and embellished embroidery that she masterly tailored into whimsical and feminine evening attire. Padina Bondar’s line can best be described as funky-class.
Fabio Potere by Mohammed Islam
Next down the runway, we were introduced to Mohammed Islam’s collection of men’s sweaters. Apart from his collection of beautiful male models, Fabio Potere left a disappointing impression. Proper, but a bit pretentious, preppy with a twist of hipster, this collection really did not offer much variety in terms of gentleman attire, except for the leather tie. The leather tie, which surprisingly worked very well with the rest of the banal sweaters and cardigans, was the only jaw-dropper. Islam’s line can best be described as metropolitan day-wear or sexy Harry Potter, if you prefer.
Anonymous by Anonymous
Dark, yet alternative; Anonymous’ designs were very original. The designer principally employed monotonous shades of black, white, and grey and constructed some of the most creative, yet simple designs for men and women. Anonymous’ designs gave off a very goth-like, underground look.
Showcasing both men’s and women’s fashion, Anonymous’ designs offered a fair range of grungy, yet chic apparel. The Anonymous line just looked comfortable—a casual comfort that had exuded just enough elegance that the clothing could pass for a night out on the town. Unfortunately, about fifty per cent of Anonymous’ showcase was wearable, whereas the other fifty per cent? Well, let’s just keep that half anonymous. Anonymous designs could best be described as threadbare, but fashion-forward. 
Award-winning filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici’s documentary about terror bombing in Israel is about conflicts everywhere
Jasmine Saroya
Contributor

For many, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just another conflict of many. The loss of human life, of real people who occupy more than meagre lines on a ledger, is one we don’t often contemplate.
According to Simcha Jacobovici, three-time Emmy award-winning documentary filmmaker and the visionary behind Impact of Terror, our media reduces real human tragedies into numbers. His film about terror bombing screened in the Nat Taylor Cinema on January 17 for three separate film classes.
Jacobovici described his interest in making the documentary as having arisen after viewing much of the coverage of the Second Intifada, the period of Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 2000 to 2005.
“It was all about stats—it wasn’t about people,” Jacobovici said.
It is exactly this trend in journalism which he seeks to correct with his film. Centred on the 2001 Sbarro restaurant bombing in Jerusalem, the documentary explores the lives of the survivors and the relatives of the deceased three years after the attack.
At times, it is grisly, showing footage of the victims with blood streaming down their faces. At others times, it is emotionally draining, telling the story of one victim, a teenage boy, who developed an obsessive-compulsive tendency of constantly cleaning his clothes, believing that he would never truly be clean of the flesh and blood strewn across his body on that day.
The memories of that day still resonate for many of those victims. Interviewee Arnold Roth describes the situation in Israel as being an onslaught of “world-changing events, over and over,” and says that, “as a society [they] are going through earthquakes.”
Addressing the audience after the screening, Jacobovici commented on the lack of media coverage given to conflicts such as the Murle-Luo Nuer conflict in Sudan, or the ongoing conflict in the Congo.
“Do any of you know who the Murle people are?” Jacobovici asked. After no sign of a response, he continued to talk of the disparities in death tolls, and that the death tolls of aforementioned conflicts vastly outnumber that of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“What is the motivation [for this biased coverage]?” he asked.
Such are the kinds of questions raised by Impact of Terror, a film that ultimately exposes the true nature of all ongoing global conflicts, not just the one between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Whether the death toll for one conflict is higher than another is irrelevant. Every one of these conflicts deserves attention, because they concern the lives of real people—not statistics.

2012-03-28,York,Israel,"CRO says margin of error “less than one per cent” 
Tamara Khandaker

@anima_tk
The elections are over and the incumbent party has won by a clean sweep. But members of the challenging party have alleged that there are a number of flaws in the election process.
Mandy Yang, who ran for director of Schulich with the slate Free York University (FYU), approached Excalibur with concerns regarding the way polls were run, and a number of students have backed up her claims.
Yang says that there was potential for double voting, and that there were instances in which students were given fewer ballots than there were slots.
Vivian Chen says she initially voted for Yang, who is a friend of hers. A few days later, she was stopped by a York United candidate in Central Square who asked her if she would vote. Chen says she informed the candidate that she had voted for Yang already, but the candidate said she didn’t know who Yang was and insisted that Chen vote for her. Chen asked if she could vote for just one slot, and the poll clerks allowed it. She was not asked if she had already voted.
“I feel like there was a lack of administration. It didn’t happen properly,” she says.
When Chen told Yang that she voted twice, Yang thought she would see for herself if this was possible. After removing her campaign gear, she went to a poll in the Lassonde Building to vote for a second time.
Unlike her friend, she was asked whether or not she had already voted. Yang said no, and the poll clerk allowed her to proceed.
However, the election’s chief returning officer (CRO), Cécile Des Vignes, says it is extremely unlikely that any individual was able to vote twice or receive only one ballot.
“The margin of error was less than one per cent,” Des Vignes said in an email. “This could not have had any impact on the outcome of the elections.”
However, students Yuanyou Ma and Stefan Gatti-Cavanagh both say that they had difficulty voting for their own colleges. Ma was not given a ballot for her college, Calumet, and Gatti-Cavanagh had to go to a second polling station to be able to vote for his college, Vanier.
“They didn’t seem prepared very well,” says Gatti-Cavanagh, “I’m not sure if they were scamming everyone, I’m not sure what to feel.”
Hamid Osman, the YFS executive director, says that it is almost impossible for this to happen. He explains that the only confusion that arises when it comes to voting is when a student has a common name. But in these cases, the ballots are put into an envelope, and later cross-checked against their information.
Another student, Sangeung Jung, is also confused as to whether or not her vote was counted. She says the poll clerk could not find her name in the database, and she was given two envelopes to hold her ballots. This is done when someone has a common name, but on York University’s database, she is the only Sangeung Jung.
Regardless, Osman expressed confusion as to why Yang did not approach Des Vignes when she ran into these problems.
“I don’t understand why she would go to Excalibur first before coming to file a complaint with the CRO,” says Osman, who confirmed that Yang had not filed any formal complaints with Des Vignes. “If there were any issues, the CRO would have caught onto it,” he says. “It’s interesting that no one else from her team contested this.”
However, Yang is not the only person on the FYU slate who believes the process is flawed. Jonathan Jupiter, FYU president, says that he has noticed many problems which may deter students from running against the incumbent party in the future.
“At the end of the day, anyone campaigning deserves a fair election,” he says.
He does not think students were made aware of the fact that elections were happening, let alone taught how to vote correctly.
“A spoiled vote means that someone who doesn’t understand how to complete a ballot has voted, someone who was not educated about the process,” he says.
“People put up banners for Nas, for Frost Week, and Welcome Week. Why aren’t we promoting elections?” he asks. “Why can’t there be a display board of all candidates? Students aren’t aware enough.”
Jupiter also says that a lack of resources made campaigning considerably more difficult for FYU.
Nevertheless, Jupiter says he congratulates York United for their successful campaign.
“York United worked hard and did a great job, and I don’t want to take anything away from them. But I do want to improve on elections,” he says. “Why should we run when we don’t have a chance? That’s the message they’re sending out.”

Representatives from Students in Support of CUPE 3903 and JUST SAY NO TO STRIKE share their thoughts on the bargaining process

Students in Support of CUPE 3903
My name is Farshad Azadian. I’m one of the activists and a spokesperson for the group. I’m a fourth-year undergraduate psychology major.
JUST SAY NO TO STRIKE
I’m the co-founder of JUST SAY NO TO STRIKE. I’m a York graduate student, and part of CUPE 3903 Unit 3.
 
Support CUPE
We want to prevent the strike. The administration at the university tried to drive a wedge between students and workers last time, waited it out for several months, and allowed McGuinty to step in. This divide between students and workers resulted in a prolonged strike. None of the academics want to be on strike. They have bills to pay, too. Students and workers should be united to make the university listen. Shoukri makes nearly half a million each year. Give the workers a better deal, that’s our demand. Workers are expecting job security, and that’s unacceptable?
SAY NO
Our purpose is to provide students with information about the strike process that is not biased in a way that the CUPE updates are. They say things like “someone at the table is forgetting to bargain!” in their language. When they talked about the strike mandate vote, they told people just to vote yes. They never ask people to question or present alternatives. If you’re a client, we’re the ones signing their cheques. CUPE 3903 are employees, but also students. We are also encouraging students to prevent a strike before it happens.
 
Support CUPE
I was at U of T, and I transferred during the period of the strike. Actually at U of T, our union was bargaining as well. We ran a similar campaign to support CUPE 3902, and we pressured the admin. Students and workers were together. We collected up to 1,400 online and paper petitions, we brought it to the university […] at U of T, we prevented a strike. But at York, you had this strike that harmed education, hurt the workers, and you had stepping on labour rights.
SAY NO
I suppose if all the students decided to side with the union, the university would give in. But if the students sided with the university […] I think it works both ways. Union members could have done a better job not polarizing students. If they want to block the road, that’s fine. But I don’t want to talk to them. I remember one time I drove up to the entrance [during the 2008 strike], and one union member didn’t stop knocking on my window until I opened it, and she gave me her spiel. It’s not a good way to get students on your side. CUPE 3903, as opposed to U of T’s CUPE 3902, has had a lack of skills as far as communicating with the community. They come off as abrasive and off-putting.
 
Support CUPE
We’ve got a lot of support. We started over the past couple weeks, but already the NDP club, the sociology student association, and student activists support us. We started putting up posters and tabling, and a couple of dozen students are already on board.
SAY NO
I think people have used our website as individuals to vent about how they’re feeling. We haven’t had any groups approach us, but that’s not surprising because our point of view is an unpopular one at York University.
 
Support CUPE
You should be mad. Students should be mad and do something about it. York admin isn’t willing to give academic workers—thousands of them—basic wages and job security. Our education is being compromised. We appeal to students and undergrads to get involved with our campaign.
SAY NO
We’d like to encourage people to take action in whatever way they can. On either side, I think the clear thing is that we resolve the situation. Write a letter to your MPP, use Facebook, tell your friends, spread the word. Let your perspective be heard. 
The Idan Raichel Project coupled their campus performance with an intimate chat dedicated to their fans
Adelaide Strachan
Contributor
The Idan Raichel Project played to an intermittent audience of fans Monday afternoon. The performance consisted of an interview with Raichel and fellow collaborator, Cabra Casay, whose voice embodies her Ethiopian heritage and Jewish upbringing. The result is a breathtaking performance of cultures.
Raichel and Casay reminisce about the Idan Raichel Project’s humble beginnings in Raichel’s parents’ basement just outside Tel Aviv. Thus far, they have collaborated with more than 70 different artists who make up the Project’s signature sound. Having sold more than 300,000 albums, the Idan Raichel Project is a three-time platinum selling artist in Israel and has a solid cult following around the world.
When I first heard that the Idan Raichel Project was coming to Toronto—and to our university—I was extremely excited, to say the least. I was first introduced to his music by a friend about seven years ago. His music makes you feel as though you have been listening to it your whole life.
Raichel won me over with his charm and sincerity when he discussed his music and influences. His overriding philosophy of love and tolerance and his sense of community came to light with a contagious sense of passion through his music.
The only downside to the afternoon’s performance was that the time allotted was too short, and the fact that Idan and his crew had to rush off to catch a plane back to Israel left no time to talk with the fans. At the very least, he left us wanting more with some spine-tingling music vibes. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
spotted on campus • On Red and White day, York’s golden-maned mascot was giving out free hugs and posing for photos in the middle of the Student Centre to celebrate the school’s 53rd birthday. A bevy of athletic achievements were also celebrated, with cheerleaders, live music, and a DJ. Faculty, staff, and students clad in red-and-white gear had a chance to win prizes, and the bookstore sold discounted merchandise in honour of the event. There was plenty of clapping, cheering, and of course, mounds of free cake. Congratulations, York: you’re middle-aged.

A man who caused a disruption at an on-campus restaurant was arrested by Toronto police March 22.
The accused arrived at Blueberry Hill in York Lanes at approximately 8 p.m. and spent the majority of two hours’ time in the men’s restroom, which was later found to have been flooded. Police were called to the scene after both the restaurant owners and York security were unsuccessful in making the man leave the washroom.
The accused was escorted out by Toronto police around 10 p.m. and later was charged with mischief. As they escorted the accused out of the restaurant, he appeared to be soaked in water.
“He seemed very apologetic,” says one of the owners. “He wasn’t threatening anyone. We were just worried about what would happen if other students did approach him.”
Employees went around the restaurant shortly after the incident, informing customers that the men’s restroom was out of order.
Toronto police say they cannot release the name of the person, or even whether the person was a York student.

Negotiations between York and the union representing York’s teaching assistants and contract faculty continued last week in an effort to avoid a second strike by the union in four years.
York met with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 3903 March 22 after the local voted in favour of a strike mandate, placing CUPE 3903 in a legal strike position as of April 12.
Joanne Rider of York media says the meetings following CUPE 3903’s strike mandate have been “productive” and explains that the university remains hopeful a negotiation will be reached with the conciliator.
Rider notes the university has increased its monetary proposals to meet the union’s desires. This includes increases in the per-term amount of financial assistance for international students, increases in summer assistance provided to graduate assistants, and increases in funds with priority given to international students.
However, according to CUPE 3903 chair Karen Walker, there has been “little movement” with regards to the university’s stance and the negotiation process since the vote for a strike mandate.
As for the York Federation of Students (YFS), vp equity Siva Vimalachandran says that while the student union has no influence over the bargaining process, they too remain hopeful that both sides reach an agreement before the strike deadline. 
Safety and student space still remain primary goals to tackle

Another year, another student election, another win by the incumbent slate.
The results of the York Federation of Students (YFS) elections came Saturday with little surprise when the York United (YU) slate swept the polls in an overwhelming win over the opposition slate, Free York University (FYU). The winners were announced March 26, after the polls were closed and ballots counted.
“All the candidates more or less played fair and stuck to the rules outlined to them in the YFS Elections Bylaws,” said chief returning officer, Cécile Des Vignes in an email to Excalibur. She noted that while a number of demerit points were handed out for reasons such as using unapproved campaign material, there were no disqualifications, marking this the first YFS election without a single disqualification, according to YFS executive director Hamid Osman.
Every candidate running on the YU slate for executive and director positions won their seat, including the three returning members of the executive team: Vanessa Hunt, Alastair Woods, and Robert Cerjanec.
Hunt, who is returning for her second term as YFS president, says that the win is a reflection of the hard work and effort her slate put into the election.
She says that many of the YFS’s main priorities will remain unchanged going into next year, such as issues with safety and student space topping the concerns.
The implementation of the remaining Metropolitan Action Committee on Violence Against Women and Children (METRAC) recommendations—specifically with reference to the mandatory women’s studies or equity class—is a major element.
While this is something the YFS has been working towards over the past year, the recommendations that have yet to be addressed prompted Hunt to throw in her bid for a second time.
“That is part of the reason I wanted to come back,” she says, explaining that the YFS has engaged in “heavy duty” research to support the implementation of an equity or women’s studies course, and that they intend to bring their research and work to the university and have the York senate approve the recommendations.
“We’re all very excited and happy, but also very humbled,” says Hunt of their win and the YU slate’s upcoming challenges, noting the strong support she received from students during the campaign period. 
All exams to follow regular schedule as of now, says York admin

With CUPE 3903, the union representing teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and contract faculty legally allowed to strike as of April 12 if an agreement is not reached, many students might be facing exam schedules.
“The university is in the process of figuring out a plan B if needed,” says a representative from the Registrar’s Office. “We haven’t been given any details yet, but when we do know it will be up on the York website.”
Joanne Rider of York media says as of now, exam schedules remain the same.
“We are meeting this Thursday and Friday with the union and the conciliator again, and will continue to provide regular updates,” she says. “So with respect to the question about backup or alternative schedules, currently all academic activities are proceeding as planned.”
Despite the fact she may not get her grades on time, third-year English major Stephanie Mckechnie feels that CUPE 3903 has the right to go on strike for wages and benefits.
“You need to do that kind of thing to get results,” she says. “The administration knows the student body will be really upset by it, so they would be more willing to give in to the bargaining.”
However, not everyone holds the same view as Mckechnie when talking about the potential strike. Caroline Ruccella, a first-year student, understands the predicament but still feels stressed about the situation.
“I’ve been terrified as hell for the past few months, and know all my major exams are happening. I just want it done,” she says. “If the union has any problems, they need to take it up with the administration and not let it affect the students.”
Should CUPE 3903 choose to strike, Rider says the university will be taking all possible steps to minimize the impact on students and academic activity.

2012-04-04,York,Israel,"How carpe diem led Alex Braff to the world-renowned film festival with his short film Framed 
Justin Li
Contributor
For Alex Braff, an East Asian studies and philosophy double major in second year, applying his academic disciplines has helped him accomplish something most filmmakers only dream of: getting his film screened at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.
Braff’s 10-minute short film Framed documents the strain and labour that writer’s block can have on relationships and the ability to create new material. Although it may sound like a fusion of Spike Jonze’s Adaptation with Federico Fellini’s 8½, Braff is quick to point out that, although depicted from a writer’s perspective, the film is more about “creative block” in general, something that “everyone can relate to.”
For Braff, creative block is a universal concept. Whether at home or at school, writing screenplays or writing essays, the process of formulating thoughts into tangible results is an everyday struggle, and in the enterprise to overcome, we often alienate those around us.
“When you sit down with your notebook, it’s just you and your notebook,” says Braff. “There’s nothing else in the world except those two things. And when you’re absorbed into your world, it’s very difficult to bring someone else in and to see anything other than what’s in your focus.”
Braff insists that his philosophy background has helped him see and approach the film differently.
“In a lot of cases, a person only sees things one way,” says Braff. “Philosophy allows you to think outside the box and see different viewpoints.” Because he was taught to look at things differently and from varying perspectives, Braff describes how he can add fresh, creative, and unconventional insight. The result, he says, is a more nuanced and layered film.
In the making of Framed, however, Braff had a very different story to tell. He says the film was a byproduct of his mantra for seizing the day and the begetting of a beautiful friendship with the film’s director, John Virtue.
“The only reason this film was my project and the director’s, is because I’ve known the director for a long time and we’re good friends,” Braff explains. Virtue sent him a copy of the script while he was in Japan at the time, and he instantly liked it. Braff replied by saying the pair could turn the script into something meaningful.
In way of offering advice for budding filmmakers, Braff says that if a friend comes up to you with a good idea for a movie, give them five to 10 minutes.
“If someone approaches you with a great idea, don’t say you’re too busy for it. Take a moment and look at it,” suggests Braff. “Framed all started because a friend sent me a document that he had written out of fun.”
To Braff, having fun is what life, and university, is all about. University, he says, should be about meeting people with great ideas and adding your own creativity on top of that. If he wasn’t at York, Braff admits, the process of making a film would never have crossed his mind.
Braff says networking is the most important thing.
“At the end of the day, it’s who you know and how you know them,” he says. “Six degrees of separation ends up working for you.”
His personal convictions and hard work have paid off, culminating in a confirmation email from the Cannes Film Festival that booked him, his director, and their film, a ticket to France.
“It was the best day of my life,” Braff says.
But just because he has booked a ticket to Cannes, it doesn’t mean Braff will be taking a break from his producing duties. Along with his upcoming exams, his schedule is full.
He and Virtue are currently in the process of securing venues to screen their film with at the TIFF Lightbox—and on campus—before they embark for Cannes.
On top of that, Braff sees Cannes as a great opportunity to generate interest for the film and to connect with possible distributors, producers, and other eminent members of the film industry. When asked whether or not he thinks Framed will win any awards, Braff says that producing the film was an achievement in and of itself.

According to calendars created by the Mayans (an advanced Mesoamerican civilization that existed from 2000 BCE until their destruction by the Spanish in 1697 CE), the end of humanity will come December 21, 2012 when some catastrophe is predicted to demolish the world. Many theorize that the end of the world will come from astronomical events, from a “killer” solar flare to a huge asteroid.
Others, like Young, however, theorize that the end of humanity may just come from a nuclear war.
Young started preparing for Doomsday after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, even after peace was maintained. His thoughts on surviving things like nuclear war stayed with him throughout his childhood and even now.
“I wrote a short story when I was 12 about my age group in school withstanding the Soviet invasion,” says Young who has read about hundreds of wars and deadly disasters. “So things like that were on my mind as I grew up.”
Young is not alone though. The preparation-centric fiction he writes and publishes on the internet has a readership of well over 10,000 and the number of people who have started preparing seems to be increasing as days go by.
“There are thousands upon thousands of other people doing their best to get ready for anything from a loss of a job, to medical emergencies, all the way up to Doomsday,” says Young.
The amount of people preparing for the end has grown big enough that there is a network dedicated to helping them known as the American Preppers Network (APN).
The network defines these “preppers” as a group of people who have started preparing for Doomsday, or TEOTWAWKI—The End of the World as We Know It. There are “preppers” in the United States and in parts of Canada, Australia, and Italy, according to Tom Martin, founder and chief visionary officer of the APN
The network already has over seven thousand “likes” on their Facebook page and has gained the attention of organizations like the BBC and Popular Mechanics.
The way Young and Martin both see it is that the world right now is not very sustainable, whether you look at it from a financial point of view or an environmental one. The radical weather patterns and the frequent occurrences of natural disasters around the world indicate to them that something big is going to happen which will either destroy the world or change the world that we know today.
Which is why Young says that it’s important to be prepared for not only “Doomsday,” but for accidents and disasters which can occur at any time.
While Young does not believe the popular Mayan prophecies about the world ending by the end of this year, he does however, believe that several natural cycles are reaching either peaks or lows, depending on the type of cycle, with the sunspot cycle one of the key ones, indicating that some bad natural disasters will occur.
When asked what kind of advice Young has for university students, he suggested that we forget about preparing for “Doomsday” for the moment and make preparations for basic human needs first.
Martin’s advice reflected the views of Young: “Students need to learn how to budget and manage their finances since things like credit cards and loans will not be useful when a disaster strikes. Students should learn how to make their own meals and make sure they have enough food stocked up for at least three months.”
Some preppers may follow the Mayan calendar, but they all have one common goal: to be prepared on a daily basis just in case they are faced with a natural disaster of some sort.

The streets are decrepit in Aida, a Palestinian refugee camp located just two kilometres north of Bethlehem. There are crumbling walls, piles of rubble, and garbage surrounding them all. The men and women who live in these poor conditions are victims of prejudice. This is where Tyler Koverko, a York law student, finds himself with a pit in his stomach.
Koverko, a second-year criminal law student at Osgoode, had a lot of interest in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but he had no genuine understanding of the situation before visiting Bethlehem.
However, last summer, he was awarded $5,000 to plan a trip to Jerusalem where he saw firsthand what the long-standing conflict looks like.
Koverko left for Jerusalem having no partiality for either side. He considered himself an interested third party. With a general understanding, he wanted to better comprehend the conflict and also experience what everyday life was like. Being stationed primarily in Israel, he decided to go out and see what waited for him. That was when he saw Aida.
Aida was established in 1950, and holds over 4,000 refugees. It is just one of 19 refugee camps in the West Bank. There are 62 Palestinian refugee camps across Jordan, Syria, Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon. These camps house more than four million refugees that were displaced as a result of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.
These people were either forced out of their homes or chose to leave the country.
Koverko was able to see much more than what is reported in the North American media. Even though he began this trip with an open mind towards both sides, biases were unavoidable. However, seeing firsthand a decrepit Palestinian refugee camp and victims of suicide bombings, Koverko felt these biases “beaten out of him,” leaving behind the difficulty to find a “human side” of the issue.
These people were not characters in a movie; they have to continue to live this way everyday. Koverko was surprised to discover that not just the camp’s leaders, but also the children spoke fluent English. Not only did they speak English, most of them were fairly sophisticated and bright—welcoming him wholeheartedly. He saw “human beings with souls behind all the political madness.” It became clear how irresponsible it is to generalize an entire group of people that are caught up in politics that expand far beyond their power.
A major surprise for him was the amicability of Jerusalem.
This trip was very important for Koverko, but he does not want you to simply take his word for it.
“This experience was awesome, unforgettable, a slap in the face and it opened up a major world conflict to me,” he says. These same opportunities are available to all students who wish to take advantage of them. “I learned immediately that you can’t understand why people believe so strongly in the cause, until you know the history.”
Jerusalem was “a life changing experience,” for Koverko.
“Whatever I thought was immediately transformed through personal experience,” he says.
Koverko says he left Canada with little bias towards either the Israelis or Palestinians and came back with even less. It was no longer “this group or this group,” but simply people caught up in defending their rights and beliefs that they hold so sacred.

2013-03-27,York,Israel,"Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York opposed to endorsement
The York Federation of Students has endorsed the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign at York, causing an uproar from those who disagree with its aims.
This decision was made during a meeting called by the YFS’ executive members held at the Underground on March 21, where a motion was put forth to endorse the BDS campaign, resulting in a vote of 18-2 in favour of its endorsement.
Approximately 200 undergraduate students attended the meeting.
Safiyah Husein, vp equity of the YFS, says the BDS movement is a form of “international solidarity with the Palestinian call for justice, equality, and an end to the occupation” that “puts pressure on institutions to divest from companies currently funding weaponry for the Israeli military.”
Over 5,000 students signed a petition asking the YFS to discuss the BDS issue, says Husein.
Jessica Cherkasov, member of Hillel at York, alleges no one from Hillel at York or Hasbara @ York was officially informed of the meeting, the motion, or of the meeting’s agenda. They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.
While both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.
“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.
Vanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.
“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”
The BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.
As of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.
The campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.
Members of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012. They celebrated the YFS’s endorsement after the meeting at around 1:45 p.m. with a march around campus, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “victory.”
The Graduate Students Association at York endorsed the BDS campaign on November 16, 2012, as have other student organizations including the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association and the University of Toronto Graduate Student Union.
Hillel at York and Hasbara @ York condemned YFS’s endorsement of the BDS campaign on behalf of York’s undergraduate students and issued a statement through the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.
In the statement, Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara @ York, says Hasbara is “extremely disappointed” that the YFS passed this resolution. He alleges the YFS is “blacklisting and boycotting Israelis.” Lax also alleges the YFS’ resolution is “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”
Cherkasov says as a union representing the interests of 55,000 undergraduates, the YFS should not take a political stance on an issue that does not affect all students on campus.
“I understand that we all have our personal opinions, but the fact that [the YFS] took a stance on a very touchy issue for Israeli and Palestinian students, I think that was inappropriate,” says Cherkasov. “Now, they have marginalized a group of students and created a hostile environment because they adopted the BDS movement.”
Lax echoed Cherkasov’s opinion, saying the YFS should not take a political stance that could divide the campus.
He says 4,000 students have signed a petition against the GSA’s endorsement of BDS, created in November 2012 by Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York.
“It showed a substantial amount of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.
Husein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.
She says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she would be happy to meet with them to discuss it.
“Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important,” says Husein.
Husein says to remain silent on issues of basic equality is often a tacit endorsement of injustice.
“We engage in anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, and anti-sexism campaigns not because they are popular, but because they are right, and they are important to our members,” she says.
Joanne Rider of York media says university administration has not been contacted by the YFS or any other student groups regarding this campaign.
SAIA will be holding a protest March 27 in Vari Hall at 1 p.m. to call on university administration to address their demands.

UPDATED 9:00 p.m. March 27 — York admin has yet to issue security bulletin or email to students about incidents
Toronto Police have arrested a man after two women reported indecent acts in a lab at York University.
Joanne Rider of York media says the occurrences happened in a research lab located in the Petrie Science and Engineering Building.
On Wednesday, March 13 and Thursday, March 21, a male student from another university, taking a co-op program at York, allegedly performed an indecent act in a lab, while staring at a female York student who was present, police say.
According to police, the accused male was the same in both incidents, but the female victims were different.
Police say there may be more victims.
As of 9:00 p.m. on March 27, York administration has not yet sent out a security bulletin email to students informing them of these incidents and a security bulletin has not been posted on the York Security Services website.
Rider says administration is in the process of  directly advising students by email.
“Given the circumstances of this case, communication was focused on those who may have interacted with the individual,” she says. “Dean Crow advised the Graduate Students’ Association yesterday afternoon of the incidents and provided the [Toronto Police Services] communication.  Science and Engineering faculty and staff were also advised.”
John Fletcher, 19, of Maple, Ontario faces two charges of performing indecent acts.
He is scheduled to appear in court at 1000 Finch Avenue West on Tuesday, April 30, 2013.

2013-05-23,York,Israel,"Two former York executives have had their fraud charges dropped after a phony invoice scheme that billed York for over $1.2 million. Despite the charges being dropped, they are still facing a civil action suit from York.
Michael Markicevic and Phil Brown, two former York employees, have been acquitted of all criminal charges of fraud against the university.
The criminal charges of fraud were dismissed on May 1 by Assistant Crown Robert Wright on accounts of the poor credibility of key witnesses.
According to the Toronto Star, Wright announced in court that the prosecution had set aside charges against Markicevic and Brown and said that while the police had reasonable grounds to lay the charges, there is no reasonable prospect of conviction at this stage of the matter.
Both Brown and Markicevic were charged by police for their alleged involvement in a phony invoice scheme that billed York for more than $1.2 million between May 2007 and April 2010. 
While employed at York, Markicevic worked as an assistant vice-president and Brown as director of maintenance.
Although the criminal charges were dropped against both former employees, they are still facing a civil action suit by the university.
Joanne Rider of York media says the university was disappointed in the Crown’s decision to dismiss the criminal charges against Markicevic and Brown.
“We do have substantial evidence in the fraud case, and we are still pursuing a civil action case including the civil action against Markicevic and Brown,” says Rider.
“Markicevic had already tried unsuccessfully to try to have the civil case against him dismissed.”
According to an interview done by the Toronto Star, when asked about the Crown’s decision, Markicevic expressed relief over the crown’s decision. In the same interivew, Markicevic said that as a result of York firing him, his reputation has been damaged, he’s having a hard time finding a new job, and that this situation has cost his family about $800,000 in legal costs to date.
Markecevic said to the Toronto Star that he is depicted by York as being the mastermind behind the entire fraud invoice scheme, with the university filling the civil action suit in early 2012 before the police criminal charges.
“I’m not able discuss specifics relating to an individual’s case when it comes to an agreement made with the university, but we are making an effort through the civil action suit to recover the funds that were defrauded by Markicevic,” says Rider. 
President Shoukri has placed in Canadian Immigrant Magazines Top 25 contest. 
York’s President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri is in the running for Canadian Immigrant magazine’s Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards.
The awards acknowledge citizens for their accomplishments in their adoptive country.
Sanjay Agnihotri, director of operations and strategy at Metroland Specialty Markets, who leads the Top 25 awards program, says Shoukri’s nomination was a result of his inspiring academic and professional accomplishments, as well as his participation in many organizations.
Shoukri currently sits on the boards of directors for the Ontario Centres of Excellence, Cancer Care Ontario, and the Canadian Merit Scholarship Foundation.
“I am extremely honoured to be nominated for this prestigious award along with such respected and accomplished individuals who have contributed so much to Canada,” says Shoukri.
The nomination process is open to all Canadians who wish to nominate an inspirational immigrant with permanent residency or citizenship in Canada.
Nominators are asked to provide reasons as to why the nominee is inspiring to them, including any accomplishments they have made and any challenges they have overcome, explains Agnihotri.
Nominations, as well as votes, were made on Canadian Immigrant’s website. The winners of the awards will be announced June 20, 2013.
“After the nominations phase is closed, a judging panel reviews the hundreds of nominations sent in and selects 75 finalists who earn the highest marks on a set scale of criteria,” says Agnihorti. 
The criteria used by the panel to shortlist the finalists is based on nominations that describe how the potential candidates’ work has improved the standard of living in Canada in some way, whether these accomplishments have been made on a local or national scale.
Shoukri says his involvement in the Top 25 program and its testimonial is an achievement for not only himself but for the entire York community.
“This is public recognition for all of the amazing achievements by people here at York. We are known for excellence and innovation both in Canada and increasingly on an international level, so we all share a part of this nomination,” says Shoukri.
Winners will be announced by Canadian Immigrant on June 20.

York alumnus and SAIA activist Hammam Farah has been banned from York property. After receiving warning letters, the Students Against Israeli Apartheid had their club status revoked for “repeated disruption of academic activities.”
Students Against Israeli Apartheid’s status as an officially recognized student group at York was revoked by the university following a rally held in Vari Hall on March 27.
Janet Morrison, vice-provost students, who makes decisions with respect to club statuses, de-listed SAIA as an official club until January 2014 for “repeated disruption of academic activities,” according to Joanne Rider of York media.
“Specifically, SAIA will not be able to book space or otherwise access university resources directly or through another student organization,” says the notification letter from Morrison. SAIA is also “debarred from re-registering for official student group status” until January 1, 2014.
Rider says this isn’t the first time that SAIA has “disrupted academic activities” during one of their rallies and that this action wasn’t taken lightly. The university follows a similar process with any student club, association, or organization when university policies are violated, she explains.
“We followed due process including warning SAIA a number of times before we made the decision to sanction them,” says Rider.
SAIA was notified on May 3 by York that their club status had been revoked via email and letter delivered by Morrison.
Along with SAIA, a number of other groups were present at the rally, including the York University Black Students’ Association, York’s chapter of the Filipino Canadian Youth Alliance, the Middle Eastern Students’ Association, Ontario Public Interest Research Group-York, Independent Jewish Voices – Toronto, Fightback, and CUPE 3903.
“An unprecedented attack on academic freedom and freedom of speech on the York University campus.” 
A few members of student groups involved in the rally received warning letters from the university.
Excalibur obtained a copy of the letter sent from the university to Arshiya Lakhani, one of the students who spoke at the March 27 rally.
“By this letter, the University is giving you notice that should you in future fail to comply with applicable regulations of the University […] York University may invoke disciplinary action against you in accordance with applicable University rules,” the letter said.
Letters were also sent to the presidents of YUBSA and the Middle Eastern Students’ Association, among other students.
“The warning letters sent from the university definitely felt threatening,” says SAIA member Huda Al-Sarraj.
YUBSA and Rider were contacted concerning warning letters but were unable to be reached in time.
“Receiving the letters and threatening us is problematic because all these clubs involved are fighting for fundamental rights, like YUBSA who fight against racial profiling and for black rights,” says Al-Sarraj.
The rally in question took place one week after the York Federation of Students endorsed the Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign at a board of directors’ meeting, joining York’s Graduate Students’ Association in their support of the movement.
In a post on SAIA’s Facebook page, the group writes that the university’s decision to revoke their status is an “unprecedented attack on academic freedom and freedom of speech on the York University campus.”
When asked for a response, Rider says, “York University encourages freedom of expression and debate of controversial issues, and values diverse perspectives.  The university does not permit such expression to compromise or disrupt classes or other academic activities.”
“With the March 27 rally, we wanted to show that York didn’t have an ethical investment strategy and that we needed to push for that,” says Al-Sarraj. “We cooperated with York security, and we also had a security liaison and marshal keep things under control.”
Following the same rally, York alumnus and SAIA activist Hammam Farah was banned from entering York property as of April 25.
According to a letter sent to Farah by Gary Brewer, vp finance and administration, Farah was banned from campus because of his participation in two demonstrations — the first on November 29, 2012, and the other on on March 27, 2013,  — where he was observed by York security using an amplification device to speak to a gathering of students and others.
Rider says Farah was banned for violating university policy.
“Acting in violation of any York University policy or procedure may result in a review process,” says Rider. “Actions by the university as a result of the review may include banning an individual or group from campus.”
This is the first incident since 2009 that a club has been sanctioned by the university.
In 2009, SAIA and the Hasbara Fellowship were each suspended for 30 days and fined $1,000, the Tamil Students’ Association was suspended for 15 days and fined
$500, and Hillel was fined $500 for “for their part in recent activities which disrupted classes adjacent to Vari Hall rotunda,” according to a York Media Relations press release. 
 
With a new editorial team comes a new set of experiences, opinions, and skill sets. We are excited, to say the least – and Abdul Malik would like to introduce himself and the whole new editorial board with a smile, a hearty handshake, and a pat on the back. We’re on your side, we swear.
Hi. You there?
Are you reading this? Do I have your attention? I do? I hope I have your attention. Because I’m about to INTRODUCE THE FUCK OUT OF MYSELF.
I’m Abdul Malik, the new arts editor around here. We’re all new. In the same way the guards change regularly at Buckingham palace, aspiring Bat-men blow up the lairs of the ninjas that trained them, and white dwarf suns create nebulae that eventually coalesce into brand new stars, Excalibur has a new editorial team once again.
One of the great things about this paper is the fact that the staff changes every year. Each new editor brings a different set of priorities and personality to their job; it’s simultaneously a way to improve the learning experience and stay in touch with the ever evolving needs of the community we serve.
“Cynicism is far too easy, and we are all of us doing the best we can.”
And believe me, we’re here to serve.
To those unacquainted with Excalibur, I’ll give you this sentence to expend your phallic jokes re: our name. Done? Alright. Cool. To get you up to speed: we’ve been York’s community newspaper since 1966 and we are completely autonomous from the school administration. Our job is simply to be journalists, journalists that look out for the interests of York’s students, faculty, and community.
To those familiar with Excalibur and are cynical about the paper, student journalism, or the impact of the press-at-large: at the end of the day, we’re still here to look out for you, regardless of how you view us. Cynicism is far too easy, and we are all of us doing the best we can.
To those of us who pick up and read Excalibur regularly, we can guarantee the paper will only get better. We’ve picked up from what was already an amazing team of editors, and we have titanic shoes to fill.
Our team is diverse. Some of us have worked here in other positions, others are entirely new, and a few of us started as volunteers and staff writers. Our doors are open to anyone and everyone who wants to be a part of the team, and this has only ever been a good thing.
The paper has content online and in print; we change with the times, and expect a Herculean degree of web content this year. The physical paper will stay strong, too, no matter how many death bells toll for print journalism.
Hey, we outlived Newsweek. Isn’t that neat-o?
At this point, it’s not unsafe to call Excalibur an institution at York, and while there have been ups and down in the paper’s history, we have a standard of excellence to meet — a standard that’s set not by us, but by you, the reader.
And I can speak for the entire team when I say we plan to go above and beyond the call of duty for the next year. We’re here to create dialogues, keep you in the loop, and shine a light on any of the numerous goings on, positive or negative, on the York campus.
We hope you can be a part of what we’re doing, while we’re doing it.
And occasionally, our headlines will be punny. Sorry in advance.

2013-08-29,York,Israel,"Devised and playwriting theatre student Luke Reece has proven himself to be a capable entrepreneur, founding the rising theatre company, Little Black Afro Productions. Having put on a variety of in-company shows over the last two years, LBA has found success in fringe festivals and short runs across southern Ontario. Luke answered a few questions for incoming theatre students.
Excalibur: What’d you like and dislike about first year theatre?
Luke Reece: My favourite thing about first year theatre was the variety of skills I learned. I was hanging lights, making skirts, and building a giant water tower for Hippolytos. You get to learn about every aspect of theatre, inside and out. There is also a really friendly community that is wonderful to be a part of.
I don’t think there was anything I really disliked but something that was challenging for me was making the time for crew shifts. I was (and still am) commuting from Mississauga and I wouldn’t be home until 11:30 pm or later on days I had crew shifts and then up early the next morning to get to Stagecraft.
E: What do you wish you had done more of in first year, especially re: your program and your aspirations? 
L: I’m fairly happy with everything I did in first year. I was there for Orientation Week, acted in Playground, played intramural sports and all that fun stuff. I guess what I wish I did more was go see more of the upper-year devised shows. Shows, shows and more shows! See the un-mounted ones too.
E: What do you wish you hadn’t done? 
L: I wish I hadn’t procrastinated as much as I did! I wish I hadn’t not slept as much. Yes, that’s a double negative. That’s what happens when you don’t sleep enough. ..make sure you stay healthy! Take care of your body and your body will take care of you.
E: How did first year shape you as both a creative person and help build up Little Black Afro ? 
L: First year shaped my creative being in the most positive way ever. I was exposed to new techniques and did things I never thought I would even try. I also met a ton of other creative people who I learned from. You learn a lot from working with your fellow theatre students.
As for Little Black Afro, after my first year of theatre, I had learned so much and I wanted to put it into practice. My friend Ryan Ovas came to me with the idea and we just went to it. It’s that easy. I reworked a piece I wrote back in high school, and it was noticeably better. It was clear proof that I had improved as a theatre artist through my first year at York. And then, in future shows our cast and crew were all Yorkies.
E: What advice would you give to incoming theatre students regarding the program? 
L: Try everything! Approach everything with an open mind, and prepare to surprise yourself with everything you will learn. There are things you didn’t think you’d like that you’ll like a lot and vice versa. It’s a lot of work, but you get out what you put in, so work hard. Also, don’t be afraid to have fun. It’s a big York theatre family, and now you’re a part of it. Welcome!

Don Jon, Joseph Gordon- Levitt’s directorial debut, is a strong, bold take on how our generation forms relationships and how unrealistic our expectations of those relationships can be.
Don Jon cares about very little besides porn and the flashes of open-mouthed women and bouncing breasts during the opening credits of the film make this clear.
We follow Jon, played by Gordon-Levitt himself, a chauvinistic, Jersey Shore-esque “bro,” who likes to work out, go to the club, go to church, and masturbate excessively. During a typical night out at the club, he meets who he believes is the woman of his dreams, Barbara, played by Scarlett Johannson.
As their relationship progresses, it becomes clear that Jon and Barbara aren’t on the same page in terms of expectations, which we see during a scene in which Barbara tells Jon how she desperately wants him to meet her parents.
and take classes at night school as he dry-humps her outside of her apartment. He wants sex as good as the pornography he is addicted to, and she wants a happy ending like the ones shown in the films she obsessively watches.
Everything in Jon’s life is an objectified version of what it’s supposed to be, and Gordon- Levitt shows us this is a bold way. When his portrayals verge on the stereotypical, we’re reminded that he doesn’t take himself too seriously. His girlfriend is almost too hot, but also incredibly vapid and demanding. His family looks like an Italian-American blue-collar family taken straight out of one of too many reality TV shows. His church is where he confesses his numerous sins and instantly redeems himself by reciting 10 Hail Marys and 10 Lord’s Prayers. It is only when he gets to know Ester, played by Julianne Moore, a quirky middle-aged woman in his night class, that he begins to reflect on his empty affair with pornography and how it affects his relationships with women.
Gordon-Levitt is able to walk the line between satire and stereotype, while creating a tight narrative that wraps up in a satisfying conclusion.
The social commentary is relevant and honest, but doesn’t overwhelm the script. Levitt knew exactly how deep to go with this film, and he hit his mark perfectly. If he remains this tempered and disciplined, he could be a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Considering all the attention Don Jon has been getting, we will all certainly be watching.

Amidst international cries for their release, York film professor John Greyson and London, Ontario doctor Tarek Loubani are still being held in an Egyptian prison.
The actual date of the arrest is unconfirmed, but most sources have reported it to be between August 16 and 18. Loubani, who is an emergency room physician and assistant professor at Western University, was arrested alongside York’s Professor Greyson on accusations of being part of an armed gang, threatening security, and possessing firearms, ammunition, and explosives.
The two were originally in Egypt on a stop-over when they were apprehended by Egyptian police. Both Greyson and Loubani were headed to Gaza; Greyson was hoping to shoot a documentary, while Loubani was set to take part in the training of local doctors.
On August 20, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Youm Al-Sabea released the Cairo prosecutor’s statement which said Greyson and
Loubani, along with seven other prisoners were required to stay in prison for 15 days.
“The pair were at the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Following the hiring of lawyers to represent Greyson and Loubani, Justin Podur, York professor and mutual friend of Greyson and Loubani, wrote on his blog that the allegations announced by the prosecutor are not formal charges.
“The prosecutor is not bound by any rules of evidence, and as a result, the press release was full of wide-ranging, far-fetched, and outright bizarre accusations,” Podur wrote online. He added that the 15-day detention order is not jail time, but rather a “detention order pending investigation.”
The detainment of Loubani and Greyson comes at a turbulent time for Egypt as they face the deadliest period of civil unrest they have seen in 60 years. It was only recently that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi was ousted as from o ce, and since then, conflict has erupted between the Muslim Brotherhood, the military, and other political factions within the country.
This recent violence has killed over 1,000 people, which makes the detainment of the two Canadian even more concerning for family and friends.
According Canadian officials in Egypt, it appears that the pair were at the wrong place at the wrong time, and were apprehended during the arrests of anti-government protesters, reported CTV. Shalakany Law Office has been hired to represent Greyson and Loubani and is currently working to free the pair, who are being held pending an investigation by prosecutors.
Greyson, who has been part of York’s film department since 2005, is both an awarding winning filmmaker and professor of video theory, film production, and editing. President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri says the university as a whole is extremely concerned about the safety and well being of Greyson and Loubani.
“We are in contact with Canadian government officials about the detainment of the two men, and we offer our support for theirsafe return,” says Shoukri.
“Our thoughts are also with their family and friends at this time.”
Deepak Obhrai, parliamentary secretary to John Baird, Minister of Foreign Affairs, told CBC on August 19 that the federal government is trying to call on the Egyptian ambassador for the release of Greyson and Loubani.
Meanwhile, demands for the quick release of the two Canadians has been growing in Canada. Other universities, including Western and Queen’s, have released statements of support, along with organizations like the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Doctors for Medicare, and the Toronto International Film Festival.
A petition has also been set up on change.org, calling on the Canadian government to put pressure on Egyptian authorities for a quick release and has gathered over 86,000 signatures as of publication.

Representatives from Students Against Israeli Apartheid recently sat down with York administration to discuss the SAIA rally that occurred earlier this year, which resulted in their club status being revoked until January 2014.
The meeting with administration, which took place August 7 in the President’s Office, followed a
York University Board of Governors meeting on June 24, during which members of the Board walked out after SAIA members attempted to engage them in a discussion.
At the June 24 meeting, SAIA delivered a communication to the chair of the Board, which was read aloud by a student Board member. The board was then advised by the speaker that the document, which contained demands from SAIA, be drawn to the president’s attention.
Once the first page of the statement was read, individuals from SAIA attempted to engage the board in a conversation, expressing concerns about York’s alleged investments in weapons manufacturing companies and the sanctions imposed on their club.
“SAIA members had violated meeting protocol and the chair’s repeated requests to follow protocol were not met. The members of the board then walked out and continued their meeting in a closed setting, according to Rider.”
The incident was recorded via mobile phone, uploaded to You- Tube, and circulated amongst various social networking platforms.
SAIA’s club status was revoked following a March 27 rally after which a student complaint was received by the York University Office of Student Conflict Resolution that academic activity was disrupted by a SAIA rally in Vari Hall.
Rider says that the matter was referred to a local adjudicator and a resolution was achieved between the parties.
According to Huda Al Sarraj, a member of SAIA, the adjudicator found there to be no academic disruption.
A statement from SAIA, provided by member Dan O’Hara, said members took very precise, word-for-word notes at the meeting. According to SAIA, the adjudicator said, “I didn’t find that there was a breach. I think that what the student was complaining about was fair, but I didn’t think that it met that threshold of disruptive activity. I didn’t find a formal breach.”
York officials, however, state: “It is false that the adjudicator found there to be no academic disruption. In fact, academic activities were disrupted which is in violation of University policy. “
The university also notes that members of SAIA were warned verbally and in writing that they were in violation of a contract signed by the club, stating that it would abide by all university policies.
The same day SAIA’s club status was officially revoked on May 3, SAIA activist and York alumnus Hammam Farah was also banned from York property due to “repeated disruption of academic activities.”
“SAIA claims adjudicator ruled no breach.”
Al Sarraj commented on this past summer’s meetings: “What York is currently portraying is that they treat alumni like outsiders who come on private property.”
Earlier this month, a total of 125 York faculty members signed a statement addressed to Shoukri, as well as to Janet Morrison, vice-provost of students, and Gary Brewer, vice-president of finance and administration, expressing their concerns about civil liberties on campus. The statement cited an earlier statement made by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association who also came out in support of SAIA.
The statement called on York administration to restore SAIA’s full rights as a student club, to withdraw the trespass notice against Farah, and to amend the Student Code of Conduct and the Temporary Use of Student Space Policy to “recognize the legitimate right of peaceful assembly on campus by members of the […] community.”
SAIA has also been gathering support for their reinstatement as a student club through an online petition which has collected 1,363 signatures thus far.

Can you believe that Ontario doesn’t have CEGEP yet?
For those who don’t know, allow me to be condescending for a moment about something I was unaware of until last year: CEGEP (Collège d’enseignement général et professionnel) is Quebec’s enforced college system.
Basically, students from the province enter university with two years of post-secondary experience that we don’t get in Ontario. I feel like the kid who just found out all his friends get money when they lose a tooth.
“CEGEP lets you figure out your future cheaply.”
I’m well aware that mass overhauls of education, healthcare, and everything else are tricky business. I’m also quite familiar with the questions many people have about Quebec’s education system on the whole. It does work, however. The benefits are twofold.
For one, every year thousands of university students pay Ontario millions of dollars in tuition just to figure out what they maybe want to do at some point if they don’t want to not do it. A lot of these people end up dropping out in a year, or three, after their fortunes have been drained discovering they don’t want to be a psycho-para-engineer.
CEGEP lets you figure out your future cheaply. The programs are usually two years long and are affordable – two reasons it really doesn’t matter if you screwed up choosing your major. In fact, many CEGEP students will focus in one stream, and discover their future university major in some mandatory other class on the side.
We enter university at 17 or 18 in Ontario. In Quebec, high school ends a year earlier, but the extra year of schooling that CEGEP provides means they start university around 19. Those couple years at the end of our teenagehood are pretty formative. It doesn’t matter what you do with that time – by the laws of science, you’re going to grow up.
Personally, I think that giving yourself a year or two to mature before entering university can help relieve the stresses of adapting to a new environment, and reduce social anxieties that many first-years have.
For this reason, I’ve always encouraged taking a year off between high school and university, but a CEGEP equivalent would be even better, offering something productive for us to do with that time and a means to adjust more smoothly into higher education.
Ontario already offers the choice to pursue college, but it’s more of an opposing option to university than a companion. With a CEGEP-like program in place, many people will find a passion that they otherwise wouldn’t have known they thirsted.
So do I think that this little piece is actually going to cause the Ontario government to reform their entire education system, build dozens of new institutions, and hire thousands of new professors? I’m 60 per cent sure it won’t. But maybe this will help cultivate some sort of action.
If Ontario won’t initiate an equivalent program with the scope of Quebec’s, they can at least encourage other post-secondary endeavors that help bridge an oft-ignored leap in our young lives. Let’s make that big journey off to university really worth it when the time comes. We don’t all have the luxury to be uncertain.

Re: York sanctions SAIA
I find the banning of SAIAas a student group completely unconstitutional and a blatant violation of the Ontario Human Rights Code; SAIA in no way violated the student code of conduct and were just practicing their civil liberties.
Isay this because Iattended the rally on March 27 and it was not as disruptive as they’d like us to believe. There was a heavy security presence and there were no major incidences that would be cause for sanctions. York’s administration has proved very prejudiced against anyone who dares speak out against injustice. Isuspect that this decision must have been pre-meditated; there must also have been influence from the university’s shareholders and affiliates to resort to this decision.
The March 27 rally is not a sufficient reason and has crossed the line into censorship. Furthermore threatening YUBSA, OPIRG, and other student groups is a desperate move. Iwould think that York University would be a great space to exercise our civil liberties, York being progressive and all, but now it no longer feels like the safer, inclusive space they promised us when we enrolled. Ifully agree with SAIAthat the decision to revoke their status is an attack on academic freedom.

Re: Safety forums 
Iam writing this in reply to a recent opinion article entitled “York administration plays it safe” in Volume 47, Issue 22 of the Excalibur. Iwas slightly disappointed when Iread this article that emphasized the “lack of interest” of the writer for safety initiatives that the university undertakes. Ican only hope that not too many students at the university have the same opinion and indifference towards this topic, but Ifear that Imight be wrong.
Ido not know if the intentions of the forums held over the past year were “part of a larger public relations strategy of the university,” but Ibelieve that they were not. Nonetheless, the forums held were an amazing opportunity for everyone in the community to come together and voice their concerns on a very important topic. If you want your voice to be heard, you should not take it elsewhere. WE, the students, ARE York University, and only we can make it better. While the administration might have the financial power or the fancy job titles, students can be leaders and agents of social change, if we so choose to be, by investing our passions accordingly. Imagine that there were no inspiring and passionate individuals in the world: what would happen if we were all to decide that we no longer cared?

2013-12-09,York,Israel,"Holiday tunes that are good, real good!
Maybe it’s the fact that you hear it non-stop in any customer service job for two-plus months, or maybe the kids just don’t like Bing Crosby like they used to. Perhaps it’s because in our angst-ridden early adulthood, a crooner’s release of “Silver Bells” simply doesn’t touch our icy soul. But whatever the reason, it seems that many people at York don’t like holiday music.
If you find the blizzard of Christmas tunes around this time emotionally numbing, infuriatingly catchy, culturally assimilating, too religious, or conversely, too commercial, you’re not alone. It’s part of the lethal holiday mix that drives employees and customers everywhere into a state of rage.
But there may be hope yet for the herds of Christmas-weary students. Not all Christmas music is so bad. Over the last decade or two, the music industry has slowly trudged out some gems by bands a little more worthy of radio play than Susan Boyle.
Here are 15 downloads to put on your next seasonal mixtape:
1. “Did I Make You Cry on Christmas Day? (Well, You Deserved it)” by Sufjan Stevens 
Of the 50 or so Sufjan Stevens Christmas songs on record, this is the best. The instrumentation and Stevens’ shaky, harmonized voice have all the drabness and depression of an office X-mas party, but the overall arrangement is beautifully moving and folksy.
2. “Christmas Lights” by Coldplay 
This single, released in 2010, begins low-key, led solely by a sparkling, effervescent piano, but eventually achieves the kind of grandiose, heavily orchestrated Coldplay heard in “Viva La Vida.” It’s also a rare Christmas tune about heartbreak and relationship problems.
3. “The First Song” by Band of Horses 
The best Christmas songs are those that aren’t actually written for the season — the lyricist just had the holidays on their mind. The vocals in “The First Song” are cried with BoH’s typical uber-reverb, but one of the few clear lines is “Christmas time’s coming.”
4. “I Wish it Was Christmas Today” by Julian Casablancas 
Casablancas, the frontman of The Strokes, does a jingly cover of the song made popular by Saturday Night Live’s Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz, Tracy Morgan, and Chris Kattan. Aside from the expected Casablancas throatiness and danceable beat, the rendition is actually pretty faithful.
5. “It’s Christmas So We’ll Stop” by Frightened Rabbit 
The Scottish indie band’s attempt at a Christmas track is as touching as it is minimalist. Mostly backed only by the carefully composed plucks of an acoustic guitar, the song builds to a swell of choir humming and percussion, and feels like an audio sweater being placed over your shoulders after a sad skating trip.
6. “Are You Coming Over For Christmas?” by Belle and Sebastian 
The Glasgow band’s playful Christmas gem kicks off with a jazzy tone, evoking famous holiday tunes from the 40s, while having the likability of modern indie pop’s most darling act. From there, the duo’s soft and lispy vocals accompany an alternation of big brass and tranquil bass strums.
7. “Candy Cane Children” by The White Stripes 
Maybe the most gritty and unpolished Christmas song of all time, “Candy Cane Children” is actually a somewhat hard find, especially its studio version. Nonetheless, it’s worth the search for Stripes fans, with Jack at his most unhinged, tattering his vocal chords, and Meg slamming those drums like she literally wants to break a record.
8. “All I Want for Christmas” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs 
In a way, this is as Christmas-spirited as you can get: Karen O actually sounds pleasant and a little seductive, and there are some unexpected holiday tropes thrown in: jingle bells behind the sheen of guitar strings, a snowfall tempo, etc. But a sloshed-sounding O dedicates the song to “the people they love” right off the bat, so you can be rest assured this wasn’t some festive cash-in.
9. “I Do Not Care for the Winter Sun” by Beach House 
Some people do not care for Beach House’s too-distant, ice queen sound, but it lends itself well to a winter-themed song. The tune shivers with Christmas loneliness, and is warmed only by the sound of its own sunburst electric guitar. It ends with Charlie Brown-worthy Yuletide lyrics (“it’s all that matters this time of year”) but they’re chilled with a melancholy piano outro.
10. “Xmas Time is Here Again” by My Morning Jacket 
If Radiohead and Fleet Foxes had a disappointingly conventional baby, it would be My Morning Jacket. If nothing else, that baby would’ve been born to perform a hipster Christmas anthem or two. That’s exactly what these bearded boys with bad style did. “Xmas Time is Here Again” is gentle and harmless, a little poignant, and very suggestive of the winter woodsmen in the recording booth.
11. “The Christmas Song” by The Raveonettes 
The most popular of the songs on this list (you’ll definitely hear this in an HMV or Sears around this time), The Raveonettes’ holiday jam is still commendable for its great musicality and for the Danish duo’s reliably haunting, consistent harmony. The lyrics are traditional Christmas schlock, but nothing can take away from moving chord changes and faint guitar wailing.
12. “Got Something for You” by Best Coast and Wavves 
At first, the collaboration between real-life lovers Best Coast and Wavves doesn’t sound so different from a Target Radio choice (because that’s exactly what it was written for). But over two minutes, these Cali surf rock hipsters pull out their own brand of rad, sneaking some garage-rock crunch into a market-friendly exterior.
13. “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” by Death Cab for Cutie 
This one’s kind of a cheat, as you’ll be sick to death of U2’s version by late November, but Death Cab manages to escape the Christmas music trap, turning this “classic” into a fairly traditional yet well-composed indie rock song, with the bonus/detractor of Ben Gibbard’s beautiful voice.
14. “Christmas at the Zoo” by The Flaming Lips 
An upbeat, sort of Christmas-y song, performed by pop rock’s weirdest band. It starts off seasonal enough, with disheveled frontman Wayne Coyne lamenting about the lack of snow on Christmas Eve, but pretty quickly he’s just shouting about monkeys and birds being loose. What else did you expect?
15. “Christmas in Harlem” by Kanye West 
No such list would be complete without Kanye’s sleazy and nostalgic six-and-a-half minute, ghetto-blasting gift to the world. Bringing with him an army of urban music all-stars, West manages to hit a sweet spot in spite of himself, and produce a crude, vulgar, ass-shaking Christmas carol that’s also unexpectedly worthy of a fireside hot chocolate.
With 15 fine Christmas songs at your disposal, you may make it through the holiday toil yet. Get these on a mixtape and block out Kelly Clarkson. You can still have a hipster — I mean, happy – holiday season.

7. For Bad Singers Who Don’t Care or Theatre Buffs: 
Musicals 
What kind of person says no to musicals? And I’m not talking about your average Shakespearean play here, people.  With musicals like Aladdin and Les Misérables, thou shalt never be bored. With singing and dancing, it’s a fun time for everyone, so bring your loved ones along with you.
Just try not to get kicked out for singing along to those catchy numbers.
8. For Samaritans and Everyone: 
Volunteer!
Lastly, and most importantly, this season is not just about buying gifts – it’s about giving back. A quick Google search and you will see that there are many organizations that need volunteers like you.
Even if it’s not specifically related to the holidays, volunteers are always needed and much appreciated, whether it’s here on campus, in your community, or in the city.

With this being our last issue before 2014, it makes sense to reflect a little before moving forward. This year, like any year, changed the world and added its unique stamp on history — politically, socially, and culturally. Here are some of the moments and movements that shaped the last 365 days (give or take a month).
In entertainment:
Just this week, 40-year-old • Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died, tragically and ironically, in a car crash. Cory Monteith, the 31-year-old star of TV’s Glee, died of a drug overdose in July. Other notable deaths in the entertainment industry this year included singer-songwriter and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, espionage-fiction writer Tom Clancy, Sopranos star James Gandolfini, and famous film critic Roger Ebert.
As of publication, • Iron Man 3 was the year’s highest grossing film, while Justin Timberlake’s The 20/20 Experience and Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2 were notably successful albums. Grand Theft Auto V was the top video game, and had the biggest debut of any entertainment release in history.

The subway extension, which is set to bring a stop on the TTC metro system all the way to York in 2015, continued this year. With heavier work underway, there were more bussing delays, and some total reshaping of the campus.
For no good reason but democracy, York’s students voted in favour of a new Student Centre, which will set our financially-challenged school back another few million dollars.
The Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) have played a major role in recent York University news: security has had alumni protestors leave the campus, a past student was banned for his involvement in a SAIA rally in March, and the group’s official status as a York club was revoked. All of this has contributed to York’s nationally recognized free-speech limitations.
York began construction on a new building for the Lassonde School of Engineering. The construction will cost $85 million, and is set to further diversify the career paths of York graduates. The building is currently aiming for completion in 2015. It will be a massive, artistically unique construction, near Curtis Lecture Hall.
In politics:

The story has made Ford the most talked about politician in the world, being the focus of international news (including CNN) and satire (Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show).
Ed Snowden, a computer expert and former CIA employee, divulged 200,000 classified documents to the world in what could be called a lazy remake of the Julian Assange story. Snowden’s revelations gave new perspective on the privacy-slaughtering measures taken for U.S. security.
Syria’s civil conflict continued to escalate into 2013, with the use of extremely controversial chemical warfare on the country’s own people.
In a move from Republicans to get cutbacks in Obamacare, the U.S.’s federal government shut down for a whopping two weeks in October. The move proved futile and fruitless, except that it cost the government billions of dollars.
Two of the most divisive politicians of the last century, former UK prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, died this year. The latter was still politically active at the time of his death.

With this being our last issue before 2014, it makes sense to reflect a little before moving forward. This year, like any year, changed the world and added its unique stamp on history — politically, socially, and culturally. Here are some of the moments and movements that shaped the last 365 days (give or take a month).
In entertainment:
Just this week, 40-year-old • Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died, tragically and ironically, in a car crash. Cory Monteith, the 31-year-old star of TV’s Glee, died of a drug overdose in July. Other notable deaths in the entertainment industry this year included singer-songwriter and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, espionage-fiction writer Tom Clancy, Sopranos star James Gandolfini, and famous film critic Roger Ebert.

2014-03-26,York,Israel,"Walking through Vari Hall, fourth-year psychology major Tamika Johnson picks up a York region newspaper. Messages of gun violence, theft, and other crimes run rampant through its pages, with the finger of disapproval constantly pointed towards members of her own community, Jane and Finch.
Johnson skims the pages with a familiar feeling of dismay. The picture of Jane and Finch’s youth population is painted clearly in the paper’s narrative: troublesome, delinquent, and even criminal.
Johnson, 27, was born in Jamaica. She is a former resident of the Jane and Finch area. The community has always held a special place in her heart, but it is aggrieved by the constant stereotyping of its inhabitants.
Perpetuated by popular media, the “danger” myth of Jane and Finch is widespread—even amongst York students and faculty, a population situated mere minutes away. Johnson recognizes that a communication barrier between York and the Jane and Finch community has resulted in a damaging reputation for the neighbourhood.
“I think the relationship between York and the Jane and Finch community needs a lot of work. It’s an institution versus [the Jane and Finch community’s] youth, and youth in the media are either seen as unable to represent themselves or as rebellious,” says Johnson. 
Johnson has taken a stand against the stigmatization of her heart and home by founding Boss Magazine. While others dwell on mainstream media stories of gun violence and poverty, Johnson works ardently to inspire a better informed public.
The youth-led Boss aims to dispel the danger myth of the neighbourhood by showcasing positive activities of the Jane and Finch community and its vibrant youth population. The publication covers a range of lifestyle and fashion topics to appeal to a diverse audience.

“There was nothing for us to voice our own views of what we like, what’s really happening in the community, and the creative vision that youth have,” says Johnson on the pre-Boss Magazine era.
Johnson has attempted to engage the York population by reaching out to students, specifically those interested in fashion and business, and encouraging them to get involved with the magazine.
“[York] shouldn’t be a separate entity from the area,” she says. “It is part of the Jane and Finch community, it should have a mandate to engage.”
Johnson continues, “There are a lot of students that are [at York] for writing, and I wanted to give them a platform to [promote] their own talents.”
Currently, Johnson is still looking for more York students to work with Boss. She wants the magazine to be a vehicle for talent and to bring in youth to be a part of a project they can be proud of.
Johnson is extremely proud of her accomplishments with the magazine thus far. For her, the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Boss Magazine from the Jane and Finch community is its own reward.
“People from the community opened the magazine and saw themselves,” she says. 
Johnson feels strongly that reconnecting York and the Jane and Finch community will be mutually beneficial because their proximity allows them to share resources.
Lorna Schwartzentruber, manager of York University’s Community Engagement Centre, is deeply focused on repairing the relationship between the two communities as well.
“Most understandings of the Jane and Finch community don’t reflect its reality. Stereotypes have been processed year after year, and students don’t often take the time to experience the community, which perpetuates a power imbalance,” says Schwartzentruber. “We need to challenge some of those stereotypes by getting a more holistic view of the community.”
The Community Engagement Centre is making efforts to strengthen university’s ties to the community by making York a better neighbour.
“York has a social responsibility as a large organization to be a good neighbour, and contribute in positive ways to the community it is a part of,” says Schwartzentruber. 
Their “Student Orientation to Working in Jane and Finch,” for example, will pilot this September in an effort to unpack some of the issues faced by this community for students so they may better understand systemic oppression in marginalized communities and be able to engage with the community without fear or judgment.
Schwartzentruber strongly feels that this is just the beginning of uniting York with Jane and Finch. “Through community engagement, we can increase the learning potential for students, while simultaneously strengthening the community,” she says.
Natalie Coulter, a communications studies professor at York, is another strong advocate for community engagement. Through her classes, she has given her students the opportunity to participate in various community engagement projects with different organizations in the Jane and Finch region.
“I hope [York students] have a new understanding of [the] richness of the community that goes beyond school,” says Coulter. “I hope when students leave [York], they are proud that they both went to York University and that York University is in the Jane and Finch community.”
“The separation is not just physical—it’s also in terms of knowing and understanding the community,” she says. “I realize that there are incredibly rich resources in this community that represent a huge array of opportunities for students.”
Projects like Johnson’s and Coulter’s provide a channel of communication between the two communities that students can get involved in.
Johnson is amazed that Coulter’s students have become involved with the magazine, and this exemplifies how Boss is one step closer to reaching this common goal.
Although Johnson is excited about the current progress and attention to these initiatives, she realizes there is much more work to be done, and that the process will be an arduous one.
As a York student and a Jane and Finch native, the burden of the stigma against her community is her own, and it pains her to see her school and her home at odds when the media so often targets them both. But she is hopeful that more people will join her fight for change. When that happens, the students of York and the people that make up Jane and Finch may stand together in a celebration of diversity, talent, and a sense of unity.

There’s been a dialogue about whether switching to an online voting system would be a better way forward for York Federation of Students elections.
To me, this is sort of like a debate on whether or not you should find a place to live by looking at pictures online and sending your first and last deposit by email transfer or by doing your research and then going in person to ensure you are getting what you’re paying for. Sure, the former is convenient and might save some time, but the risks are far too great for my liking.
We have seen far too many examples of elections going horribly wrong when online voting is employed, and these many instances of corruption give me doubts about the true integrity of the online elections.
The Western Gazette reported that in 2012, their university students’ council elections had been hacked by a former student, “who took advantage of a weakness in the site,” and that all 10,000 votes were invalidated, requiring a re-vote to be held two weeks later.
Similarly, in 2013, “poorly-timed human error lead to voters being presented with the wrong choices.”
At the University of British Columbia, in an online vote held in 2010, The Ubyssey reported that people were able to log in, clone the voting page, and submit fake ballots. This resulted in 731 ballots being submitted from a single IP address, alerting the elections committee that something was wrong.
Unsurprisingly, the votes were thrown out, but whoever received the extra 731 votes could have won if the flaw wasn’t discovered. And of course, students were a little angry at the system that allowed this to happen.
Recently, Queen’s University students saw their fall referendum postponed by a day because a miscommunication between the software behind their online voting system and their email server resulted in 6,000 email ballot logins not being sent out.
I think you see the trend here. The list goes on.
Let’s also acknowledge that in Canada, our federal, municipal and provincial elections operate on paper ballots.
The paper ballot voting system does not work at the touch of a button, but at least we know it’s a system that allows the integrity of the elections to stay intact.
At the end of the day, I like knowing I can have my space to vote without someone looming over my computer, that the candidates can’t hack in and vote for themselves 1,000 times over, and that people won’t be prevented from accessing the system due to glitches.
You can keep your “convenient” shortcut—I would much rather spend the time on ensuring quality.

I was banned from York University almost a year ago for exercising my freedom of expression by organizing and participating in a peaceful protest for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions and against York’s investments in weapons manufacturers.
The administration singled me out as an instigator, and they now may be attempting to paint me as an outsider to the York community.
Despite the dubious claim that I was banned for disrupting classes during the protest (York’s own local adjudicator found no disruption), I initially received a letter from VP Students Janet Morrison stating: “The University does not give permission for members of the public—including alumni—to enter our campus lands for protests or demonstrations, or to engage in forms of speech or action that are, in any way, racist or that advocate racism, violence, or hatred.”
Aside from the fact that alumni participate in on-campus protests regularly, Morrison’s statement raises the question of whether I was banned for disruption, for my political beliefs, or because I’m Palestinian. The fact that York Security threatened another Palestinian alumnus with arrest and trespass makes the question more pressing.
Moreover, former director of Security Services, Rob Kilfoyle told Office of Student Conflict Resolution Director Debbie Hansen by email that although my status as an alumnus complicates things, he “would love to” trespass me.
In another instance of disregard for the role of alumni, when SAIA met with the administration, VP Academic Rhonda Lenton refused to include me because “the offer was made to meet with current members of the York community.”
I feel compelled to state my history at York, for the record.
I was a student of psychology and political science from 2001 to 2007. The attacks of September 11 occurred after I arrived to Canada and following my frosh week.
My world was changed.
I became radicalized as bombs fell over Afghanistan and Iraq, and as the second Palestinian uprising was crushed under blood-soaked tank treads and the rubble of thousands of demolished Palestinian homes.
That’s when I joined the anti-war movement and, through the mentoring of a group of Iraqi students, honed the skills of activism.
I was co-founder of Amnesty International at York, a member of Now End War and Sanctions on Iraq, an executive member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, and a member of the Grass-Roots Anti-Imperialist Network.
I took part in the barricading of the entrances to campus on March 10, 2003, and helped to organize lectures, film screenings, and protests.
I worked for the Student Christian Movement at York and for the York University Telemail Program. I was elected to the York Federation of Students as the Stong College director, submitted articles for Excalibur and the YU Free Press, sang with the York University Choir, and performed with Vanier College Productions.
I experienced the corporatization of campus, repressive changes to university policies, and the numerous sanctions imposed on outspoken students and faculty as a result of those changes.
I went to pub nights when Founder’s Cock&Bull and Calumet’s On the Edge were more popular than The Underground. I lived at Stong Residence and Assiniboine. I walked through the graffiti-laden, weed-scented underground tunnels before they were closed, pulled all-nighters alone at the Student Centre and watched the sun rise from rooftops.
After I lost my home in Palestine, the York community became another home to me. York and I even share the same birthday. So rest assured, I am here to stay, and attempts at erasing my history at York University have already failed.

BDS is a campaign that marginalizes Jewish and pro-Israeli students. Whether or not you agree with their values, they have legitimate opinions from a different perspective. They are paying students trying to get an education. You’ve already paid your dues and you are preventing them from getting an education. Move on.
And fight your cause somewhere else.
You’ve got to get rid of this “us vs. them” mentality. It’s extremely unproductive and totally misrepresents the work of these activists at York University.
This is not an issue of Palestine vs. Israel. This is an issue of whether a public institution which ostensibly promotes itself as an advocate for social justice and human rights issues uses tuition dollars to invest in bombs, guns and other weapon paraphernalia to kill other human beings across the world.
It is a matter of morality.
To distort the BDS argument as simply, “marginalization of pro-Israeli students” misses the point entirely and confines the divestment argument to an entirely self-imposed narrative that comes from one’s own insecurity and fear of the “other”.
There is only one side, that is humanity.
Without a doubt York is an organization feasting on our tax dollars, with low educated lifers making 6 figures and completely unqualified for the positions they occupy. Disgusting. 
[su_heading size=”21″]Witnesses are now being called to the stand in the trial of Brian Dickson, the man accused of killing York student Qian Liu in her Village home in 2011.[/su_heading]
On the second day of the trial, the jury heard several witness accounts of what happened the day Liu’s body was first discovered in her Aldwinkle Heights residence.
Faquan Zeng, Liu’s landlord at the time; Alvin Yuhalogarasan, a paramedic who responded; and Toronto police sergeant Eric Dugan took the stand on March 25 to explain what they saw on April 15, 2011.
Zeng explained through a translator that he had received a message stating Liu might be in danger before rushing over to the residence to check if she was okay.
In her opening statements, Crown attorney Christine Pirraglia outlined how Liu’s former boyfriend (who had seen her struggle with a man over webcam the night before) had contacted her friends.
They eventually relayed the information to a tenant in the house, who then contacted Zeng.
[su_pullquote align=”right”]“We shouted Qian’s name, [but] we got no response, so we used the [master] key,” said Zeng’s translator.[/su_pullquote]
Zeng says he shouted Liu’s name a few more times and then opened the door and saw Liu lying on the floor.
According to Pirraglia, Liu’s body was faced down on the floor, naked from the mid-chest down with a nightgown pulled up around her chest. The Crown also noted Liu’s body had a white dry substance located on the upper thigh and groin area when found.
It was later determined that the substance was semen.

Yuhalogarasan, a paramedic who responded, says after examining her arm, he determined resuscitation would be futile.
“She was pronounced dead with rigor mortis,” says Yuhalogarasan, explaining rigor mortis is when joints become stiff and is a clear sign of death.
The Crown attorney stated on March 24 that Liu had died from mechanical asphyxia involving some form of neck compression.
Police sergeant Dugan explained on the stand that Liu was lying face down with blood coming from each side of her head, matching the photos displayed in court on March 24.
In the busy courtroom, Liu’s family listened in with earphones, as a translator helped them understand every single word said in the trial. The family stayed silent as each witness described what they saw in the Village home.
In her opening statement, Pirraglia revealed more details on how Liu was allegedly killed.
Around 1 a.m., Liu was chatting online with her former boyfriend Xian Meng in Beijing. She heard a knock on her door, said Pirraglia. Meng then saw a man attempt to hug Liu before pushing his way into her bedroom and knocking her webcam off the computer.
“He shoved Ms. Liu causing her to fall off camera in the direction of her bed,” said Pirraglia. “Mr. Meng, no longer able to see any images, heard Ms. Liu saying the word ‘no’ in both English and Mandarin.”
Pirraglia said after two muffled bangs, Meng never heard Liu’s voice again, and before the screen was shut, he saw the man approach the computer, naked from the waist down.
Robert Nuttall, the lawyer representing Dickson, asked the jury to return with a verdict of manslaughter, stating at the beginning of the trial, “This is not a case of who did it; this is a what happened case.”
He also stated that the jury members should pay close attention to the forensic evidence.
Dickson’s trial is expected to last three to four weeks with a 14-member jury.
A doctor who examined the body is expected to testify as a witness on March 25, along with Detective-Sergeant Frank Skubic, a lead investigator in the case.

[su_heading size=”21″]Students and faculty members were agitated last week when a widespread network outage shut down York’s web-based services. [/su_heading]MyMail, Moodle, the York homepage, and Flex accounts were all affected by the outage, which started at 7:20 p.m. on March 19.
Christopher Russel, director of ICT infrastructure and information security officer at York, says the outage was caused by a breaker being tripped during inclimate weather on the evening of March 19.
This caused a power outage on the Keele campus, and University Information Technology supply units failed. Some elements of York’s core network then lost power.
“With some exceptions, nearly all services were affected since they rely on the network,” says Russel.
“In some cases the service itself was still functioning, but it wouldn’t have been possible to connect to it. Parts of the network, including internet access for Keele campus student residences, were not directly impacted and continued to function.”
Pardis Aliakbarkhani, a third-year professional writing and anthropology student, says, “I had an assignment due that night through Moodle, and I was locked out of everything York-related. It was really frustrating.”
Between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 20, nearly all services affected by the outage were restored. Some services however, were not fully restored until midday on March 20.
Russel says a network error would not allow for correct diagnosis of network problems right away, and technical teams referred to a process of elimination to figure out what the problems were.
“In all, over 800 servers and systems were checked on and brought back into service,” says Russel.
Russel says scenarios like this have been successfully tested in the past.
UIT is currently working with the network vendor to ensure this problem is fully understood to reduce chances of this happening again.

The election voting period for CUPE 3903, the union that represents York’s contract faculty, teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and research assistants, has been extended to the end of this week as neither candidate for chair received more than 50 per cent of the votes.
The third candidate was dropped from the ballot since he did not have enough votes, leaving only Faiz Ahmed and Christina Rousseau running for chair. According to CUPE 3903’s bylaws, the union must have a run-off election for this position.
The run-off election runs until March 28.

Three York employees were arrested in relation to a fraud that occurred at York over seven years.
The fraud, alleged to have occurred between November 2005 and October 2012, is estimated to have cost the university $1.6 million. Police allege the employees issued fake invoices to the university.
Toronto Police announced the arrests on March 20. This is an ongoing investigation, and police expect more arrests to be made and further charges to be laid.
Vittoria Caparello is being charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, Yossi Zaidfeld is charged with one count of fraud over $5,000, and Melissa Caparello faces a charge of possession of property obtained by crime of under $5,000.
Malissa Caparello is still employed as an administrative assistant in the dean’s office at the faculty of environmental studies and has been employed by the university since January 2005.
In regards to the future of her employment status, Joanne Rider of York media says the university is currently doing a review of the matter, and once a decision has been made, appropriate action will be taken.
“As soon as the university was informed that there was a suspicion of fraud, we did two things: we informed the police and we engaged an external firm to conduct a forensic audit,” says Rider.
“The university has already recovered the money estimated to be lost plus additional costs since the university initially found out about the alleged fraud in October of 2012,” she says.
York was notified of the fraud when a whistleblower came forward with the information around the same time the university implemented new policies and procedures to detect fraud, says Rider. 
These policies were developed following a 2012 case in which two former York executives were accused of taking part in a massive phony invoice scheme and of defrauding the university of $1.2 million.
The Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation of Funds Policy developed as a result helped strengthen the university’s controls against fraud. The changes included an updated whistleblower policy, a conflict of interest policy, and the implementation of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment initiative.
“So it was at that time an individual came forward and indicated that they suspected suspicious activity,” says Rider.
As part of this policy, the identity of the whistleblower remains confidential.

Prominent York faculty and community members spoke in the Student Centre on March 25 to publicize alleged violations of student rights and civil liberties by York’s administration.
Professors David McNally, John Greyson, and Penni Stewart, as well as CUPE 3903 Chairperson Faiz Ahmed and alumnus Hamman Farah all spoke at the event.
Farah, who was banned from campus in the spring of 2013 following a rally held by Students Against Israeli Apartheid, says administrators cannot be allowed to continue to intimidate and harass students in unrestrained manner. 
Farah also points to York’s revocation of SAIA’s club status on March 27, 2013, as an example of this harassment and intimidation from York’s administration.
Despite being banned from campus, Farah still spoke at the event.
Joanne Rider of York media responded to Excalibur’s request for comment via email, stating that freedom of expressions is one of York’s guiding principles.
“Members of the York community have the right to express their views and to test and challenge ideas, provided they do so within the law, and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner that does not disrupt academic activity,” Rider continues. 
She also adds that York’s responsibility is to protect the academic environment, while ensuring all community members abide by agreed upon standards of conduct, which allow students to pursue their studies “free from unwelcome disruptions.”
“York has and will continue to ensure these policies are communicated, understood, and adhered to in a consistent manner,” says Rider.
The event was not prevented by York administration, as it was approved by the Student Centre board and included participation from the York Federation of Students.
Farah is pushing for York to amend their Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Senate Policy on Disruptive and/or Harassing Behaviour in Academic Situations, and the Temporary Use of University Space policy to reflect Canadian values of freedom of expression.
“Free speech and free assembly are important to students,” he says. “This is where we learn the most about these basic democratic values, and where the most opportunities arise to exercise them.”
David McNally, a political science professor, spoke out in support of SAIA and Farah. Hereferenced a letter signed by 150 faculty members urging the administration to recognize civil rights violations and begin amending policies on the use of student space and the student code of conduct.
“You cannot maintain any of kind of democratic culture in a society unless basic rights to express opinions and assemble on behalf of those opinions is secure,” says McNally.
He cites the treatment of SAIA and Farah as a specific problem within York’s democratic culture. McNally also believes the York administration is attempting to “roll back the gains that student and social movements have made in regards to free speech and free assembly, particularly those with dissenting opinions.”
“Speaking as a political scientist, I don’t see how I can go into my classes and try to transmit to students the importance of basic civil rights in a democratic society, and then not speak out when I see my own administration violating them,” he says.
McNally says the event will only have been successful if it contributes to increasing pressure on the York administration to “get serious about civil rights and student rights.”

That is ridicuous. The author fails to mention that SAIA is by the the most harassing and intimidating (well they try) club on campus. Outrageous to protest in a lecture hall and disrupt class, that WE PAY FOR AND NEED TO GRADUATE, and then get the appropriate punishment as agreed upon in the contracts with the school on behavior codes. And then play the victim? Whack
SAIA harasses students (the white poppy thing on Remembrance day) and administrators (screamed violently and disrupted York’s Birthday and insulted President Shoukouri). Not to mention violently barricading Jewish students in the Hillel office in 2009 where the police had to be called. Peaceful protests?? get your head examined

2014-04-02,York,Israel,"Pick up a copy of the Butterknife in Excalibur for this week only!
Video by Ashlee Mitchell 
When I started my term as editor-in-chief last May, I was pretty naive.
The vision I pitched in my job interview was one of Excalibur as a driving force for change on campus.
This has proven to be difficult though. The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.
Excalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.
When they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.
Whether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.
One reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.
While I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.
But it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.
Some believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.
Have students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?
There are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.
I’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.
There are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.
When it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.
Students Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.
But more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.
If you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.
This year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause. I just wish I’d had more to talk about.

As a Founders grad, Student Council, & Excalibur active participant from the early 70’s, I’ve recently been disappointed with your online feedback procedures and the lack of commitment to fix such a simple technological problem. Maybe this has now been addressed and If this comment is accepted I’ll be encouraged to contribute more. 
Historically York has been known as the school where activism never stops.
So why have we seen such little of it recently? Protests seem to have all but disappeared from our campus, and this isn’t necessarily a good thing.
Has the school really managed to quiet its students?
According to OPIRG-York, an organization that conducts research, advocacy, and lobbying, as well as educational and media campaigns for social justice, “the decline of student activism has a direct correlation with the corporatization of York.”
With increased costs and budget cuts, York has basically become a big business, they say.
“York University was once an open institution that was used as a safe space to express different views, but unfortunately, the university’s administration has made clear their views on protests and the consequences the students will face if participating in such activities.”
We’ve decided to take a look back into the Excalibur archives at large student protests that refl ect York University’s once active and radical student political engagement.
We also highlight a few recent events that suggest while activism may be dormant on our campus, it isn’t dead.

A total of 1,596 York staff and faculty members have made it onto the 2013 Ontario Sunshine List.
The list discloses the salaries of people who earn over $100,000, working for public institutions in
Ontario. Included on York’s list are professors, librarians, program directors, deans, sports coaches, and senior staff .
Topping the list is York President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri who earns $478,405.94 as his yearly salary, and another $8,455.72 in taxable benefits.
Shoukri is the second-highest paid public sector employee within the university portion of the Sunshine List, coming in just behind Western University’s President and Vice-Chancellor Amit Chakma, who earns $479,600.04 and $41,467.28 in taxable benefits.
Brenda Spotton Visano, a professor of economics at York, sees a tension between the public’s right to know and the right to privacy for public sector employees.
“Should we reveal everybody’s income? I don’t think so,” says Visano.
She favours the idea of transparency, but would also like to see the salaries of employees of private corporations.
The Sunshine List has been published since the Ontario government passed the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act in 1996. Its purpose is to encourage a more open system of government.
Visano adds that the list should be adjusted, as the $100,000 cut- off was implemented in 1996, and suggests it should be moved closer to $150,000.
The list itself allows the public to compare individuals and their respective compensations, providing more information on how tax dollars are being spent.
The Sunshine List also includes employees of the Ontario government, crown agencies, municipalities, hospitals, boards of public health, school boards, colleges, Hydro One, Ontario Power Generation, and other public sector employers.

York President and Vice Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri recently met with Toronto Police Services to discuss improving security on campus after the March 6 Student Centre shooting.
The meeting, which took place on March 18, was closed to the public. A full debrief of the incident was conducted, and recommendations were proposed.
Shoukri and police agreed that for the remainder of the academic term, York would provide enhanced security patrols in “key public areas in and around the central core of Keele campus” during evening and night hours.
“Given the nature of the recent occurrence in the Student Centre, the enhanced patrols will focus on prime public locations on campus,” says Rob Castle, senior executive officer for the vp finance and administration.
“Of course, locations of the patrols can be adjusted if there is a need to do so, as the enhanced patrols will occur during evening and night hours.”
Patrols will be done by both Toronto Police and York Security officers. Only the Keele campus will see an increase in security presence.
Shoukri and Toronto Police also resolved to strengthen their ongoing relationship and the neighbourhood community response team.
Additionally, “An expanded campaign will encourage students, staff, and faculty to download the [YorkU Mobile Safety App], which will be a key element in emergency communications,” says Joanne Rider of York media.
With over 11,000 downloads by users for the app, a new push notification function has been added, allowing the university to have direct communication in urgent situations with York community members.
Castle says a “Campus Alert” feature has been added, which allows the university to communicate on-going programs and information to users.
“The voice over function was improved to ensure more accurate voice responses when a user presses specific icons,” he adds.
Two students were injured in the March 6 incident, which sparked this review of security measures on campus, and police arrested a suspect several days later.

York students can expect to hear noise throughout the night due to continuing construction of the Toronto York-Spadina Subway Extension.
The site has been authorized to run construction overnight from March 21 to April 11.
A dewatering system has been installed to drain the site. The work is currently focused on excavating the “Light Scoop” area and building the station box.
Construction is continuous, with work on the base slab of the station expected to commence in late April.
This will include installing waterproofing, pouring and curing the concrete protection slab, formwork. and installing rebar.

After hearing arguments from both the defense and the Crown, jury members in the trial of Brian Dickson, the man accused of killing York student Qian Liu in 2011, will begin deliberations on April 7.
The Crown is charging Dickson with first-degree murder for the death of Liu, and has rejected Dickson’s plea for a manslaughter charge.
Liu was attacked by a man in her apartment in the Village while she was chatting online with her boyfriend, Xia Chao Meng, who was in Beijing at the time. She was found naked and face down in her room the next day after Meng managed to get word out to her friends and landlord that she could be in danger. 
On April 1, the court heard that DNA found on Liu’s abdomen, groin, fingernails, and chest matched Dickson’s DNA profile.
Forensic biologist Melissa Kell also testified that Liu could also not be excluded as a source of the DNA found on the bloodstained shirt collected from Dickson’s residence.
Forensic pathologist Dr. Christopher Milroy said Liu’s death may have been caused by mechanical asphyxiation, which is blockage of airways through neck or chest compression, as indicated by bruising on her neck and bleeding in her eyes.
Her roommate, Zahid Abdullah, who also testified on April 1, may have helped identify the shirt with the matching DNA sample. 
He told the jury he saw an unknown Caucasian male in the house the night of Liu’s death, wearing a shirt that matched the description of the one investigators eventually retrieved and tested.
Abdullah, however, did not directly identify Dickson.
Dickson’s lawyer, Robert Nuttall, is seeking a manslaughter ruling, arguing the cause of death needs to be definitive before one can determine intent beyond reasonable doubt.
Nutall also argued that Dickson’s mental capacity was reduced, based on his claim that he was medicated and intoxicated, but no evidence to prove this combination affected him has been presented as of publication.

The York University Student Centre’s board of directors has decided to increase security surveillance and lighting in the building.
Cameras will be installed facing the exits of the building, and lighting in the walkway and exterior of the building will be increased.
Jessica Thyriar, York Federation of Students president and spokesperson for the board of directors, says after discussions with stakeholders and groups in the Student Centre, a compromise was made to increase surveillance for safety reasons, but also ensure student privacy.
“We needed to find a balance between ensuring that folks who use the space for various reasons, such as support services, felt comfortable [and that their information remained confidential] and ensuring other students did feel safe when using the building,” says Thyriar.
Imran Mohamed, third-year kinesiology and psychology major, says the change is a positive one.
“It’s not exactly monitoring student activities inside the Student Centre. We still have our sense of privacy, [but] we know who is coming in and who is leaving,” says Mohamed.
Mohamed adds that while he supports the decision to add cameras facing the exits, he would not feel comfortable with cameras being installed in the food court or by the couches upstairs.
“If there is a sense of people watching you, you just do not feel right. It doesn’t add to the festivities or the atmosphere [that the Student Centre is trying to promote],” says Mohamed.
Thyriar says the board of directors is constantly reviewing ways to improve the Student Centre and ensure students feel safe.
“I think it’s important for the community to come together in various ways to share various things that we can do in regards to safety, and if we continue having these discussions and [making] efforts to actually put these things forward, it’s more of a community,” says Thyriar.
Currently, York has over 660 CCTV cameras overlooking parking lots, buildings, and classrooms, but there are none in the Student Centre.

2016-01-31,York,Israel,"Students are reporting mixed reactions after Ontario New Democratic Party leader, Andrea Horwath toured York’s Keele campus.
Backlash ensued on social media after a photo was posted to the Students Against Israeli Apartheid Facebook page featuring Horwath meeting with York Federation of Students executives and a “SAIA member.”
Rena Silver, political liaison with Hasbara at York, says it was distressing seeing Horwath meeting with students associated with movements such as Israeli Apartheid Week, which Silver describes as dangerous behaviour.
“Without being privy to the exact details or context of this meeting, Hasbara at York can say that it is of the firm understanding that hateful movements such as Israeli Apartheid Week which serve no purpose but to demonize and slander Israel slow potential peace processes.” 
Willem Hart, president of Campus Conservatives York University, wants an Ontario free of discrimination.
“But it gives me pause to think of what this secretariat would look like practically, given that Horwath is promoting this policy to students whose goal is to marginalize and alienate Jewish and Israeli students with their advocacy for the BDS movement,” says Hart.
“Horwath and the NDP should take a less ambiguous stance on this issue. BDS has no place in an Ontario that welcomes everybody,” he adds.
In a phone call with Excalibur, representatives for Horwath say the MPP wasn’t aware of any SAIA members at the meeting, while the purpose of the meeting was to discuss anti-racism initiatives.
“The Jewish community at York is home to a diversity of political opinions,” says Manisha Joshi-Vijayan, second-year English student, and the SAIA member allegedly featured in the photo.
“The York chapter of Independent Jewish Voices, for example, advocates for equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians. So we shouldn’t confuse criticism and peaceful action against the racist policies of a state for an attack on an entire people,” she adds.
Previously, a coalition of Ontario MPs voted to condemn Israeli Apartheid Week. The YFS famously endorsed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in 2013.
Last March, Toronto hosted the 11th annual Israeli Apartheid Week.

Juno-nominated jazz trio, Myriad3, graced York last Thursday in the Martin Family Lounge in Accolade East. Composed of Chris Donnelly on piano, Ernesto Cervini on drums and percussion, and Dan Fortin on upright bass, the group shared equal ambition and exuberance in performance, bringing their beautiful and exciting sound to the uplifting contrast of overcast skies and the York subway construction behind them.
Hailing from Toronto, Myriad3 formed accidentally as a self-proclaimed “twist-of-fate” which had brought the trio together in 2010. Each member brought forth awe-inspiring talent, performed with the utmost intricacy, providing the modestly crowded room of York students a one-of-a-kind show.
Myriad3 was nominated for Jazz Album of the Year: Group at the 2015 Juno Awards for their sophomore release, The Where. Their debut album, Tell, was released in 2012. If that wasn’t ambitious enough, Myriad3’s pianist, Donnelly, released a collection of renditions of the group’s music in the style of 8-bit chiptunes in Tell((Chip)), bringing the worlds of classical jazz and the nostalgia of Nintendo Entertainment System together, colliding in a beautiful harmony.
Although jazz is often associated with being soothing and soft, intensity was not devoid in their performance. The ambiance and emotion of the trio’s sound hopped from moments of vigorous intensity, often guttural, bassy transitioning, to intoxicating soothing smoothness.
The performers also treated the audience with an original rendition of Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson’s arrangement of a Duke Ellington piece, which showed exuberance in everything that is in the spirit of the Jazz ethos.
The trio even dabbled in some modes of performance art, where the audience broke out into unbridled applause, when Donnelly lead a synchronized rest and queued his fellow bandmates to break the silence by sniffling; a flawlessly executed move that led to the audience’s amazement.
This could arguably be recognized as the highlight of the performance.
The modestly crowded room enjoyed the jazz outfit’s timing, both speeding up and slowing down tempos and resting pauses, and showing the different streams of consciousness of playing amalgamated into a single, unified form.
The instrumental renditions were not without sentimentality either. One of the group’s songs “Little Lentil” was titled after Cervini’s then unborn child, who was the size of a little lentil. A twinkle sounding beautiful lullaby-esque jazz ballad was reminiscent of the charm of a child’s lullaby, mixed with the thickness of layered artistry found in jazz.
Although the performance was instrumental, Myriad3 managed to conspire laughter as Fortin’s hosting showcased his sense of humour. Pressing on issues of the current state of the Canadian dollar, and the terrifying rising price of cauliflower, brought more personality to the silent moments between renditions, arguably just as entertaining as the music.
The show’s greatest moments however were surely seen from the beginning of the performance until the end. It was seen in each member of the trio’s moods while playing. The looks of joy, unobstructed focus, and dedication on each of their faces showed the genuine love each member had for the performing arts and music alike.

2016-02-29,York,Israel,"The following is a community editorial expressing the opinions of community members. The views do not reflect Excalibur, its publishers or masthead.

The media war against Israel still continues at York and has manifested itself in the well-known forms we’ve come acquainted with. It was only recently that an anti-Israel parade had made itself publicly known to the student body in the February 4 YU Divest protest in Vari Hall and the Student Centre.
The anti-Israel and anti-Zionist agendas are seen by many as a humanitarian-aid effort to help those who are under an alleged occupation. Yet, Jewish people whose beliefs, customs, and origins came from the very land that’s being disputed among the world’s powers is seen as illegitimate. It’s true that many of us have been conditioned by the media on this campus to think of Israel as an apartheid state and that war is being waged every second of everyday, but the truth is, as I found it, surprisingly different. Israel does what’s necessary to protect her people, her history, and her existence. For the reader who’s ignorant of Jewish history, allow me to educate you – throughout history, the Jews were constantly exiled, slaughtered, and discriminated, but they kept on believing in a future for themselves. A future where Jews could find peace and return to the place they always called home. This was re-established in 1948 – the year Israel gained independence.
Is it not okay for one to dream? To not aspire? To defend his right to exist on the soil of their forefathers? I implore the readers to please educate themselves and to actually talk with those who are being ostracized (the Jews), rather than blindly accept the biased material being excreted by anti-Zionists on campus, who strategically disguise themselves as a human rights council, when they are not.
With my first visit to the Promised Land, I was expecting soldiers to be in their numbers and the possibility of a missile raining down on my family. Okay, I confess, soldiers and police were almost everywhere I went, but it was their presence that made me feel okay. I didn’t have to turn around every second to make sure no one was going to stab me to death.
As the Trinidadian that I am and as a student who chooses to educate himself, I have a deep concern for the kind of information and the politicized atmosphere being dispersed at York. But as the proud Zionist that I am, I remain unafraid to express my love for Israel on this campus, as it is a testimony and monument of people who refuse to be swayed, assimilated, and judged by the world’s standards.
The next time you observe the extremist bandwagons of those who oppose Israel in the Student Centre, those oppose the Jewish people and the refuge in which they yearned for, try putting yourself into the shoes of a Jew and simply ask yourself, what would coming home feel like after 3,000 years of being away from it? If you said it was good to come home, then I say to you, mazel tov! You’re a Zionist and being unapologetic for it is one of the bravest things you could be at York.

Calls for a boycott rang out during Israeli Apartheid Week as a group representing black graduate students made allegations against Students Against Israeli Apartheid’s guest speaker Rania Khalek, an independent journalist and activist whom they accused of being “notoriously anti-black.”
York University Black Graduate Student’s Collective posted an anti-black racism bulletin on March 23, the same day that Khalek was to deliver a lecture called The Weapon’s Lab: Israeli Apartheid and the Arms Trade. According to SAIA, Khalek was invited to give a lecture on how Israel uses Palestine as a laboratory for weapons and methods of domination and control, which are then exported to other parts of the world.
BGSC’s bulletin calls for a boycott of Khalek’s lecture, stating it is their policy whenever a speaker with a history of committing emotional, social, and or physical violence against groups of black people. However, the event proceeded as scheduled.
The BGSC was not available for further comment.
“Rania Khalek is a well-known supporter of Black Lives Matter and the call for reparations for past and present injustices inflicted on black people in the United States,” says Merate Atare, member of SAIA. “Those who levelled the allegation that Khalek is anti-black, with no evidence, lack a progressive worldview based on mutual solidarity.”
Atare explains SAIA reached out to the individual, but couldn’t come to an agreement.
“We in the Palestine solidarity movement at York will not throw our friends and supporters under the bus, and we stand firmly behind them.”
Khalek has come under fire in the past for allegedly overstating the similarity between the movements for Palestinian and black rights, particular on social media.
In the aftermath of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri in late 2014, for example, Khalek made a connection between the repression of Palestinian protests in Israel and of black protests in the United States.
She faced backlash on Twitter, where she was referred to as “an anti-black, ahistoric troll” and was threatened with violent retaliation.

The Lions men’s basketball team fought hard all season long for their spot in the Ontario University Athletics playoffs, but just as they were about to hit the court for a post-season play, their season came to an abrupt and disappointing end.
York University Athletics and Recreation announced on the last day of February that an ineligible player had been participating in the games and that all games he had been involved in would have to be disqualified. This included nine regular season games overall and three crucial victories, without which the Lions gave up their spot in the OUA playoffs.
The player, who was not named, had participated in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport at another institution during the preseason and hence was not supposed to take part in the Lions’ games this season.
Prior to the debacle, the Lions had spent the final weeks of the regular season fighting their way through tough games. They lost to the Windsor Lancers by a score of 86-85 and to the Western Mustangs by 81-80. The Lions then edged the Algoma Thunderbirds by 68-67 and finally secured themselves a playoff spot by defeating the UofT Varsity Blues in a huge overtime victory by a score of 97-93.
The Lions lost to the dominant Ryerson Rams by a score of 81-72 in their final game of the regular season, perhaps taking it easier knowing they had already achieved their long-sought goal of making the playoffs. Two days later, on February 29, Athletics and Recreation finally broke the bad news to the team, the OUA, and the CIS.
However, instead of brooding over that, athletes on the team are reflecting on their performance throughout the season.
“I honestly don’t think we reached our full potential as a team,” says guard Shane Reader. “Mostly because of injuries, but we were definitely better than our record showed. We lost a handful of games by three or fewer points that could have gone either way.”
“We did everything well at some point or another,” he adds, “but (we) just couldn’t bring it all together consistently.”
Reader believes that the team needs to especially work on defense, which he says can be done by careful observation of the opponent’s strategy and game planning. “Our offence does need work,” he adds, “but we have enough weapons to score when chances come around.”
Looking forward to next season, Reader says that it will take more than just better defense and a summer of intensive workouts to get the team to where it needs to be.
“The goal for next season is to get a new coach that will help [our program],” he says. “It’s obviously time for a change after six long seasons of backing out in the first round of the playoffs, and you’ve all seen how this season ended.”

The subject of illiteracy among women has not been talked about enough and it is time to change that. Adults who are illiterate or have low literacy have been shamed as beings of idiocy or laziness in today’s society, unless they seek to improve themselves or merge into the mainstream education system. In Canadian society alone it is noted that four out of 10 adults’ literacy skills are too low to be fully competent for most jobs in the economy.
Illiteracy rates among racialized women have a critical effect in Canadian society. To be an immigrant to Canada, one must be capable of learning a language outside of their mother tongue, if not English or French, and be able to adapt to the new economic structure in place here.
What many seem to overlook about immigrants in Western society is that a majority are coming from situations of poverty, political upheaval, or social structures that have not allowed them to seek further education.
Literacy is a fundamental right for all, but in regions where agendas of domestication are pushed onto women, literacy and higher-education do not become a priority.
Before jumping to theories, it is important to note the life of a lot of immigrant women and how they have adapted into Canadian society. It has become necessary that women provide the domesticated services they have been trained to do, under the sacrifice of an education. Unpaid domestic labour that goes on in the home is often considered invaluable.
A lot of people in Western society and in our current generation are used to having the ability to read and write. Many cannot imagine what it feels like to look at something and not be able to understand it. You may say, well then go out and learn, but once these women come of age they take the knowledge and notion they learned in their home country and migrate to Canada, and start a new life.
They come here for work and to start a family. You will find a lot of immigrant women and men working in factory settings because more often than not, the job does not require a lot of comprehension for reading and writing, but rather is more labour focused.
Once these women marry and start a family, the structure in the household changes to focus not just on themselves but on their children. These women tend to put themselves second to their children, and education is prioritized for their child. Over time, their notion of improvement gets lost, because they become roped into a routine of work and home life, and the idea for a second chance at literacy is put on the back burner.
But the stigma of women not having that ability is still in place. Women who do not have the skills that modern education provides lose the ability and skill set that they could have had to manage their own income and expenditure. Children of literate mothers are known to be more likely to complete their education.
Does this mean we need to start forcing people to take educational tests and literacy examinations before entering the country? No. That is only fueling the taboo around the whole topic. What needs to be done is accepting the fact that they are people who’ve had to sacrifice more than they’ve had to gain, especially these women.
 This is still an empowerment movement for women. Even though some women may lack mainstream education in Canadian society, they still provide for themselves and their families in the best way that they can. They are not lesser beings because they didn’t get the chance at modern education. You wouldn’t make fun of an individual in a wheelchair, therefore there should be no hatred or fuel for ignorance against women for their disposition.
Instead, please praise them and encourage more women to better themselves and take a second chance at learning. What many miss when they cross paths with a person who is illiterate is the fact that in a society built upon languages and literature, despite them not being able to fully comprehend what is being written, they still made a life and have overcome that barrier. Women who have this trait are no less than women who have the educational means to succeed in life through positions greater than their own.
A factory job does not under any circumstances demean you as lesser than others, because what many forget is that we are all striving towards supporting ourselves and others. These women face this stigma harsher than anyone else, and they still stand strong and make it through a lifestyle that does not accept their lesser implication. So stop shaming them, start praising them, and help them when you can. Take an interest in adult illiteracy because many people have family and friends who are going through this and everyone deserve a second chance.

Meet Jeff Bierk, a Toronto photographer who documents both beauty and tragedy in Toronto’s neighbourhoods with junkies and homeless people being the subject of many of his photographs. While the raw and honest elements of Bierk’s work might mistake him for a street photographer, his work strongly differs from this practice. He is currently featured in the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival, an annual month-long festival held throughout the GTA in May. Bierk has two shows on display, Top Left and 10 Blankets, the latter of which has been praised as a must-see of the festival. Excalibur had the opportunity to attend the opening night of Top Left on May 13 and interview the man behind the powerful images.
From making photographs to displaying them, transparency and respect remain principles in Bierk’s work. He has developed a collaborative practice where the subjects of his photographs are recognized as collaborators, with profit splitting being one way to demonstrate this. This perspective comes from Bierk’s understanding that without the labour that his collaborators put into daily life, none of the photographs would be possible. He also offers accessible public viewing of his work by displaying them on streets, perhaps a response to the widening of class gaps and digital divides.
Consent has been another cornerstone of Bierk’s recent photography. Bierk explains how he used to take photographs of homeless people, who he refers to as “precariously housed,” sleeping on hot air grates on the corner of Queen Street East and Victoria Street.
“I used to do it without consent,” describes Bierk. “Those images, without consent, mark a big transformation in my way of making photographs because I was operating without a lot of thoughtfulness. I had entitlement where I wanted to capture the honesty. I [felt I] had the right to photograph you and use your body to tell my story.” 
Bierk’s journey has not come without hardship. Tragedy has influenced much of his work.
“I experienced three deaths at a pretty young age. My parents and the person I fell in love with died,” says Bierk with both strength and sadness.
Bierk’s parents were both artists, so as a child, he was exposed to their art from a young age. His father was a painter and even taught him how to take photographs.
“I was seeking connection to my father and my mother through trying to become an artist and make photographs,” he says.
For the majority of his life, Bierk battled with a drug addiction, though he has been sober for four years. 
“I was really into photography and then I got really into drugs. So I checked out of the world for a long time,” says Bierk.
Photography has been a mechanism to cope with his addiction. “I think seeking quick interactions with strangers was a way for me to connect with my addiction and connect with the kind of excitement I felt when I was doing drugs – being in places I shouldn’t be in, seeing these secret places we don’t see unless we’re involved.”
Beauty might not be the word dominant culture would use to describe his work but Bierk begs to differ. 
“At the core, it’s about honouring a kind of beauty that I see, though it is not a dominant notion of what is beautiful,” explains Bierk. Bierk believes narrow perceptions of beauty are why his portraits are mischaracterized as street photography.
“You show portraits of people and automatically have it lumped into street photography,” he says.
Bierk’s work is refreshing and his story is one that adds dimension to conversations of street, candid and beauty photography, pushing conversation of what it means to be homeless.

Summer is finally here and many students are enjoying the lack of responsibilities associated with time off from school.
One particular benefit that summer brings is the freedom to sleep in. With tuition costs constantly rising, more and more students are forced to try and balance work and school to ensure they can pay their fees. This balancing act often forces them to give up certain aspects of their life, and one of the most common things sacrificed is sleep.
The National Sleep Foundation published a study in February 2015 that stated people between the ages of 18 and 25 should be getting between seven and nine hours of sleep each night, while people between the ages of 14 and 17 should be getting eight to 10.
People who don’t get more than six hours of sleep on a nightly basis have been found to be clumsier and less focused.
Clete Kushida, director of Stanford University Center for Human Sleep Research, found that people who aren’t getting enough sleep often have trouble focusing, impaired depth perception and slowed reflexes.
Not getting enough sleep on a nightly basis can also lead to other more serious health concerns, including weight gain. When your body doesn’t get enough sleep it starts craving high-calorie foods to make sure that you have the energy you’ll need if you’re going to be awake longer. Another side effect is a lower immune system, leading to difficulty in fighting off illnesses. According to a 2009 study, people who get less than six hours of sleep each night are three times more likely to develop a cold. They also have a harder time recovering from illnesses such as the flu.
Probably the most frightening side-effect of lack of sleep is the increased risk of heart disease and stroke.
According to Atlanta cardiologist David E. Montgomery, people who don’t get enough sleep put more pressure on their heart, which leads to a higher risk of heart-related illness.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in North America, with one in four deaths linked to it. A recent study found that people over the age of 45 who got six hours of sleep or less on a consistent basis doubled their chances of stroke and heart attack, and are more likely to experience heart failure.
So the next time you’re up late and Netflix asks if you’re still watching, hit no and go to sleep.
 


I highly recommend meditation at least twice a day for at least 20 minutes each session. It is hard at first, but after a few months of effort it gets easier.
It does a lot to help get a better night sleep and just helps you have a clearer peaceful mind throughout the day. There are many resources online to help, I recommend focusing on your breath but the Mantra method works for other people, find what works for you. And remember, you can meditate walking to class, riding your bike, just quieting your mind and not thinking all the time about things you do not need to think about.   Think when you need to, live in the moment and quiet your mind whenever you can and you will have a much better sleep and life.

York’s Inclusion Committee and President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri have come under sustained attack by national media in recent weeks, as Jewish organizations allege the committee is “stacked” with anti-Israel faculty.
In an interview with the Canadian Jewish News, or CJN, Shoukri said inclusion is a broad campus issue, and the committee’s membership needs to reflect that breadth.
“To be clear, this committee was not formed as a result of any specific incident, but rather to bring together York scholars to advance our shared goals of strengthening York’s commitment to building an inclusive and diverse campus through collegial dialogue that nurtures the respectful exchanges of ideas, and supports and prepares our graduates for success anywhere,” said Shoukri to CJN.
Not everyone is convinced.
Rena Silver, president of Hasbara at York, says the Inclusion Committee not only consists of a majority of individuals with anti-Israel leanings, but also includes some outright hateful individuals.
“I was privileged to attend a meeting with a couple of administrators for Jewish campus leaders recently where it seemed York’s administration understood that there is no way this committee can be effective at dealing with anti-Semitism on campus,” she adds.
She hopes for a vetting process and the inclusion of campus leaders “who know best that line between legitimate discourse of the state of Israel and anti-Semitism.”
Following his interview, several Jewish groups sent Shoukri an open letter calling for the removal of members “with a record of publicly promoting BDS and other anti-Israel initiatives.”
“We were disappointed to see comments that we felt were condescending to the concerns of our community and dismissive of the concerns of our students,” reads the letter.
The letter acknowledges Shoukri’s “commitment to combat bigotry and enhance inclusion” and claims York administration under Shoukri has failed to address a “growing sense of alienation among Jewish students on campus.”
“We remain alarmed by the seeming disregard of York University’s administration to recognize and confront anti-Semitism on campus,” it states.
The groups were also “astonished to learn that almost half of the members appointed to the inclusion committee either support boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) or have been publicly critical of Israel.”
The letter was signed by B’nai Brith of Canada, The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, Hasbara Fellowships Canada, Hillel Ontario, StandWithUs Canada and UJA Federation of Greater Toronto.
“These organizations may represent their members, but in no way can they claim to represent, or speak for, all Jewish communities,” reads a letter co-signed by Independent Jewish Voices Canada, Toronto and York chapters, International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network – Canada, United Jewish People’s Order Canada and YorkU Jews Against Colonialism.
“The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA)’s statement assumes that ‘anti-Israel activism’ is equivalent to anti-Semitism, which diverts the focus away from criticism of the Israeli government’s record of human rights violations and breaches of international law,” says Samuel B. Halévy, spokesperson for Independent Jewish Voices York.
“Independent Jewish Voices’ presence on campus, which is comprised of Jewish and non-Jewish students working together, is evidence that inclusion is possible outside of political Zionist-led narrative,” he adds.
Groups such as CIJA do not represent the entirety of the Jewish population, as there are other Jewish-led groups, both on- and off-campus, that understand the Israeli government’s motives and  advocate for the human rights of Palestinians and equality of all peoples in the region, says Halévy.
Shoukri said this “discrepancy” of views in the Jewish community is because there are students and faculty at York who support the Palestinian causes and who are critical of policies of the State of Israel.
“Some of this criticism is part of a legitimate political dialogue, while part of it can be seen by some as a cover for anti-Semitic sentiment,” he said.
While York is in a good position to protect and support academic freedom and freedom of expression, and to draw the line when it comes to hate or other forms of discrimination or intimidation, the emotional aspects of an issue may affect some students and can make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe, according to Shoukri.
“[T]he mostly unfair targeting of York by several Jewish organizations and individuals – perhaps in their zeal to combat anti-Semitism, which I can understand – has had a negative effect on some of our young students and has contributed to making them feel worried and victimized,” he added.
Previously, Shoukri said that while acting within the limits of the law, vigorous yet respectful dialogue and exchange of ideas can be deeply enriching to the academic life of an institution.
“I believe it is the responsibility of those with strong views on any debate to act in a way that does not demonize and threaten others or make others feel unsafe,” he said.
Indeed, the balance between freedom of expression and ensuring that all members of a community feel safe in sharing their views without intimidation is a subject worthy of discussion in a collegial environment, according to Shoukri.
“We have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism or other forms of racism, or the advocacy of hate and violence by any group or individual,” he added, “however, it is understandable that there will be individuals who may feel challenged by some ideas.”

2016-06-06,York,Israel,"Featured image courtesy of Mandi Gray. The image shows Gray (far right) standing with other members of the student organization Silence is Violence.
 
The Mandi Gray sexual assault trial resumed May 3, with the accused Mustafa Ururyar appearing on stand. Ururyar confirmed he and Gray were casually dating each other for two weeks.
During cross-examination, more personal details came to light about the nature of Ururyar and Gray’s relationships. It came to light that on the night of the alleged assault, Gray and Ururyar were at a bar with colleagues when Ururyar heard from someone that Gray was planning a threesome with him and a mutual friend, to which he was indifferent, yet expressed his disappointment to Gray when the third person did not join them at his apartment for drinks.
Ururyar maintained that it was consensual sex, as he had received a text from her earlier that evening to “come drink and then we can have hot sex.”
While walking from the bar to his apartment, Gray expressed interest in having sex, to which Ururyar responded saying he was not physically feeling up to it and did not promise her one hundred per cent. He said he would try to perform.
Gray claims Ururyar criticized her at his apartment, calling her “needy” and an “embarrassment.” Ururyar denied this in his testimony, though he did clarify by saying he did not appreciate her behaviour that night.
Ururyar apparently broke up with her while they were having sex as Gray leaned in to kiss him.
The accused reasoned he decided to break up because they were incompatible due to Gray’s behaviour at the bar when she allegedly groped him without his consent, and because he was in an open, long-distance relationship with his girlfriend who was moving to Toronto in April.
“I said we could still be friends but she would often get upset if I mentioned my girlfriend and I intended to continue my relationship with my girlfriend,” says Ururyar.
Upon hearing about the break up, Gray cried and Ururyar claims he consoled her and then they had consensual sex. During intercouse, Ururyar failed to have an erection and suggested that they watch pornography to get in the mood.
“I just put on porn because I needed extra help. It didn’t work so I suggested we just watch a movie or The Daily Show. Mandi got angry with my inability to perform and left abruptly without saying a word.”
Later he received a text from her stating “last night was fucked up.”
“I did not want to assume anything so I simply replied ‘OK’ because I did not want to dominate the conversation.I wanted to provide her space to tell me what was going on. I wanted to give her the space and opportunity to continue what she was thinking,” says Ururyar.
Ururyar’s girlfriend, Alison Moore, says he’s the best boyfriend ever, having met him seven years ago.
Moore said she was shocked when Ururyar informed her that Gray had pressed sexual assault charges against him.
“While we were in different cities, we agreed to see other people, but maintain our relationship,” says Moore.
“We agreed not to talk about our other relationships with each other.”
Closing arguments in the trial are scheduled for May 24.

York’s men’s soccer team will look to defend their title as national champions when the season kicks off at the end of August.
Last year, the Lions’ men’s team won back-to-back titles for the first time in history. The win marked the fourth time the Lions have won the Sam Davidson Memorial Trophy since 2008.
Despite the recent success, the team has been working harder this offseason according to head coach Carmine Isacco. 
“Our approach has been somewhat different. I feel like we’re working harder because we’re going to lose a few key players, and we’re not sure about a couple other ones. So it’s going to be a rebuilding process,” says Isacco.
The Lions will are saying goodbye to midfielder Matt Stinson, goalkeeper Colm Vance, striker Michael Cox and forward Jarek Whiteman. Ben Futorianski is expected to be gone, as is Joey Cicchillo, who injured his ACL during winter training.
Isacco is excited to see who steps up and fills the void. 
“We’ve got some players coming in. It’s going to be up to them how they make an impact. They’re going to be good players, but we keep a big roster, and our players who haven’t stepped up and gotten a lot of time in the past are going to have to step up and give us some more minutes.
“Jonathan Lao has always been a stalwart for us; Matthew Arnone who went from a striker to a center back position and was fantastic for us and should have a big impact. We’ll be looking to Malcolm Loukides for a lot more leadership, as well as a couple red-shirts from last year such as Adam LoFranco to step in and do well.
“We’re hoping Cristian Cavallini, who didn’t play last year because he wanted to focus on school, will come back, because he’s quite a talent and he can score goals. We’re going to look to the guys we have to be more responsible.”
When asked about the chance of a three-peat, Isacco says, “We’re not even concentrating on that. We’re concentrating on what we need to do to get better. We’re just trying to be physically, mentally and of course academically prepared for the season. It’s a new game, it’s a new season and it’s 0-0 across the board.”
The Lions open their regular season in the last week of August, with the official date still to be determined.

Elisa Alloul, third-year psychology and public administration student, has won the Board of Governors, or BoG, election with 800 votes out of a total of 1,947 cast.
Her two-year term as the representative for undergraduate students on York’s top decision making body starts July 1.
The election results were ratified by the Student Senator Caucus, or SSC, on April 1 and Alloul’s appointment as the Student Nominee to the Board of Governors was approved by BoG at its May 3 meeting, according to Sayjon Ariyarathnam the chief returning officer overseeing the election.
The election was seen in some quarters as a turf war between pro- and anti-divestment factions in York student politics.
Alloul says it is inaccurate and unproductive to portray the election as being primarily about the issue of divestment.
“Having interacted with many students during the election, the subject did not come up,” she adds.
“I am someone who is very devoted to a better future for both Israelis and Palestinians,” says Alloul.
“This is why I oppose any political agenda that contributes to the mistrust and conflict between the two sides.”
“I am also a student who believes in academic freedom and fostering mutual respect between diverse communities on campus. I see efforts to boycott and isolate Israelis collectively as destructive and contrary to these values.”
Election results were communicated to BoG through the office of the University Secretary and General Counsel, according to Maureen Armstrong, university secretariat.
Tashwiq Khan came second with 496 votes, Sebastien Lalonde had 286 votes, SAIA-endorsed Haman Mamdouhi managed 193 votes and Mohammed Barry placed last with 172 votes.
Some 55,650 York students were eligible to vote in this election, amounting to a turnout of 3.5 per cent.
The election was marred with irregularities and allegations of bribery, following Maharshi Jani’s withdrawal from the race.
Moreover, a videotape of an alleged bribery incident between candidates was confirmed by Janice Walls of York media.

Art teacher and York alumna Marisa Suriano is a painter who juxtaposes realism with abstraction within her work. She is currently working on a series of paintings where she manipulates acrylic paint to create unique abstract pieces. 
Suriano has been influenced by the cubist art style in the past, and more recently, has been interested in the postmodernist movement. She describes her art style as a mixture of realism and abstraction, through an elevated yet childish process of painting. 
“Anything can be art but not everyone can be an artist,” says Suriano. “Art nurtures the mind and the soul. It allows you to express yourself visually when you cannot verbally. It is an outlet that encourages creative thinking and abstract ideas. Art brings things to life on a daily basis so as an art teacher, it is my mission to instill a love for art in all of my students.” 
Suriano attributes her high school years as a key developing stage for her as an artist. She decided to pursue art and teaching thanks to her high school art teacher, in hopes of inspiring future generations of artists. “As for teaching,” says Suriano, “I knew I loved sharing my artwork and my art knowledge with others so it was just fitting that I become a teacher.”
Even though she enjoys teaching, Suriano holds that she is a painter before a teacher. She plans to continue creating artwork on a weekly basis in order for her to properly teach students. She dreams of opening her own art studio and private art school one day in order to focus solely on developing students’ artistic creations. 
“I want to inspire my students to embrace their many talents and understand how amazing art truly is.”
Suriano’s art has varied over the years, depending on her courses and the themes she was exposed to. Her recent artwork focuses on nature in its simplest forms. She has combined nature with her new art technique, which Suriano claims allows her to “explore art in ways I have never been able to.”

With musical talent flowing through her blood, Natasha Stephens grew up surrounded by 90s R&B and pop music, courtesy of her father who was a DJ. Stephens, a 20-year-old Seneca@York student who grew up in Toronto, is a true musical force to be reckoned with.
“My dad would say it was when I was 2, I sang the entirety of ‘I Can Believe I Can Fly,’ and at that point he knew I was going to be a musician.” 
Stephens is not only a talented vocal artist and DJ, but also a well-rounded musician. She plays a wide array of instruments including the piano, drums, guitar and steel pan, some of which were self-taught. 
For Stephens, music is a release and a way to connect with her listeners, showing them that she understands their struggles, especially concerning heartbreak. 
“Life events and experiences play a major part in my music,” notes Stephens. “I’ve always treated my song-writing as an emotional release – a therapeutic way for me to analyze my own thoughts and also connect to my listeners.” 
Stephens recognizes Brian McKnight and Aaliyah as important influences in her vocal work, and her father for her passion for DJing. “I developed a passion for music from before I could remember,” says Stephens. 
Like every artist, Stephens has gone through her own journey of struggles and feels that finding her sense of self as an artist and remaining true to herself has made her music better than it has ever been. 
“Be true to yourself,” Stephens advises aspiring artists. “There will always be people who want you to sound a certain way or do certain things in the industry, and it is important to take the time to understand yourself. There is always something to learn, even when you feel you are at your best.” 
You can listen to Stephens on Soundcloud at soundcloud.com/classybutdaring and follow her on Facebook at Natasha Stephens. She will be dropping an EP later this summer titled Lust & Indifference.

2016-09-29,York,Israel,"York activists joined UNITE HERE Local 75 union members last week in celebrating “Hotel Workers Rising,” a decade-long campaign centred around securing rights for hospitality workers.
“With Toronto Rising, we are taking the next step. We’re partnering with community groups across the city to stand up for a living wage for all, good jobs in our communities, affordable housing across the GTA, a Toronto that works for young people and equal rights under the law for immigrant- and service-workers,” reads a media advisory released by Marc Hollin, coordinator for UNITE HERE Local 75.
Melissa Sobers, food service campus coordinator for Real Food Real Jobs campaign, states the main goal of the Toronto Rising summit was to be a kick-off event for the 2,000 low-wage food service workers who will potentially be entering into a strike across the city, including at universities like York.
“The strike would be a collective bargaining for living wages and benefits with the goal of ultimately breaking the cycle of precariousness, lack of dignity and stigma that food service jobs hold,” she says.
Sobers recounts the event’s historical origins, saying hotel workers across the city used to make poverty wages similar to what food service workers are paid today, approximately $12 per hour with no benefits.
“Due to their tireless acts of solidarity and demonstrations, hotel workers in downtown Toronto are currently making approximately $20 per hour with decreased workloads and full benefits, thus setting a standard for the vast majority of hotel workers in the city in terms of wages,” says Sobers.
Sobers states that food service workers are now trying to achieve the same standards of employment. Allies like Fight for $15 & Fairness in Canada and the United States, the Changing Workplaces Review in Ontario and the organizing efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement make this goal seem more achievable.
“The event also hosted discussions on how the labour laws in Ontario presently discriminate against contract service workers, such as the York Aramark food service workers, ultimately targeting racialized people since they are over-represented in this line of work,” explains Sobers.
For instance, Filipino workers alone compose 75 per cent of hotel workers in Toronto, according to The Philippine Reporter. 
“We understand that low-wage jobs for Filipino immigrants is a growing issue. We have many skilled and educated Filipinos struggling at the bottom of the job market,” said the Filipino Student Association at York, or FSAY, in a statement to Excalibur.
Many Filipinos get stuck in these positions because they are trapped balancing 40-hour work weeks and raising a family, all while getting used to their new environment, according to FSAY.
Meanwhile, the Ontario Public Interest Research Group at York, or OPIRG, intends to collaborate with other campaigns to address issues of unfair treatment of immigrants in the workforce, minimum wage, exorbitant tuition fees and unaffordable rent.
“OPIRG York attended in order to help connect student issues to the broader movement as well as to provide support to the food service workers at York who are currently fighting for more respect in the workplace and better conditions,” says Imran Kaderdina, admin and information coordinator for OPIRG York.
One of the highlights of the event was the Fairbnb coalition, which aims to hold Airbnb, a popular home-sharing platform, accountable for its short-term rentals.
“Airbnb was discussed in the context of its threat to affordable housing access in the city to people like us, the working poor, students in debt as well as the great living-wage jobs that hotel workers have fought so hard to establish,” says Sobers.
Sobers claims Airbnb is a threat because of its non-taxed, non-regulated nature. UNITE HERE Local 75 expresses similar sentiments: “As Airbnb ‘ghost hotels’ proliferate, workers in regulated hotels will see their hours cut. Our paycheques will shrink as our housing costs go up. While Airbnb alone didn’t cause Toronto’s housing affordability crisis, it certainly isn’t helping.”
Filipino Canadian Youth Alliance at York, Ethiopian and Eritrean Workers Network, Federation of Metro Tenants Association, CUPE 3903, U of T’s student union and members from the Osgoode Hall Law union were some of the community groups in attendance.

If you’re a sports fan, you’ve probably heard of players being sidelined with concussions. Perhaps you’re a fantasy sports enthusiast, and have had to adjust your lineup because one of your starters was knocked out with a concussion. Or maybe you just really like Will Smith and saw the 2015 film.
But what is a concussion?
Concussions, often referred to by athletes as the c-word, are traumatic brain injuries usually caused by hits to the head.
Other injuries are fairly easy to detect—if you break a bone, for example, there is usually a visible indication of the injury, as well as an incredible amount of pain. But concussions are an invisible injury, and are harder to detect.
Fortunately, advancements in technology and increased research have allowed us to learn more about the nature of concussions.
A recent study by Purdue University found that concussions are possibly caused by multiple hits to the head over time, as opposed to the previous notion that they were caused by a single impact. Another common misconception about concussions is that they go away after a certain amount of time, without any lingering side effects. In reality, many people who experience concussions also experience post-concussion syndrome, where symptoms last for more than six weeks.
But what are the symptoms, and how do you know if you have a concussion? According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms include headaches, loss of consciousness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, fatigue and slurred speech.
In severe concussions, a person’s pupils may appear different sizes, with one dilated more than the other.
Some symptoms may take longer to show up, such as memory loss and an inability to concentrate, irritability and personality shifts, sensitivity to light, erratic sleeping patterns and even psychological disorders such as depression, according to Mayo Clinic.
More alarming are the findings by the researchers at York’s Centre for Vision Research, who found that athletes who suffer concussions may also have neurological deficits that are typically not detected in standard clinical assessments.
The study compared the cognitive-motor integration between 51 athletes who had never been diagnosed with a concussion, and 51 athletes who had a history of concussions but were no longer showing symptoms.
The goal of the study was to determine whether athletes with a history of concussions displayed any impairment when asked to “think and move at the same time.” Participants were asked to perform two separate tasks that tested their cognitive-motor integration.
According to the results, athletes who had never suffered a concussion performed the tasks roughly 50 milliseconds faster than athletes who had.
While that doesn’t sound like a large difference, it could be the difference between getting hit or not, according to Professor Lauren E. Sergio.
These tests could also provide a more accurate assessment for determining when a player is safely able to return to the field or rink. If a player returns to their sport too soon after experiencing a concussion and suffers another, known as second impact syndrome, the results could be devastating and even fatal.
Side effects of second impact syndrome include swelling in the brain, possible herniation, loss of consciousness, acute metabolic changes and cerebral blood flow alterations, according to brainandspinalcord.org.
Hopefully as we learn more about the brain and how it functions, we can find ways to ensure player safety and better diagnose concussions—or prevent them from happening at all. 

Let’s face it: staying focused in class is hard—especially in the age of technology, where laptops and cellphones are everywhere you look. Since 2000, when the mobile revolution began, the average attention span dropped from 12 to eight seconds. It is hard to focus when you’re distracted by chatter in the back of the class and a never-ending stream of late students. This difficulty increases with lecture lengths.
Although the average attention span has dropped quite a bit, fourth-year psychology student Shakil Mirza says it heavily depends on the lecture. “I have sat through three-hour psychology lectures once a week, and one-hour biology lectures three times a week. I’ve been alert and more attentive in the latter, because I’d be more interested [and] there is no time to doze off. Even with a middle break in a three-hour lecture, not everyone comes back to class,” says Mirza. One of the perks of hour-long lectures is that there’s no time to stop—so you’d better write notes and stay focused as if your life depended on it.
But what about the dreaded three-hour lectures? How do students possibly stay focused? Are they simply wasting their time? The answer is, surprisingly, that there are some benefits to long lectures. For one, commuting times can be reduced, saving time and money. Rather than travelling to campus several times a week, stacking up longer classes could cut down on days travelling to school, thus saving those pricey tokens. You know that a broke student is willing to do anything to save those valuable dollars.
“All of my courses are three-hour classes, and sometimes they are back-to-back. I actually prefer three-hours lectures over [hour-long] lectures as it cuts down on commute time. But I do often struggle with paying attention. I try to sit close enough to the [professor] that I can engage in discussion, but far enough so that I can slip out easily if I need a break, which is often,” says fourth-year global health policy, management and systems student Anmol Yagnik.
Three-hour lectures allow for more opportunities to spend time with the professor and fellow students to develop a strong connection with them. “I love long lectures as I feel the professors cover more of the material in detail. They are more prone to tell their personal stories regarding the text or theories presented, which I enjoy. It makes it easier to comprehend and more interesting,” says third-year psychology student Waverly Pegelo.
That being said, if you are planning to take or currently taking three-hour-long lectures, try to find a different course offering that can break them down into one-hour lectures. If you cram your schedule with class after class of three-hour lectures, be mindful of the hazards and honest with yourself: are you actually learning and retaining the material, or are you just wasting your time and money? It does depend on preference and on the specific person.
If it is nearly impossible to split your class schedule, here are some tips. Turn off all devices, such as your cellphone and laptop, if possible. This prevents the possibility of opening time-wasting applications. Sitting in the front of the class will keep you focused and be an incentive to not use your devices. Ask yourself if you really need to bring a laptop to take notes. Recent research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton University and the University of California found that writing notes by hand requires a different type of cognitive processing than when typing notes. Since writing by hand is a slower method, it also allows for more time to digest information. Try finding a professor with favourable ratings. One of the more popular sites used for rating professors is ratemyprofessors.com. If a professor is passionate about the subject and teaches the material in a clear and concise way, chances are you will be more attentive in class and learn more about the material. Until then, stay alert!

Tattoos are everywhere. Take a glance around and it will not take you long to locate someone with a tattoo. Maybe your friend tattooed his ex-girlfriend’s name on his arm, or maybe your grandpa has a tattoo hidden away from his rock n’ roll days. Maybe you have a tattoo yourself. If so, you might have found yourself exploring this unique art form in a museum exhibit. 
This year the Royal Ontario Museum, or ROM, hosted an exhibit dedicated to showcasing the diverse body art form of tattooing. Tattoos: Ritual. Identity. Obsession. Art, opened its doors on April 2, 2016 and closed on September 5, 2016. Visitors were invited to an exhibition that not only displayed the uniqueness and variety of tattoos, but also the traditional, historical and cultural context associated with this intrinsic art form.  
The exhibit enabled onlookers to have a multifaceted learning experience. Spanning over the course of 5,000 years, the exhibit provided a history of both ancient and modern tattoos, while also paying tribute and highlighting some of the world’s most famous and talented tattoo artists, such as Sailor Jerry, and their respected pieces. This was done using various visual aids, artifacts, posters and silicone figures that were used to reproduce tattoo pieces. 
Tools that were used to draw tattoos were scattered all over the museum. One of the more complex and inventive tools featured was a handmade tattoo gun crafted by prison inmates. Using the limited supplies available, the prisoners were able to use ball point pens, wire and spool to create electric and manual machines. 
The exhibit also provided a historic and cultural context for tattoos, exploring how tattoos are regarded in America, Asia and Europe. In a historical context, the museum displayed photographs of the chests of Auschwitz prisoners in Nazi camps and the identification tattoos the Nazis’ inked onto the inmates’ skin. Juxtaposed with these pictures were the bodies of the grandchildren of some of these survivors, who tattooed the identification numbers onto their skin as a way to remember and honour their family and family history. 
On a cultural level, the museum explored what tattoos meant to different cultures, such as the Japanese. This was explored through a documentary video that interviewed famous and rewound Japanese tattoo artist Horiyoshi III, who specializes in full body tattoos. Horiyoshi III said that tattoos are important to the Japanese culture he caters to because they view tattoos as a symbolic and personal expression. When a person goes out to the workplace, they are seen as that person; a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher. However, once they are in their naked form, their tattoos became their own personal, symbolic expression of their true inner identity. In a Japanese cultural context, tattoos are essential in cultivating modes of personal identity and expression. 
Every empty space, every wall and every corner of the tattoo exhibit was scattered with unique information on tattoos and the rich history that accompanies it. Whether you have your own obsession with tattoos, want to learn more about this ancient form of body art, or have a burning passion for history, the exhibit satisfied all these interests. What was most amazing about the exhibit was the way it took tattoos and gave them an identity not many would expect. In modern society, tattoos are met with mixed reactions, but a spectator who went to the exhibit would have left with a newly found perspective that hopefully allowed them to see that tattoos are more than just ink on skin; they are a tool for cultures to cultivate identities that penetrate external surfaces. 
As an international student, I come from a country where student activism and politics are banned across university campuses and journalism has become a guise for promoting a corporate agenda.
Coming to York, colloquially referred to as a “social justice university,” I found a sense of freedom in expression and joined many social justice groups on campus in various leadership capacities.
I also ended up becoming the assistant news editor at Excalibur, York’s largest student newspaper. Given my involvement, many have branded me as playing a contradictory role of both an activist and a journalist.
I disagree with this characterization.
The terms “activism” and “media” mean different things to different people. The former could imply anything from justice and equality to radicalism and extremism while the latter could imply anything from truth and accountability to lies and propaganda.
Both terms can have widely contrasting connotations depending on factors involved and context of discussion, yet we can perhaps agree that a combination of the two generally provokes unease and cognitive dissonance among people.
While that may be true, it is just one perspective of looking at things. During my time at Excal, I have personally come to experience the converging influence of the two fields.
Journalists and activists are not enemies nor always at loggerheads with each other. Most of the time, our work is complementary and collaborative, not in the sense that journalists endorse any particular activist agenda, but rather that we consistently keep track of and report on any arising developments within activist groups. In short, we both need each other, regardless of our differences.
The idea of objectivity, in context of journalism, is very misplaced. Journalism, like activism, in many ways is agenda-driven. While we aim to offer unbiased, critical perspectives, one cannot deny that there are always dominant themes and angles, a by-product of stories with cracks left unexplored.
Student activism has the power to expose one to hot-button issues, ranging from anti-tuition fees campaigns, campus racism and sexual violence campaigns to international issues such as the Israel-Palestine controversy and other cases of nationalistic self-determination struggles.
While some may find certain campus politics disagreeable, it undeniably sparks a degree of critical thinking, which in itself is a sign of progress. Yet student politics is not immune to criticism, whether it be allegations of romanticizing and oversimplifying struggles or simply being written off as ineffective.
This is where we student journalists play a key role. Besides putting a spotlight on emerging issues, we indirectly give activist groups a greater impetus to act while maintaining a historic memory of community events through our extensive documentation.
Despite points of criticism, I think it is safe to say that both activism and journalism are inevitable outcomes of challenging the status quo in an unfair world, and they are here to stay. Both are united by common themes of community, shared networks and storytelling.
My point is to move beyond the concept of binary thinking, of pro- this and anti- that, labelling things as right and wrong and pigeonholing ideas into neatly packaged definitions. Instead, we should aspire to create a space where we can have honest and challenging discussions about our current paradigms, where we are constantly redefining our roles and open-heartedly embracing the conflict-ridden process of changing the world.

York is known as a commuter school, and many students are no strangers to the red and white buses that circulate York, which are frequently delayed, overcrowded and overpriced.
Students and faculty are travelling miles upon miles to get to campus, making the daily use of transit a necessity. Despite many students’ growing financial burdens, the TTC continues to increase fares. In 2016, the TTC’s decision to raise fares occurred in the beginning of January. While Metropass prices remained the same, the transit board approved a 25 cent increase to the adult cash fare, a 10 cent increase to the cost of a token, a 50 cent increase to family/day passes and a $1.50 increase to both adult weekly passes and downtown express stickers.
“Like many people, I believe that [the TTC] is very expensive and underdeveloped. Toronto is a big city area-wise, and comparing it to other urban centres such as New York City, London or Istanbul, the subway system needs so much improvement as well as lower fare prices,” says Mert Beloglu, third-year accounting student.
Toronto now has the most expensive monthly pass in Canada, priced at $141.50. The Toronto Star reported that Torontonians will have to ride the TTC more than 50 times per month to make the Metropass worth its price. With the increase in cash fare and the price of tokens, the TTC will still have to address a $30 million deficit through an increase in the subsidy it gets from the city.
While children are allowed to ride for free, there is no discount provided to low-income riders as in many other Canadian cities; Calgary offers a 95 per cent discount to its monthly pass for residents living in extreme poverty. Despite this, the TTC is again considering increasing fares to make up for lost costs, as it claims that it receives the smallest subsidy in North America.
“I am an international student and for me paying about $3.25 for a ride seems stupid. If I have to go to downtown then it makes sense, but sometimes going from one stop to the other [and paying that much] seems outrageous,” says Latika Verma, second-year communications student.
The TTC is beginning to phase out older fare media such as tokens and tickets and move forward with the PRESTO fare card system. Many TTC buses are now accepting PRESTO as a form of payment, however it is still encouraged to bring cash in case of a glitch. The old fare media will be accepted until mid-2017.
TTC users are not happy when it comes to the lack of reliably and inconsistency in their transit conditions. With the winter months approaching, commuters are dreading the delays and tentative bus schedules. Enduring the elements of a Canadian winter only makes matters worse. Waiting for a bus can change from a 10 minute expenditure to 25 minutes; busses seemingly go in and out of service with no warning, and the winding lines in the York Commons are surely a foreshadow of your inevitable sardine-like packing into a bus.
Commuters are left in the dust, wondering if the transit system serves them or the owners.
In 2015, the TTC broke its record of highest all-time total number of riders with 538 million. Kadeem Griffiths, TTC communications advisor, says that they are taking action to increase capacity, such as the automatic train control system coming in 2019.
“The [Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension Project], which is scheduled to open in late 2017, will have a subway station on the York University Campus and will help with any increased demand for transit for students traveling to and from the campus,” he adds.
With six fare hikes in six years, the unpredictability and unreliability in TTC prices and times are leaving many people looking for alternative methods of transportation. TTCriders, a grassroots transit advocacy organization, is encouraging Toronto residents to stand up against the prices and conditions of the TTC. On October 26, they are hosting an event at City Hall to protest the cost of fares for individuals in need of social assistance, including low-income families, seniors and students.

The men’s and women’s hockey teams were in action this week, as the men played on Thursday and Saturday, while the women played on Saturday and Sunday.
In Thursday’s game, the men were facing off against the Guelph Gryphons in Guelph. With just under six minutes to play in the first period, the Lions drew first blood with Derek Sheppard’s third goal of the season, assisted by Greg Milner and Trevor Petersen.
Less than three minutes later, York added a goal courtesy of Petersen and assisted by Daniel Nikandrov and Nick Zottl.
Guelph opened the scoring six minutes into the second period to cut the Lions’ lead to one, but York added an empty net goal with under a minute to play, putting the game out of Guelph’s reach.
York goalie Mack Shields was sensational, saving 33 of the 34 shots he faced in the win.
On Saturday, Ryerson opened the scoring with just 10 seconds left in the first period, giving them a one-goal lead they would take into the break.
However, York didn’t have to wait long to respond, as Petersen scored his fourth goal of the season two minutes into the second to tie things up at one.
At the end of regulation, the score was still tied, which meant overtime was needed. However, neither team was able to break the stalemate in the first overtime, meaning we were heading to double overtime.
Just four minutes into the extra extra frame, Sheppard was able to sneak a shot past the Rams goalie to give the Lions the 2-1 win.
Shields was spectacular once again, saving 26 of 27 shots, including five saves in overtime.
With the win, the Lions are now 4-2 on the season and have won their last four games.
Earlier on Saturday, the women played the Brock Badgers at home, but neither team was able to find the back of the net in the first period.
The Badgers opened the scoring in the second period with a flurry of three unanswered goals coming nine, 12 and 18 minutes into the frame, respectively.
With seven minutes left in the game, the Lionesses finally answered Brock’s three goals with one courtesy of Erin Locke, who found the back of the net for the second time this season to end the Badger’s shutout. Unfortunately, that was York’s only goal of the game, and Brock went on to win by a final score of 3-1.
The women played again on Sunday, looking to even out their record against Ryerson.
The Rams’ Ailish Forfar opened the scoring with just over five minutes left in the first period, but less than two minutes later, the Lionesses evened the score with a goal from Leah Hibbert, assisted by Kelsey McHolm and Avery Reeves.
Both men’s and women’s teams won nail-biting games against Gryphons and Rams.
York opened the scoring midway through the second courtesy of Dana Somerville, assisted by McHolm and Taylor Davison.
Despite being outshot by York in the third, it was Ryerson who found the back of the net just after the midway point, evening the score and forcing overtime.
Neither team was able to break the tie, sending the game to double overtime. York was outshot 3-0 in the second overtime, but managed to preserve the tie and force a shootout.
York’s first shooter was Rianna Langford, who beat the goalie and gave York a 1-0 lead. Ryerson’s first shooter missed, but York’s second shooter, Tegan Duncan, also missed.
Ryerson’s second shooter missed again, but a goal from Somerville beat the Rams goalie and gave the Lionesses a 3-2 win.
The men’s next game is Friday at home against Brock starting at 7 p.m., while the women play again Saturday at home against Laurentian at 2 p.m.
 


Cheers pal. I do aprcpeiate the writing. 
Casually arranged seats, a lit stage and glittery garments magically transformed Buddies in Bad Times Theatre’s cabaret space for Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again. The musical comedy, written by, directed by and starring Rachelle Elie, with musical accompaniment by Luke Jackson, teased and thrilled audiences from October 18 to 23.
The show started with Elie in a vibrant dress, descending a staircase as she took centre stage. Her gleeful and welcoming demeanor as she made her way through showgoers set the tone for the whole night. Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again was going to be fun, upbeat and relaxed.
No stranger to comedy, Elie filled the room with her sexual jigs and honest storytelling. As Elie glided across the stage and changed her costumes, she shared her love woes and awkward sexual encounters. Her stories of falling in love with a poet and then with her husband, aka “the voice,” resonated with the audience.
The lighting added an important formal element to the performance, following Elie’s every move, adding drama to her stories and illuminating key parts in the show. Even if Elie’s sharp humour and jokes did not connect with all present, the theatrics of the setup—costume, lighting, sound and staging—were aesthetically pleasing.
Elie shares everything in Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again, from her parents falling in and out of love, discovering her own sexuality in adolescence, to getting married, having kids and traveling. This vulnerability, along with guest interactions throughout the show, stressed the importance of love being rooted in communication. The casual and intimate setup could have backfired if audience members didn’t connect with the production, but Elie overcame this with her performance. She maintained eye contact with the audience throughout the night, creating a welcoming environment where people could feel comfortable to laugh, sing along or disagree.
Sh!t I’m in Love with You Again centers around Elie’s energetic performance, but what makes the show special is its message. The comedy show doesn’t shy from diverging from the fairytale story about a man and woman meeting and falling in love. Elie’s one-woman performance shows that, more than anything, love is not about getting your happily ever after.
Elie’s storytelling lets us know that it’s okay to hate your partner at times or to change your mind. It’s okay to leave a relationship that you’re not happy in, as is the case with her mother and father, or try to make things work with your partner as Elie does with her husband. Both are equally acceptable responses to falling out of love.
It’s easy to fall prey to notions of what a relationship, love or partner should look like. Remember that there is no ideal relationship to hold yours up to.
The only measure of your happiness or love is yourself.
When your resolve weakens in February, Elie and Jackson will be putting on a Valentine’s Day Rag Bag Cabaret on February 14. The night promises to dish out music, burlesque, clowns and magic. 
 
Cramped office spaces in the Student Centre and apparent lack of communication see clubs demanding greater transparency in the way space is allocated each year. Over 50 student clubs are housed in the Student Centre, or YUSC, but their office spaces are renewed annually on an application basis.
“Office allocations are determined by an allocation committee comprised of the YUSC Chairperson, YUSC Executive Director, YUSC Executive Officer, YUSC Clubs and Services Representative and YFS President or YFS VP Equity and Services,” reads YUSC’s online statement on club office spaces.
“There are more student clubs and organizations than available office spaces. Since office space is in high demand, it is allocated annually,” the website continues.
Nikessa Joseph, promotions representative for the Caribbean Student Association, or CSA, says her club deserves more space because it has a large and active membership.
“As far as I know, space allocation is based off of membership, events [and] presence on campus. And I feel like not only CSA, but all cultural clubs are somewhat brushed under the rug when it comes to assessing each club for space allocation and renewal,” alleges Joseph.
“I think the process needs to be better outlined and defined. The persons who are in charge of making these decisions [should] follow through with all steps of the process and properly assess each and every club and association, both cultural and non-cultural,” she asserts.
Nirinina Ngartola, vice president of the African Student Association, says the allocation committee should be more flexible with their deadlines and accommodation of new clubs who may not be fully aware of the process. “It’s just really sad when we see a club not having an office space for a whole year just because they missed the deadline the year before,” she says.
“The process definitely needs to be more transparent and less bureaucratic, because we are all students and we are trying our best to keep our club active for our members and us,” she adds.
While clubs with offices press for more clarity and accountability in the space delegation process, other clubs, including Hasbara at York, a pro-Israel advocacy group, have no space at all.
Hasbara president Rena Silver says it has been a difficult process to be granted office space, remarking that club members could really utilize the space if they had it.
“If there were a reason provided or additional steps for next time listed with the rejection, that would likely make it easier for us to understand why we were denied space and how we could attain it for the upcoming year,” she says.
Despite being handed the short end of the stick, clubs continue their efforts to remain active on campus.
“We work as a board in temporary spaces, room bookings, and Internet forums. We use our executives homes to store things we can’t keep at school,” adds Silver.
“We have no choice but to manage.”
The YFS and YUSC did not respond to repeated requests for comments.

2017-02-10,York,Israel,"With “Drop Fees Not Bombs” posters on nearly every wall and a gathering planned for February 9, the topic of divestment from weapons manufacturers is looming large once again on York’s campus.
YU Divest is continuing to lobby York’s Board of Governors against any future investment in companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Textron and Amphenol.
Weapons manufacturers are perceived as being complicit in major harm and destruction brought upon communities around the world, with the claim that because they rely on and directly benefit from conflict, they have an inherent interest in their continuation.
With growing refugee crises in parts of the Middle East and Africa, there has been a growing pressure on institutions around the world to consider ethical investment practices.
In a statement on YU Divest’s website, it is emphasized that any investment in weapons manufacturers has a lasting impact on both war-torn areas and York’s community.
“Many York community members have family members who are directly impacted by these weapons. A university that values the safety of its community should not be investing in companies that put the safety of its community members at risk, along with many other innocent people,” it reads.
York makes investments through its endowment fund, a pool of money utilized to generate profits that finance scholarships, bursaries and university projects.
Every financial quarter, a detailed investment holdings report is produced, along with a statement of investment policies and procedures.
As of December 2016, York held no investments in the aforementioned companies and continues to consider the integration of environmental, social and governance risk factors in its investment selection process.
Nonetheless, many do feel that there is nothing concrete stopping the university from reinvesting in them in the next financial quarter.
“[York’s actions] prove that it is possible to ethically manage a successful endowment fund,” said YU Divest.
“Divestment does not only require the university to pull their existing investments from these companies but also to make a binding commitment not to reinvest.”
Studies of divestment campaigns have shown that they in fact do little to directly impact the share prices of the companies involved.
It is believed, however, that divestment campaigns create an impact through the generation of stigma surrounding certain industries, leading to fewer people wanting to work there or to greater popular support for policy at a university or government level.
More than 80 campus organizations endorse the YU Divest campaign, but it has faced criticism from numerous groups citing it as a means of promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions policy against Israel.
Steph Baker, political liaison for Hasbara, says that they do not agree with the campaign due to the negative connotation surrounding it that makes peaceful dialogue around the topic difficult.
“While YU Divest does not focus only on Israel, a large amount of energy is focused on promoting divestment from it,” says Baker.
“It makes it very difficult to create a peaceful dialogue about the country when such actions are fighting against it,” she adds.
“While some people may think that it is impossible to help Palestine while supporting Israel, it is untrue.”
Rawan Habib, vice-president campaigns and advocacy for YFS, states that the divestment campaign focuses solely on ensuring that university funds be channelled into education and the lowering of tuition fees.
“Divestment from weapons manufacturing by [the university] and the redirection of those funds into post-secondary education is directly linked to the reduction of tuition fees and improvement in the quality of education,” she says.
Trudy Pound-Curtis, assistant vice-president finance and CFO at York, notes that the Advisory Committee on Responsible Investing includes staff, faculty and students.
“The committee has held […] panel discussions over the past two years to enable the community to hear diverse viewpoints on responsible investing,” says Pound-Curtis.
Divestment remains a highly contentious topic that has created many heated exchanges, so Excalibur sought to establish what York students really think.
As far as I am concerned, [this] investment isn’t ethical. This is an institution that spreads inclusivity and acceptance, but at the same time makes money from wars around the world. It doesn’t seem right. For myself, divestment would make me feel better about the institution I attend. Reinvestment into more sound ethical industries feels a lot better. This campaign is the definition of a student movement. We cannot allow our beloved institution to make money off weapons manufacturing.
I’m personally against York investing in weapons manufacturers. Universities should focus all their resources on education, especially at a diverse university like York where weapons investment is an issue that hits close to home for many. Weapons investment causes a distraction, and some students may feel they are directly contributing to conflict.
I only discovered that York was behind this quite recently. I can see why York’s involvement with this investment would be kept on the down-low. If you look at power, it is often sustained and cultivated by ignorance. They should look at the needs of students and lower fees, for the greater good and for people wanting an education who are unable to afford it. I can, however, appreciate if the investment was done with the good intention of establishing scholarships and bursaries; I don’t see much wrong with that.
York is an enormous institution that can invest in other companies that are economically large enough to fund our scholarships. By investing money in companies that create such deadly weapons that lead to destruction, death and horror for the entire world to fear, York is being included in this problem. Instead of using money to help these companies grow, York should really think about lowering our fees so that scholarships wouldn’t need to be funded by these companies.

2017-03-31,York,Israel,"York’s Advisory Committee on Responsible Investment has voted to recommend divestment from fossil fuels and arms manufacturers.
The decision comes after the committee, or YUACRI, examined two major proposals submitted by YU Divest and Fossil Free York.
YU Divest, a coalition of York students and alumni, has called for York to make a lasting commitment to divesting from five large arms manufacturers for their alleged complicity in human rights abuses due to war.
Fossil Free York called for York to divest from companies whose involvement in the extraction, processing and transport of fossil fuels means that they directly contribute to climate change.
They also state that investment in fossil fuels risks becoming “stranded” as the market for them becomes less viable.
Chenthoori Malankov, president of York Federation of Students, stated that the York community understands the link between human rights and climate justice.
“We are excited about the possibility that York could be a global leader in promoting these values and in helping build sustainable, ethical economies of the future,” she said.
Richard Wellen, president of York University Faculty Association, has hailed YUACRI’s decision as a historic moment for York.
“The university is now poised to align its investment practices with its institutional values of sustainability, social justice, equity and good governance,” he said.
“The Board of Governors should implement these recommendations as soon as possible.”
Previously, YU Divest was lobbying the Board of Governors against any future investment in companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Textron and Amphenol. As of December 2016, York did not hold any investments in those companies.
Zena Gopal, vice-president campaigns of the York University Graduate Students’ Association, added that it commends YUACRI for its commitment to participatory and democratic policymaking.
“We look forward to its continuing efforts to develop policy that represents and enacts values of the York community in the coming years,” she added.
The decision has faced some criticism from the York community, as many feel it acts as a means of promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions policy against Israel.
Steph Baker, political liaison for Hasbara at York, says that Hasbara does not approve of YUACRI’s recommendation for this reason.
“It does not accomplish the key objectives of responsible investment,” says Baker.
Baker feels that it gives the impression that Israel is a more dangerous country than it is, and that the topic is best addressed through dialogue.
“It causes students to take these ideas as a given, instead of it being open to discussion,” says Baker.
YUACRI seeks to integrate environmental, social and corporate governance considerations in the investment management process and ownership practices of York’s $413 million endowment fund.
They will now prepare their recommendations for the York administration to consider. 
 
A poster caused quite the commotion when it made its way onto social media.
The event being promoted, a CPR and Emergency First Aid Training course, was offered by the York United Black Students’ Alliance, or YUBSA, for a $30 registration fee. The poster included the customary details, followed by a statement that the event is “catering to black students only.” According to YUBSA, the event went well and participants were happy to have received the training.
The poster garnered a strong reaction on social media, with many pointing out the wording, which they claim is discriminatory towards other racial groups that may have wanted to participate.
According to YUBSA, they have received several messages on social media as a response to the event poster, acts which the YFS have condemned as cyberbullying. The attacks allegedly included YouTube and Facebook comments, as well as direct messages to their Twitter page.
Many of the messages were racist and explicit in nature.
YUBSA released a statement in response to the comments, saying that their efforts to offer reduced-cost training were met with resistance and anti-black racism.
“Do not confuse our duty to give back to our community with the notion that we are imposing limitations or restrictions to others,” reads the statement.
Some were quick to point out that other groups on campus, including York First Aid, provide similar medical training courses.
According to YUBSA, the poster’s wording was generalized to include all black students, even those who are not officially YUBSA members.
One post on the York University Class of 2019 Facebook page has garnered more than 100 comments, with students discussing the validity of having a “black students only” event.
The controversy even escalated to some students being publicly attacked as white supremacists, but many posts were later taken down.
In a public statement, YUBSA proclaimed that as black students, they were faced with resistance for wanting to provide support for black community members, when allegedly other service groups and cultural organizations do this as well.
YUBSA was not concerned with responding to the social media uproar.
“Our concern was our intent,” says YUBSA.
“The university must make a genuine commitment to challenge racial injustice and social inequalities on this campus,” they add.
Founded in 1996, YUBSA was the fusion of African Student’s Association, the Caribbean Student’s Association and the Black Caucus Association.
“As a Pan-African organization, YUBSA’s mission is to provide services that will foster the self-empowerment of students of African descent academically, financially and socially on the York University Campus; as a politically motivated association, YUBSA embodies a mandate to fight racial discrimination and systemic racism on the York campus as well as the wider York community,” reads the YUBSA description on the YFS website.
 


I really wish there were more arlcetis like this on the web.
Maybe there is a reason why these people impose this kind of announcement, other groups are doing this to them as well. formal first-aid training are imposed in order for a person to be considered “suitable” to carry out that role. 
 
What a year.
Correction: what a shitty year.
2016-2017 at York saw continuing declining enrollment with tuition still rising by up to 3 per cent; the food sucked so much that we topped the list of worst Ontario post-secondary institutes for food safety; a petition was created for a disappointing sandwich; food service workers went on strike and a new incoming president received letters of no-support even before she was announced to take over the position.
But I guess the year didn’t suck that much. The food services workers that went on strike settled with Aramark, including an agreement that within a year, no worker will be making less than $15 an hour; the Bachelor of Administrative
Studies program has been officially renamed as the Bachelor of Commerce thanks to a student petition; Bethune is introducing a course to help equip student leaders to address sexual violence and the men’s Lions hockey team won their first Queen’s Cup in 13 years.
And that’s just what Excalibur reported on.
There are countless issues, concerns and voices that we didn’t cover—and it’s a damn shame.
York is a widely diverse and immensely passionate community and I recognize the opportunity— and responsibility—that is bestowed upon student journalists. We strive for the truth while jumping over hurdles, avoiding lawsuits and finishing our assignments for class.
Excalibur has been nothing short of a ride with many wonderful and terrifying stops along the way. I have learned more about myself and grew as a person and a journalist in more ways that I could have anticipated from a measly student club. I have also seen the true passion within activists, the hurt souls of marginalized groups and even the ugly sides of people’s characters.
But most of all, I have learned that you can’t please them all. The truth, this imaginary ideal that journalists strive for, is not always pleasant. As a journalist, if you are pleasing everyone, then you are probably not doing your job right.
However, if you’re ignoring certain voices, or simply not including them in your paper, then you are also failing at your job.
Journalism is hard, particularly at a school that does not have a dedicated journalism school to teach us these valuable skills of interviewing, transcribing, oxford commas and managing hateful emails.
All I can wish for is that in spite of all of this, there are some of you who read Excalibur, appreciate the efforts of the editorial team and maybe become inspired to contribute.
It is immensely difficult to reflect the student body without the student voice. So please, don’t shy away from the challenge that may be Excalibur; speak up, and let your voices be heard.
Excalibur is always willing to listen.
 


In the coaitpcmled world we live in, it’s good to find simple solutions. 
 
Whether it be about the complications that arise from mental illnesses or the lack of treatment offered on university campuses, we need to talk about mental health.
You can usually see the implications of a physical ailment, however when it’s our mental health that is suffering, it’s harder to see and much more difficult to explain.
In September, 66.8 per cent of York students reported to have felt overwhelming anxiety within the previous 12 months. Nearly 49 per cent of students had felt depressed to the point that it was difficult to function regularly and nearly 12 per cent seriously considered suicide.
Earlier this month, Jack.org held their annual summit in Toronto, which saw 200 post-secondary students attend and discuss what mental health means on their campuses. The organization developed in 2010 as a movement when Jack
Windeler, a first-year student at Queen’s University, committed suicide due to mental illness. Their vision is “No More Silence” about mental health.
The summit discussed the importance of access to mental health services on campuses and how there is often a lack of communication, resources and programs available for individuals in need. Many campus services are overwhelmed with students and are not properly equipped to deal with a large capacity or long-term treatment options.
“It’s evident that universities are overwhelmed. There’s a huge increase in students wanting and needing to access mental health services,” said Fred Wagner of the Canadian Mental Health Association.
Jack.org is about creating dialogue and networking; by ensuring that young people are better able to care for themselves, they are further encouraged to support their peers.
“When it comes to the more serious, long-term mental health conditions, the community and the university really have to come together to support that student,” said Wagner.
The aim is to empower students to get involved with their campus resources health advisory committees to ensure that help is available to all students who need it and that students know how to access these resources, as well as establishing dialogue around universities’ academic policies and how they affect mental health.
Students can play a significant role in how universities approach and handle mental health. Mental health problems exist beyond Bell Let’s Talk Day, and these illnesses aren’t present exclusively during exam periods.
Maintaining one’s mental health is a continuous process, which is why Jack.org has created contact-based education and peer-to-peer outreach programs that are designed to teach students that we all have mental health, we all need to care for it and, most importantly, we need to talk about it.

Re: Professor Suzanne MacDonald featured in CBC wildlife docuseries
News» Jan 22, 2020 
I found the article on York psychology and biology Professor Suzanne MacDonald’s research on urban wildlife extremely interesting and, on a personal note, relevant to material I cover in my psychology classes on animal behaviour (e.g.,  psychology of motivation). Prof. MacDonald’s research on the environmental value provided by various animal species living in our midst is informative and impressive, and is in keeping with the legacy of the naturalist Charles Darwin that there is merit in the comparative study of other species. 
The article makes it clear that the animals she has studied (e.g., raccoons, opossums) actually benefit us;  “recycling mountains of consumer-generated waste in cities around the world.” As your article points out, Prof. MacDonald also confronts various myths about urban wildlife, as these animals are generally viewed as dangerous and dirty, responsible for disease.  By “eliminating enormous amounts of consumer waste,” she says, these animals actually make our cities healthier.  
For those of us who live in an urban environment, our contact with urban wildlife may be coloured by misinformation that generates negative views (e.g., see the late Rob Ford’s views on the opossum).  Growing up in a city with its shopping plazas and malls may not give much of an opportunity to take note of the natural world and the creatures with whom we co-exist, except as seeing them as intruders and pests.  
Through her work on animal behaviour, Prof. MacDonald not only provides insight into the habits of urban animals, which is in itself interesting,  her research, by reaching a wider audience through a docuseries such as CBC’s, The Nature of Things,  also contributes to fostering more tolerant and benign attitudes towards these creatures and remind us that we, too, are biological animals sharing our ecological niches with other species.  Let’s not forget, we are the waste makers and these animals, by being the ‘clean-up crew’, are doing their best to adapt to the environments that we continually destroy and create. Their creative ability to adapt to the challenges they confront in our urban spaces is even more remarkable for in the process of making our living spaces healthier,  these animals do not contribute to further environmental contamination or deterioration. 
In a consumer-driven culture such as ours, with our bloated overblown sense of narcissistic omnipotence, these animals can teach us a lesson in humility, a lesson in eco-consciousness, by reminding us that we are custodians, and not rulers, of an ecosystem we all share and should protect.

It was a near-annual pilgrimage back to her native homeland of Sylhet, Bangladesh. Nanjeeba Chowdhury-Mohammad had been waiting to meet with family and partake in cultural ceremonies and gatherings. Although Sylhet’s economy has been thriving in recent years due to its production of gas and tea for all of Bangladesh, its residents continued to persevere through difficult living conditions. Many of the people living in Sylhet are elderly and are stricken with illnesses that make life debilitating. 
Nanjeeba says everything feels different than what it is in Canada — a lot more “hustle and rush.” 
Grime and dirt-stained cars and lorries dangerously weaved through traffic. Run-down buildings and services in the village is a byproduct of the crippling economy. Merchants and business owners nearby try to keep their head above water to sustain their family. The demise of a notorious, poverty-stricken community being illuminated by the cultural preservation that still exists.
Nanjeeba’s experience, for the most part, is consistent with mine when I had travelled to Harar, Ethiopia in 2007. The city of Harar is walled with notable features of the region being its homes that are built from stone and wildlife (specifically hyenas). During my first visit, I recall seeing merchants scattering the streets on the hard rock surface selling their fresh produce and clothing in desperation to survive. 
Though I have only travelled back home once, I remember trying to immerse myself with how life was lived there. Doing so forces you to wonder about all of the first-world luxuries you take for granted: a nice bed to sleep on, a lack of nuisance-causing mosquitoes, a free healthcare system, a transit system that gets you places without compromising your safety, and a lack of air raid sirens. When we go back to our homeland, we say our hellos, stay a while for leisure, and just leave without so much as lending a helping hand once we leave.  
Humanitarian agencies identify many nations, like both Ethiopia and Bangladesh, as underdeveloped or developing. Most of all, these countries are in need of relief from famine, war, water contamination, disease, and deplorable living conditions.
You have seen the campaigning and programming time and time again: starved and traumatized children shedding tears in front of a camera. So although we as immigrants have the privilege of living in Canada now, we cannot forget our roots. 
Be it donating to non-profit organizations, volunteering with programs or volunteering abroad, donating clothes back home during leisure visits, donating insecticide-treated bed nets, sponsoring a child, or directly contributing to education reform, the smallest of sacrifices will make all the difference.
In hopes of reshaping and restructuring people’s lives in these nations, merely a small amount of time out of our days is required. After all, it is a delegation and duty that we do our part in contributing to our motherlands, as to show we are not abandoning them.
 


I like this piece. Maybe say that World Vision is an agency – orient people with it?

I hear a lot of apologizing today. A lot of people are made to feel ashamed of themselves and their identities. A lot of people who are being silenced based not on what they say, but who they are. I’ve seen people who accept the role assigned to them as some sort of enemy based on what they look like or what they believe in. People who apologize for their own existence. I’m not one of those people. I do not apologize for being white. I do not apologize for having red hair, either. And I surely won’t apologize for being Jewish. I’d like to emphasize that last point. I will neither apologize for being Jewish, nor will I remain silent while the cloud of anti-Semitism looms darker by the day.
Instead of listing off the daily news events in the Jewish world, from the ongoing anti-Semitic attacks that have gone rampant in France, England, and throughout North America, I will single out two Canadian events. They speak to a larger issue that is at hand. These are not isolated incidents. They are indicative of the current political climate in Canada, and surely in other parts of the world as well. These are not the exception, but rather, the new normal.
Instead of generating intellectual discourse, university campuses have become a breeding ground for hatred and thought control. At McGill University, it has been outlawed by the school newspaper to publish any pro-Zionist content whatsoever. This has been passed and enforced under the guise that any pro-Zionist speech is “hate speech.”
Forget the fact that I’m writing this as a Jew. This is a university we’re talking about here. A university that has effectively silenced an entire group of people. I don’t care who you are or what you stand for, that is anti-democratic. How that could ever pass is beyond my imagination, but I will venture to explain it this way: hating Israel (and Jews by default) is not just trendy, it is now politically correct.
If you are confused as to why Jews were included in that equation, you shouldn’t be. It’s simple math, really. If people hate Israel, believing it to be an evil, apartheid state, without the right to exist, and Israel is the homeland for Jewish people, is it a big intellectual leap to say those same people who hate Israel probably hate the Jews? That, coupled with the statistically most violent last couple of years in the history North American Jewry and the rise of anti-Zionist activist groups may help to elucidate the point a little clearer. If Israel is the enemy, then so are the Jews.
Let’s be clear: the point isn’t to say anyone can’t disagree with Israel (or Judaism for that matter). Go right ahead and disagree. But, don’t forcefully break up a lecture being given by a veteran of the Israeli army while hurling anti-Semitic slogans and death threats under the guise of “social justice.” Here, I am referring to the incident on York’s campus where a pro-Israel group had their event shut down by a protest from Students Against Israeli Apartheid which quickly resulted in violence, anti-Semitic slogans, and death threats.
If this is what’s going on in our universities today, and if students are being bullied, belittled and denied their own voice, then the future is looking pretty bleak. Censorship and physical violence have no place in any democratic institution.
This has nothing to do with me being Jewish. This has nothing to do with me being pro-Israel. This is about hatred. No group deserves to be bullied into silence. No group deserves violence against them.
I don’t care what group you belong to or what you think you stand for. I stand for what’s right. I stand for the truth. If that makes me the enemy, then so be it. I will not apologize for that.
 


This is such a bad take, are you forgetting that it’s a settler colonial state and people have literally been displaced and had their homes destroyed and bulldozed in droves? I’m not sure what anti semitic slogans were actually said when the only alleged one was debunked and heard by no one there, but to answer your point the PREMIER of ontario and PRIME MINISTER of canada publically shamed the grassroots student protest because of one alleged comment that wasn’t actually said. So you have to ask yourself at some point, who has the real institutionalized power here, and who is actually being shamed for their opinions when any human rights activist in this country is smeared as being anti-semitic (google Canary Mission if you don’t believe me) and deplatformed/fired. What did actually happen was an FBI-recognized terrorist group, the JDL full of grown men, came and urinated on a Palestinian flag (Captured on video, see the yfs link) and assaulted student protestors. And sorry, yes it is strange to have members of a foreign military on our campus speaking because they are being paid heavily to do so by herut, a right wing, fascist political party. There is nothing wrong with criticizing israel’s policies when they have blatantly committed many human rights violations and many students have personal histories of their families being affected by these facts.
i agree with bh. this is a very strange take on the situation. i absolutely understand the hurt & hatred one must feel when they’re standing up for something that others don’t believe in, but you have to recognize that this was not an antisemitic event. the rally was against having former soldiers who have killed innocent families in our place of education. as a palestinian supporter, i had a grown woman flip me off from behind a police officer & gesture as though she was spitting at me. all i had done was make eye contact w her. the “antisemitic chants” were debunked as a rumour a JDL member had started. as a rally attendee, i promise you there were no antisemitic chants. find me a video where that was chanted & i’ll side w you in a heartbeat.

Currently, the minimum wage in Ontario is $14 an hour, which falls short of ensuring full-time work pays enough to make a living. It was scheduled to rise to $15 an hour this year, but the current provincial government has decided, instead, to freeze the minimum wage at $14.  
  I believe that $14 an hour is too low as compared to the current living wage, but $15 would have been a large increase and a good start to catch up with inflation,” says Sheila Block of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives “$14 is still good progress, but since it was rolled back it affected minimum wage workers negatively.”
The minimum wage is regarded as the legislative floor for hourly wages, and it should cover everyday costs for all workers. However, there are a number of exclusions not taken into consideration.
Since the minimum wage is so low in Ontario, young adults struggle to pay for their daily expenses including schooling, transportation, housing and groceries. Regardless of where they are in their life, a minimum wage job does not cover the living expenses of Ontario.
According to Statistics Canada, 52 per cent of Canada’s working population aged 15-24 earn the mandated minimum wage — 77.8 per cent of those minimum wage workers live in Ontario. 
Many students can relate to the struggles of having to keep up with living expenses. 
University of Guelph-Humber student Lucas Neto, 21, says he worked a minimum wage job from age 16 to 18. 
“For me, at this age, I had a lot saved up and purchased my first car and paid off my first year of university. Of course, I had help from scholarships and my parents paying my car insurance. Without this financial assistance my perspective would be completely different,” says Neto.
Now, Neto earns $20.81 an hour and was able to work full-time over the last few summers, which helped pay for his university tuition. Still, he struggles to stay on top of other expenses.
“Although I have been fortunate to work at a higher wage job, this doesn’t leave me with too much room to spend more money,” Neto explains. “I can only imagine how difficult it is to work the minimum wage while having to pay for tuition, books, food, residence, a car, insurance, etc.”
University of Guelph-Humber student Brooklynn Lake, 21, has been working a minimum wage job for over six years. Lake explains: “Although my job has provided me with some funds for schooling, I still have to make sure that I have done the extra work to receive scholarships to cover my school payments. As well, it has made it difficult for me to ensure that I have enough funds for transportation as well, with bus fares increasing and not being able to afford a car for school and work”.
Lake believes that the minimum wage is not comparable to a living wage. “It has been difficult to live off of the wage I have been receiving for these six years”.
Young adults feel pressured to further their education in hopes of getting a well-paid job, but this also comes with the uncertainty of getting the occupation for which they studied so hard. Many are stuck working minimum wage jobs while paying off their student loans.
York alumnus Alex Few, 23, says that student debt can often weigh heavy on young adults’ shoulders. “Most of us have the hope that post-secondary will bring a well-paying job, but in reality, that’s not always the case,” says Few. 
“I have friends who work in retail and other underpaid positions to help pay for school or other necessities, and I have first-hand seen the stress that results from large expenses and low salaries”
Few believes that the minimum wage needs to reflect growing expenses so that the wellbeing of people her age don’t have to be at stake.
According to a 2013 report by Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a large majority of millennials who work in minimum wage jobs are characterized by four main things: low pay, few or no benefits, part-time or casual work, and greater risk of injury. Many minimum wage workers also have no choice but to rely on low-income jobs to support themselves.
Some people worry that raising the minimum wage to a more adequate living wage could lead to job losses and would affect employees positively or negatively. However, this is not the case, according to Block.
  Extensive academic research has been progressive on this issue and claims that the minimum wage increase does not increase unemployment but, instead, it increases wages for families as well as increases the pay rates of workers earning slightly over the minimum wage,” Block says. 
“So, overall, it is a positive impact.”
The bar is set too low in Ontario and it is time for the Ontario government to increase the minimum wage to benefit all low-income workers.

As midterms approach, tensions and emotions run high. Families are pressing their children to reach their maximum potential to secure their dream job that “pays well,” build a name for themselves, and uphold family dignity. For hours on end, students will immerse themselves in textbooks and hurriedly submit documents online.  
In many families, though, speaking about mental health is practically non-existent and having a mental illness is shameful in some cultures. January is half-way point of the school year, and students just hope to be able to plow through the remainder of the year with decent grades. Being caught up with studies and sometimes a part-time job can mean forgetting about self-care — physically and mentally. Fortunately, many corporations and businesses are taking a stand by letting social media be a voice to many who sit in silence to the stigma surrounding mental health.
January is renowned for Bell Let’s Talk Day: an initiative created by Bell Canada to advocate and educate others about mental health awareness and self-care. Their initiative, which began in January 2011, encourages Canadians to use hashtag symbols in conjunction with ‘BellLetsTalk’ and ‘MentalHealthAwareness’ on social media with their posts. 
Alternatively, if you are a Bell Canada customer, every text or call made on their network contributes to the cause. The power of medical innovation is, quite literally, at the tip of your fingers. The annual initiative also aims to destigmatize mental health and open up a conversation about the struggles of living with mental illness.  This is also the time where on-campus support services are the most critical.
While technology can aid so much in advocating for a great cause, if you are a student who believes studying comes before self-care, you may want to reassess your disposition. When your brain is fogged and in the clouds, how can you expect to achieve success in school? 
Unfortunately, many students deal with adversities during their learning. The loss of a family member, emotional abuse from a loved one, a traumatic event — and especially when it happens for the first time, one can be at a standstill. It takes a lot of time for someone grieving to rationalize what has happened. Time can heal, but time can also manifest itself into a spreading “infection” on the brain. This is why it is important to seek help when and where possible, and without delay. 
If you’re someone who is feeling down, put your head up and look around. Our school’s community has an array of support groups, services, and clubs where one can open up without feeling judged or ashamed. Mental health initiatives are imperative for us all, and we must continue to talk about this not only in January, but every day of the year. 
Since #BellLetsTalk’s inception, $100 million dollars has been raised for the cause. Canadians remain hopeful that technological advancements in both medicine and social media enhance the lives of those living with mental health challenges.
 


When I was 19, I met my girlfriend who was 18 at the time. Her ex had herpes and didn’t tell her. Then she had a breakout, but we didn’t know what it was until after it went away. We had sex a few days after that. I was itching all the time. I went to the doctor to find out I had herpes. My herbal doctor (DR JOE) gave me HSV HERBAL REMEDY, and I took two teaspoon daily for good one month and three weeks just as instructed. I haven’t had a breakout yet, and My last test came out Negative. For more information about this remedy, visit: ww w. besthealthherbalcentre .c om

Bell Let’s Talk Day has arrived and across campus you can see people donning blue toques with the little white smiley-face-and-speech-bubble logo. It’s a time when student groups and the university alike go all-out to talk about mental health and wellness.
There are so many resources and services available to help with feelings of stress, anxiety, depression, and the like at York that it can be overwhelming figuring out what the best option is for you. At least the options are there, unlike at some other universities that have little to no support available for student mental health needs.
It’s great that we’re finally moving into a place where we can discuss all of our feelings — not just the shiny, happy ones. And, it’s great that Bell Let’s Talk Day has played a major role in this movement.
However, in these conversations about mental health, what’s often excluded is mental illness.
Yes, when negative mental health exists long enough it can turn into an illness, so it is important to focus on strategies to improve and reflect upon one’s mental health. However, stopping at mental health doesn’t help those who are already at the point of illness, both diagnosed and undiagnosed. It also doesn’t help that we only speak about mental health meaningfully at this time of year, and that for a few weeks its social media filters and tags are the new fad before mental health and wellness fades into the background.
Emphasizing positive mental health practices — such as exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep — isn’t enough for those who struggle on a regular basis, not just in January. It can make those who are mentally ill feel like they did something wrong, that somehow their illness is entirely their fault, and that can be dangerous to someone who is already struggling with mental illness(es).
So, in the same way that we’re moving forward and breaking down the stigma around discussing mental health, we’re often neglecting thoughtful conversation and education about mental illness. We’re neglecting an already vulnerable group who doesn’t feel like they belong, and further ostracizing them. 
What Bell Let’s Talk festivities need isn’t more talk about mental health, it needs more talk about the illnesses that can result from prolonged poor mental health. It’s talking about what anxiety can look like, or depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, or any other number of mental illnesses. And, it’s talking about how harmful it can be when someone who doesn’t have one of those illnesses uses them as adjectives to describe their quirks.
The Bell Let’s Talk initiative raises a lot of money every year that goes toward making mental health support services more accessible, and the conversation it sparks at this time of year is important. However, it’s a conversation that needs to be continued and be made more inclusive. Mental health and mental illness are equally important every other day of the year. 
If we can’t have comfortable conversations about mental illness, we’ll struggle to understand why those who practice good mental health habits can also be the same people who have a mental illness.

The Lions were looking to snap their 11-game losing streak this past weekend, and did just that when they travelled to St. Catharines to take on the Brock Badgers on Thursday. However, when they returned onto home ice the following night to take on the Guelph Gryphons, they could not repeat their success.
The Lions had defeated the Badgers by one point at the beginning of the season, but the Badgers had in turn won their last contest by the same margin.
In Thursday’s match, the Lions beat the Badgers 5-4 in overtime. Tyler Higgins got the Lions onto the scoreboard first, netting a goal at 13:37. Twenty seconds later, Xavier Pouliot added a second goal for the Lions. Brendan Browne assisted on both of these goals.
The Lions added two more goals in the second period, the first of these coming from Justin Bean. Brandon Yeamans followed up with another goal less than a minute later, bringing the score to 4-0 for the Lions.
In the last half of the same period, the Badgers took control of the puck and scored three consecutive goals. Tyler Rollo scored twice and  Jordan Sambrook added another to close out the period one point behind the Lions at 4-3.
The Badgers tied the score in the third period when Ayden MacDonald scored on a power play.  Neither team was able to score after that, and the game went into overtime. 
Early in the period, the Lions were able to once again find the back of the Badgers’ net and regained the lead at 5-4. This goal came off the stick of Nic Coric, with Yeamans and Mark Wilson assisting. 
The Lions’ defence stayed strong for the rest of the game, and the Lions took home their first win since November.
Friday’s match against the Gryphons was a tough contest. The Gryphons had defeated the Lions in both of their prior matches this season, and were looking for a third. The Gryphons achieved just that, edging out the Lions in overtime for a final score of 4-3.
The Gryphons scored early in the period, with Mikkel Aagaard and Justin Lemcke teaming up to get past Lions goaltender Cole Ceci. After battling it out for another 18 minutes, the Lions found their way to the Gryphons’ net. Peter De Coppi scored first for the Lions, and was assisted by Coric and Browne. The first period ended tied 1-1.
The Gryphons took the lead in the second period. Ryan Valentini and Ted Nichol scored once each to put the Gryphons up 3-1 over the Lions.
Shortly after Nichol’s goal, Morgan Messenger of the Lions found his way to the net. Alex Mowbray and Scott Feser assisted on this goal.
The Lions scored again in the third period while keeping the Gryphons at bay. Bean scored his second goal of the weekend, with Feser and Messenger assisting. This left the game tied at 3-3, and the game went into overtime once again.
This overtime did not go as well for the Lions as it did the night before. Connor Bramwell of the Gryphons scored 40 seconds into play, and the Lions were unable to regain the lead. The game ended 4-3 in favour of the Gryphons.
The Lions are now at 6-16 for the season, up to 14 points but still last in the OUA West rankings.
They will be back in action tomorrow on Wednesday, January 29 at 7:00 p.m. to take on the Badgers once again, this time at Canlan Ice Sports.

The Lions’ basketball teams were back in action at home this past weekend. They took on the Nippissing Lakers on Friday and the Laurentian Voyageurs on Saturday. The women’s team picked up two more wins, extending their winning streak to five in a row. The men’s team had a tougher time and lost both matches.
Friday’s school-day match against the Lakers saw the women’s team start strong and maintain their lead throughout the game. By the end of the first half, the Lions were already up 39-28. 
The Lakers desperately tried to close the gap, but they were no match for the Lions. The game ended 84-70 for the Lions.
Lauren Golding once again lead the Lions in points, scoring 28. Katrina Collins-Samuels lead in rebounds with 19.
When the men took to the court, their skills were not enough to keep up with the Lakers. After the first quarter ended in a 19-all tie, the Lions increasingly fell behind each quarter. At halftime they were down 43-35.
The Lions struggled for the remainder of the game, which ended 82-67 for the Lakers.
Saturday night’s matches against the Voyageurs saw the women’s team replicate their first half success from the previous night. They were up 31-22 over their opponent at half time, and picked up the pace in the third and fourth quarters.
The Voyageurs struggled to keep up with the Lions in the last half of play, and continued to fall further behind. A massive 26-point fourth quarter from the Lions sealed their fifth straight win, with a final score of 75-48. 
Golding and Megan McLeod shared top point accolades, scoring 18 each. McLeod also lead in rebounds with 10.
Where the women’s team replicated their success, the men’s team had an equally hard time in Saturday’s match. After trailing in the first, the Lions came back to score an equal number of points to the Voyageurs in the second period. This burst of energy did not extend into the last half of the game though, and the Lions lost their third straight game 84-76.
Prince Kamunga and Tyler Prince led in points during Friday’s game, earning 13 each. Kamunga took the lead for the Lions in Saturday’s game with 26 points.
The women’s team now sits in third in the OUA Central division, with 20 points and 10-6 for the season. The men remain in last with just four points, and two wins to 14 losses.
The Lions will be on the road for their next four games where they will take on Brock, McMaster, Windsor, and Western.
They will return to the Tait McKenzie Centre for their final games of the regular season, the first being Wednesday, February 12 against the UOIT Ridgebacks. The second and final game will be on Friday, February 14 against the Queen’s Gaels. Tip-off for both games is at 6:00 p.m. for the women and 8:00 p.m. for the men.

Excalibur is not affiliated with the work-study program. Excalibur invites all applicants to apply, and does not discriminate against any applicant, including, but not limited to, the following: age, ethnicity, gender identity, disability, national origin, race, or religion.
However, due to reasons pertaining to conflict of interest and editorial integrity, we cannot hire applicants that are simultaneously associated with organizations or clubs that are deemed political in nature, including but not limited to the York Federation of Students (YFS). 
As a Jewish student at York, I was both frustrated and upset to come across a recent post on the York University Fessions Instagram (@yu.fessions) account. This post, which boasted hundreds of likes and included three different confessions, is not only deeply antisemitic and offensive, but it could not be further away from the truth.
The first confession stated that the York Federation of Students (YFS) was right to not let Israeli students participate in CultureFest because Israel has no culture and “is a country built on the genocide of Palestinian families”. This statement is both factually incorrect and deeply offensive. Israel is a legitimate, democratic country that was founded in 1948 on the back of a rich 3000-year-long connection to the land of Israel, dating back to biblical times. This connection is not only religious and cultural, but also historical.
Claims that Israel “has no culture” are simply false. Israel’s culture is deeply rooted in the Jewish religion and its diverse population has contributed to its dynamic, creative, and diverse culture with contributions in areas such as art, literature, music and cuisine.
The claim that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people is an ugly distortion of reality. Genocide is defined as the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation. The reality is millions of Arab citizens live peacefully and freely in Israel, with equal rights and opportunities under the law. Arab citizens hold positions of power in government, business, and academia and they are represented in the Israeli parliament and judicial system. Israeli hospitals treat Palestinian patients alongside Israeli patients, Israeli universities admit Palestinian students alongside Israeli students, and all citizens enjoy full opportunity to participate in Israel’s vibrant economy. 
The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is complex and reducing it to a simplistic narrative of genocide is not only inaccurate but also dangerous. It is important to recognize that Israel is not committing and has never committed genocide. Both sides have suffered in this conflict. This February alone, 13 Jews, as young as six years-old were murdered by Palestinian terrorists solely for the fact that they are Jewish. Most people on both sides desire a peaceful resolution that recognizes the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians, and to end the non-stop suffering from terrorism that Israeli people have endured — Jewish and non-Jewish, alike.
Comparing Israel to Nazi Germany, as the second confession post does, is not only absurd, but also deeply offensive to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Such comparisons trivialize the atrocities committed by the Nazis and demonstrate a profound ignorance of history.
The third confession is the face of today’s antisemitism. It is a cheap coverup of the same old, vile forms of antisemitism Jews have suffered from for thousands of years. While you could technically be pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel without physically hurting Jews, the notion that taking an anti-Israel position is not only detrimental to Jewish people, but is also utterly foolish from all viewpoints. It is important to note that there is a line between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. Denying the legitimacy of millions of Jews living in their ancestral homeland and denying their right to self-determination is antisemitic. This is not a matter of political opinion, but a basic human right that is afforded to all people, even to those without a rich history and ties to a land like the Jewish nation.
What is particularly concerning about these confessions is not just that they are offensive and frightening to Jewish students, but also that they contribute to the spread of antisemitism in our society. Antisemitism is a type of hatred that not only harms Jewish people but one that perpetuates fundamental flaws in society and negatively affects everyone.
We have seen time and time again throughout history the horrific consequences of allowing antisemitism to take hold. 
It is crucial that we, the York student community, come together to fight against antisemitism in all its forms. This means standing up against hate speech and discrimination, and fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect for all students, regardless of their background or beliefs. For future events held by the YFS, we must demand from the federation to be truly inclusive and allow for the fair representation of all students, including those of Israeli descent. We must all work together to create a campus community that is inclusive, respectful, and free from hate speech and discrimination.

Editor-in-Chief
A new student group campaign is encouraging York University to divest from companies they think violate international human rights laws, but the administration argue their stake in those companies gives them a voice they can use to change unethical business practice.
A recent report from the Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), “Holding York University Accountable,” pressed York to withdraw its endowment and pension fund investments and refrain from reinvesting in BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, manufacturers of components for Israel’s F-16 Falcon fighter jets; and from Hewlett-Packard, who supply Israel’s military with computers.
SXC.HU
In the report, SAIA says that by investing in companies that manufacture weapons “used to kill and maim Palestinian civilians,” York may be complicit “in the commission of crimes under international law.”
Trudy Pound-Curtis, assistant to the vice-president finance, explained York doesn’t actually choose which particular stocks it invests in, but only selects an investment manager.
“What we do, however, is provide each manager with our mandate,” said Pound-Curtis. “Included in that mandate is that they take into consideration environmental, social and governance factors in their formulas.”
The university’s “best practice” policy on investments, built on advice from major consulting firms, forbids “negative screening” or divesting from particular companies.
“[Mercer Ltd. consulting] believe the best approach to make a difference is through something called ‘active engagement’ where we would have our managers engage with managers in those companies’ behaviours, and we’ve built that into our investment philosophy,” said Pound-Curtis. “If we give up our stock, we have no vote, no say, no anything.”
But SAIA’s Katherine Lapointe thinks the university is using corporate rhetoric to complicate the situation.
“York can, and is indeed under the obligation to, instruct the investment manager to refrain from investing in companies based on defined criteria, including compliance with international law and respect for human rights,” she explained. “York cannot hide behind the fund managers and pretend that there is no problem. It is York’s money, and it is York’s ethical obligation.”
Lapointe said the university’s investment philosophy is inherently flawed.
“As long as our university remains invested in companies that profit from war crimes, it continues to make a mockery of its stated commitments to human rights and social justice,” she said. “‘Active engagement’ is a very
slow and ineffective tool [and it’s] not possible at all when the company’s main business is to manufacture weapons which are, by definition, death machines.”
Omar Dominguez, chair and co-founder of the Coalition of Universities for Responsible Investing, said York is on the right track.
“Issues like military spending are bound to be controversial,” he said. “But if you divest from these companies, it really leaves you out of an opportunity to negotiate with the companies and try to address your concerns.”
Nevertheless, Dominguez appreciated SAIA’s efforts to include students in these discussions.
“We encourage universities to combine the university trustees – who are ultimately responsible for these decisions – with faculty who have expertise on the very issues, to include the views of students, who are some of the beneficiaries, and to include multiple stakeholders,” he said of his coalition’s goals.
Pound-Curtis also pointed out that since they switched investment managers in late February, York is no longer investing in Hewlett-Packard or Northrop Grumman, and that they have not invested in Lockheed Martin since August 2010.
In fact, York is currently invested in only one of SAIA’s four target companies, BAE Systems, via the university’s pension fund.
“We’ve about a million dollars [in BAE Systems] out of our total pension fund, which is $1.4 billion dollars – it’s insignificant,” said Pound-Curtis. “We will have a discussion with our investment manager to ask if they’d considered any of the facts [of SAIA’s report].”
Lapointe emphasized that York has not yet promised not to reinvest in these companies.
“Pound-Curtis has not addressed any of the three demands of our divestment campaign,” she said.
Anne Bayefsky, a political science professor at York University who specializes in international human rights, thinks the campaign is wrongheaded because of its focus on Israel as an apartheid state.
“Israel, like all states, is entitled to the rights of self-defense,” she explained. “Efforts to deny Israel’s right to self-defense are, in fact, the inverse of the declared intention of people concerned with apartheid because it would deny the Jewish people a homeland where they can find protection and security.”
In their report, SAIA compares Israeli policy to apartheid South Africa, citing a study, “Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?” by the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. But Bayefsky thinks the evidence points in the opposite direction.
“Everyone should be concerned about human rights, but we have to take a good hard look at the facts,” she said. “The evidence clearly indicates that Israel – a country where one-fifth of the population is Arab with full democratic rights and representation at the highest levels of Israeli society – is not an apartheid state.”

Am I seeing things, or is there a hideous misuse of the possessive apostrophe in the title?
Hi Harrison! Long time?!
Not a hideous misuse if you pretend that “group’s” is supposed to be followed with “policy”.
Is it just me or does excalibur give wayyyyyyy too little space to any group that stands in solidarity with Palestine in their paper? One and a half sentences from a SAIA spokesperson and half an article of b.s from the admin and blatant lies from a “professor” at York, Who’s obviously working with Hillel.
Is it a prerequisite for editors that they must be in love with Israel? Maronese, in his piece does a bad job hiding his bias and clear attempts to mislead readers. The group in this article is not asking for divestment from companies that they “feel” vioates international law. These findings have been made by experts of International law: academics, UN investigations, Amnesty International, Human rights watch have found Israel’s actions and the bodies that support it are in constant violation of international law.
Excalibur, readers are tired of this open love for apartheid.
I agree, Steve. Just google the professor Anne Bayefsky. She is a pretty outspoken Israel sympathizer. I understand that the writer of the article felt that they were balancing SAIA with this professor, but it’s actually unbalanced.
Using a professor’s (expert’s) comments against a student group’s comments is not leveled. Why not get Dr. Rahnema to comment? After all, he only teaches the most popular course on Israel/Palestine Relations in all of York. Or any other political professor who specializes in Middle East Politics?
The end of this article is atrocious. Bayefsky’s blatant apologetics are just embarrassing and shouldn’t be taken seriously at all. They’re clearly tacked on and they completely divert focus away from rest of the piece.
Also, the most verbose lead in existence
Um… since when is a country democratic when it has already titled itself as a “Jewish State”. The dominating ideology and bias is clear in that alone, and does not in any circumstance create a space for democracy.
I am really glad to see this dialogue at York and online. These are important questions for universities and their communities.
I want to invite you to the 1st national symposium to examine social and environmental issues affecting university investments (June 21, 2011, Victoria, BC).

If you have ever parked in The Village while you dash off to your three-hour class to avoid having to pay York University’s parking fees, one day you might find a bright yellow ticket slapped to your windshield.
Parking by-laws in the streets around The Village at York neighbourhood south of campus changed recently, from a maximum three hours to one hour between 8 am and 8 pm. According to North York Community Council minutes, the change came after Village residents made numerous complaints about York students abusing the three-hour parking limit.
(Pippin Lee)
The new by-law took almost a year to implement after being adopted in July 2010. Anthony Perruzza, Ward 8 York West councillor, said it takes time for new by-laws to be put into practice. The City doesn’t start putting up signs or enforce new laws until everything is finalized.
When the new signs went up March 24, York University tweeted about the new parking regulations, pleading, “We’re just the messenger!” They also published a YFile article with detailed
information.
The new by-laws have left some York students furious.
It’s Anne’s last year York University, and she had never gotten a ticket parking in The Village – until now.
“It’s fucking ridiculous,” she said after learning about the new bylaw and finding a $30 ticket on her car. “[It’s] obviously against students because they know we have three-hour classes, and one-hour parking is trying to prevent us from what we’ve been doing the whole time.”
Many students returning from class to their cars parked in The Village were surprised to learn about the new time-cap. Most of them park in The Village to avoid parking costs at York.
Councillor Peruzza understands the challenges York students face when parking at Keele campus – students paying for expensive parking at York is nothing new.
“I went to York myself and we used to pay steep parking rates, and that’s why I took up riding my bicycle to York,” said Peruzza.
He urged Toronto’s parking authority to construct an underground parking lot under the hydro corridor near Murray Ross, though the city apparently decided they’d be unable to recuperate their losses or maintain the lot financially.
“We know [parking in The Village is] a problem and I would also like to take some of those cars parking in those neighbourhoods out of the neighbourhoods and into a parking lot […] but so far we’ve been unsuccessful with it.”
Peruzza is still very interested in the idea of a parking lot at Murray Ross and said he is continuing to fight for its construction.
Students that park in The Village couldn’t decide whether they’d be willing to bite the bullet and pay for York parking. Some said they’ll still park in The Village because it’s their last year at York; others said paying the fine would still be cheaper than buying a York parking permit. Some students, however, said they’d have no choice but to park at York because of the new bylaw.
The university is still unsure how a one-hour parking limit in The Village will affect the number of students parking at York in the future, said York spokesperson Wallace Pidgeon.
“We just don’t know,” said Pidgeon.
According to Toronto parking enforcement, they usually patrol an area when they receive a lot of complaints from residents in that community. They won’t usually issue more than a ticket a day on a single car.
With the previous three-hour limit, parking officials used to fine drivers $15. The new by-law also allows people to park for free in The Village from  8 am and 8 pm.
York currently charges $1.50 to $2.50 per half-hour, and $10 to $20 per day for parking.

York Federation of Students (YFS)  executive director Jeremy Salter and YFS president Krisna Saravanamuttu are at University of Victoria (UVic) campus this week where, according to a Facebook event titled “The Big CFS Debate at UVIC,” Salter was set to engage in a debate regarding the recent referendum as a speaker for the “yes” side – he would be arguing UVic should not break away from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS).
Gemma Karstens-Smith, Editor-in-Chief for UVic’s student newspaper the Martlet, confirmed there’s a heavy CFS presence on campus at the moment.
UVic’s student union – University of Victoria Students’ Society (UVSS) – chairperson James Coccola noted there are “a lot of people from the ‘yes’ side who have been brought to campus to campaign on this and there’s a lot of resources behind this side.”

(Pippin Lee)
The UVSS has officially endorsed the “no” side, implying the current board believes it is not in the best interest of students to continue to be
part of the CFS.
Coccola said he was aware there was going to be a number of people flown out to campaign for the CFS during the
referendum.
“It’s happened at every school [that votes to defederate from the CFS] […] it’s quite common, so it doesn’t surprise me at all that Jeremy’s here,” he said.
Coccola also suggested York students should reflect on the fact their student union executive director had flown out to “campaign on the other side of the country, something that arguably doesn’t affect York students.”
“This is a referendum for UVic students. Why would someone from York be able to speak to the issues that UVic students are facing?” questioned Coccola. “Not all issues are the same across the country, despite what people say.”
When asked about whether the YFS covers the expenses for its members to travel to other campuses during a CFS referendum, Saravanamuttu responded via email, “The answer is no.”
Saravanamuttu couldn’t comment on who did, in fact, pay for the trip.
According to UVic student David Foster, there have been attempts for many years to break from the CFS.
“We don’t get a lot of value for our money, and the money could be better used in another way or even just by putting it back in our pockets,” said Foster. “This year we’re using even less of the CFS services than we ever have.”
He explained that UVic students do not use the CFS health plan, website services, and, since they found a company that could produce yearly handbooks at a lower cost than the CFS, even the handbook service has gone unused.
Karstens-Smith added that the referendum has been a long time coming for the university.
The original petition to begin a referendum was circulated by a number of students and began in 2009, but was declared invalid by the CFS because of a counter-petition started by the former UVSS.
According to Coccola, both petitions were submitted to CFS, which used the second petition to deny a referendum, although there was no way to tell which petition was signed first or whether students knew what type of petition they were signing.
The issue was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada in November, where the judge ruled the petition valid.
Nevertheless, the CFS began claiming the UVSS owed a debt to the CFS from the ’90s to the tune of  $129,000. CFS bylaws state that student unions cannot have a referendum if they owe any outstanding membership fees.
Nevertheless, the court granted and set a date for the referendum on the basis that the debt was released by the CFS two days prior to a court date.
“The judge ruled it prejudicial and said they could not submit the affidavit and that they should’ve done so sooner – they had plenty of time to do so,” said Coccola.
The campaign period for the referendum started March 21 while the voting period started March 29 and ends March 31.
While Excalibur obtained a photo of Saravanamuttu on the UVic campus, Karstens-Smith said that Salter avoided all photos.
“Is he trying to hide the fact he’s here or something? Because we can definitely confirm that he is,” stated Karstens-Smith via e-mail.
Excalibur attempted to reach both Salter and Saravanmuttu by phone, text and email regarding these issues but did not get a comment from them as of publication.
Salter has a very strong tie to the CFS, and received an ‘A’ in a report card-like document accidentally released by CFS-British Columbia about three years ago. The document ranked CFS members based on loyalty, and recommended which members would be well-suited to advocate at universities holding a CFS defederation referendum.
When  Salter was president of Continuing Education Students at Ryerson (CESAR), he helped along the referendum to make CESAR a permanent member of the CFS. He was also the former Northern Ontario Commissioner for CFS-Ontario, while he served as the Lakehead University Student Union president.
 


Jeremy Salter also came to the University of Regina to campaign for the ‘yes’ side last October. We questioned then, how can the Executive Director be gone from work, campaigning in Saskatchewan for three weeks?
Thanks for the coverage, Excalibur! Happy to say that your students will be returning to their home campus shortly, as UVic voted overwhelming to defederate, removing the CFS and their representatives from our campus. Kindest regards from the west coast, from a ‘NO CFS’ side supporter.

TAHIR: Why the name “SlutWalk”? Wouldn’t people find it offensive?
TEEKAH: If folks were to try and bury this story and shove it under the carpet, all that does is replicate and increase the power words like “slut” have. We want to confront this power and change it. By calling it SlutWalk, we are acknowledging his comment – and want to open up dialogue. We can take concepts “slut” points to – women having sex, who should have sex and what kind of women there should be – and completely rework these concepts in the interest of an actual gender-equal world.
TA: What’s the aim of this event?
TE: One of our main aims is to reappropriate the word “slut.” We are also looking for increased transparency, accountability and greater anti-oppression training for police. We are coming to this with a politic that can mean different things for different people who attend the march.
TA: Some might call it an overreaction to blame the entire police force for a reckless comment made by one officer.
TE: When a police officer puts on the uniform of the police force, he is not a lone person. For York and the Toronto police to select this officer to come and speak for “campus safety awareness” events, they are sending him as a rep of the Toronto police. Police officers are the result of police culture and training. Either the culture indirectly supports his point of view, or the training does not do a good enough job to train out of them this ignorance.
TA: How important is SlutWalk Toronto?
TE: We are not doing this event to say, “Fuck the police.” We are looking to have a dialogue with them, to open up real interaction between them and the community they serve. We want to improve their approaches toward minority groups, and make change for the better. This march is one of the steps in that process. We’ve had enough of these cases. It’s time to do something real and tangible about them.
TA: What kind of changes to attitude are you looking for?
TE: It’s easier to blame the victim than to look at the larger picture. Why are we telling women to police their bodies, to stay indoors, to dress in certain ways while men have absolutely none of this “policing” on them? Victim blaming actually works to support the rapist. How can you say that a rapist is ever “justified” in raping? We need to start looking at the larger picture – sexism in different places – and how these sources that spawn things like rape are not being addressed.

People all live with viruses, most of them benign; when these harmful tunes infect the brain, the average listener displays no signs of being completely subsumed by unexceptional music. They’re sort of like the sonic version of the human papillomavirus: symptoms don’t always show up, though the results can be deadly.
But creating public awareness for devastating viruses is not my intention – it’s to establish awareness in regard to the rapid spread of bad music (in most cases anything that falls under the umbrella of “mainstream”) and its ultimate destruction of formerly genuine bands.
Instrumental band Scale The Summit at one of their tour stops in Austin, Texas. (Prosthetic Records)
Let’s scale the summit of reason, shall we? To back up my salvo of accusations and labels, I’ve formed an armada of alternatives, a formidable flotilla of funk and folk that will freak your frontal cortex. My smart bomb comes in the form of an unorthodox, independent-minded group of people that helped build up a genre and simultaneously smash it down with complicated chord progression, sporadic melodies and overall awesomeness.
Scale The Summit is out with their latest album, The Collective.
Formed in 2004, Scale the Summit has peaked on many music charts and weathered many attacks from their perch, but they’re far too high up this mountain of musical mastery to notice the petty criticisms from down here. Ass-kissing, you say? Maybe, but the accolades are well deserved.
What sets Scale the Summit apart from other bands in the same metal subgenre is their lack of vocals. ‘Instru-metal’ is their brand of vocal-free metal, and they make up for the vocals elsewhere. The music literally speaks for itself, and lacks nothing in the frontman department.
Even more astounding is how young the band members are. Their average age is just 22, so they’ve many years ahead to develop as a band. If they’re at this level now, imagine their progress in five, 10 or 20 years.
Their stylistic elements are peculiar and wonderful. The music is hard with moments of softness, always maintaining a level of complexity even in simple harmonies. It maintains a happy atmosphere, something metal bands before them have seldom achieved. Songs like “Gallows” should be listened to on headphones while walking down a sunny street. Certain parts of the songs scream uncertainty, while the mood is cemented in the very atmospheric quality of “Colossal,” the opening track of The Collective.
Whereas many bands have to rely on sound editing to get their cohesive, unified quality, Scale the Summit has it on their own. It’s a quality that makes for outstanding live performances: all of the musicians are constantly on the same wavelength.
Taking time to savour The Collective is a transcendental experience of self-reflection, comparable to the effects of psychedelic drugs. Many fans of the band have described their music as a journey, a form of exploration both musically and personally for the individual; drifting into oneself after listening to the entire album is easy. Scale the Summit’s music lends itself to introspection, and that’s why critics have coined the term “adventure metal” to replace the tired old horse that is “progressive metal.” I’m not knocking the “prog,” but change is good.
Everyone’s level of musical knowledge and fondness is different and we listen to music for different reasons. For those unseasoned listeners, your level of critical listening isn’t the same as that of a professional. You may not pick out the minuscule elements of each song, but you don’t need to be an expert to enjoy expertly performed music.
What is bad music? What is good music for that matter? The subjectivity is the attraction to the medium – what’s certain is that The Collective will take you on a musical journey through passages of the mind rarely ever examined, without ever having to leave the comfort of home.

Nina Arsenault has spent a fortune changing her appearance from male to female. The 37-year-old used to work in the sex trade, but now supports herself as a playwright, performer and motivational speaker to queer youth. Her one-woman show, The Silicone Diaries, recently had a second highly successful run in Toronto, was later performed in Montreal and will open in Vancouver next year.
MCLAUGHLIN: Where did you grow up?
ARSENAULT: In Beamsville, Ontario in the Golden Horseshoe Trailer Park. It was a really tight knit community. My memories of it are just great. But we moved when I was about six to a house in Smithville. It was very difficult to make friends because I was so feminine. Growing up in the trailer park and going to school with those kids, they always knew how girlish I was. With everyone on top of each other you have no choice but to accept people. [Then I moved and] being the new kid it was very, very difficult to make friends. I have been a bit of a lone wolf all my life.
Nina Arsenault, who holds a York graduate degree in theatre, supports herself as performer. (Tony Fong)
M: In The Silicone Diaries you talk about seeing a female mannequin in a store at age five. What was it that affected you that day?
A: I think just the harmony and symmetry of the face spoke to me. I knew that I was a girl inside but I had this boy body. Then, for my visual gaze to rest upon a face that was a sculpture of a woman’s face, I just seized on that as a child. It affected me, the perfection of it.
M: When did you decide to begin plastic surgery?
A: About age 23, but I didn’t have my first procedure until I was 25.
M: What did you have done?
A: At first, just transsexual procedures to feminize myself. It got to a point where I looked as much like a normal woman as I possibly could; however, I still had masculine features. It was really traumatic on a daily basis to see those features. So I made the decision to really push the cosmetic procedures, knowing I would no longer look natural, that I would start to look plastic and artificial.
M: Like a mannequin?
A: Yeah. But I can’t say at the beginning of the journey I was trying to look like a mannequin or a Playboy bunny. I was just trying to be a woman.
M: Did you literally have 60 surgeries?
A: There were actually more. Some were just procedures, like a lip injection.
M: When was the last one?
A: In 2006.
M: How much did they cost?
A: Upwards of $200,000.
M: How did you afford that?
A: I was working in the sex trade and made an incredible amount of money so quickly there.
M: Men like “shemales”?
A: Yeah. In terms of supply and demand, there just aren’t a lot of us, but there’s a lot of interest. The first day I put my escort ad in the paper, I had 250 calls. I don’t think that’s something that’s spoken about that openly amongst otherwise heterosexual men. I could have worked from morning until night if I had wanted to.
M: What was it like working in the trade?
A: It was physically very tough. And I only did oral, no fucking.
M: A lot of transgender women work in the sex business. Why is that?
A: It’s one of the few places you can get work and feel safe. If you’re visibly transgender you’re going to be one of the most disenfranchised and disadvantaged people in culture.
M: You have two graduate degrees, right?
A: I do. But it’s tough to get straight work. You can’t imagine the amount of transphobia out there.
M: How long have you been out of the trade?
A: About three years. I support myself now as a performer.
M: In the play you mention that you have had your testicles removed. But you kept your penis. Why was that, if your goal was to be as close to a woman as possible?
A: I never knew what would happen to me financially so [if I still had my penis] I could always return to the sex business.
M: What has the play done for you?
A: It has been an incredibly healing ritual. I think I wrote it because I had a lot of emotional angst and suffering that I needed to express, that I needed someone to bear witness to. It makes me stronger every time I perform it.
M: Do you feel 100 percent female now or still a bit male?
A: I’ve always known I was a woman but I was socialized as a male. I have some qualities people see as male – I’m an aggressive thinker – but my core is definitely female.
M: Do you feel beautiful enough now?
A: I don’t work on the outside anymore. I concentrate now on inner work.
M: Any more surgeries ahead?
A: No. Not until I start to really visibly age.

Increasingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, you’ll find doctors and health care professionals turning to the ancient disciplines of meditation to deal with mental health disorders.
Meditation is the most well-known – and certainly one of the most thoroughly studied – forms of medicine practiced by the Tibetan Buddhists for centuries.  Personified by the dignified and solemn Dali Lama for over 25 centuries, meditation has become a method of refining and exploring the inner self, probing and navigating inner space in much the same way we have preferred to examine our outer.
Spending just a few minutes to mediate can help you relive stress that comes from a busy scheduel. (SXC.HU)
“The monks, we believe, are the Olympic athletes of certain kinds of mental training,” said Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist from the University of Wisconsin who, as part of a select group of scientists and scholars, travelled to Dharamsala in 2000 to attempt to dissect problems of distress and human suffering.
He analyzed 150 ordinary brains and compared them to the brain of a monk, and discovered a monk’s brain was simply more active on the left, which represented happiness. “This is tantalizing evidence that these practices may indeed be promoting beneficial changes in the brain,” concluded Davidson.
Zindal Segal, a psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health who uses meditation to treat patients with mood disorders, finds that though we may never be able to reach the same heights as Buddhists who spend 10,000 hours sitting and meditating by just spending time clearing out minds we may be able to feel better.
“We’re talking about paying attention, we’re talking about returning wherever our minds are to this present moment. These are things that we all have. We don’t have to earn them, we just have to find a way of clearing away the clutter to see that they are already there,” said Dr. Segal.
The key to meditation is to slow the mind down and examine one’s thoughts and thinking processes and connect that to the present moment. “[Meditation is] a way of training yourself to pay attention in the present moment without judgement [as] to what your experience is,” said Dr. Segal in a Globe and Mail article.
The health benefits are still very much debated, but researchers have found that meditation is good for relieving stress, and dropping blood pressure. This form of medicine changes someone’s attitude from sour to positive and can go a long way especially in our busy lives. “Meditation is a set of practices that have been around for more than 2,500 years, whose principal goal is to cultivate these positive human qualities, to promote flourishing and resilience […]” said Davidson.
At first glance this may seem simple, but it has been shown to be just as effective as antidepressants in treating and preventing depression relapse, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The next time you are feeling blue, or stressed over exams, you shoulder consider your inner strength before popping a pill.

Final exams may drive you to the edge of sanity, but compared to what Norio Ota, director of Japanese studies at York University, went through at his Japanese high school, our academic lives are a cakewalk.
“When I was going through the entrance examinations, it was called ‘the exam from hell,’” said Ota. “I had to work until two to three in the morning every single day because I had to study for ten or twelve subjects at the same time, and then get up 6:30a.m. and go to school.”
He could tell I was shocked. Ota shook his head with a dismissive smile, “I wasn’t exceptional. Many people had to study the same way. We had a saying: If you sleep for four hours, you will fail the entrance exam. You have to sleep only for three. Seriously.”
It’s difficult for me to imagine an educational culture so different from my own.
“Well, many people went through this in Japan at those times. We thought about dying, and all those things, because the pressure was just enormous.”
“It was okay for me because I thought of it as one hurdle I had to overcome.”
Decades later, Ota still works until 2 or 3 am many days of the week, teaches overtime, trains high school teachers across Canada via videoconferencing, and recently helped coordinate a new Japanese language program at Havana University.
His peaceful smile, balanced demeanour and humility gave me the impression of self-awareness, dedication, and a man truly in love with his work.
“I feel appreciated by other people – I think that’s a source of work ethic for me,” said Ota. “It’s not just culturally ingrained. I love what
I do.”
A certain school of Western psychologists, however, might use a different word to describe his behaviour.
Workaholism.
Work·a·ho·lic (n. circa 1968)
The term workaholic has been used informally to refer to white-collar and public service workers who ‘work too hard’ since it was coined in 1968 by American psychologist Wayne Oates.
However, there has been much academic discussion about what the term actually means in a clinical context, and considerable difficulty reaching a consensus.
Some early studies in workaholism looked at workers’ attitudes toward their jobs, while others focused on their behaviour, i.e. the number of hours worked per year. For example, Mosier (1983) defined a workaholic as someone who works more than 50 hours a week regardless of his psychological condition; Cherrington (1980) defined a workaholic as having an “irrational commitment to excessive work”; Machlowitz (1980) focused on the workaholic’s positive enjoyment of work.
Later studies attempted to place workaholics on a spectrum of “work involvement, a feeling of being driven to work, and work enjoyment”, differentiating between workaholics who enjoy their work and those who resent it.
The ‘Japanese Work Ethic’
The Japanese have a reputation for outworking their Western counterparts. But do the numbers support anecdotal evidence like professor Ota’s high school entrance exam experience? Is Japan a nation of workaholics?
At Japan’s economic peak, the numbers indicated a resounding yes. In 1980, Japanese worked an average of 2121 hours a year while Canadians and Americans both worked just over 1800. To put that in perspective, if you took two weeks of vacation, you would have to work about 8.5 hours every day – not including breaks – to meet the Japanese average.
While cultural collectivist attitudes are sometimes cited, Ota explained there is a clear economic explanation for this phenomenon.
“For a long time, until the beginning of the bubble economy, many [Japanese] worked for the same company until they retired. That was the source of loyalty in the company. These people worked really hard because they identified with the company.”
Overworking was such a serious issue that a word, kar?shi, was coined in the late ’80s to describe death or suicide attributed to work-related stress. Kar?shi prompted the Japanese government to begin research initiatives and enact legislation to force workers to take holidays.
Today, the problem is less severe, but over 10,000 continue to die from kar?shi every year – almost as many causalities as the March 11 earthquake crisis this year.
White collar workers and high level executives are among the most vulnerable. Even pre-university students, who are exposed to high levels of stress, are affected by kar?shi; Japanese students have one of the highest suicide rates for their age group in the world.
Bursting the Bubble
Westerners continue to view Japan as a workaholic society, but the trend may be changing.
In 2009, Japanese workers laboured an average of 1714 hours a week – only 15 more than Canadians – and actually less than American workers, who worked 1768.
This statistic forces us to rethink typical stereotypes about cultural pre-dispositions and look at economic factors in defining trends in
overworking.
“After the economic bubble burst, what happened was that Japanese companies started laying off and firing people, so the so-called life-time employment system has collapsed since then.” said Ota. “Many people felt the same way I did: ‘Why should I spend my whole life working for a big corporation?’ A different value orientation was introduced. Not all at once, but gradually.”
While Japanese workaholism may be subsiding, for Canadians, there are no signs the problem is going away. Since workaholics tend to be high-functioning members of society, their problems often go unnoticed.
Bryan Robinson, PhD., author of the best-selling Chained to the Desk, thinks the subject is, at least in some ways, taboo.
“Cultural attitudes towards workaholism have changed very little,” said Robinson. “In a downturn economy, where people are desperate for jobs, they don’t want to talk about working too much.  Plus, with the advent of wireless technology, electronic devices are invading personal time more than ever before.”
A lot of the problem is awareness.
“People still don’t get how damaging work addiction is. It continues to be praised and misunderstood, especially in a time when many people don’t have jobs.”
According to Robinson, university environments are particularly at risk, and desperately need to take action.
“Universities are notorious for enabling work addiction with huge expectations and very few boundaries […] Universities and any workplace at risk for burnout should be encouraging self-care among faculty, not expect multi-tasking, which only activates the stress response, and they should hold seminars on the dangers of overworking and the damage done to marriages and children.”
Robinson found it hard to think of a North American campus he could hold up as a positive example. “I don’t know of any who are doing it right,” he said.
A Positive Outlook
In a very personal moment, I described my own struggle with workaholism to professor Ota. I spend up to 15 or more hours a day working at Excalibur as a designer, a writer and a manager, an ethic that differs little from the way I’ve approached my work since middle school.
Despite all of this negativity, not everyone views intense commitment to work as a bad thing. The key to staying healthy and balanced for an intense worker, he said, is passion and
humility.
“I used to think I worked for self-satisfaction; it was only after an important person in my life died that I realised, actually, my life is not for myself. When you can feel your life is not for yourself, all negative feelings like anger, jealousy, everything disappears. Once you reach that stage, you keep your peace of mind.”
I told him maybe this was true, but my drive to work sometimes took over the rest of my life.
“You are part Japanese, remember,” he laughs, referring to my one-quarter Japanese background. “It’s in your blood!”

York is changing the way students are affiliated with their colleges.
Under the old regulation, residence students were automatically affiliated with whatever college residence they moved into – if a student lived in Winters College during first year and moved to Vanier residence, their college affiliation would be automatically switched from Winters to Vanier. Even if students submitted a form to maintain their original affiliation, a glitch in the system would prevent the request from being realized.
The university has now fixed that glitch, and students may now successfully choose to remain with their original college after their first year, even if they decide to move residences.
“The bigger issue is after first year, should you still be forced to be affiliated with whatever college you live in or whatever college you choose?” said Founders College Council president Robert Cerjanec. “Under the current system, it almost tells you indirectly that if now you live in Calumet, you should be involved in Calumet. But you don’t have any connection with Calumet. You have a connection [with your original college].”
Vp students Rob Tiffin explained that the student information system would automatically change any college affiliation requests back to the college of residence due to a system pre-programming.
“Even if students could change, or request a change, we discovered it was slipping students back into [the college affiliation of the residence they were living in],” he said.  “We are going to make certain that that doesn’t occur [anymore].”
tudents must go through the registrar’s office to request to change college
affiliation.

York housing is planning a commuter floor in Tatham Hall at McLaughlin College.
The second floor of the college residence will be converted into a floor for commuter students to rent out for a night during the school year.
“[It will] offer York undergraduate students an overnight accommodation option,” said Debbie Kee, director of housing services. “The rooms will be available for students who plan to stay on campus late to study, or for students who are anticipating bad weather and do not want to commute.”
Kee said that the floor would include 16 single rooms and four double rooms, a total of 24 beds. While she said that the cost to rent the room have not been solidified yet, she estimated that it would probably be around $25 a night including tax.

Students from all over the Greater Toronto Area, including those from York, made their way to city hall September 26 to oppose proposed cuts to vital city services.
Sandy Hudson, chair of the Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O), says students from colleges and universities across the GTA have been organizing to make sure their voices will be heard.
“[These are] all sorts of services that students in this city need in order to continue their studies, to get to school, and to make sure that they’re able to do well,” says Hudson.
She points out the biggest concerns for students include cuts to childcare, libraries, bike lanes, and the TTC.
However, city councillor for Ward 17 Cesar Palacio insists that this is not about cutting services.
“It’s about improving and maintaining the level of service,” he says. “The difference is between having the essential services and all other services that would be nice to have—the ones we cannot afford. City council is simply trying to find what services are essential to Torontonians and to find efficiencies.”
Alastair Woods, vp campaigns and advocacy for the York Federation of Students (YFS), agrees city service cuts—especially to transit and bike lanes—will have a huge impact on students.
“We have a lot of students who travel from all ends of the city,” he says. “Any cuts to the TTC—whether it be in routes or whether it be in the number of times [buses] come or whether it be in the actual infrastructure—will end up hurting students in the end.”
Fourth-year York student Sean Dimnik depends on his bicycle to get around the city. The notion of less bike lanes worries him.
“It would limit my mobility,” he says. “My primary resource is my bike in terms of transportation.”
Woods also addresses the concerns of students who rely on childcare.
“I think the common misconception is that students are 18 or 19 years old and don’t always have kids to take care of,” he says, “but that’s not entirely true.”
Tanya McFayden, vp gender issues for the Graduate Students Association, has a child in the Lee Wiggins Childcare Centre at York.
“I know many people in my life with children who end up putting them in childcare they don’t feel comfortable with,” she says. “They put them into unlicensed daycares and into home daycares simply because they need a spot and they have to work.”
If she didn’t have a spot, says McFayden, she would not be able to pursue her graduate studies.
Hudson says the massive outcry from residents across the city has resulted in city council delaying some service cuts, such as those to public libraries.
“[People] here today are demonstrating for two reasons: one is a bit of a celebration because it looks like some of the cuts that were on the table […] before have been delayed or will be, at the very least.”
However, Palacio believes there won’t be any radical changes.
“[In reality], there won’t be any closures to city libraries in Toronto […] and the city is still going to provide daycare services,” he explains. “What we’re asking is simply for the province to subsidize the additional funding that we need to provide the 2000 additional spaces [to daycare].”
“The main thing is that we’re in a crisis right now, and we have a chronic financial problem and deficit of $470 million dollars,” Palacio points out. “In the last administration, nothing was done. But this administration has taken the fortitude to stand up to the challenge and get a review of city financing.”

As the memories of Frosh Week 2011 fade away, groups of students participating in a campus walking tour have the chance to learn about the “unofficial” side of York.
DisOrientation 2011, a week-long series of events organized by the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPIRG) and their allied organizations, attempts to introduce students to the political history of York. The event, which serves as an alternative to traditional orientation, centres around issues of social and environmental justice.
The Radical Walking Tour, the first event, took students on a walk through campus, focusing on places of political significance at York.
“We start off by looking at the governing structure and how York is managed,” says tour guide Imran Kaderdina. York’s mission statement “speaks of having a community that values freedom, social justice, and accessible education, but those are not always upheld by the university through its actions.”
Kaderdina also explains where many of York’s building names came from.
“The buildings are often named the way they are because of donations, which come with strings [attached] that many students don’t know about,” he says.
Participants ranged from students to faculty to community members.
“It’s a pretty diverse group,” says Aruna Boodram, volunteer and programming coordinator at OPIRG York. “I’d say it’s for people who want to learn more about the issues happening around their community and around the world.”
Viola Huang immersed herself in DisOrientation activities all week—including the walking tour and a screening of Slingshot Hip Hop, a film presented by the Toronto Palestine Film Festival—and hopes other students will show more interest in politics.
“I can understand this indifference to a certain degree when I think of all the busy schedules students have here,” says Huang. “I think it is pivotal for students themselves to get engaged in politics, to know what’s going on, and to educate themselves.”
Kaderdina also believes it is important for students to be engaged in campus politics.
“I think it’s impossible for students to stay politically neutral,” says Kaderdina. “If the students aren’t engaging with the university, they are essentially supporting the status quo.”
DisOrientation events—which include workshops, film screenings, and a free concert—are being held every day until October 1.
Forthcoming are a workshop on the decriminalization of sex work, a discussion on Canadian immigration, and a workshop on alternative media.

Almost a month after it was taken down by York management for “health and sanitary reasons” a new Goddess of Democracy statue may soon see the light of day.
The York University Student Centre (YUSC) has allocated a spot for the new statue—which commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre in China—near the Treats Coffee Emporium located in the Student Centre.
Design plans are currently being developed by Bruce Parsons, fine arts professor at York.
“I’m working on six or seven drawings right now,” Parsons reveals. Once done, he says, the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC) will decide on the best one before a design plan is reviewed and approved by the Student Centre.
The height of the statue, Parsons adds, will depend on cost. Bronze, the preferred material, costs more than alternatives like aluminum. Though there are cheaper and quicker alternatives, he feels they will not be a creative, long-lasting solution.
Cheuk Kwan of the TADC is hoping a bronze statue will be approved.
“The Goddess of Democracy is the most symbolic icon of the Tiananmen Massacre,” he says. “Thus, it must be both prominent and identical to the original, both conditions laid down by the TADC to emphasize the statue’s historical significance. It can’t just be any art piece [or] abstract statue of remembrance.”
Parsons estimates construction may take up to six months.

If there is anything to remember about the Nas concert at York, it’s that Nas never disappoints—and when he does, he makes up for it.
Nas was initially a no-show due to illness at the Yorkfest concert scheduled for September 21. This was not much of a surprise to some York students.
“I was actually expecting him not to come,” says first-year biochemistry student Ali Khan. “This man is a legend. He is like the walking Jesus of New York, and [if he doesn’t] show up in Toronto and specifically at York University […] you can expect that.”
Regardless, Khan and other students went to the concert on Wednesday to see other artists, including Shawn Desman and Danny Fernandes.
When it was announced that Nas would be unable to perform, many students began to leave, recalls Zuha Vance, first-year biomedical student.
“The organizers informed us that Nas wasn’t coming, and everyone left,” she says. “Like ‘screw that’ […] it [was] raining.”
The following day, Nas tweeted “#Yorku sorry about yesterday, I was ill. BUT Fri 23 Sept I will def be there at #Rexall @yorkfest2011 @YFSlocal68” informing followers of his intention to hold a “Redemption” concert.
Despite the initial fall-through, the York Federation of Students (YFS), which organized the concert event, was determined to get Nas to perform at York.
“We had to make sure those students got to see Nas,” explains Monirul Pathan, vp campus life. “Within roughly 13 hours, we did a lot of concert class talks, and making sure the word went out
[…] we had to manage space, security, and venue. It was quite hectic.”
Almost 3,000 people attended the make-up concert.
As student Khan puts it, the concert itself was “insane”.
“He is a legend; you got a legend.”

Despite being over 20 kilometres apart, York and Ryerson University have entered into a partnership this fall to exchange grad school students for select studies.
The Reciprocal Interdisciplinary Studies Opportunity will allow York’s Osgoode Hall Law School students to take courses at the Yeates School of Graduate Studies at Ryerson, and vice-versa.
The exchange—which will combine York’s legal expertise and Ryerson’s applied education—will be launching this fall semester. A limited number of students each semester will be allowed to enrol in courses at the host university, but will pay tuition to their home university.
Though the courses are complementary, Ronda Bessner, assistant dean of the JD Program at Osgoode, encourages students to take advantage of the opportunity and the expertise of the partner university.
“A maximum of five students [from each institution] each semester from Osgoode and from Ryerson-Yeates will be permitted to enrol in designated courses,” she notes.
Selected students will be allowed to register for up to one full year or two half-year courses from a list and will get transfer credits based on a “pass” or “fail” on their transcript.
Osgoode students are impressed by the new exchange and commend the positive addition.
“Given that a law degree is so transferable, it definitely makes sense to give students access to some other areas of study that are likely to have some crossover with law,” says first-year law student Laura Fraser.
However, she doesn’t think commuting downtown is practical for her.
“I can’t see myself enrolling in Ryerson courses just because of the proximity issue, “ Fraser says. “Being at York all day, I don’t know how feasible it would be to commute all the way downtown for a single credit.”

The Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O) released a report card last week grading each party based on promises and platforms, giving the New Democrat Party (NDP) the highest grade of B+ overall. The NDP took top marks for its promises on tuition fees, student debt, funding, and research.
The Liberal party, however, maintains that the attractive planks of the NDP platform have not been properly accounted for.
According to a media release sent out on September 26, the Liberals state that “according to the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the NDP have promised that, if elected, they will raise the per-student funding to more than the national average. That’s a $1-billion promise. Every year. But in the costing document the NDP released yesterday, there wasn’t a single penny set aside to back up that promise.”

Chairperson for the CFS-O Sandy Husdon, however, points out that all parties have made unfounded promises, and that this doesn’t change the NDP’s grade on the report.
“What the NDP stated to us when they made that promise was that, if elected, they would talk to each of the institutions about what kind of funding shortfall they have and what kind of funding they need and to develop a framework to get that money to the institutions,” she says.
Overall, Hudson says the goal of the CFS-O report cards are to “boil down […] what the crux of these parties really are.”
“We think it’s really important for students to know how the election will be affecting them, and what kinds of things can and might change as a result of the election.”

2012-04-04,York,Palestine,"How carpe diem led Alex Braff to the world-renowned film festival with his short film Framed 
Justin Li
Contributor
For Alex Braff, an East Asian studies and philosophy double major in second year, applying his academic disciplines has helped him accomplish something most filmmakers only dream of: getting his film screened at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.
Braff’s 10-minute short film Framed documents the strain and labour that writer’s block can have on relationships and the ability to create new material. Although it may sound like a fusion of Spike Jonze’s Adaptation with Federico Fellini’s 8½, Braff is quick to point out that, although depicted from a writer’s perspective, the film is more about “creative block” in general, something that “everyone can relate to.”
For Braff, creative block is a universal concept. Whether at home or at school, writing screenplays or writing essays, the process of formulating thoughts into tangible results is an everyday struggle, and in the enterprise to overcome, we often alienate those around us.
“When you sit down with your notebook, it’s just you and your notebook,” says Braff. “There’s nothing else in the world except those two things. And when you’re absorbed into your world, it’s very difficult to bring someone else in and to see anything other than what’s in your focus.”
Braff insists that his philosophy background has helped him see and approach the film differently.
“In a lot of cases, a person only sees things one way,” says Braff. “Philosophy allows you to think outside the box and see different viewpoints.” Because he was taught to look at things differently and from varying perspectives, Braff describes how he can add fresh, creative, and unconventional insight. The result, he says, is a more nuanced and layered film.
In the making of Framed, however, Braff had a very different story to tell. He says the film was a byproduct of his mantra for seizing the day and the begetting of a beautiful friendship with the film’s director, John Virtue.
“The only reason this film was my project and the director’s, is because I’ve known the director for a long time and we’re good friends,” Braff explains. Virtue sent him a copy of the script while he was in Japan at the time, and he instantly liked it. Braff replied by saying the pair could turn the script into something meaningful.
In way of offering advice for budding filmmakers, Braff says that if a friend comes up to you with a good idea for a movie, give them five to 10 minutes.
“If someone approaches you with a great idea, don’t say you’re too busy for it. Take a moment and look at it,” suggests Braff. “Framed all started because a friend sent me a document that he had written out of fun.”
To Braff, having fun is what life, and university, is all about. University, he says, should be about meeting people with great ideas and adding your own creativity on top of that. If he wasn’t at York, Braff admits, the process of making a film would never have crossed his mind.
Braff says networking is the most important thing.
“At the end of the day, it’s who you know and how you know them,” he says. “Six degrees of separation ends up working for you.”
His personal convictions and hard work have paid off, culminating in a confirmation email from the Cannes Film Festival that booked him, his director, and their film, a ticket to France.
“It was the best day of my life,” Braff says.
But just because he has booked a ticket to Cannes, it doesn’t mean Braff will be taking a break from his producing duties. Along with his upcoming exams, his schedule is full.
He and Virtue are currently in the process of securing venues to screen their film with at the TIFF Lightbox—and on campus—before they embark for Cannes.
On top of that, Braff sees Cannes as a great opportunity to generate interest for the film and to connect with possible distributors, producers, and other eminent members of the film industry. When asked whether or not he thinks Framed will win any awards, Braff says that producing the film was an achievement in and of itself.

According to calendars created by the Mayans (an advanced Mesoamerican civilization that existed from 2000 BCE until their destruction by the Spanish in 1697 CE), the end of humanity will come December 21, 2012 when some catastrophe is predicted to demolish the world. Many theorize that the end of the world will come from astronomical events, from a “killer” solar flare to a huge asteroid.
Others, like Young, however, theorize that the end of humanity may just come from a nuclear war.
Young started preparing for Doomsday after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, even after peace was maintained. His thoughts on surviving things like nuclear war stayed with him throughout his childhood and even now.
“I wrote a short story when I was 12 about my age group in school withstanding the Soviet invasion,” says Young who has read about hundreds of wars and deadly disasters. “So things like that were on my mind as I grew up.”
Young is not alone though. The preparation-centric fiction he writes and publishes on the internet has a readership of well over 10,000 and the number of people who have started preparing seems to be increasing as days go by.
“There are thousands upon thousands of other people doing their best to get ready for anything from a loss of a job, to medical emergencies, all the way up to Doomsday,” says Young.
The amount of people preparing for the end has grown big enough that there is a network dedicated to helping them known as the American Preppers Network (APN).
The network defines these “preppers” as a group of people who have started preparing for Doomsday, or TEOTWAWKI—The End of the World as We Know It. There are “preppers” in the United States and in parts of Canada, Australia, and Italy, according to Tom Martin, founder and chief visionary officer of the APN
The network already has over seven thousand “likes” on their Facebook page and has gained the attention of organizations like the BBC and Popular Mechanics.
The way Young and Martin both see it is that the world right now is not very sustainable, whether you look at it from a financial point of view or an environmental one. The radical weather patterns and the frequent occurrences of natural disasters around the world indicate to them that something big is going to happen which will either destroy the world or change the world that we know today.
Which is why Young says that it’s important to be prepared for not only “Doomsday,” but for accidents and disasters which can occur at any time.
While Young does not believe the popular Mayan prophecies about the world ending by the end of this year, he does however, believe that several natural cycles are reaching either peaks or lows, depending on the type of cycle, with the sunspot cycle one of the key ones, indicating that some bad natural disasters will occur.
When asked what kind of advice Young has for university students, he suggested that we forget about preparing for “Doomsday” for the moment and make preparations for basic human needs first.
Martin’s advice reflected the views of Young: “Students need to learn how to budget and manage their finances since things like credit cards and loans will not be useful when a disaster strikes. Students should learn how to make their own meals and make sure they have enough food stocked up for at least three months.”
Some preppers may follow the Mayan calendar, but they all have one common goal: to be prepared on a daily basis just in case they are faced with a natural disaster of some sort.

The streets are decrepit in Aida, a Palestinian refugee camp located just two kilometres north of Bethlehem. There are crumbling walls, piles of rubble, and garbage surrounding them all. The men and women who live in these poor conditions are victims of prejudice. This is where Tyler Koverko, a York law student, finds himself with a pit in his stomach.
Koverko, a second-year criminal law student at Osgoode, had a lot of interest in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but he had no genuine understanding of the situation before visiting Bethlehem.
However, last summer, he was awarded $5,000 to plan a trip to Jerusalem where he saw firsthand what the long-standing conflict looks like.
Koverko left for Jerusalem having no partiality for either side. He considered himself an interested third party. With a general understanding, he wanted to better comprehend the conflict and also experience what everyday life was like. Being stationed primarily in Israel, he decided to go out and see what waited for him. That was when he saw Aida.
Aida was established in 1950, and holds over 4,000 refugees. It is just one of 19 refugee camps in the West Bank. There are 62 Palestinian refugee camps across Jordan, Syria, Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon. These camps house more than four million refugees that were displaced as a result of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.
These people were either forced out of their homes or chose to leave the country.
Koverko was able to see much more than what is reported in the North American media. Even though he began this trip with an open mind towards both sides, biases were unavoidable. However, seeing firsthand a decrepit Palestinian refugee camp and victims of suicide bombings, Koverko felt these biases “beaten out of him,” leaving behind the difficulty to find a “human side” of the issue.
These people were not characters in a movie; they have to continue to live this way everyday. Koverko was surprised to discover that not just the camp’s leaders, but also the children spoke fluent English. Not only did they speak English, most of them were fairly sophisticated and bright—welcoming him wholeheartedly. He saw “human beings with souls behind all the political madness.” It became clear how irresponsible it is to generalize an entire group of people that are caught up in politics that expand far beyond their power.
A major surprise for him was the amicability of Jerusalem.
This trip was very important for Koverko, but he does not want you to simply take his word for it.
“This experience was awesome, unforgettable, a slap in the face and it opened up a major world conflict to me,” he says. These same opportunities are available to all students who wish to take advantage of them. “I learned immediately that you can’t understand why people believe so strongly in the cause, until you know the history.”
Jerusalem was “a life changing experience,” for Koverko.
“Whatever I thought was immediately transformed through personal experience,” he says.
Koverko says he left Canada with little bias towards either the Israelis or Palestinians and came back with even less. It was no longer “this group or this group,” but simply people caught up in defending their rights and beliefs that they hold so sacred.

2013-03-27,York,Palestine,"Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York opposed to endorsement
The York Federation of Students has endorsed the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign at York, causing an uproar from those who disagree with its aims.
This decision was made during a meeting called by the YFS’ executive members held at the Underground on March 21, where a motion was put forth to endorse the BDS campaign, resulting in a vote of 18-2 in favour of its endorsement.
Approximately 200 undergraduate students attended the meeting.
Safiyah Husein, vp equity of the YFS, says the BDS movement is a form of “international solidarity with the Palestinian call for justice, equality, and an end to the occupation” that “puts pressure on institutions to divest from companies currently funding weaponry for the Israeli military.”
Over 5,000 students signed a petition asking the YFS to discuss the BDS issue, says Husein.
Jessica Cherkasov, member of Hillel at York, alleges no one from Hillel at York or Hasbara @ York was officially informed of the meeting, the motion, or of the meeting’s agenda. They only found out about the meeting the day before it was scheduled when a member of Hillel at York overheard from the YFS that it would be happening, she says.
While both Students Against Israeli Apartheid and Hillel at York members had a chance to speak at the meeting, Cherkasov says she would have liked to have been informed earlier.
“I would have preferred that the YFS, as a body that represents all undergraduate students, inform Hillel that they wanted to have a conversation on the issue, just so the board members could have an equal opportunity to hear from both sides,” says Cherkasov.
Vanessa Hunt, YFS president, says the YFS by-laws were followed in calling a board meeting.
“The BDS campaign has been passed at [other universities], so we thought we should bring this to York,” says Johanna May Black, member of SAIA. “We did research last year about what companies York was invested in and we thought this would be a good way of raising awareness.”
The BDS campaign specifically calls on the university to withdraw its investments from companies,—like Hewlett Packard, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin—which allegedly profit from Israeli human rights violations and war crimes.
As of November 18, 2012, York had 580 shares in Northrop Grumman and 290,600 shares in BAE Systems Group, but no holdings in the other companies named, according to Trudy Pound-Curtis, York’s assistant vp of finance and chief financial officer.
The campaign also demands the return to the pre-1967 border and the removal of the Israeli West Bank barrier, improving the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.
Members of SAIA have been calling on York’s student body to endorse the campaign since September 2012. They celebrated the YFS’s endorsement after the meeting at around 1:45 p.m. with a march around campus, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “victory.”
The Graduate Students Association at York endorsed the BDS campaign on November 16, 2012, as have other student organizations including the Concordia Graduate Students’ Association and the University of Toronto Graduate Student Union.
Hillel at York and Hasbara @ York condemned YFS’s endorsement of the BDS campaign on behalf of York’s undergraduate students and issued a statement through the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.
In the statement, Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara @ York, says Hasbara is “extremely disappointed” that the YFS passed this resolution. He alleges the YFS is “blacklisting and boycotting Israelis.” Lax also alleges the YFS’ resolution is “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”
Cherkasov says as a union representing the interests of 55,000 undergraduates, the YFS should not take a political stance on an issue that does not affect all students on campus.
“I understand that we all have our personal opinions, but the fact that [the YFS] took a stance on a very touchy issue for Israeli and Palestinian students, I think that was inappropriate,” says Cherkasov. “Now, they have marginalized a group of students and created a hostile environment because they adopted the BDS movement.”
Lax echoed Cherkasov’s opinion, saying the YFS should not take a political stance that could divide the campus.
He says 4,000 students have signed a petition against the GSA’s endorsement of BDS, created in November 2012 by Hasbara @ York and Hillel at York.
“It showed a substantial amount of students, our constituents, didn’t want the YFS to endorse this motion and didn’t want them them taking a position on the Palestine-Israel conflict,” he says.
Husein says the YFS took a “principled stance” on this issue, which does not mean everyone should agree with their support for the BDS campaign.
She says if any students have questions or concerns about this endorsement, she would be happy to meet with them to discuss it.
“Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important,” says Husein.
Husein says to remain silent on issues of basic equality is often a tacit endorsement of injustice.
“We engage in anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, and anti-sexism campaigns not because they are popular, but because they are right, and they are important to our members,” she says.
Joanne Rider of York media says university administration has not been contacted by the YFS or any other student groups regarding this campaign.
SAIA will be holding a protest March 27 in Vari Hall at 1 p.m. to call on university administration to address their demands.

UPDATED 9:00 p.m. March 27 — York admin has yet to issue security bulletin or email to students about incidents
Toronto Police have arrested a man after two women reported indecent acts in a lab at York University.
Joanne Rider of York media says the occurrences happened in a research lab located in the Petrie Science and Engineering Building.
On Wednesday, March 13 and Thursday, March 21, a male student from another university, taking a co-op program at York, allegedly performed an indecent act in a lab, while staring at a female York student who was present, police say.
According to police, the accused male was the same in both incidents, but the female victims were different.
Police say there may be more victims.
As of 9:00 p.m. on March 27, York administration has not yet sent out a security bulletin email to students informing them of these incidents and a security bulletin has not been posted on the York Security Services website.
Rider says administration is in the process of  directly advising students by email.
“Given the circumstances of this case, communication was focused on those who may have interacted with the individual,” she says. “Dean Crow advised the Graduate Students’ Association yesterday afternoon of the incidents and provided the [Toronto Police Services] communication.  Science and Engineering faculty and staff were also advised.”
John Fletcher, 19, of Maple, Ontario faces two charges of performing indecent acts.
He is scheduled to appear in court at 1000 Finch Avenue West on Tuesday, April 30, 2013.

2014-03-26,York,Palestine,"Walking through Vari Hall, fourth-year psychology major Tamika Johnson picks up a York region newspaper. Messages of gun violence, theft, and other crimes run rampant through its pages, with the finger of disapproval constantly pointed towards members of her own community, Jane and Finch.
Johnson skims the pages with a familiar feeling of dismay. The picture of Jane and Finch’s youth population is painted clearly in the paper’s narrative: troublesome, delinquent, and even criminal.
Johnson, 27, was born in Jamaica. She is a former resident of the Jane and Finch area. The community has always held a special place in her heart, but it is aggrieved by the constant stereotyping of its inhabitants.
Perpetuated by popular media, the “danger” myth of Jane and Finch is widespread—even amongst York students and faculty, a population situated mere minutes away. Johnson recognizes that a communication barrier between York and the Jane and Finch community has resulted in a damaging reputation for the neighbourhood.
“I think the relationship between York and the Jane and Finch community needs a lot of work. It’s an institution versus [the Jane and Finch community’s] youth, and youth in the media are either seen as unable to represent themselves or as rebellious,” says Johnson. 
Johnson has taken a stand against the stigmatization of her heart and home by founding Boss Magazine. While others dwell on mainstream media stories of gun violence and poverty, Johnson works ardently to inspire a better informed public.
The youth-led Boss aims to dispel the danger myth of the neighbourhood by showcasing positive activities of the Jane and Finch community and its vibrant youth population. The publication covers a range of lifestyle and fashion topics to appeal to a diverse audience.

“There was nothing for us to voice our own views of what we like, what’s really happening in the community, and the creative vision that youth have,” says Johnson on the pre-Boss Magazine era.
Johnson has attempted to engage the York population by reaching out to students, specifically those interested in fashion and business, and encouraging them to get involved with the magazine.
“[York] shouldn’t be a separate entity from the area,” she says. “It is part of the Jane and Finch community, it should have a mandate to engage.”
Johnson continues, “There are a lot of students that are [at York] for writing, and I wanted to give them a platform to [promote] their own talents.”
Currently, Johnson is still looking for more York students to work with Boss. She wants the magazine to be a vehicle for talent and to bring in youth to be a part of a project they can be proud of.
Johnson is extremely proud of her accomplishments with the magazine thus far. For her, the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Boss Magazine from the Jane and Finch community is its own reward.
“People from the community opened the magazine and saw themselves,” she says. 
Johnson feels strongly that reconnecting York and the Jane and Finch community will be mutually beneficial because their proximity allows them to share resources.
Lorna Schwartzentruber, manager of York University’s Community Engagement Centre, is deeply focused on repairing the relationship between the two communities as well.
“Most understandings of the Jane and Finch community don’t reflect its reality. Stereotypes have been processed year after year, and students don’t often take the time to experience the community, which perpetuates a power imbalance,” says Schwartzentruber. “We need to challenge some of those stereotypes by getting a more holistic view of the community.”
The Community Engagement Centre is making efforts to strengthen university’s ties to the community by making York a better neighbour.
“York has a social responsibility as a large organization to be a good neighbour, and contribute in positive ways to the community it is a part of,” says Schwartzentruber. 
Their “Student Orientation to Working in Jane and Finch,” for example, will pilot this September in an effort to unpack some of the issues faced by this community for students so they may better understand systemic oppression in marginalized communities and be able to engage with the community without fear or judgment.
Schwartzentruber strongly feels that this is just the beginning of uniting York with Jane and Finch. “Through community engagement, we can increase the learning potential for students, while simultaneously strengthening the community,” she says.
Natalie Coulter, a communications studies professor at York, is another strong advocate for community engagement. Through her classes, she has given her students the opportunity to participate in various community engagement projects with different organizations in the Jane and Finch region.
“I hope [York students] have a new understanding of [the] richness of the community that goes beyond school,” says Coulter. “I hope when students leave [York], they are proud that they both went to York University and that York University is in the Jane and Finch community.”
“The separation is not just physical—it’s also in terms of knowing and understanding the community,” she says. “I realize that there are incredibly rich resources in this community that represent a huge array of opportunities for students.”
Projects like Johnson’s and Coulter’s provide a channel of communication between the two communities that students can get involved in.
Johnson is amazed that Coulter’s students have become involved with the magazine, and this exemplifies how Boss is one step closer to reaching this common goal.
Although Johnson is excited about the current progress and attention to these initiatives, she realizes there is much more work to be done, and that the process will be an arduous one.
As a York student and a Jane and Finch native, the burden of the stigma against her community is her own, and it pains her to see her school and her home at odds when the media so often targets them both. But she is hopeful that more people will join her fight for change. When that happens, the students of York and the people that make up Jane and Finch may stand together in a celebration of diversity, talent, and a sense of unity.

There’s been a dialogue about whether switching to an online voting system would be a better way forward for York Federation of Students elections.
To me, this is sort of like a debate on whether or not you should find a place to live by looking at pictures online and sending your first and last deposit by email transfer or by doing your research and then going in person to ensure you are getting what you’re paying for. Sure, the former is convenient and might save some time, but the risks are far too great for my liking.
We have seen far too many examples of elections going horribly wrong when online voting is employed, and these many instances of corruption give me doubts about the true integrity of the online elections.
The Western Gazette reported that in 2012, their university students’ council elections had been hacked by a former student, “who took advantage of a weakness in the site,” and that all 10,000 votes were invalidated, requiring a re-vote to be held two weeks later.
Similarly, in 2013, “poorly-timed human error lead to voters being presented with the wrong choices.”
At the University of British Columbia, in an online vote held in 2010, The Ubyssey reported that people were able to log in, clone the voting page, and submit fake ballots. This resulted in 731 ballots being submitted from a single IP address, alerting the elections committee that something was wrong.
Unsurprisingly, the votes were thrown out, but whoever received the extra 731 votes could have won if the flaw wasn’t discovered. And of course, students were a little angry at the system that allowed this to happen.
Recently, Queen’s University students saw their fall referendum postponed by a day because a miscommunication between the software behind their online voting system and their email server resulted in 6,000 email ballot logins not being sent out.
I think you see the trend here. The list goes on.
Let’s also acknowledge that in Canada, our federal, municipal and provincial elections operate on paper ballots.
The paper ballot voting system does not work at the touch of a button, but at least we know it’s a system that allows the integrity of the elections to stay intact.
At the end of the day, I like knowing I can have my space to vote without someone looming over my computer, that the candidates can’t hack in and vote for themselves 1,000 times over, and that people won’t be prevented from accessing the system due to glitches.
You can keep your “convenient” shortcut—I would much rather spend the time on ensuring quality.

I was banned from York University almost a year ago for exercising my freedom of expression by organizing and participating in a peaceful protest for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions and against York’s investments in weapons manufacturers.
The administration singled me out as an instigator, and they now may be attempting to paint me as an outsider to the York community.
Despite the dubious claim that I was banned for disrupting classes during the protest (York’s own local adjudicator found no disruption), I initially received a letter from VP Students Janet Morrison stating: “The University does not give permission for members of the public—including alumni—to enter our campus lands for protests or demonstrations, or to engage in forms of speech or action that are, in any way, racist or that advocate racism, violence, or hatred.”
Aside from the fact that alumni participate in on-campus protests regularly, Morrison’s statement raises the question of whether I was banned for disruption, for my political beliefs, or because I’m Palestinian. The fact that York Security threatened another Palestinian alumnus with arrest and trespass makes the question more pressing.
Moreover, former director of Security Services, Rob Kilfoyle told Office of Student Conflict Resolution Director Debbie Hansen by email that although my status as an alumnus complicates things, he “would love to” trespass me.
In another instance of disregard for the role of alumni, when SAIA met with the administration, VP Academic Rhonda Lenton refused to include me because “the offer was made to meet with current members of the York community.”
I feel compelled to state my history at York, for the record.
I was a student of psychology and political science from 2001 to 2007. The attacks of September 11 occurred after I arrived to Canada and following my frosh week.
My world was changed.
I became radicalized as bombs fell over Afghanistan and Iraq, and as the second Palestinian uprising was crushed under blood-soaked tank treads and the rubble of thousands of demolished Palestinian homes.
That’s when I joined the anti-war movement and, through the mentoring of a group of Iraqi students, honed the skills of activism.
I was co-founder of Amnesty International at York, a member of Now End War and Sanctions on Iraq, an executive member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, and a member of the Grass-Roots Anti-Imperialist Network.
I took part in the barricading of the entrances to campus on March 10, 2003, and helped to organize lectures, film screenings, and protests.
I worked for the Student Christian Movement at York and for the York University Telemail Program. I was elected to the York Federation of Students as the Stong College director, submitted articles for Excalibur and the YU Free Press, sang with the York University Choir, and performed with Vanier College Productions.
I experienced the corporatization of campus, repressive changes to university policies, and the numerous sanctions imposed on outspoken students and faculty as a result of those changes.
I went to pub nights when Founder’s Cock&Bull and Calumet’s On the Edge were more popular than The Underground. I lived at Stong Residence and Assiniboine. I walked through the graffiti-laden, weed-scented underground tunnels before they were closed, pulled all-nighters alone at the Student Centre and watched the sun rise from rooftops.
After I lost my home in Palestine, the York community became another home to me. York and I even share the same birthday. So rest assured, I am here to stay, and attempts at erasing my history at York University have already failed.

BDS is a campaign that marginalizes Jewish and pro-Israeli students. Whether or not you agree with their values, they have legitimate opinions from a different perspective. They are paying students trying to get an education. You’ve already paid your dues and you are preventing them from getting an education. Move on.
And fight your cause somewhere else.
You’ve got to get rid of this “us vs. them” mentality. It’s extremely unproductive and totally misrepresents the work of these activists at York University.
This is not an issue of Palestine vs. Israel. This is an issue of whether a public institution which ostensibly promotes itself as an advocate for social justice and human rights issues uses tuition dollars to invest in bombs, guns and other weapon paraphernalia to kill other human beings across the world.
It is a matter of morality.
To distort the BDS argument as simply, “marginalization of pro-Israeli students” misses the point entirely and confines the divestment argument to an entirely self-imposed narrative that comes from one’s own insecurity and fear of the “other”.
There is only one side, that is humanity.
Without a doubt York is an organization feasting on our tax dollars, with low educated lifers making 6 figures and completely unqualified for the positions they occupy. Disgusting. 
[su_heading size=”21″]Witnesses are now being called to the stand in the trial of Brian Dickson, the man accused of killing York student Qian Liu in her Village home in 2011.[/su_heading]
On the second day of the trial, the jury heard several witness accounts of what happened the day Liu’s body was first discovered in her Aldwinkle Heights residence.
Faquan Zeng, Liu’s landlord at the time; Alvin Yuhalogarasan, a paramedic who responded; and Toronto police sergeant Eric Dugan took the stand on March 25 to explain what they saw on April 15, 2011.
Zeng explained through a translator that he had received a message stating Liu might be in danger before rushing over to the residence to check if she was okay.
In her opening statements, Crown attorney Christine Pirraglia outlined how Liu’s former boyfriend (who had seen her struggle with a man over webcam the night before) had contacted her friends.
They eventually relayed the information to a tenant in the house, who then contacted Zeng.
[su_pullquote align=”right”]“We shouted Qian’s name, [but] we got no response, so we used the [master] key,” said Zeng’s translator.[/su_pullquote]
Zeng says he shouted Liu’s name a few more times and then opened the door and saw Liu lying on the floor.
According to Pirraglia, Liu’s body was faced down on the floor, naked from the mid-chest down with a nightgown pulled up around her chest. The Crown also noted Liu’s body had a white dry substance located on the upper thigh and groin area when found.
It was later determined that the substance was semen.

Yuhalogarasan, a paramedic who responded, says after examining her arm, he determined resuscitation would be futile.
“She was pronounced dead with rigor mortis,” says Yuhalogarasan, explaining rigor mortis is when joints become stiff and is a clear sign of death.
The Crown attorney stated on March 24 that Liu had died from mechanical asphyxia involving some form of neck compression.
Police sergeant Dugan explained on the stand that Liu was lying face down with blood coming from each side of her head, matching the photos displayed in court on March 24.
In the busy courtroom, Liu’s family listened in with earphones, as a translator helped them understand every single word said in the trial. The family stayed silent as each witness described what they saw in the Village home.
In her opening statement, Pirraglia revealed more details on how Liu was allegedly killed.
Around 1 a.m., Liu was chatting online with her former boyfriend Xian Meng in Beijing. She heard a knock on her door, said Pirraglia. Meng then saw a man attempt to hug Liu before pushing his way into her bedroom and knocking her webcam off the computer.
“He shoved Ms. Liu causing her to fall off camera in the direction of her bed,” said Pirraglia. “Mr. Meng, no longer able to see any images, heard Ms. Liu saying the word ‘no’ in both English and Mandarin.”
Pirraglia said after two muffled bangs, Meng never heard Liu’s voice again, and before the screen was shut, he saw the man approach the computer, naked from the waist down.
Robert Nuttall, the lawyer representing Dickson, asked the jury to return with a verdict of manslaughter, stating at the beginning of the trial, “This is not a case of who did it; this is a what happened case.”
He also stated that the jury members should pay close attention to the forensic evidence.
Dickson’s trial is expected to last three to four weeks with a 14-member jury.
A doctor who examined the body is expected to testify as a witness on March 25, along with Detective-Sergeant Frank Skubic, a lead investigator in the case.

[su_heading size=”21″]Students and faculty members were agitated last week when a widespread network outage shut down York’s web-based services. [/su_heading]MyMail, Moodle, the York homepage, and Flex accounts were all affected by the outage, which started at 7:20 p.m. on March 19.
Christopher Russel, director of ICT infrastructure and information security officer at York, says the outage was caused by a breaker being tripped during inclimate weather on the evening of March 19.
This caused a power outage on the Keele campus, and University Information Technology supply units failed. Some elements of York’s core network then lost power.
“With some exceptions, nearly all services were affected since they rely on the network,” says Russel.
“In some cases the service itself was still functioning, but it wouldn’t have been possible to connect to it. Parts of the network, including internet access for Keele campus student residences, were not directly impacted and continued to function.”
Pardis Aliakbarkhani, a third-year professional writing and anthropology student, says, “I had an assignment due that night through Moodle, and I was locked out of everything York-related. It was really frustrating.”
Between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 20, nearly all services affected by the outage were restored. Some services however, were not fully restored until midday on March 20.
Russel says a network error would not allow for correct diagnosis of network problems right away, and technical teams referred to a process of elimination to figure out what the problems were.
“In all, over 800 servers and systems were checked on and brought back into service,” says Russel.
Russel says scenarios like this have been successfully tested in the past.
UIT is currently working with the network vendor to ensure this problem is fully understood to reduce chances of this happening again.

The election voting period for CUPE 3903, the union that represents York’s contract faculty, teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and research assistants, has been extended to the end of this week as neither candidate for chair received more than 50 per cent of the votes.
The third candidate was dropped from the ballot since he did not have enough votes, leaving only Faiz Ahmed and Christina Rousseau running for chair. According to CUPE 3903’s bylaws, the union must have a run-off election for this position.
The run-off election runs until March 28.

Three York employees were arrested in relation to a fraud that occurred at York over seven years.
The fraud, alleged to have occurred between November 2005 and October 2012, is estimated to have cost the university $1.6 million. Police allege the employees issued fake invoices to the university.
Toronto Police announced the arrests on March 20. This is an ongoing investigation, and police expect more arrests to be made and further charges to be laid.
Vittoria Caparello is being charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, Yossi Zaidfeld is charged with one count of fraud over $5,000, and Melissa Caparello faces a charge of possession of property obtained by crime of under $5,000.
Malissa Caparello is still employed as an administrative assistant in the dean’s office at the faculty of environmental studies and has been employed by the university since January 2005.
In regards to the future of her employment status, Joanne Rider of York media says the university is currently doing a review of the matter, and once a decision has been made, appropriate action will be taken.
“As soon as the university was informed that there was a suspicion of fraud, we did two things: we informed the police and we engaged an external firm to conduct a forensic audit,” says Rider.
“The university has already recovered the money estimated to be lost plus additional costs since the university initially found out about the alleged fraud in October of 2012,” she says.
York was notified of the fraud when a whistleblower came forward with the information around the same time the university implemented new policies and procedures to detect fraud, says Rider. 
These policies were developed following a 2012 case in which two former York executives were accused of taking part in a massive phony invoice scheme and of defrauding the university of $1.2 million.
The Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation of Funds Policy developed as a result helped strengthen the university’s controls against fraud. The changes included an updated whistleblower policy, a conflict of interest policy, and the implementation of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment initiative.
“So it was at that time an individual came forward and indicated that they suspected suspicious activity,” says Rider.
As part of this policy, the identity of the whistleblower remains confidential.

Prominent York faculty and community members spoke in the Student Centre on March 25 to publicize alleged violations of student rights and civil liberties by York’s administration.
Professors David McNally, John Greyson, and Penni Stewart, as well as CUPE 3903 Chairperson Faiz Ahmed and alumnus Hamman Farah all spoke at the event.
Farah, who was banned from campus in the spring of 2013 following a rally held by Students Against Israeli Apartheid, says administrators cannot be allowed to continue to intimidate and harass students in unrestrained manner. 
Farah also points to York’s revocation of SAIA’s club status on March 27, 2013, as an example of this harassment and intimidation from York’s administration.
Despite being banned from campus, Farah still spoke at the event.
Joanne Rider of York media responded to Excalibur’s request for comment via email, stating that freedom of expressions is one of York’s guiding principles.
“Members of the York community have the right to express their views and to test and challenge ideas, provided they do so within the law, and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner that does not disrupt academic activity,” Rider continues. 
She also adds that York’s responsibility is to protect the academic environment, while ensuring all community members abide by agreed upon standards of conduct, which allow students to pursue their studies “free from unwelcome disruptions.”
“York has and will continue to ensure these policies are communicated, understood, and adhered to in a consistent manner,” says Rider.
The event was not prevented by York administration, as it was approved by the Student Centre board and included participation from the York Federation of Students.
Farah is pushing for York to amend their Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Senate Policy on Disruptive and/or Harassing Behaviour in Academic Situations, and the Temporary Use of University Space policy to reflect Canadian values of freedom of expression.
“Free speech and free assembly are important to students,” he says. “This is where we learn the most about these basic democratic values, and where the most opportunities arise to exercise them.”
David McNally, a political science professor, spoke out in support of SAIA and Farah. Hereferenced a letter signed by 150 faculty members urging the administration to recognize civil rights violations and begin amending policies on the use of student space and the student code of conduct.
“You cannot maintain any of kind of democratic culture in a society unless basic rights to express opinions and assemble on behalf of those opinions is secure,” says McNally.
He cites the treatment of SAIA and Farah as a specific problem within York’s democratic culture. McNally also believes the York administration is attempting to “roll back the gains that student and social movements have made in regards to free speech and free assembly, particularly those with dissenting opinions.”
“Speaking as a political scientist, I don’t see how I can go into my classes and try to transmit to students the importance of basic civil rights in a democratic society, and then not speak out when I see my own administration violating them,” he says.
McNally says the event will only have been successful if it contributes to increasing pressure on the York administration to “get serious about civil rights and student rights.”

That is ridicuous. The author fails to mention that SAIA is by the the most harassing and intimidating (well they try) club on campus. Outrageous to protest in a lecture hall and disrupt class, that WE PAY FOR AND NEED TO GRADUATE, and then get the appropriate punishment as agreed upon in the contracts with the school on behavior codes. And then play the victim? Whack
SAIA harasses students (the white poppy thing on Remembrance day) and administrators (screamed violently and disrupted York’s Birthday and insulted President Shoukouri). Not to mention violently barricading Jewish students in the Hillel office in 2009 where the police had to be called. Peaceful protests?? get your head examined

Video by Ashlee Mitchell 
When I started my term as editor-in-chief last May, I was pretty naive.
The vision I pitched in my job interview was one of Excalibur as a driving force for change on campus.
This has proven to be difficult though. The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.
Excalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.
When they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.
Whether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.
One reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.
While I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.
But it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.
Some believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.
Have students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?
There are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.
I’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.
There are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.
When it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.
Students Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.
But more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.
If you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.
This year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause. I just wish I’d had more to talk about.

As a Founders grad, Student Council, & Excalibur active participant from the early 70’s, I’ve recently been disappointed with your online feedback procedures and the lack of commitment to fix such a simple technological problem. Maybe this has now been addressed and If this comment is accepted I’ll be encouraged to contribute more. 
Historically York has been known as the school where activism never stops.
So why have we seen such little of it recently? Protests seem to have all but disappeared from our campus, and this isn’t necessarily a good thing.
Has the school really managed to quiet its students?
According to OPIRG-York, an organization that conducts research, advocacy, and lobbying, as well as educational and media campaigns for social justice, “the decline of student activism has a direct correlation with the corporatization of York.”
With increased costs and budget cuts, York has basically become a big business, they say.
“York University was once an open institution that was used as a safe space to express different views, but unfortunately, the university’s administration has made clear their views on protests and the consequences the students will face if participating in such activities.”
We’ve decided to take a look back into the Excalibur archives at large student protests that refl ect York University’s once active and radical student political engagement.
We also highlight a few recent events that suggest while activism may be dormant on our campus, it isn’t dead.

A total of 1,596 York staff and faculty members have made it onto the 2013 Ontario Sunshine List.
The list discloses the salaries of people who earn over $100,000, working for public institutions in
Ontario. Included on York’s list are professors, librarians, program directors, deans, sports coaches, and senior staff .
Topping the list is York President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri who earns $478,405.94 as his yearly salary, and another $8,455.72 in taxable benefits.
Shoukri is the second-highest paid public sector employee within the university portion of the Sunshine List, coming in just behind Western University’s President and Vice-Chancellor Amit Chakma, who earns $479,600.04 and $41,467.28 in taxable benefits.
Brenda Spotton Visano, a professor of economics at York, sees a tension between the public’s right to know and the right to privacy for public sector employees.
“Should we reveal everybody’s income? I don’t think so,” says Visano.
She favours the idea of transparency, but would also like to see the salaries of employees of private corporations.
The Sunshine List has been published since the Ontario government passed the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act in 1996. Its purpose is to encourage a more open system of government.
Visano adds that the list should be adjusted, as the $100,000 cut- off was implemented in 1996, and suggests it should be moved closer to $150,000.
The list itself allows the public to compare individuals and their respective compensations, providing more information on how tax dollars are being spent.
The Sunshine List also includes employees of the Ontario government, crown agencies, municipalities, hospitals, boards of public health, school boards, colleges, Hydro One, Ontario Power Generation, and other public sector employers.

York President and Vice Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri recently met with Toronto Police Services to discuss improving security on campus after the March 6 Student Centre shooting.
The meeting, which took place on March 18, was closed to the public. A full debrief of the incident was conducted, and recommendations were proposed.
Shoukri and police agreed that for the remainder of the academic term, York would provide enhanced security patrols in “key public areas in and around the central core of Keele campus” during evening and night hours.
“Given the nature of the recent occurrence in the Student Centre, the enhanced patrols will focus on prime public locations on campus,” says Rob Castle, senior executive officer for the vp finance and administration.
“Of course, locations of the patrols can be adjusted if there is a need to do so, as the enhanced patrols will occur during evening and night hours.”
Patrols will be done by both Toronto Police and York Security officers. Only the Keele campus will see an increase in security presence.
Shoukri and Toronto Police also resolved to strengthen their ongoing relationship and the neighbourhood community response team.
Additionally, “An expanded campaign will encourage students, staff, and faculty to download the [YorkU Mobile Safety App], which will be a key element in emergency communications,” says Joanne Rider of York media.
With over 11,000 downloads by users for the app, a new push notification function has been added, allowing the university to have direct communication in urgent situations with York community members.
Castle says a “Campus Alert” feature has been added, which allows the university to communicate on-going programs and information to users.
“The voice over function was improved to ensure more accurate voice responses when a user presses specific icons,” he adds.
Two students were injured in the March 6 incident, which sparked this review of security measures on campus, and police arrested a suspect several days later.

York students can expect to hear noise throughout the night due to continuing construction of the Toronto York-Spadina Subway Extension.
The site has been authorized to run construction overnight from March 21 to April 11.
A dewatering system has been installed to drain the site. The work is currently focused on excavating the “Light Scoop” area and building the station box.
Construction is continuous, with work on the base slab of the station expected to commence in late April.
This will include installing waterproofing, pouring and curing the concrete protection slab, formwork. and installing rebar.
York students can get more information about the TYSSE at the Project Information Centre in York Lanes.

After hearing arguments from both the defense and the Crown, jury members in the trial of Brian Dickson, the man accused of killing York student Qian Liu in 2011, will begin deliberations on April 7.
The Crown is charging Dickson with first-degree murder for the death of Liu, and has rejected Dickson’s plea for a manslaughter charge.
Liu was attacked by a man in her apartment in the Village while she was chatting online with her boyfriend, Xia Chao Meng, who was in Beijing at the time. She was found naked and face down in her room the next day after Meng managed to get word out to her friends and landlord that she could be in danger. 
On April 1, the court heard that DNA found on Liu’s abdomen, groin, fingernails, and chest matched Dickson’s DNA profile.
Forensic biologist Melissa Kell also testified that Liu could also not be excluded as a source of the DNA found on the bloodstained shirt collected from Dickson’s residence.
Forensic pathologist Dr. Christopher Milroy said Liu’s death may have been caused by mechanical asphyxiation, which is blockage of airways through neck or chest compression, as indicated by bruising on her neck and bleeding in her eyes.
Her roommate, Zahid Abdullah, who also testified on April 1, may have helped identify the shirt with the matching DNA sample. 
He told the jury he saw an unknown Caucasian male in the house the night of Liu’s death, wearing a shirt that matched the description of the one investigators eventually retrieved and tested.
Abdullah, however, did not directly identify Dickson.
Dickson’s lawyer, Robert Nuttall, is seeking a manslaughter ruling, arguing the cause of death needs to be definitive before one can determine intent beyond reasonable doubt.
Nutall also argued that Dickson’s mental capacity was reduced, based on his claim that he was medicated and intoxicated, but no evidence to prove this combination affected him has been presented as of publication.

The York University Student Centre’s board of directors has decided to increase security surveillance and lighting in the building.
Cameras will be installed facing the exits of the building, and lighting in the walkway and exterior of the building will be increased.
Jessica Thyriar, York Federation of Students president and spokesperson for the board of directors, says after discussions with stakeholders and groups in the Student Centre, a compromise was made to increase surveillance for safety reasons, but also ensure student privacy.
“We needed to find a balance between ensuring that folks who use the space for various reasons, such as support services, felt comfortable [and that their information remained confidential] and ensuring other students did feel safe when using the building,” says Thyriar.
Imran Mohamed, third-year kinesiology and psychology major, says the change is a positive one.
“It’s not exactly monitoring student activities inside the Student Centre. We still have our sense of privacy, [but] we know who is coming in and who is leaving,” says Mohamed.
Mohamed adds that while he supports the decision to add cameras facing the exits, he would not feel comfortable with cameras being installed in the food court or by the couches upstairs.
“If there is a sense of people watching you, you just do not feel right. It doesn’t add to the festivities or the atmosphere [that the Student Centre is trying to promote],” says Mohamed.
Thyriar says the board of directors is constantly reviewing ways to improve the Student Centre and ensure students feel safe.
“I think it’s important for the community to come together in various ways to share various things that we can do in regards to safety, and if we continue having these discussions and [making] efforts to actually put these things forward, it’s more of a community,” says Thyriar.
Currently, York has over 660 CCTV cameras overlooking parking lots, buildings, and classrooms, but there are none in the Student Centre.

Calls for a boycott rang out during Israeli Apartheid Week as a group representing black graduate students made allegations against Students Against Israeli Apartheid’s guest speaker Rania Khalek, an independent journalist and activist whom they accused of being “notoriously anti-black.”
York University Black Graduate Student’s Collective posted an anti-black racism bulletin on March 23, the same day that Khalek was to deliver a lecture called The Weapon’s Lab: Israeli Apartheid and the Arms Trade. According to SAIA, Khalek was invited to give a lecture on how Israel uses Palestine as a laboratory for weapons and methods of domination and control, which are then exported to other parts of the world.
BGSC’s bulletin calls for a boycott of Khalek’s lecture, stating it is their policy whenever a speaker with a history of committing emotional, social, and or physical violence against groups of black people. However, the event proceeded as scheduled.
The BGSC was not available for further comment.
“Rania Khalek is a well-known supporter of Black Lives Matter and the call for reparations for past and present injustices inflicted on black people in the United States,” says Merate Atare, member of SAIA. “Those who levelled the allegation that Khalek is anti-black, with no evidence, lack a progressive worldview based on mutual solidarity.”
Atare explains SAIA reached out to the individual, but couldn’t come to an agreement.
“We in the Palestine solidarity movement at York will not throw our friends and supporters under the bus, and we stand firmly behind them.”
Khalek has come under fire in the past for allegedly overstating the similarity between the movements for Palestinian and black rights, particular on social media.
In the aftermath of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri in late 2014, for example, Khalek made a connection between the repression of Palestinian protests in Israel and of black protests in the United States.
She faced backlash on Twitter, where she was referred to as “an anti-black, ahistoric troll” and was threatened with violent retaliation.

The Lions men’s basketball team fought hard all season long for their spot in the Ontario University Athletics playoffs, but just as they were about to hit the court for a post-season play, their season came to an abrupt and disappointing end.
York University Athletics and Recreation announced on the last day of February that an ineligible player had been participating in the games and that all games he had been involved in would have to be disqualified. This included nine regular season games overall and three crucial victories, without which the Lions gave up their spot in the OUA playoffs.
The player, who was not named, had participated in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport at another institution during the preseason and hence was not supposed to take part in the Lions’ games this season.
Prior to the debacle, the Lions had spent the final weeks of the regular season fighting their way through tough games. They lost to the Windsor Lancers by a score of 86-85 and to the Western Mustangs by 81-80. The Lions then edged the Algoma Thunderbirds by 68-67 and finally secured themselves a playoff spot by defeating the UofT Varsity Blues in a huge overtime victory by a score of 97-93.
The Lions lost to the dominant Ryerson Rams by a score of 81-72 in their final game of the regular season, perhaps taking it easier knowing they had already achieved their long-sought goal of making the playoffs. Two days later, on February 29, Athletics and Recreation finally broke the bad news to the team, the OUA, and the CIS.
However, instead of brooding over that, athletes on the team are reflecting on their performance throughout the season.
“I honestly don’t think we reached our full potential as a team,” says guard Shane Reader. “Mostly because of injuries, but we were definitely better than our record showed. We lost a handful of games by three or fewer points that could have gone either way.”
“We did everything well at some point or another,” he adds, “but (we) just couldn’t bring it all together consistently.”
Reader believes that the team needs to especially work on defense, which he says can be done by careful observation of the opponent’s strategy and game planning. “Our offence does need work,” he adds, “but we have enough weapons to score when chances come around.”
Looking forward to next season, Reader says that it will take more than just better defense and a summer of intensive workouts to get the team to where it needs to be.
“The goal for next season is to get a new coach that will help [our program],” he says. “It’s obviously time for a change after six long seasons of backing out in the first round of the playoffs, and you’ve all seen how this season ended.”

The subject of illiteracy among women has not been talked about enough and it is time to change that. Adults who are illiterate or have low literacy have been shamed as beings of idiocy or laziness in today’s society, unless they seek to improve themselves or merge into the mainstream education system. In Canadian society alone it is noted that four out of 10 adults’ literacy skills are too low to be fully competent for most jobs in the economy.
Illiteracy rates among racialized women have a critical effect in Canadian society. To be an immigrant to Canada, one must be capable of learning a language outside of their mother tongue, if not English or French, and be able to adapt to the new economic structure in place here.
What many seem to overlook about immigrants in Western society is that a majority are coming from situations of poverty, political upheaval, or social structures that have not allowed them to seek further education.
Literacy is a fundamental right for all, but in regions where agendas of domestication are pushed onto women, literacy and higher-education do not become a priority.
Before jumping to theories, it is important to note the life of a lot of immigrant women and how they have adapted into Canadian society. It has become necessary that women provide the domesticated services they have been trained to do, under the sacrifice of an education. Unpaid domestic labour that goes on in the home is often considered invaluable.
A lot of people in Western society and in our current generation are used to having the ability to read and write. Many cannot imagine what it feels like to look at something and not be able to understand it. You may say, well then go out and learn, but once these women come of age they take the knowledge and notion they learned in their home country and migrate to Canada, and start a new life.
They come here for work and to start a family. You will find a lot of immigrant women and men working in factory settings because more often than not, the job does not require a lot of comprehension for reading and writing, but rather is more labour focused.
Once these women marry and start a family, the structure in the household changes to focus not just on themselves but on their children. These women tend to put themselves second to their children, and education is prioritized for their child. Over time, their notion of improvement gets lost, because they become roped into a routine of work and home life, and the idea for a second chance at literacy is put on the back burner.
But the stigma of women not having that ability is still in place. Women who do not have the skills that modern education provides lose the ability and skill set that they could have had to manage their own income and expenditure. Children of literate mothers are known to be more likely to complete their education.
Does this mean we need to start forcing people to take educational tests and literacy examinations before entering the country? No. That is only fueling the taboo around the whole topic. What needs to be done is accepting the fact that they are people who’ve had to sacrifice more than they’ve had to gain, especially these women.
 This is still an empowerment movement for women. Even though some women may lack mainstream education in Canadian society, they still provide for themselves and their families in the best way that they can. They are not lesser beings because they didn’t get the chance at modern education. You wouldn’t make fun of an individual in a wheelchair, therefore there should be no hatred or fuel for ignorance against women for their disposition.
Instead, please praise them and encourage more women to better themselves and take a second chance at learning. What many miss when they cross paths with a person who is illiterate is the fact that in a society built upon languages and literature, despite them not being able to fully comprehend what is being written, they still made a life and have overcome that barrier. Women who have this trait are no less than women who have the educational means to succeed in life through positions greater than their own.
A factory job does not under any circumstances demean you as lesser than others, because what many forget is that we are all striving towards supporting ourselves and others. These women face this stigma harsher than anyone else, and they still stand strong and make it through a lifestyle that does not accept their lesser implication. So stop shaming them, start praising them, and help them when you can. Take an interest in adult illiteracy because many people have family and friends who are going through this and everyone deserve a second chance.

2016-09-29,York,Palestine,"York activists joined UNITE HERE Local 75 union members last week in celebrating “Hotel Workers Rising,” a decade-long campaign centred around securing rights for hospitality workers.
“With Toronto Rising, we are taking the next step. We’re partnering with community groups across the city to stand up for a living wage for all, good jobs in our communities, affordable housing across the GTA, a Toronto that works for young people and equal rights under the law for immigrant- and service-workers,” reads a media advisory released by Marc Hollin, coordinator for UNITE HERE Local 75.
Melissa Sobers, food service campus coordinator for Real Food Real Jobs campaign, states the main goal of the Toronto Rising summit was to be a kick-off event for the 2,000 low-wage food service workers who will potentially be entering into a strike across the city, including at universities like York.
“The strike would be a collective bargaining for living wages and benefits with the goal of ultimately breaking the cycle of precariousness, lack of dignity and stigma that food service jobs hold,” she says.
Sobers recounts the event’s historical origins, saying hotel workers across the city used to make poverty wages similar to what food service workers are paid today, approximately $12 per hour with no benefits.
“Due to their tireless acts of solidarity and demonstrations, hotel workers in downtown Toronto are currently making approximately $20 per hour with decreased workloads and full benefits, thus setting a standard for the vast majority of hotel workers in the city in terms of wages,” says Sobers.
Sobers states that food service workers are now trying to achieve the same standards of employment. Allies like Fight for $15 & Fairness in Canada and the United States, the Changing Workplaces Review in Ontario and the organizing efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement make this goal seem more achievable.
“The event also hosted discussions on how the labour laws in Ontario presently discriminate against contract service workers, such as the York Aramark food service workers, ultimately targeting racialized people since they are over-represented in this line of work,” explains Sobers.
For instance, Filipino workers alone compose 75 per cent of hotel workers in Toronto, according to The Philippine Reporter. 
“We understand that low-wage jobs for Filipino immigrants is a growing issue. We have many skilled and educated Filipinos struggling at the bottom of the job market,” said the Filipino Student Association at York, or FSAY, in a statement to Excalibur.
Many Filipinos get stuck in these positions because they are trapped balancing 40-hour work weeks and raising a family, all while getting used to their new environment, according to FSAY.
Meanwhile, the Ontario Public Interest Research Group at York, or OPIRG, intends to collaborate with other campaigns to address issues of unfair treatment of immigrants in the workforce, minimum wage, exorbitant tuition fees and unaffordable rent.
“OPIRG York attended in order to help connect student issues to the broader movement as well as to provide support to the food service workers at York who are currently fighting for more respect in the workplace and better conditions,” says Imran Kaderdina, admin and information coordinator for OPIRG York.
One of the highlights of the event was the Fairbnb coalition, which aims to hold Airbnb, a popular home-sharing platform, accountable for its short-term rentals.
“Airbnb was discussed in the context of its threat to affordable housing access in the city to people like us, the working poor, students in debt as well as the great living-wage jobs that hotel workers have fought so hard to establish,” says Sobers.
Sobers claims Airbnb is a threat because of its non-taxed, non-regulated nature. UNITE HERE Local 75 expresses similar sentiments: “As Airbnb ‘ghost hotels’ proliferate, workers in regulated hotels will see their hours cut. Our paycheques will shrink as our housing costs go up. While Airbnb alone didn’t cause Toronto’s housing affordability crisis, it certainly isn’t helping.”
Filipino Canadian Youth Alliance at York, Ethiopian and Eritrean Workers Network, Federation of Metro Tenants Association, CUPE 3903, U of T’s student union and members from the Osgoode Hall Law union were some of the community groups in attendance.

If you’re a sports fan, you’ve probably heard of players being sidelined with concussions. Perhaps you’re a fantasy sports enthusiast, and have had to adjust your lineup because one of your starters was knocked out with a concussion. Or maybe you just really like Will Smith and saw the 2015 film.
But what is a concussion?
Concussions, often referred to by athletes as the c-word, are traumatic brain injuries usually caused by hits to the head.
Other injuries are fairly easy to detect—if you break a bone, for example, there is usually a visible indication of the injury, as well as an incredible amount of pain. But concussions are an invisible injury, and are harder to detect.
Fortunately, advancements in technology and increased research have allowed us to learn more about the nature of concussions.
A recent study by Purdue University found that concussions are possibly caused by multiple hits to the head over time, as opposed to the previous notion that they were caused by a single impact. Another common misconception about concussions is that they go away after a certain amount of time, without any lingering side effects. In reality, many people who experience concussions also experience post-concussion syndrome, where symptoms last for more than six weeks.
But what are the symptoms, and how do you know if you have a concussion? According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms include headaches, loss of consciousness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, fatigue and slurred speech.
In severe concussions, a person’s pupils may appear different sizes, with one dilated more than the other.
Some symptoms may take longer to show up, such as memory loss and an inability to concentrate, irritability and personality shifts, sensitivity to light, erratic sleeping patterns and even psychological disorders such as depression, according to Mayo Clinic.
More alarming are the findings by the researchers at York’s Centre for Vision Research, who found that athletes who suffer concussions may also have neurological deficits that are typically not detected in standard clinical assessments.
The study compared the cognitive-motor integration between 51 athletes who had never been diagnosed with a concussion, and 51 athletes who had a history of concussions but were no longer showing symptoms.
The goal of the study was to determine whether athletes with a history of concussions displayed any impairment when asked to “think and move at the same time.” Participants were asked to perform two separate tasks that tested their cognitive-motor integration.
According to the results, athletes who had never suffered a concussion performed the tasks roughly 50 milliseconds faster than athletes who had.
While that doesn’t sound like a large difference, it could be the difference between getting hit or not, according to Professor Lauren E. Sergio.
These tests could also provide a more accurate assessment for determining when a player is safely able to return to the field or rink. If a player returns to their sport too soon after experiencing a concussion and suffers another, known as second impact syndrome, the results could be devastating and even fatal.
Side effects of second impact syndrome include swelling in the brain, possible herniation, loss of consciousness, acute metabolic changes and cerebral blood flow alterations, according to brainandspinalcord.org.
Hopefully as we learn more about the brain and how it functions, we can find ways to ensure player safety and better diagnose concussions—or prevent them from happening at all. 

Let’s face it: staying focused in class is hard—especially in the age of technology, where laptops and cellphones are everywhere you look. Since 2000, when the mobile revolution began, the average attention span dropped from 12 to eight seconds. It is hard to focus when you’re distracted by chatter in the back of the class and a never-ending stream of late students. This difficulty increases with lecture lengths.
Although the average attention span has dropped quite a bit, fourth-year psychology student Shakil Mirza says it heavily depends on the lecture. “I have sat through three-hour psychology lectures once a week, and one-hour biology lectures three times a week. I’ve been alert and more attentive in the latter, because I’d be more interested [and] there is no time to doze off. Even with a middle break in a three-hour lecture, not everyone comes back to class,” says Mirza. One of the perks of hour-long lectures is that there’s no time to stop—so you’d better write notes and stay focused as if your life depended on it.
But what about the dreaded three-hour lectures? How do students possibly stay focused? Are they simply wasting their time? The answer is, surprisingly, that there are some benefits to long lectures. For one, commuting times can be reduced, saving time and money. Rather than travelling to campus several times a week, stacking up longer classes could cut down on days travelling to school, thus saving those pricey tokens. You know that a broke student is willing to do anything to save those valuable dollars.
“All of my courses are three-hour classes, and sometimes they are back-to-back. I actually prefer three-hours lectures over [hour-long] lectures as it cuts down on commute time. But I do often struggle with paying attention. I try to sit close enough to the [professor] that I can engage in discussion, but far enough so that I can slip out easily if I need a break, which is often,” says fourth-year global health policy, management and systems student Anmol Yagnik.
Three-hour lectures allow for more opportunities to spend time with the professor and fellow students to develop a strong connection with them. “I love long lectures as I feel the professors cover more of the material in detail. They are more prone to tell their personal stories regarding the text or theories presented, which I enjoy. It makes it easier to comprehend and more interesting,” says third-year psychology student Waverly Pegelo.
That being said, if you are planning to take or currently taking three-hour-long lectures, try to find a different course offering that can break them down into one-hour lectures. If you cram your schedule with class after class of three-hour lectures, be mindful of the hazards and honest with yourself: are you actually learning and retaining the material, or are you just wasting your time and money? It does depend on preference and on the specific person.
If it is nearly impossible to split your class schedule, here are some tips. Turn off all devices, such as your cellphone and laptop, if possible. This prevents the possibility of opening time-wasting applications. Sitting in the front of the class will keep you focused and be an incentive to not use your devices. Ask yourself if you really need to bring a laptop to take notes. Recent research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton University and the University of California found that writing notes by hand requires a different type of cognitive processing than when typing notes. Since writing by hand is a slower method, it also allows for more time to digest information. Try finding a professor with favourable ratings. One of the more popular sites used for rating professors is ratemyprofessors.com. If a professor is passionate about the subject and teaches the material in a clear and concise way, chances are you will be more attentive in class and learn more about the material. Until then, stay alert!

Tattoos are everywhere. Take a glance around and it will not take you long to locate someone with a tattoo. Maybe your friend tattooed his ex-girlfriend’s name on his arm, or maybe your grandpa has a tattoo hidden away from his rock n’ roll days. Maybe you have a tattoo yourself. If so, you might have found yourself exploring this unique art form in a museum exhibit. 
This year the Royal Ontario Museum, or ROM, hosted an exhibit dedicated to showcasing the diverse body art form of tattooing. Tattoos: Ritual. Identity. Obsession. Art, opened its doors on April 2, 2016 and closed on September 5, 2016. Visitors were invited to an exhibition that not only displayed the uniqueness and variety of tattoos, but also the traditional, historical and cultural context associated with this intrinsic art form.  
The exhibit enabled onlookers to have a multifaceted learning experience. Spanning over the course of 5,000 years, the exhibit provided a history of both ancient and modern tattoos, while also paying tribute and highlighting some of the world’s most famous and talented tattoo artists, such as Sailor Jerry, and their respected pieces. This was done using various visual aids, artifacts, posters and silicone figures that were used to reproduce tattoo pieces. 
Tools that were used to draw tattoos were scattered all over the museum. One of the more complex and inventive tools featured was a handmade tattoo gun crafted by prison inmates. Using the limited supplies available, the prisoners were able to use ball point pens, wire and spool to create electric and manual machines. 
The exhibit also provided a historic and cultural context for tattoos, exploring how tattoos are regarded in America, Asia and Europe. In a historical context, the museum displayed photographs of the chests of Auschwitz prisoners in Nazi camps and the identification tattoos the Nazis’ inked onto the inmates’ skin. Juxtaposed with these pictures were the bodies of the grandchildren of some of these survivors, who tattooed the identification numbers onto their skin as a way to remember and honour their family and family history. 
On a cultural level, the museum explored what tattoos meant to different cultures, such as the Japanese. This was explored through a documentary video that interviewed famous and rewound Japanese tattoo artist Horiyoshi III, who specializes in full body tattoos. Horiyoshi III said that tattoos are important to the Japanese culture he caters to because they view tattoos as a symbolic and personal expression. When a person goes out to the workplace, they are seen as that person; a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher. However, once they are in their naked form, their tattoos became their own personal, symbolic expression of their true inner identity. In a Japanese cultural context, tattoos are essential in cultivating modes of personal identity and expression. 
Every empty space, every wall and every corner of the tattoo exhibit was scattered with unique information on tattoos and the rich history that accompanies it. Whether you have your own obsession with tattoos, want to learn more about this ancient form of body art, or have a burning passion for history, the exhibit satisfied all these interests. What was most amazing about the exhibit was the way it took tattoos and gave them an identity not many would expect. In modern society, tattoos are met with mixed reactions, but a spectator who went to the exhibit would have left with a newly found perspective that hopefully allowed them to see that tattoos are more than just ink on skin; they are a tool for cultures to cultivate identities that penetrate external surfaces. 
As an international student, I come from a country where student activism and politics are banned across university campuses and journalism has become a guise for promoting a corporate agenda.
Coming to York, colloquially referred to as a “social justice university,” I found a sense of freedom in expression and joined many social justice groups on campus in various leadership capacities.
I also ended up becoming the assistant news editor at Excalibur, York’s largest student newspaper. Given my involvement, many have branded me as playing a contradictory role of both an activist and a journalist.
I disagree with this characterization.
The terms “activism” and “media” mean different things to different people. The former could imply anything from justice and equality to radicalism and extremism while the latter could imply anything from truth and accountability to lies and propaganda.
Both terms can have widely contrasting connotations depending on factors involved and context of discussion, yet we can perhaps agree that a combination of the two generally provokes unease and cognitive dissonance among people.
While that may be true, it is just one perspective of looking at things. During my time at Excal, I have personally come to experience the converging influence of the two fields.
Journalists and activists are not enemies nor always at loggerheads with each other. Most of the time, our work is complementary and collaborative, not in the sense that journalists endorse any particular activist agenda, but rather that we consistently keep track of and report on any arising developments within activist groups. In short, we both need each other, regardless of our differences.
The idea of objectivity, in context of journalism, is very misplaced. Journalism, like activism, in many ways is agenda-driven. While we aim to offer unbiased, critical perspectives, one cannot deny that there are always dominant themes and angles, a by-product of stories with cracks left unexplored.
Student activism has the power to expose one to hot-button issues, ranging from anti-tuition fees campaigns, campus racism and sexual violence campaigns to international issues such as the Israel-Palestine controversy and other cases of nationalistic self-determination struggles.
While some may find certain campus politics disagreeable, it undeniably sparks a degree of critical thinking, which in itself is a sign of progress. Yet student politics is not immune to criticism, whether it be allegations of romanticizing and oversimplifying struggles or simply being written off as ineffective.
This is where we student journalists play a key role. Besides putting a spotlight on emerging issues, we indirectly give activist groups a greater impetus to act while maintaining a historic memory of community events through our extensive documentation.
Despite points of criticism, I think it is safe to say that both activism and journalism are inevitable outcomes of challenging the status quo in an unfair world, and they are here to stay. Both are united by common themes of community, shared networks and storytelling.
My point is to move beyond the concept of binary thinking, of pro- this and anti- that, labelling things as right and wrong and pigeonholing ideas into neatly packaged definitions. Instead, we should aspire to create a space where we can have honest and challenging discussions about our current paradigms, where we are constantly redefining our roles and open-heartedly embracing the conflict-ridden process of changing the world.

2017-02-10,York,Palestine,"With “Drop Fees Not Bombs” posters on nearly every wall and a gathering planned for February 9, the topic of divestment from weapons manufacturers is looming large once again on York’s campus.
YU Divest is continuing to lobby York’s Board of Governors against any future investment in companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Textron and Amphenol.
Weapons manufacturers are perceived as being complicit in major harm and destruction brought upon communities around the world, with the claim that because they rely on and directly benefit from conflict, they have an inherent interest in their continuation.
With growing refugee crises in parts of the Middle East and Africa, there has been a growing pressure on institutions around the world to consider ethical investment practices.
In a statement on YU Divest’s website, it is emphasized that any investment in weapons manufacturers has a lasting impact on both war-torn areas and York’s community.
“Many York community members have family members who are directly impacted by these weapons. A university that values the safety of its community should not be investing in companies that put the safety of its community members at risk, along with many other innocent people,” it reads.
York makes investments through its endowment fund, a pool of money utilized to generate profits that finance scholarships, bursaries and university projects.
Every financial quarter, a detailed investment holdings report is produced, along with a statement of investment policies and procedures.
As of December 2016, York held no investments in the aforementioned companies and continues to consider the integration of environmental, social and governance risk factors in its investment selection process.
Nonetheless, many do feel that there is nothing concrete stopping the university from reinvesting in them in the next financial quarter.
“[York’s actions] prove that it is possible to ethically manage a successful endowment fund,” said YU Divest.
“Divestment does not only require the university to pull their existing investments from these companies but also to make a binding commitment not to reinvest.”
Studies of divestment campaigns have shown that they in fact do little to directly impact the share prices of the companies involved.
It is believed, however, that divestment campaigns create an impact through the generation of stigma surrounding certain industries, leading to fewer people wanting to work there or to greater popular support for policy at a university or government level.
More than 80 campus organizations endorse the YU Divest campaign, but it has faced criticism from numerous groups citing it as a means of promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions policy against Israel.
Steph Baker, political liaison for Hasbara, says that they do not agree with the campaign due to the negative connotation surrounding it that makes peaceful dialogue around the topic difficult.
“While YU Divest does not focus only on Israel, a large amount of energy is focused on promoting divestment from it,” says Baker.
“It makes it very difficult to create a peaceful dialogue about the country when such actions are fighting against it,” she adds.
“While some people may think that it is impossible to help Palestine while supporting Israel, it is untrue.”
Rawan Habib, vice-president campaigns and advocacy for YFS, states that the divestment campaign focuses solely on ensuring that university funds be channelled into education and the lowering of tuition fees.
“Divestment from weapons manufacturing by [the university] and the redirection of those funds into post-secondary education is directly linked to the reduction of tuition fees and improvement in the quality of education,” she says.
Trudy Pound-Curtis, assistant vice-president finance and CFO at York, notes that the Advisory Committee on Responsible Investing includes staff, faculty and students.
“The committee has held […] panel discussions over the past two years to enable the community to hear diverse viewpoints on responsible investing,” says Pound-Curtis.
Divestment remains a highly contentious topic that has created many heated exchanges, so Excalibur sought to establish what York students really think.
As far as I am concerned, [this] investment isn’t ethical. This is an institution that spreads inclusivity and acceptance, but at the same time makes money from wars around the world. It doesn’t seem right. For myself, divestment would make me feel better about the institution I attend. Reinvestment into more sound ethical industries feels a lot better. This campaign is the definition of a student movement. We cannot allow our beloved institution to make money off weapons manufacturing.
I’m personally against York investing in weapons manufacturers. Universities should focus all their resources on education, especially at a diverse university like York where weapons investment is an issue that hits close to home for many. Weapons investment causes a distraction, and some students may feel they are directly contributing to conflict.
I only discovered that York was behind this quite recently. I can see why York’s involvement with this investment would be kept on the down-low. If you look at power, it is often sustained and cultivated by ignorance. They should look at the needs of students and lower fees, for the greater good and for people wanting an education who are unable to afford it. I can, however, appreciate if the investment was done with the good intention of establishing scholarships and bursaries; I don’t see much wrong with that.
York is an enormous institution that can invest in other companies that are economically large enough to fund our scholarships. By investing money in companies that create such deadly weapons that lead to destruction, death and horror for the entire world to fear, York is being included in this problem. Instead of using money to help these companies grow, York should really think about lowering our fees so that scholarships wouldn’t need to be funded by these companies.
