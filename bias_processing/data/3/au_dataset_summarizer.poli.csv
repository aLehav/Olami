2009-03-05,AU,conservative,"As the crowd streamed out of Ward 1 last Thursday, shouts for ethnic pride and gay rights rang through the air while faint voices sang ""This Land is My Land."" Former Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., had just given his talk about assimilation against the ""cult of multiculturalism,"" and some students had been stifling and hushing their reactions to his words all night.
The AU chapter of the national organization Youth for Western Civilization invited Tancredo to speak on campus, and the event drew both interest and protest.
YWC started on campus last semester through the efforts of Kevin DeAnna, a senior in the School of International Service who also helped found the national organization. 
""I started it here and found some other people who agreed with its goals,"" DeAnna said.
YWC chapters also exist at several other campuses across the nation, according to the group's Facebook page.
The group's Facebook page also displays its mission statement.
""The purpose of Youth for Western Civilization is to form a right wing youth movement,"" the page said. ""Youth for Western Civilization educates, organizes and trains activists on campuses across the nation to create a subculture that promotes the survival of Western Civilization and pride in Western heritage.""
Protest organizers referenced the Facebook page during a preliminary organizational meeting prior to Tancredo's speech.
""The language on the Facebook group is flawless,"" said Bianca Jones, Inter-cultural Liaison of Black Student Alliance, who came to the meeting representing herself and not the BSA.
The AU YWC Facebook group's description said the group's purpose is to educate about and promote pride in Western heritage and incite debate among its members on ""issues of vital important to Western Civilization.""
Josh Jacobs, a freshman in SIS, said he thinks the YWC is not racist on its Facebook page or elsewhere.
""I'm Jewish, our vice president is Hispanic, our president is an international student and we have multi-ethnic and multi-religious members,"" Jacobs said.
Even with diversity within the group, one can still show pride in the group's collective Western heritage and identiy, Jacobs said. 
""We hold that you should not be proud of your biology. There is nothing special about being born white, black, or Hispanic. It's a skin color,"" he said.
""I felt the need to join the Youth for Western Civilization group in order to see what the group and some of their members stand for,"" said Nafiza Jelassi, a senior in SIS and the Kogod School of Business who is an Egyptian-born Muslim.
Jelassi said she felt the group directs its attitudes solely towards white Americans.  
""I want to disprove their stereotypes of people who don't fall into their understanding of who's an American by getting to know them and letting them get to know me,"" she said.
""It is important for Muslims to not only be open to others but to help people understand what we stand for,"" she said. ""[YWC] is very new to our campus and perhaps some of the members may benefit learning from AU's diversity,"" she said.
DeAnna discussed the YWC's mission and views in an e-mail interview.
""We are opposed to radical multiculturalism, mass immigration, racial preferences and attempts to move curriculum away from Western Canon,"" DeAnna said in the e-mail. ""We are a nonpartisan conservative youth group that is concerned about the far left climate on American college campuses and are trying to push the debate back to the center.""
Vitus Van Rij and Amanda Patino, freshmen in SIS, helped to start and lead the group with DeAnna this year.
""The reason I was attracted to the group was because of the sort of hypocrisy I found on the leftist movement,"" Patino said. ""There's this idea that we're all equal and whatnot, but at the same time there's nothing unifying about their actions ... there are plenty of other people trying to tear our country apart and they don't need our help doing it.""
She said she helped DeAnna start AU's YWC chapter last semester, but they did not plan any events until this semester.
""[Tom Tancredo's talk] was our first main event,"" DeAnna said. ""It went well ... It was to open a debate on immigration and assimilation and announce our presence on campus ... We got our message out, the lecture was well attended by both sides.""
Some students wore black clothing and carried signs to protest of the event, but some came to support Tancredo's message and join forces with YWC.
Since Tancredo's lecture, YWC's Facebook group has increased its membership.
""I met a number of new members,"" DeAnna said. ""I don't exactly have a formal roster right now ... [but] it's certainly growing ... and I expect that growth will continue.""
Jacobs said he joined YWC a few weeks ago.
""The group offers a good alternative perspective on ... a very pro-multicultural campus,"" he said.
Jacobs is involved in College Republicans as well as in YWC, and several other YWC members are also affiliated with College Republicans, including College Republicans Vice President Luke Kraus and David Lindgren, a freshman in SIS.
Though College Republicans and YWC hold certain ideals in common, Lindgren said YWC needs to exist separate from a partisan organization.
""I am a member of the College Republicans,"" he said. ""And although certain parts of the Republican ideology align with that of the YWC, I feel YWC focuses and seeks to promote a greater understanding of Western culture and the harm of multiculturalism in American society that college Republicans do not address.""
YWC's message is for both those who associate themselves with Republicans and Democrats, Lindgren said.
""Specifically addressing the point of multiculturalism, an individual does not need to be a Republican or Democrat to understand the challenges multiculturalism poses and the problems associated with seeking to differentiate cultures,"" he said.
The purpose of the group's opposition to multiculturalism is to unify, according to DeAnna.
""America has a lot of different kinds of people here,"" he said in the e-mail. ""Something has to hold us together.""
Tancredo's talk expressed the group's goal to be as inclusive as possible, DeAnna said.
""[Tancredo] stated that people - regardless of race, religion or background - can become part of this country and identify proudly with American history and as part of the American people,"" he said in the e-mail.

2009-03-05,AU,conservative,"Being at AU for four years now, I'm no stranger to rolling my eyes when another misguided ""progressive"" colleague, seemingly unaware or indifferent to the eugenics, racism, social planning and contempt for individual freedom synonymous with the word's history, proceeds to attack conservatives for being both ""mean"" and ""stupid."" Watching progressive ignorance embarrass itself can be fun, but the absurdity of Jacob Shelly's most recent column simply cannot be exaggerated, largely for the same reason infinity cannot be exaggerated.
First and foremost, Shelly shows his own ""meanness"" and ""stupidity"" when he throws all substance and seriousness to the wind by willfully embracing an ignorant caricature of former President Bush's term in office. Surely, our 43rd president's term in office was filled with failings, and we should be honest about what they are and what they are not. Seeing the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, our economic hard times and the war in Iraq as the result of President Bush being one-big meany-pants hardly is the mark of someone whose accusations of ""stupidity"" can be taken seriously.
Many of Shelly's assertions also go a long way in disqualifying him from making stupidity calls. For one thing, President Obama is hardly ""wildly popular."" His approval rating is about average for a president within his first 100 days, according to Gallup polls taken of presidents going back to Eisenhower. For another, the stimulus is hardly ""wildly popular."" At the end of January, CNN reported support for the stimulus dropped nearly 12 points in a week, finishing off at about a 51 percent approval rating. This of course says nothing of the more than 30,000 phone calls the offices of Sens. Snowe, Specter and Collins against the stimulus bill from their constituents, forcing them to shut off their office phones. 
While it's clear Shelly is titillated by the stimulus (even with the contraceptives funding removed, curiously enough), I'd love to know one ""poor"" person that will actually be aided by the stimulus, unless of course he means those 1.2 million additional recipients of Medicare as a result of the stimulus, which could even include Wall Street CEOs. Then again, seeing as the Dow has lost nearly 20 percent of its value since Election Day, nearly half of it coming since Obama's inauguration, they may need our tax dollars after all. 
Shelly should also be more concerned about making sure the provision in the stimulus to override governors' decisions to refuse stimulus money is actually constitutional before he starts questioning the motives of those against the money. And, given Shelly's logic that any governor refusing stimulus funds is clearly plotting a presidential run, he might want to talk to Gov. Phil Bredesen, D-Tenn., who is considering turning down stimulus money.
Fiction can be fun, or ""awesome"" as Shelly alludes. But without facts, the only person left sounding mean and stupid is Shelly himself.

2009-03-05,AU,conservative,"Some of your readers may recall a letter that I previously sent to your paper in reply to an Alex Knepper column. In it, I take him to task on the straw man that he sets up, which stated that liberals cared less about victims of bigotry in non-Western countries than about the comparatively less severe discrimination in the West. Apparently, he has revived this canard in his latest column. 
I once more reiterate that crimes east of the Prime Meridian do not mitigate the crimes to its west, and it's more practical to address problems at home than those abroad. If Knepper says he supports the plight of victims of bigotry in Muslim countries, then I recommend that he donate his time and/or resources to human rights organizations (most of them run by leftists) that advocate for them (such as Human Rights Watch), instead of crassly appropriating their cause to score cheap political points against liberals. 
He also makes another erroneous point in regards to ""victimhood"" and ""identity politics."" First, no minority advocacy organization wants to perpetuate victimhood as conservatives want to caricature them. They are simply about transforming victimhood into empowerment. 
Second, identity politics is a fact of life in the U.S., let alone the world. Identity politics is but a simple acknowledgment of the fact that people are categorized into groups beyond their control. The identity of each group is shaped by the forces around it, and if those forces involve past discrimination, then that cannot simply be abandoned as easily as some say it should.

2009-04-09,AU,conservative,"The national teenage birthrate has increased for the second year in a row following a previous 14-year trend of steady decreases.
The rate at which unmarried women who gave birth rose by seven percent between 2006 and 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control National Center for Health Statistics. The same report showed Texas, New Mexico and Mississippi - all states that traditionally vote conservatively - had the three highest number of teen birth rates. In Mississippi, there were 68.4 births for every 1,000 girls aged 15-19. The report did not cover how many pregnancies were terminated.
The consensus among many experts is that nobody is certain as to what is causing the sudden rise in unplanned pregnancies, although authorities on both ends of the ideological divide have voiced their opinions.
""With any kind of contraceptive there's a risk involved,"" Karin Thornton, AU's associate Catholic chaplain, said in response to the report. The Roman Catholic Church and the federal government both advocate for abstinence-only programs. Under President Barack Obama, the programs could receive significant funding cuts, according to The Washington Post.
Critics of these programs argue that abstinence-only programs do not always provide a complete and effective education.
""I think it's pretty clear from a number of independent research studies that abstinence-only education is not particularly helpful to students,"" said Women's Initiative Director Ashley Evans. 
Evans said that although she supports a person's right to abstain, she also emphasized the need to get all the information.
""'Abstinence-plus' programs would be a more comprehensive solution,"" she said.
While she said she supports a complete education, Thornton said she did not know about other programs outside of her area.
""I don't know the matter of the education is because I haven't listened to their particular plan,"" Thornton said.
Evans and Thornton chose not to comment on the CDC's report, but were happy to share their views on the general topic.
Parents have a role in their children's actions, said Rebecca Hsieh, a graduate student in the School of Public Affairs' Justice, Law and Society program.
""I feel that's where parents really need to intervene and talk with their kids and realize what they're going through because it's ultimately the kid's decision,"" she said.
Women's Initiative will host ""I Heart the Female Orgasm,"" a sex-education presentation put on by authors Dorian Solot and Marshall Miller, on April 24.
While the program is part of a national movement, Evans said she encourages men to attend, calling the event ""the climax of the year.""

2009-09-10,AU,conservative,"As I watched Ted Kennedy laid to rest at the end of August, I found myself thinking about 1987. That was the year Kennedy castigated Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. During Bork's hearings, Kennedy said, ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government."" In retrospect, many people think Kennedy's speech was the beginning of the end for Bork. Critics also charge that the harshness of his words caused of our current culture war. Maybe so. As recently as Aug. 28 of this year, The New York Times ran an editorial stating as much.
Whether or not he caused it, Kennedy certainly was on the right side of the culture war. Like all good progressives, he battled social conservatives who seek to suppress anything they personally find un-Christian, immoral or inconsistent with traditional American values. It is a struggle that still rages today.
The current Virginia gubernatorial race is rife with culture clash. The Washington Post recently reported on Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's college thesis for Regent University (Pat Robertson's school). In said thesis, McDonnell writes that working women are ""detrimental"" to families. He argues that government should prefer married couples to ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.""  He also calls a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing contraception for unmarried couples ""illogical."" He wrote that at age 34. McDonnell is starting to look like George Allen, a Virginia Republican whose 2006 Senate re-election campaign was eventually derailed when he was caught using an ethnic slur.
The Democratic National Committee has released a statement on this issue and its wording sounds familiar. It makes reference to ""Bob McDonnell's preferred Virginia,"" and pundits are already describing Democratic attacks on the thesis as ""Borking"" McDonnell. ""Borking"" is the term Republicans created for when Democrats show their backwards-looking nominees and candidates for what they really are. This entire episode illustrates why despite Democratic struggles, the Republican Party is far away from returning to power. And why? Perhaps because the GOP is a party made up of white men looking out for the interest of white men.
The problem for Republicans is that the number of white men in America continues to decline. Women outnumber them today, and in just a few decades there will be no racial majority in America. The election of a black man who campaigned on the change undercuts the decades-old GOP strategy of appealing to certain white, male fears. There are still plenty of scared white men. They are the armed nuts you see at town halls, and they would love to live in Robert Bork's America. But let us always remember Ted Kennedy. As we look around at our country as it exists now, not in a Republican fantasy of yesteryear, let us realize something. We don't live in Robert Bork's America. We live, mostly, in the America of Ted Kennedy's dreams.

2009-10-12,AU,conservative,"Clarification Appended
It’s always tough to talk about abortion. It’s a divisive issue on which many good people vehemently disagree. This is true at American as it is across America. On our campus, the Students For Life and Students For Choice organizations both thrive. Both are big; both are active. The abortion debate plays out articulately and passionately, to the credit of all involved. 
This newspaper has no plans to take sides in this struggle, especially because there is diversity of opinion among our editorial board. However, we are supportive of advancing honest and open discourse on this issue, which is why we appreciate the panel discussion AU Students For Choice hosted this past week.
Clearly, “Exposing Fake Clinics” was a pro-abortion rights affair. Wednesday’s panel featured representatives from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, the National Abortion Federation and the Feminist Majority Foundation. It’s safe to say none of these organizations advocate overturning Roe v. Wade or supporting Sarah Palin for president in 2012. Still, social conservatives can and should learn from them. The panel exposed disturbing misinformation campaigns on the part of anti-abortion rights activists, which undermine the anti-abortion cause and embolden pro-abortion rights activists. More importantly, they are harmful to American women, pro-life and pro-choice alike.
According to a Sept. 21 press release from Feminist Majority Foundation, many anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers in this country use “misinformation, fear and shame tactics to coerce and intimidate women out of considering abortion as an option.” Some call condoms a “con job,” completely misrepresenting their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and disease. Additionally, some CPCs distribute pamphlets that claim abortion leads to an increased risk of breast cancer. The World Health Organization refutes this claim completely.
To be fair, pro-abortion rights organizations can also be guilty of stretching the truth and omitting information harmful to their cause. This should go without saying. But no serious activist on either side of this issue would justify bad behavior by pointing to more bad behavior. In fact, most activists on both sides of this issue would probably agree on a few things.
Given that abortion remains legal in this country, women should be able to access a wide range of accurate information on this sensitive topic. Social conservatives should stop their scare tactics and misinformation. Social liberals should be honest about abortion’s physical and emotional consequences. Abortions are not a walk in the park. They can be gruesome and they raise troubling moral and ethical questions for an increasing number of Americans, including an increasing number of young people.
This issue is divisive and emotional. For many, gray area simply does not exist. But this is all the more reason why our campus and our country deserve an honest, substantive debate. The abortion argument should never be reduced to competing smear campaigns. Precisely because we cannot render this culture war unnecessary, America must fight it fairly. 
Clarification: The term ""pro-abortion"" was inappropriately used several times in this editorial and should have been ""pro-abortion rights."" This version of the editorial has been changed to reflect this.

2009-11-12,AU,conservative,"PHILADELPHIA — Libertarians are a diverse bunch. Some of them wish they could abolish government entirely. Others just want its power reduced. But what unites them is their shared belief that the state should be substantially smaller and do drastically less. 
Here at AU, the libertarians have a club. AU Students For Liberty is a small operation. I’m told that fewer than 20 students attend regular meetings or events. Still, there are few diehards, most of whom I met this past weekend when I traveled with AUSFL to the 2009 Students For Liberty Mid-Atlantic Conference. The event took place at Drexel University, smack dab in the middle of the Cradle of Liberty itself — Philadelphia. The journey I took there and back again is something I won’t forget soon. It taught me about an alternative governing philosophy, but it also gave me a glimpse at what it’s like to be part of a political counterculture.
Our odyssey began last Friday with a Chinatown bus ride. On the way from D.C. to Philly, I got a primer on libertarian philosophy and policy from a few members of AUSFL. For two hours, I asked hundreds of questions and took furious notes. The young libertarians explained their core principles of nonaggression and self-ownership. They argued that taxation is slavery. They dismissed the entire idea of slicing up the economic pie, saying the solution is simply to make that pie bigger. 
Throughout the conversation, I had several realizations about libertarians. First, many of them don’t love Ron Paul. True libertarians want government out of their lives in every respect, so they don’t understand Paul’s pro-life stance or his opposition to gay marriage. They say the state shouldn’t be involved in any of this.
Second, libertarians disagree amongst themselves — a lot. In fact, it seems to me, based on my little exposure, that there is greater diversity of thought within the libertarian movement than within the conservative or progressive movements. There is a great libertarian debate over just how tiny government should be. A few of them like public education, but most don’t. Many think the government should run the justice system, the military and the police force, but some don’t.
As I learned talking to AU and Drexel students at a mixer late Friday night, there are two main camps within the libertarian movement: the minarchists and the anarcho-capitalists or anarchists. The former advocate extremely limited government. The latter, at least ideally, prefer no government at all.
Learning about anarcho-capitalism shocked me, as I imagine it would shock many people. Certainly, I am familiar with the argument that limited government means more freedom. I get it. It’s compelling. I can conceive of a scenario in which America reverts to the traditions of the Founding generation and structures government simply to provide justice, defense, security and maybe a limited form of welfare. That transformation, which is what minarchists want, would be radical, but it could happen.
What I found unbelievable was that anarcho-capitalists think the Founders’ government was way too big. They have so much faith in capitalism, so much faith in free exchange, that they literally wish for a world where markets make the rules. They philosophically and practically think the state is a problem. Its abolishment, they argue, is the rational endgame of the liberty movement. 
These are radical views. They fly in the face of the Founders’ intent. They’re outside the mainstream of American politics. I think they’re insane and an overwhelming majority of Americans — nearly everyone — would reject them outright. 
The students I talked to know this. They’ve faced reality. None of them wear rose-colored glasses. The minarchists understand government will always be bigger than they’d like and the anarcho-capitalists know they’ll never have the government-free society of their dreams.
At Saturday’s conference, the students and the speakers made mention of these realities. The presenters — college professors, organization leaders and authors — spoke of setting small goals and pushing for incremental change.
I left the conference early, but I stayed long enough to get the gist. I saw Irena Schneider, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, give an impassioned speech in her capacity as Mid-Atlantic Director. I saw Eagle columnist Alex Knepper realize he was the moderate in the room. And most importantly, I saw a group of earnest political activists enjoying each other’s company, which is always cool. 
The Students For Liberty may have unconventional views about government, but they’re well within the mainstream as far as how to have a good time. I hardly knew any of them before last weekend, but everyone was accommodating and appreciative of an Eagle writer tagging along.
I had many personal firsts last weekend. I made my first visit to Philly. I ate my first Philly Cheesesteak. And for the first, and likely last time, I saw an apartment full of libertarians sing “Don’t Stop Believing” at the top of their lungs.
“...Some will win, some will lose/Some were born to sing the blues.” 
Sounds like libertarian economics to me.

2010-03-04,AU,conservative,"Democrats aren’t doing half bad right now. So far 2010 actually isn’t looking nearly as dire as it was just after pseudo-Republican Scott Brown won the Kennedy seat in Massachusetts.
If Democrats keep up the hard work and continue to ignore tea partiers—radical conservatives and ultra-liberals like they have been—they might just survive this year. Nevertheless, here’s a little advice.
Dear Democratic Strategists,
You’re doing alright. Behind all the tea party crazy talk and “Washington is broken” nonsense, the news cycle seems to be trending your way.
Predicting the news cycle is a difficult thing to do. Sometimes it’s rough for Democrats, sometimes it hits the GOP where it really hurts. 
This is supposed to be a rough year for Democrats. President Barack Obama’s policies haven’t sailed through as smoothly as we hoped. Hardly anyone’s happy with Congress, and it consists mostly of Democrats. So it’s all bad news for the Democratic Party, right?
I’m not so sure. Look at the news from Tuesday just this week, for example.
The leading headline in the Wall Street Journal was “Deal Near on Banking Rules,” one of the Democrats’ key policy items. Point for us.
Let’s look at others. “Tea Party Holds Risks for GOP.” Minus one for Republicans.
“Fed Void Clears Path for Obama,” “Manufacturing Shows Strength,” “Bailout Update: AIG’s repayment means U.S. is close to getting back half of its IOUs.” Point, point, point for Democrats.
And then there’s darling Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., holding up unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
“One Senator Holds Up Bill, in New Level of Gridlock,” proclaims the WSJ. And then Tuesday evening: “Deal Reached to End Senator’s Holdout.” Point.
“Well that’s just one paper!” conservatives might protest (never mind the fact that the Wall Street Journal typically leans right). Sure, but The Washington Post’s headlines tell the same story.
Oh, and see that cover story in the Metro section? It exposes Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia as the hypocrite he is, lobbying for education funding from the Recovery Act he’s been lobbying against since last year. Point.
So the media momentum has shifted left a bit. But we can’t just sit back and be passive, can we? “We can’t let Republicans control the agenda and the message!” say paranoid political strategists on the left.
Well, maybe not completely. But lately they’ve done a good job digging themselves into a hole without your help, Democrats.
So, let ‘em talk.
The Tea Party is a joke. Every time Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck opens their mouth, people ridicule them across the political spectrum. Ron Paul? Not much of a threat when the Republican establishment still loathes him. Let them talk.
The “Party of No” is still just saying “no,” as evidenced by Bunning’s ignorant protest of the unemployment bill. If all the public hears is “no,” let ‘em talk.
Finally, the stimulus bill is working, the economy continues to improve and Obama is working hard to find solutions to our debt problem.
Meanwhile, Republicans continue to pan his economic proposals, as if they weren’t going home to hypocritically take credit for the stimulus. Let ‘em talk; it’s only hurting them. 
So Democrats, for now I think you should just ride the wave. Let the Republicans screw up their own messaging—you just focus on getting things done. The people will notice. You act, let them talk.

2011-11-08,AU,conservative,"Just as one might wake up with a hangover after New Year’s, the government wakes up with a hangover at the beginning of a new fiscal year, said Heritage Foundation economic expert Alison Fraser.
Comparing the fiscal year to New Year’s Day, Fraser spoke about the current state of the economy at an AU College Republicans event Nov. 1
“Our hangover for the federal government is our debt,” she said. 
Fraser spoke to an audience of around 15 students in the University Club. Her organization, the Heritage Foundation, conducts conservative public policy research.
Fraser also discussed specific economic problems facing the United States and potential solutions to these problems.
“We are seeing a dramatic increase in the size and scope of our debt,” she said.  
America’s debt will only get worse with the direction the United States is headed in now, she said.  
“Our lesson learned, if any, from the EU’s experiences is that we are just a couple of years behind having to deal with the same issues,” she said.  
After explaining the issues, Fraser talked about solutions that the Heritage Foundation has supported in the past.  
“I would do it all on the spending side without raising taxes,” she said. “Rather than taxing the rich, I would rather take away their benefits,” referring to Social Security and Medicare.
Taxes make economic growth more difficult, she said.
“We’ve got to do this in a way that makes everyone’s future brighter,” Fraser said.
Fraser encouraged the students in attendance to talk to their parents and grandparents about these issues over Thanksgiving. 
She challenged students to ask them, “What are you going to do to help me?” 
“A lot of these solutions are going to rely on us having a conversation,” she said. 	
The solutions Fraser proposed seemed to resonate with many of the students at the event.  
“I really think she made a lot of sense,” said Ella Davis, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. “She had some really good ideas for the economy in the long term.”  
Charles Merrick, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, had a different opinion. 
“I generally liked the speech,” Merrick said. “I didn’t necessarily agree with things, but they made their points well.”  
Merrick said he was invited to the event by some of his Republican friends and attended because of his interest in economics.  
“It’s important to be open to other opinions,” he said.

Throughout the past two weeks, Herman Cain has weathered multiple accusations the he sexual harassed multiple women while the CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Four different women have alleged that Cain acted inappropriately toward them, while two went public this week. Yet despite the media firestorm, Cain remains a republican front runner, only a few points behind Mitt Romney. Why has Cain been able to whether the scandal? How should people react to sexual harassment allegations? Our Quick Take columnists weigh in:

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?

•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty.

•@Christian and Republican is impossible: It's not. I am and proud of it :) and other Christian Repubs, let's be friends.
•So the only free time I have to go into the city is during the weekend and that happens to be the time every week when the Metro SUCKS. Thank you DC for ""amazing public transportation""...
•Study break: I'm making little elf suits for the mice in the dorm.
•@ All the people who posted a rant about me after I said I wish someone would: You guys are the best. Seriously made my day, THANK YOU!!
•PSYCHO YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT.
•That awkward moment when the librarians are making more noise than the students on the quiet floor. You can stop yelling when you talk. Oh, and please stop hitting on each other...

•@Fourteen days: you can do this!

•That unfortunate moment when you realized that the guy who gave you a ride back from a party (while you were sober) had some things in common with you and you didn't do anything about it.
•Before I started lifting weights I was like a 120 lb. virgin.. As soon as I touched my first weight it was like BOOM, still a virgin
•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?
•@""You know how girls get, right?"" Yes, I do, because I AM a girl, and I hate girls who make excuses for not having a handle on their emotions. Is it your time of the month, sweetheart? It's mine too, you don't see me sobbing and yelling and freaking out - take some Midol and get over yourself!""
I love you

You're wrong to have a long distance relationship
•damnit. yesterday I ranted I had fourteen days left in this hellhole abroad. turns out I had fifteen and today I have fourteen. why didn't I change my flight when my mom suggested it? DYING.
•why do i seem to find the jerks who are only physically interested in me? Of course, the only decent guy who's interested in me AND my personality is abroad right now, and I'll be abroad next semester #timingfail :(
•Hey what's with the hating on Letts  4 North? Sure almost everything has broken at some point, but at least our floor is tight
•Why in the hell have the Eagle Rants gotten so pitiful and scathing? I remember the last time I sniped someone's grammar just to be an ass; I remember the last time I ignorantly bashed on someone's religious beliefs and politics. Seriously people, rants are NOT for:
-Relationship classifieds
-Poetry
-Public policy debate
-Being a dick
-Etc...
So, let's get this nice and crystal clear: play nice, play fair, and don't be a complete tool. Sincerely,
- All the normal people who read these
•If Greece defaults on their debt, what does that mean for Greek Life!?!
•@""Wow, Clark and Roper Halls were the ones that saved the most energy last month..."" I'll have you know that students in both halls took the challenge quite seriously and purposefully reduced unnecessary electricity use, even going so far as to unplug the vending machines. So thanks for mocking us.
•Why is it that being a conservative at AU automatically makes everyone hate you? I'm not rude to you about your political beliefs, don't be rude to me about mine. And for the record, conservative =/= republican.
•That moment where you're hooking up with one of the 3 guys in your class and none of your classmates know.

•Were you in IB in high school?  Wait, really?  I didn't realize you were, I guess I didn't hear you the first twenty times you mentioned it in class.  Stop thinking and acting as if you're better than everyone else.  You're not.  And also, stop answering other students' questions before the professor gets to them; I'm paying over $100 a class to learn from HIM, not some prissy-assed girl who thinks she knows more than the man with the Ph.D. in the front of the room.
•Dear next door neighbor: I'm super delighted you like playing electric guitar so much but it would be awesome if you could do it less than FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK and maybe turn your amp down a little, plug in some headphones or realize that we hear you ALL THE TIME I especially enjoy it when you stop playing guitar and just start singing at the top of your lungs, it really brightens my day
•""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other..."" This is intense but just adorable. Make plans to see this person again. I'm sure they want to see you too!
•Dear Professor,
I appreciate you assigning us a 3,000 word essay on an event that happened in North Korea during 2011..  and not teaching us a damn thing this semester.  This should be fun, because you know.. There is so much information available on an event from North Korea... in 2011... /sigh/

•To the first date jogger-- depends on the girl, but I personally would worry that I""d be sweaty and gross while jogging. Maybe a walk instead? That's still pretty casual.
•Dear Roommate,
I love you but your biddie best friend has to go. Every time she visits our room, I want to scream...
Sincerely, love you not her.
•@dear person who wants to get to know me (the one who plays roller coaster tycoon)...do you love math?-- I love both!!!!!!!
•I hate classes where EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD is due the last day of the semester. Spread the misery out a little, please?
•Dear stupid giggling biddies,
The quiet floor is called the QUIET floor for a reason. Don't bring your unwanted noise here.
•@""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other for a long time..."" I know exactly how you feel-- I ran into a guy who's that person to me this weekend. I had just convinced myself to give up but every time I see him... I can't V.V and I almost never see him.
•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.
•The other day I was in CVS and I saw some guy smelling a bottle of shampoo, and I totally freaked him out by running up to him and telling him really excitedly that I do the same thing. Then he was embarrassed and said he was trying to do it all sneakily so no one could see...
•@The NAVY ranter-- Don't be hatin' on the Air Force. I'm a proud Air Force sister. The Chair Force saves the country one cup of coffee at a time ;)

•Why hasn't the IT department been fired yet?
•To the girl in my M/TH American Political Parties class who doesn't shut up,

•Also, person who pointed out I wrongly said ""Timonese"" rather than ""Timorese"": you misspelled ""sanitation.""

mraow.
•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@""try to get laid right now"" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT IN THE SEMESTER. seriously, I admire his courage for asking me out and I do like him, but now isn't exactly the time to start a relationship!

•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because ""you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide"": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@""Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,
I feel like you must be a guy.""
Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ ""Good Christians aren't Republican"":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@""(but of course I have to come back...)"" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.

•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.

•I. Will. Kill. The. Tech. Department.

I have had many, if not all people tell me that you are not worth it...not even the friendship. Too bad that I am my own person, and I am in this world for ME, and I advocate for myself.

•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive).

How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.

•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.

•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

•If you're an Econ MASTERS student you should be able to pronounce ARBITRAGE.
•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you ""down there"", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.
•I love how upper-middle class whites concur in their smug fawning over Nicholas Kristof...nicely done ER editor
•Dear Roommate: The phone is an incredible invention. Believe it or not, you DON'T need to yell loud enough for your mother in Colorado to hear you without the technology. Indoor voice, darling.
•A jog for a first date in the winter...bad idea. Maybe during Cherry blossom time...maybe. Assuming the chick is fit and let's be honest....this is AU we're talking about so that's as likely as correctly formatted rants.
•True that to the long distance relationship comment. Absolutely the single dumbest thing a person can do while in college. #regretslaterinlife

•Dear ""#richgirlproblems"" whose trust fund hasn't come in yet,
Some of us actually have to do something I'm sure you're not aware of called ""work"" to get our money instead of waiting around for someone else's money to come in. Here's some advice while you're waiting, get some real problems.

•@Person in American Political Parties Class ranting about a girl in there class: omg there's a girl like that in my World Politics class. I want to bang my head on my desk whenever she asks a question (i.e. rambles on forever without making a point with far too many likes and ums)
•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!

•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.
•I will take your 29 pages and raise you 43 pages.  And it's only Tuesday.

•@ ""jogging as a first date"" responses. We both run, and at times I feel like it would be a good idea, but i prob wont end up doing it. there are better options out there. btw, did any of you guys read the other answers? your opinions varied from one extreme to the next haha.
•On the subject of favorite memes, mine's Forever Alone.  Because it's true.  And funny.

•@""That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.""
AMEN. If I wasn't absolutely sure I had not written this, I would have thought I wrote it.
•My day has been horrible, but I just realized that I am so thankful for all that I have in my life, I have no right to be sad.
•@#winning...I don't believe you.
•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.
[Editor’s note: The writers of the sex column this fall and last year both used their real names. The lack of anonymity was not a deterrent for them.]
•Dear girl worried you are his booty call: If his facebook doesn't list you as his girlfriend and you are hooking up with him, you're his booty call.
•@""You're wrong to have a long distance relationship"" Sorry you're jealous that your long distance relationship didn't work out while other people's did. I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for 4 years now. 4 more years to go while as my bf just started med school. And I have no doubt at all that we will make it.
•@""All the normal people who read these"" First off, it's sad that you pride yourself on being ""normal"". Have fun with your average life. Secondly, actually eagle rants were created exactly for relationship issues and policy debates. Get a clue.
•That time where you think you might be pregnant during finals...EFF my life.
•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH."" You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.
•Women needs to quit trying to make the marginalized male population from conforming to their standards.

•This I feel like is a legitimate complaint, why doenst AU have a Fall/Spring Fest type weekend, or day, where we bring a cool musical act to campus, and have them perform on the quad? Plenty of other schools have this, and it seems awesome.
•I keep seeing rants that sound exactly like they could be my ex and getting mildly concerned....

•lol the poor kid wondering about the jogging date is probably more confused than ever...
•@AUConservative: I feel like that sometimes but I hail from liberal NJ so I'm used to it.
•I have major, major issues with my professor right now. Like built-up, long-term, legitimate resentment. I'm not an angry person, either.
•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!

•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!

• @hipster girls are gross: You have it all wrong. Hipsters smoke weed. Goths smoke cigarettes.
• I HATE SOCIAL GREEK LIFE. There I said it. It separates everyone into different groups and the rest dont have a group (not that they want one...). Everyone fights for equality and no cliques or bullying but thats what greek like does (a lot of the time, not generalizing).
• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.
• Was it rude to protest Brewer? Yes. You know whats ruder? Racism.
• Dear Eagle's Nest,
I would like to bring your attention to the current dearth of ice cream selections. Never have I seen a more disappointing sight than the empty shelves of the ice cream freezer. One question: Why?

But good try.
• @Am I overreacting?,
WHY are you wearing sweatpants in public? I'd agree with your bf that you should dress a little nicer than that to go out. But if he also criticizes the clothes you wear around the dorm/ in private, that sounds controlling/problematic.

It sounds like someone is a virgin in terms of emotional maturity. Apparently, you still have some growing up to do.

I choose to live a healthy lifestyle and do not appreciate people who selfishly release their toxic fumes into my walking path when they could just as easily get their high from a nicotine patch and thereby avoid harming others with their decisions. I try my best not to make decisions that harm others, and I expect the same respect from others.

• @”I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Actually I have plenty of sex with my amazing girlfriend, thanks for asking.  But I’m glad you view your sluttiness and impulsivity as an accomplishment.  And I admire virgins for waiting for the right person instead of giving it up at a trashy frat party. But I don’t even know why I am bothering to argue with someone who clearly lacks basic human decency towards others and doesn’t care if they blow toxic fumes at innocent bystanders.
• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.

[Editor’s Note: Probably not. Maybe once on Wednesday]
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.

• @""dating five guys means you is a SLUT."" - dating, kissing, and sexing with 5 guys at the same time may potentially qualify you as a slut...or just seeing what's out there. Who am I to judge?? Better yet, WHO ARE YOU!?
• AU students are good at making petitions and protesting ish. Where do all the smokers sign?? Even better, why don't we just congregate on the quad and have one big puff sesh?
• To everyone on the side of Kogod facing Hughes: Hope you enjoy the shows~ We'll be here all week. XD
• To the editor: You make my day with your comments, especially since you love Christine like I do too. Keep on being awesome. :]
• To the smokers: maybe a smoke-free plan wouldn't even be necessary if you actually listened to the 25 feet rule? Just saying, it's not that hard and could make everyone's life easier. Could even save you from dealing with a smoke-free campus policy. Hm, novel idea? Sounds like it to me.
• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]
• @Meet us at 6am Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the fitness center wrestling room.  We won’t judge you, we will train you.""  -... what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I'm kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.

Congratulations! I may not know who you are, but I want you to know that I am proud of you for your progress. I just went today for my initial appointment and I felt so relieved even after that. They are really great at what they do, and I can't wait for another appointment. I hope things continue to go well for you!

• I'm sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished when in actuality it is the hard work of many others over several years who have worked to get a victim advocate on campus.

• Oh boy! the SG dumped more tuition dollars into a Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator! Excellent use of tuition money, especially since there are so many sexual assaults on campus as to overwhelm the existing resources for dealing with them. Just kidding.

• @""Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc..."" Um, maybe some of us are just fulfilling our natural sexual urges and comfortable with our human sexuality? I occasionally sleep around and I am perfectly happy with who I am personally and sexually. I don't need anyone's help. You have no right to try to make me ashamed of that.

• @I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
It's not RHA persey, I'd blame the RA's who don't bother looking up at the front desk when you walk in and offing public safety. This would all be so much easier if we just had freaking security cameras in the dorms like other colleges...

• Hey guess what? Who I sleep with is none of your business unless I'm sleeping with you. Why do you even care? It has NOTHING to do with you. So why don't you focus on your own life instead of judging other people, because no one asked you.
• Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.
• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.

• Can everyone just live and let live? Just quit judging people and just BE? But I guess then there wouldn't be any Eagle Rants...
• Last semester, I had a great time at AU without out-of-class friends.  This semester, I got some and had a blast hanging out with them.  Then they randomly quit talking to me.  Now I feel super down on myself and am not having a good time at all.  Hopefully being around people who actually like me back home over break will help my confidence, because I feel really sh*tty right now...
• @”Again, can we please put the Eagle Rants tab on the website on the LEFT side of the screen, so we don’t have to expand the website each time we open the eagle website in order to access the rants.” Agreed. This is three seconds of my life WASTED each day when I have to expand the webpage. Eagle staff, GET ON THIS.
• @”I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer. That’d be cool. But God could have made pokemon real but instead was like “Nah man. Malaria.” T_T” You’re the kind of guy I wanna marry. A) Are you single? B) Where can I find you?
• @ ""I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked."" If you come to the wrestling room in JFC on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 AM, you will have come to the right place.
• Does anyone else watch TV shows on Netflix, and then once you start a show you become obsessed with it and can’t do your homework until you have finished the whole season? #bing tv show watching problems
• sweatpants girl here, thanks for everyone's advice. It was all very helpful. I've talked to my bf about it and we've come to a compromise. :)
• Can we have a vending machine full of Clif bars? Is that even remotely possible?
• @""Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.""- Handily enough, theres a whole article about this! Right here! Online! Under the ""News"" section!
• @""what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.""
We're a loosely-military training group.  I'm a Marine officer candidate myself, and I design the workouts.  They will broadly strengthen all elements of functional fitness.  Do and don't be intimidated by us at the same time.  We welcome all fitness levels (many civilians are part of the group), but we WILL kick your ass :).  We're done until after break, but you won't regret joining us at 6am on the 20th.  All are welcome.
• ""we don’t judge or insult you for not joining."" Hmm.... I wonder how the term GDI came about??
• @""does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?""
I know it existed as of last semester, at least.  I'm pretty sure it's still going on now.  HOWEVER, I run a completely different club, and I can tell you from experience that those ""official"" email addresses usually don't get checked very often.  Your best bet is to find someone who's in it already that can give you the details.
• How about all the confident and attractive people just keep having lots of great sex with each other, and all the nervous virgins can keep calling women ""sluts"" and f***ing themselves?  Problem solved!
• I'm sick and tired of being judged for being male. I'm actually one of the men who is NOT a terrible person.
• I didn't get a Little. :'( I guess I'll just walk the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
• I've cordially invited many people to my pants party but as of yet no one has RSVP-ed. What should I do?
• No matter, how much I try, I cannot will myself to finish this paper.
• Re the leggings as pants debate, and this also applies to the girl with the boyfriend who doesn't like her frequent sweatpants-wearing: I used to be a anti-leggings gal. Now, I love them. They are mega comfortable. If you by a good quality pair (which doesn't have to be anywhere near expensive), they won't be so tight and revealing. And my boyfriend loves when I wear them, so wins all around!
• lol thyroid - cute.
• I just got rescued by the search and rescue raptor. Yay for being home!
• Dear freshmen who thinks they have more credits than me. You dont. You're just like everyone else at this school who thinks their smart. STFU or GTFO
• @people complaining about 30 year old guy walking around in a building: did you care to see if he worked for AU as facilities or maintenance? did you see if he had been claimed by someone? because I work at a front desk and I have seen strangers ask residents to claim them and the resident will. so double check among yourselves before blaming the people at the desk.
• @• ""I’m sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished..."" If you actually read the email, it wasn't talking about the creation of a victim's advocate position, it was talking about the recent development of confidentiality for that position... which just happened this year.  Also, the email opened up with ""For years.""
• I WANNA MAKE LOVE WITH YOU!
• Regarding the smoking issue:Its irrelevant whether or not smoking is addicting or dangerous. I'm sorry, but if you really are so terrified of second-hand smoke that you cant stand to be around it, then you should have gone to a non-smoking school, instead of making everyone conform to you. This is a matter of liberty. People have the right to do what they want to their body. You do not have the authority to limit people's free choices. Plain and simple.
• @""Where are the AC fans?"" I am a fan of air conditioning.
• Dear Person who quoted Pete's Dragon, I love you.
• Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
• Can we go back to weekly rants?  As much as I enjoy the daily rants, 1) The Rants were all around better when they only came out once a week and 2) I'm sick of these ""hey post the rants already"" rants.
Signed,
A Disgruntled Ranter
• why, why, WHY? cant you just respond
• I was watching Kenan and Kel tonight, and the plot was them trying to get to a double date on time. Their date was to see a movie called Teen McBride. Anytime it was brought up, I only heard Tim McBride... #AUproblems
• @""sweetie, if you want silence don’t sit outside the mud box and don’t tell me what to do cause im a freshman, i probably have more credits than you anyways.""...honey, talk to me in 4 years when you grow up and think twice before you throw lip, because you don't know who you may cross.
• Banana,
Thursday night I met you on LAL. you seemed really cool. thanks again for the genuine conversation.
Apple
• Well all the friends that you knew in school, they used to be so cool, now they just bore you. Well look at them now, already pulling the plow - so quick to take to grain like some old mule.
• @virtually no sexual assaults on campus: Come to Take Back the Night, I (double-dog) dare you. Amazing how your perspective changes when you see that girl from class go up to the microphone.
• So over people hating on Women's Initiative. They go hard in the paint, get over it.
• drunk eagleranting is the bestest eagleranting
• So ready to live with people who understand that mental health is a real thing.
• Come on guys let's all be friends.
• Trouble...feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again.
• I will totally date a girl who wears sweatpants.
• Someone needs to start a petition or awareness campaign or something to cut down on the excessive amount of long-distance relationships (half) on this campus.
• Jose for #
• To my photo TA: If you get any hotter, I may go insane
• LISTEN UP. AU will never be smoke free, not at least until we get our campus plan approved. Where do people go when they can't smoke on campus? The neighborhood directly around campus. This is the same neighborhood that hates AU and the students. As long as the university wants to get the campus plan approved, the campus will never go smoke free. It would be a very stupid decision. (Don't get me wrong though, I totally support a smoke-free campus!)
• @""Is Women’s Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a “rape culture”?"" ARE. YOU. JOKING. ME?? GTFO.
• To the person who responded with a hash tag about straight female conservative republican. I'm glad you people are demonized on campus. How dare you try to deny legitimate members of our society the right to marriage? Or to spend countless tax dollars on drug testing the poor to satiate your appetite for humiliation of those less fortunate than yourself? I've got a hash tag for you. #scum
• I""m just going to let you go, I like you enough to not want you to get hurt by me.
• @ whoever commented on my @5th week at the counseling center.
Thank you! Things are going very well. It's all about attitude and learning to help yourself rather than having someone else help you. It's rather exciting. Good luck with you too! Just remember to trust yourself, be yourself, and believe in yourself! (little words of wisdom I tell myself everyday to keep going, it sounds cheesy I know) LOVE YOUR LIFE everyone! It gets better :-)
• To the girl whose dog just had puppies and who let her sorority sisters take them out on the quad: Those little bundles of joy made my day, and you are amazing. I would love to have one if I could in my dorm! XP They were really so adorable. :']
• to awful lotta high class honkeys: please quit your whining - at least sometimes. it's getting old.
• Gov. Brewer ""deserves to be protested,"" while at the same time we should welcome a ""saint"" with open arms who named a sitting US Senator and Presidential candidate after a sex act... Way to go AU. Disgusting.
• TY TY RAH RAH!! ;) you fine like dynamite.
• T,
YOU'RE SEXY AND I KNOW IT!!
-curiousgal
• So excited to have the room to myself! Zumba every day!!!
• Is there a way I could get an e-mail when rants are posted. Am I too obsessed?
• Please post rants are at a more consistent time (like 5 each day). This week's times have ranged 4:34 pm to 9:30 pm. I need consistency in order to plan my daily schedule of activities. Thanks.
• omg you suck for not responding to my texts. i'm just bored and want you to come have sex with me, sheesh.
• Guys at TDR were making fun of us for staying on campus during Spring Break, calling us nerds.  Not to sound elitist, but I don't think I'm going to be taking life advice from a TDR worker.
• To the kid in my lit class who always disrespects the teacher: I'm not saying I love everything about her. But I'm putting time and money into that class, and if you don't shut up FAST, we will have a problem. PS: your paper was terrible and it DIDN'T fit the assignment. true story. stop whining.

•I like you a lot, but I'm worried if I tell you, hanging out will just get way too awkward.
•""And I have known the eyes already, known them all...""
Thank you other Eliot ranter :)
•Seriously, stop caring about other people's sex lives. It's none of your business what I choose to do. Stop trying to force your values down my throat, because I didn't ask for your opinion.
•congratulations, you read an article on promiscuity. now read one on sincerity and come back when you give a crap about how 'depressed' we're going to be for our 'promiscuity'.
•I intern, have a job, volunteer, take 16 credits, and have a pretty active social life. But what am I thinking about most of the time? How excited I am to have explosive sex with my f*** buddy.
•@Pitt bomb threats--yes.  My house is a few minutes away from one of the campuses.  It is very sad to see this happening.
•Do you want to know why I hate the feminists on this campus? It's because they never shut up- I am in the same sociology classes with you semester after semester and I am tired of hearing what you have to say. The classes I am in are not about feminism, so if you could STFU I would appreciate it...
•You got that something that keeps me so off balance.
•@""there are people in this world who would kill you, your family, your friends, anyone who is opposed to them in a heartbeat. But there are people out there stopping them.""  The world is not black and white like you portray. It’s not ‘the bad guys vs us, the good guys’. People don’t randomly hate other people for no reason.  Maybe think about WHY they hate us and what we CAN DO to rectify this anger (hint: more bombings and killings are not helping the situation, only making it much much much worse).
•@""(I'm going to continue posting this until someone replies that they picked it up... hopefully whoever lost it sees this!)"" Um what if they picked up their stuff at lost and found but they don't read eagle rants. Just sayin...
•I hope the person who ranted ""finally free. you held me down for far too long"" was not my ex-boyfriend. I hope that was not how you felt about our relationship because I thought it was pretty great
•When we first met, I was 100% positive you were gay...Then we became friends and I learned you are straight. I'm still waiting for the day you realize you're gay.....
•@join AUCR's and try to make that more prevalent on campus but please do not create this club” Are you serious here? The college republicans disgust me. I identify as libertarian. But I would totally join the conservative feminist group because women’s initiative doesn’t actually accomplish any substantive policy that would help women. Maybe the conservative group would.
•People say the anonymity of the internet brings out the worst in people. But I couldn’t disagree more. Anonymous eagle rants are so full of support for others and concern for helping our community. It really warms my heart when strangers reach out to ne another. Anonymity is totally awesome. (Or maybe the editor is filtering 10 nasty mean rants for every nice rant that is posted. Hmmm)
[Editor's notes: This editor filters the extremely mean, curse-filled, racist, hateful, etc. Rants.]
•@lost and found ranter: Why don’t you just go to lost and found and ask if someone picked up what you dropped off?
•What does FTL mean? Can we PLEASE stop making up acronyms. K thanks.
•@liberal housewife after college: Me too! Why does everyone assume housewives have to be conservative?  So annoying.  I plan on adopting very liberal parenting methods for my kids and cooking organic vegan meals every night. Yay liberal housewives!
•It’s I’m an idiot WHO likes boys, not THAT likes boys. Do we really need to go over this basic grammar concept yet again?
•So conservative women don’t like the abortion stuff, and liberal women want women to be able to not have to worry about getting pregnant. So can we all just rally together around making birth control more accessible? This leads to fewer abortions (which should make the conservatives happy) and more ability to plan one’s own timing of when to start a family (which should make liberals happy). Do we have a deal?
•@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?
•My word search was defective. Not cool. Not cool.
•How few calories does one have to consume before one has an eating disorder? -scared I may be anorexic
•So I pooped at my boyfriend's apartment and forgot to flush the toilet. He definitely saw. How do I fix the awkwardness?
•Question for women who don’t believe in legal abortion : Do you just sit around wishing that women will stop having abortions or do you actually think about how to rectify the situation, like having over the counter birth control pills so women who don’t want to be pregnant never end up getting pregnant in the first place (and therefore will not need abortions).  This is a serious question, and I would love an answer from a conservative female who opposes legal abortion.
•Remember the time Gary Johnson came to AU? That made my life. Gary Johnson 2012! No more foreign wars. Fixing the deficit by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Marriage equality. Where is all the AU support for this socially tolerant and fiscally conservative presidential candidate? You know he is going to win right?
•Can we really not choose who we fall in love with? This has to be an urban myth. TELL ME THIS IS JUST A MYTH?
•If you were my girlfriend,
I'd respect you absolutely.
I'd protect but not cage you.
I'd write poetry about you, even if you weren't around to hear it.
I'd dance with you into the wee hours of the night.
I'd make you laugh without trying.
But you are not my girlfriend.
You're the girlfriend of the guy who just called me ""broseph"" and told me how hard he was going to ""tap that"". Such is life.
•One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today.
•I hate phone interviews!!! I hate them!! I hate all kinds of interviews!!!! Waaahh!! Can't we just, like, I duno, pretend that my resume says EVERYTHING about me, and leave it at that??? gughhghgh so nervous!
•To the absolute moron who is cheating on his beautiful girlfriend: I'm on to you. The only reason I'm not going to kick your ugly rear from here to Japan is because I know you're getting busy with another guy. I would never out you to the world, but I swear to science if you don't own up to your girlfriend about what you're doing...
•Guys at this school need to learn that ""jokes"" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is. I was involved in a sexual harassment case recently, and it is just wrong for someone to make my situation seem more okay for the perpetrators through ""jokes"".  It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.
•Look over there!
Look over there!
Somebody loves you THAT much!
•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.
here's the big problem. I'm a WOMAN, a PERSON, not a GOOD OR A SERVICE. bite me.
•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually ""promiscuous"" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.
•I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(
•That awkward moment when you go to a party full of alumni who have been called by the phonathon and have to defend the phonathon and its workers to them...
•Long Islanders, please join me in prayer for everyone dealing with the brush fire back home. My heart goes out to everyone, and I hope that by the time this is posted, it will be quelled and there will not be too much damage.
•This eagle rant does not exist.
•All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
All men are Socrates.
•To the 25 year old girl with no close female friends: I'm also 25 and have no close female friends. Just know you aren't alone!
•Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...
•And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
•People can hate all they want on TDR, but their mashed potatoes last night were DREAMY.
•What about military doctors? What about service people who get their MD's? I just blew your minds ranters
•Who just posted some TS Eliot? ...I love you.
•what's the point of take back the night?
[Editor's note: ""Take Back the Night seeks to end sexual violence in all its forms including sexual assault, sexual abuse, dating violence, and domestic violence ... Take Back the Night's goal is to create safe communities and respectful relationships through awareness events and initiatives.""]
•@Pitt Bomb Threats - I was between Pitt and AU...this is reason #1001 that I'm glad I came to AU! But I've been following it and I'm very concerned because I have a lot of friends there :/
•@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?
[Editor's note: Uhh, that's way complicated. Why not just meet up somewhere?]
•when i say i miss you i mean it. when i say i love you i mean it.
maybe we should be more than friends, but i dont know if you feel the same way :( #onemonthtoshowyouiloveyouforreals
•North Korea! Stop sending nuclear rockets in the direction of my family!!!!!!!! seriously, stop. No one will think you are cool.  Not even China.  They don't even really like you anyway.  You don't even really like you. god!
•@""condoms in the wellness center could have holes too"" It's not my logic! it's the logic of AU. now see why I'm ranting?
•Where are the lesbians on this campus?  Is there some secret underground lair that I don't know about?
•Editor...please keep editing for content. It's very disappointing scrolling through a list of boring, repetitive rants day in and day out. I very much appreciate the fact that u are not allowing certain ones, it makes it better for the rest of us :)
[Editor's note: Then this editor gets ""yelled"" at for alleged censorship...]
•To the person on the 6th floor that complained about a black male sleeping on the north lounge couch in the wee hours of sunday morning, i hope public safety comes after your ass someday. people do know him on the floor and the fact that you felt the need to report him based off of his race shows how f-ing ignorant you are. racial profiling at its best @AU!
•You see the sizes S, R, L and you think they'd be small, regular, and large. But no. The creators of tampons apparently wanna fuck with hormone-crazed women. They did the complete opposite and renamed internationally recognizes sizes to super, regular, and light. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
•I need to stop creeping on your facebook/twitter. It makes me miserable yet I can't stop doing it. Anyone else have this problem??
•PLEASE just get up with me already, i enjoy hangingout/hookingup with you but i can't take this waiting game!!
•Why is amword so bad? I feel bad for ranting about how bad it is but the most recent issue was awful. Most of the photographs were pixelated or blurry and some of the text was illegible. Please, get your act together. This isn't even the first time this has happened.
•I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????
•I promised myself not to text you too much in order to avoid looking desperate and/or creepy...But at the same time constantly refreshing Facebook chat waiting for that little green dot to pop next to your name is only slightly less stalkerish. And inevitably more frustrating.
•Lets face it. Mark Zuckerburg is the root of all evil when it comes to academic productivity
•How anybody at the Facebook offices ever get anything done is beyond me. Their stalking skills must be at ninja levels now
•I'm feeling the J. Alfred Prufrock as well.
•I thought my gay-dar was bad, but my ***hole-dar is even worse.
•Running at night is the best
•I love literature so much. I love my classes. I love everything we read, and our discussions. I just hate having to write papers SO MUCH. I've written exactly three sentences in four hours.
•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?
•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

•To the absolute moron who is cheating on his beautiful girlfriend: I'm on to you. The only reason I'm not going to kick your ugly rear from here to Japan is because I know you're getting busy with another guy. I would never out you to the world, but I swear to science if you don't own up to your girlfriend about what you're doing...
•Guys at this school need to learn that ""jokes"" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is. I was involved in a sexual harassment case recently, and it is just wrong for someone to make my situation seem more okay for the perpetrators through ""jokes"".  It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.
•Look over there!

•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.
here's the big problem. I'm a WOMAN, a PERSON, not a GOOD OR A SERVICE. bite me.
•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually ""promiscuous"" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.
•I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(

•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?
•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

2012-04-10,AU,conservative,"Aaron Cohen woke up to a text message around 5:30 p.m. one afternoon saying the AU College Democrats were going to host political consultant Kim Christiansen.
Cohen decided to go to the event, not thinking that anything would come of it. 
Just a few months later, with Christiansen’s help, Cohen was working on Rep. Matt Campbell’s, D-IA, congressional campaign against Rep. Steve King, R-IA.
Campbell went on to win his primary but lost the general election. 
Cohen also worked on a campaign for Francis Thicke, who later became Iowa Secretary of Agriculture. Cohen took a “stagnant operation and turned it around” by raising about $350,000 in a month.
A mere junior in the School of International Service, Cohen now works as a consultant with the objective of adding “value at the community level” to his clients.
He also is the chief communications officer of Sawmill Hollow Family Farm in Iowa, which sells jam — all without ever taking a business class.  
One thing Cohen says he misses about being on the campaign trail is the sense of purpose.
“You wake up every day with a mission,” he said.
On campus, Cohen was both the debate chair of AU Dems and the economic policy chair of the Roosevelt Institute his freshman year. 
Cohen has an air of professional friendliness. But when he needs something done he can be frank and forceful, a skill that came in handy when he was working with campaign staff. 
He says he misses some of the direct contact with the public and making good impressions on people.
“Folks know good folks when they see them,” Cohen said.
When it comes to management, Cohen “loves to talk to interns about strategy in a dialogue” rather than a lecture.
He also feels that if an employee really understands why they are doing something, they are more likely to be invested in the task they are completing. For this reason he admires Sally Shelton-Colby, diplomat-in-residence at AU, because she takes the time to discuss the “why” behind any work she assigns.
In terms of politics, Cohen doesn’t like to be “pinned down” by traditional political labels.  
“I’m a Democrat, but [I’m for] a small and effective government,” Cohen said.
He went on to say that the regulatory system is more difficult for small businesses to maneuver in than big businesses, which stifles growth. 
“I am particularly passionate about growing rural communities,” because he grew up in a small community in Kentucky, “America’s heartland.” (Cohen says he is a fan of the Kentucky Wildcats and has been since before they were popular.)
He is fiscally conservative but socially liberal and insists he is more of a populist than a libertarian.
“I think Republicans have monopolized talking about values, and I hate that because I love talking about why I love America,” he said. 
Cohen is for gay rights and “anti-abortion, pro-choice.” 
“I would never judge anyone,” he said. “I just have a problem with it personally.” 
Whether he is talking about his success in business or as a political consultant, Cohen says, the key to success is knowing how to work with people.
“It’s all organizational theory,” he said.

2012-04-11,AU,conservative,"Usually, when I begin to question college—its reason for existence, my role within it, etc.—I think about “Accepted” (the teen comedy film that came out a few years ago). If you haven’t happened to catch one of its repeated airings on various cable networks, it’s a movie that essentially mocks the entire higher education system. 
Frustrated with the college application process, a few high school seniors decide to forge acceptance from a fake university in order to please their parents. Eventually, their schemes unintentionally lead to the creation of an entirely student-run university, which is refurbished out of an abandoned mental institution. 
While their university becomes subject to a lawsuit by an accredited university, the Hollywood ending reassures us with a victory for the students, who eventually gain official recognition by the board of education. 
Although it may seem like a far-fetched pipe dream, the students in the film display a sense of unified, collective agency that is hard to imagine ever formulating on this campus. 
However, even though I criticize it, I am fully aware that achieving our potential for collective agency is probably the most challenging struggle we can ever face as students. It is a struggle that must be fought not only within the university’s parameters but outside, in the greater societal framework as well.
In May 1968, French students were at the forefront of uprisings that brought university and factory operations to a complete standstill. Groups of student revolutionaries, who espoused ideals of the Situationist International movement, agitated the French population into staging one of the largest general strikes ever recorded in history. Inspired by Marxist ideology, the students were fiercely critical of late-stage capitalism and the alienation it caused between human relationships. 
Two years prior to the strike, students at the University of Strasbourg stirred up a great deal of controversy when they published a pamphlet titled “On the Poverty of Student Life.” 
The students were expelled after printing and distributing about 10,000 copies of the pamphlet, which aggressively promoted Situationist philosophies and called upon students to reclaim their humanity from the mind-numbing depths of the prevailing capitalist system.    
Here is an excerpt from the pamphlet, translated from French, which outlines the students’ views on their predetermined roles:
“Modern capitalism and its spectacle allot everyone a specific role in a general passivity. The student is no exception to the rule. He has a provisional part to play, a rehearsal for his final role as an element in market society as conservative as the rest. Being a student is a form of initiation.”
This past Saturday, I attended a discussion group right here on the campus Quad. Organized as part of the new “Occupy the Classroom” learning collective series, a group of about 30 students met to discuss the topic at hand: our university education within the context of race, class and gender/sexuality.  
Before you jump into skeptical critiques that usually turn up when the “Occupy” label is placed on anything, you should realize that everything we discussed deeply affects all of us as lifelong patrons of institutionalized education.  
Ultimately, our discussions generated a few common themes. 
I noticed that a recurring theme was the existence of a hierarchical and highly individualized structure, which promotes education as a product to be consumed as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, I sensed a deeper frustration with this consumption narrative that seems to dominate all facets of our university education. 
Just as the Situationists declared in 1966, being a student today still seems to resemble taking part in a rehearsal for our future role as passive consumers in the market. They observed, “The student leads a double life, poised between his present status and his future role.”
So, it really comes down to a choice we must make as students. We can simply participate in the charade, reading off our well-memorized lines. Or, we can decide to use our collective agency to subvert the play itself and fulfill our truest desires as we struggle to reclaim our human dignity.

•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.

[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief.

I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion.

•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still.

[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here.

•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

•@""I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left..."" PLEASE SWIPE ME INTO TDR EVERYDAY!!!! -hungry upperclassman with no meal plan and no money
•I REALLY have to poop but don't want to pack up or leave my stuff alone in the library since there is no one around to ask to watch my stuff. SO FRUSTRATING.
•I want to tell you that your ex boyfriend didn't cheat on you with ""just some girl,"" it was me. But I also want to tell you that it wasn't consensual. But I am too scared to tell you, or anyone else. I am so sorry this happened, to both of us.
•So you always used to booty call me but now you don't answer when I booty call you, which is a bummer because I really liked having sex with you
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the dav
•goal before graduation= have sex in the library. any takers?
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" women's initiative
•@""One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today."" Story of my life. I feel so much better knowing that I'm not the only one!!
•The Eagle should learn to stop editing the work of contributing writers when it doesn't have any grammatical errors. The editor completely mangled a key sentence in my article.
[Editor's note: We edit any submissions for clarity, relativity, length and profanity, in addition to grammar and AP Style. But send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we'll look into it. Also, this editor doesn't know who you are or what you wrote, but just wants to point out that Eagle Contributing Writers are part of The Eagle staff who have written a handful of articles; content submitted by members of the AU community to the Opinion page is not written by ""contributing writers;"" it's written by people who submit content and, thus, do not have the title ""contributing writer.""]
•Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy. I know everyone wants to get a word in, but people want to read something different on their rants. :\
•Dear Editor, thanks for censoring my rant (but really), I wanted to take back what I said after I sent it in!
[Editor's note: Anytime!]
•END OF THE YEAR SEXUAL TENSION. Glad to see I'm not alone in this one.
•I'm sorry I disturbed your mom last night on the quiet floor *raises eyebrows up and down repeatedly*
•LADY MARGARET! LADY MARGARET! A kindly bridge-troll let us in... SILENCE BRIDGE TROLL!
•HI PEGGY!!!
•Why do you even come here Papaya? No body likes you.
•Cucumbers have wicked souls...
•And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?
•To everyone who responded to my postings of T.S. Eliot; thank you as your kind words really touched me (no joke). I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.
•No gorganzola on my turkey cranberry salad from the Tavern?!! Oh HELL NO!! THIS WILL NOT STAND.
•Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours.  Is this right? Just wondering?
•WHY are the einsteins employees so slow!??!!? Seriously someone needs to give them a lesson on assembly lines. I'm not hating on the dining staff, I'm simply asking for faster service.
•If I could choose to be a lesbian, I would at this point. I've had too many bad experiences with guys lately.
•What is a Pitt bomb threat? Can someone please explain this?
-confused alum
[Editor's note: This editor thinks they mean the recent string of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh.]
•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.
-a true feminist who care about true issues that are negatively affecting females
•@”@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?” Dang, being editor is complicated.  But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology. Like where you could click a rant and reply to it anonymously and then the person who originally submitted the rant could look at all the anonymous replies and reply to them. Awesomesauce
•morning rants are da bomb
•@”I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.
•It's always nice to pay for a class where the teacher doesn't teach.  Particularly an elementary mathematical modeling class where you have to find your own practice problems on the internet.
•@”What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to. Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married” This is a very logical feminist position. If only the Women’s Initiative were actually this logical.
•P.S. Please pass me elementary mathematical modeling teacher, even though you can't teach...
•Editor: About how many rants are submitted each day that break the rules and are not posted? jw
[Editor's note: Usually only a few. Depends on the day though. This editor can tell its finals season because Rants are getting angry!]
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling.  You make math tutors angry.
•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...
•If you're a guy, Take Back the Night is about realizing how many people you know are survivors and how oblivious you were.
•Loving whoever it was that posted La Cage aux Folles lyrics.
When the world spins too fast
And your bubble has burst
Someone puts himself last
So that you can come first
•Love who ever posted Billy Joel lyrics!!
#longislandgirl
•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..
•to the ranter who started with ""If you were my girlfriend"" ILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. I'm not actually desperate and I don't really want a relationship you seem like a genuinely nice guy, sometimes hard to find here
•To the lady who just called out a room of girls being too loud: rock on.
•@@where do Au students go to party? : ""Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm ""glad"" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•""@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

2012-04-12,AU,conservative,"[Editor's note: This editor understands that it's finals seasons, which means stress and tension; but please, Ranters, follow the rules of Ranting, and please don't be hateful against people or groups of people. Conversation, criticism and view-sharing are one thing; outright profanity, hate speech, racism, sexism, advocating illegal activity and just plain cruelty are another. To the Ranter who once asked how many Rants this editor deletes each day, I take back my response; we've gone well over a dozen today.]



•@women choose lower paying jobs. additionally, you need to look up the statistics that show that (white) women have to have a PhD in order to make the same amount as a man with a B.A. That means that women have to shell out more for more than 4 yrs of education in order to earn as much as a man who paid for 4.
•@women choose lower paying jobs. this is effing bs. how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president? how many of them keep those ambitions? it's because they get shamed into thinking they're not good enough for those jobs by society. I'm ashamed of YOU for buying into that bs.
•A woman with a weapon and knows how to use it. There is almost nothing hotter.
•I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside I've got the month of May, I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way? my girl.
•I want to take your advice and just go with it, but my history keeps me from taking that leap. I wish I could be bold, but I can't.
•So Eaglesecure started sucking again on my computer when I was forced to change my myAU password. I was able to fix it by going into the command line. I wonder how AU students who aren't super-technical computer geniuses are supposed to survive with this thing?
•One is not two countries. One is not meat corrupting. It is important to stay sweet and loving.
•What most people don't know is, if you have enough credits, you can lower your meal plan. Last year I only had 100 meal swipes second semester :D
•I have never saved the world. I have played beer pong. I'm okay with this.
•what makes you think a bunch of anonymous ranters who are probably most all undergraduates who don't know you or your boyfriend at all will somehow help you figure out his mindset and why he hasn't proposed if you as his girlfriend can't. what gives indeed
•@""Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours. Is this right? Just wondering?"" No. You can call the department and anonymously report her.
•Do I Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet–and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
•stop hating on the Eagle/the editor.. it's their job, let them do it because they do it well
[Editor's note: Aww thanks.]
•I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above
•You clearly didn't do any research if you think that women get paid the same as men do for equal work.  Women's Initiative is not saying that a female teacher should make as much money as a male lawyer.  WI is saying that a female teacher and a male teacher on equal ground should be paid the same.  Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.
•@person who didn't give consent- not saying anything does not ever mean it was consented to.. and about AU doing more to educate, if you took a look at Women's Initiative, you would see there is a sub-group called ""Consensual"" that is dedicated completely to educating students about consent. I would look there for more information and I am truly so sorry about what happened to you.
•@Dear SIS: THIS! Seriously, SIS you have your own building that's beautiful and new. Stop infringing on our space.
•Funny how a melody / Sounds like a memory / Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
•i've heard that AU is going on a witch hunt to dig up stuff about fraternities to try to get them kicked off campus in favor of fraternities that aren't as popular on campus but are loved by the administration. why does AU keep making up lies to get people in trouble and decrease the amount of fun????  this pisses me off...where's the transparency?
•@once you're pregnant, it's not just your body.
It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it. And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.
•@""I like you a lot too. We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious. Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward..."" It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Just go for it.
•STRESS
•@legal guardian of younger brother: You sound like a really great guy. If your gf can't give you the support you need then there are plenty of great local support groups for family members dealing with caring for a child with autism. You should check them out. Good luck!
•@sex in the library: sounds good.
•Can't remember my own age. ""Am I nineteen? I think I'm eighteen. yeah,I'm eighteen.""
•I feel like I should've taken better advantage of the potential to hook up and meet people this year. In just a few weeks, thousands of students will graduate and I'll probably never get the chance to meet/hook up with them again...
•@won’t be donating to AU bc of eagle rants: I will be donating money to AU every time they call BECAUSE of the eagle rants. They have helped AU become a community more than any other initiative. They provide a forum for free discussion. They give a daily boost of happiness. And they show how smart and supportive AU students are. And they give alumni a window into current AU happenings.
•I can't take this anymore. By stress blood pressure is through the roof.
•I want to go back to my high school reunion, but I was bullied a lot during high school and Im scared that some of my classmates will still be very immature and mean. Should I risk going or should I skip it and be ""that girl"" who didn't go to the reunion bc I had no friends in high school.
•@using a credit card at TDR: I am also surprised at how few people do this. Newsflash: You don't need (not do I recommend) getting a meal plan. They rip you off. Just go when you want and pay with credit card or cash.
•@”I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.” People like you make me ashamed to be an alum of this university. I’ve read eagle rants every day since the day they were invented and there have never been rants that promote “rape culture”. People who want women to be held to an equal standard than men while drunk are not promoting a “rape culture”.
•@”[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]” This was a rather rude reply. Why not apologize and then say what you said.
•@ranter who thinks rants support rape culture: The editor rightly made you look like a fool by pointing out that the eagle frequent does women’s issues stories especially when it comes to the rape issue (probably more so than any other college in the country due to AU’s extremely powerful lobby from Women’s Initiative being part of student government).  Please think outside your small bubble and learn to accept differing opinions and viewpoints.
•My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got my nerd friends (RPG, Halo, etc), my floormates (drinking, shenanigans), my occupy friends, hispanic friends. Its so goddamn difficult, because I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have to focus on my goddamn GPA and how I'm going to spend my life, when I really want to focus on getting a girlfriend and who I'm going to spend my life with. And at the moment, noone wants to be my girlfriend.
•Dear (who I can only assume to be) freshmen ranters:
You have made Eagle Rants suck.  The majority of what you post aren't even rants, they're just political crap or statements.  The last couple years had REAL rants.  I'm sure you have stuff you dislike about this crappy school of ours, so stop arguing about abortion and complain.
Sincerely,
Bored Upperclassman
•Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...
•I love the idiot hippies who protest events at this school when their hero Che said gems like “The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.”
•Why are you so talkative on words with friends but as soon as we see each other in public you shut right up? One out of ten games on words with friends ends up in a hook up and I want you to be that one!!
•Women’s initiative does not make me feel empowered. It only tries to make me feel like the world is a scary dangerous place full of evil rapist men. I look forward to the soon-to-be created conservative women’s group that will hopefully be much more empowering to women.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain.."" I find therapy very helpful. There student center on campus is great, and there are a lot of therapists in the area. It's good to just have an objective outsider to talk to sometimes. In a fix, videogames are pretty great too...
•I'm always scared that people will think that I wrote rants about them here.  It's kind of creepy how familiar some of these sound.
•OIT used Wikipedia as a source in their email in addition to terrible grammar. EVERYONE SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE AND CLAIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS OK WITH IT.
•@T.S. Eliot: HUGS HUGS HUGS
•@Night runner: See you tonight! :)
•It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle in Wednesday's post. The Editor's done a good job cleaning up Knepper's mess that she inherited. The Eagle Rants are so interesting because we--actual students--get a platform to say what we want. I commend the Editor for not censoring those rants. It encourages debate and discussion. Now you can actually see how much work needs to be done on the feminism front at AU if that's something you care about.
•that awkward moment at phonathon when the person you're calling has the same name as your high school principal and you get really scared for a second...
•I sit next to a beautiful girl at phonathon.
•It has gotten to the point where the only point I am relaxed is when I'm at work. Because I'm not allowed to do school work then
•It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes
•I am an Republican, but what's happening in Arizona is just plain wrong. Seriously someone needs to stop them. That abortion bill makes no sense
•I believe in God and believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. If you don't, then let's be friends
•Who wants to start a Fight Club? once we get enough members we will start enforcing the rules
[Editor's note: Rule #1 - Don't talk about Fight Club.]
•Need to heal emotional pain? Jesus will take the wheel. Prayer helps...and tea...and green trees.
[Editor's note: Hoped this editor edited your Rant right!]
•Welcome to the Emptiness
•Why are you so awesome? I'm weird but cool and so are you...how did we find each other? Thanks OKCupid, even though we didn't meet on there.
•Now that were good and lost lets party
•Why do I close up and get scared when you tell me how much you like me? The feeling is mutual, but it's always been a problem for me to share my feelings. I hope you can see how much I'm grateful that you walked into my life. Perfect timing.
•@ Whenever I e-mail a paper to myself to print, I write nice notes to myself in the subject line so I feel like there are people who love me and think good things about me.
I know its late, but I do this too!!!!!  From now on, I'll think of you as well each time I do this.  :D
•@""Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy."" Shall we rant about men? How about them crazy boys?!
•Roomie, I adore you. And I get that you like talking on the phone in the room, I do too. But somehow your voice is three times louder on the phone than on real life.....
•@""TA is making us pay"" Absolutely not. It may technically be legal if it's not her office hours, but it's rude and not why you should be a TA. There are other great resources-- the writing center, academic support, professors, friends. That TA just sucks. I ask my TA dumb questions all the time and he's fine with it. Better luck next time, and consider mentioning it to your prof.
•""you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life"" I love you.
•@""Lately, I've been going through some major life changes..."" Those are pretty major, I'd be surprised if she was completely not understanding. Maybe bring them up casually in conversation, gauge out her reaction?I have no idea. But if I were her, I'd probably be worried but not want to make you more worried about the new pressures. She might appreciate you bringing it up so she knows it's ok to talk about.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol."" Art? Throw some paint around, get your hands dirty, stop thinking for a bit. :)
•Why does is everyone so effing annoying? I'm so sick of dealing with this.
•I don't understand why my prof has such a high rating on ratemyprofessor... He assigns so much busywork, his grading system doesn't make sense, and the essay assignments he comes up with are just plain dumb. I've never hated a class so much before in my life...and this is my favorite subject, too. :/
•sometimes i think my HIGH libido talks for me...

Yeah. Sure. Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.
•To the T.S. Eliot ranter: I want you here, please don't leave.
•Do you know what's a real tragedy? That WI thinks that people are ignoring the rape of women and that people ""aren't taking rape seriously"". Seriously? If anything it's women who are ignoring the consistent sexual abuse of men by fostering a culture where men are supposed to protect women, and where men ""can't"" be abused. Not only that, but it was incredibly hard to study during ""Take Back the Night"" and it achieved nothing than furthering the goals of the female circlejerk that is Women's Initiative. It is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.
•My boyfriend and I (long-distance) have planned on getting married for a long time. Now he's saying he's not happy, and he might want a break. Suddenly all that Vicodin leftover from my surgery is looking pretty freaking good.

•I hate to break it to you guys, but the original free speech board wasn't taken down because of speech issues, it was taken down because people drew penises all over it.  Turns out some college students still don't really have much to share with the public besides their genitalia.
•@Dear SIS: I was thinking the exact same thing. I realize that Katzen is a big space to put events. I do. But blocking several classrooms with tables all day is ridiculous. Half of those tables were not even used. They were set up around 10 am and were not taken down until around 8 pm. The fact that they don't even let students know what events will be happening when is very inconsiderate.
•Hey ANTH 225! Why do you stare like you have no light going on in your head. When the teacher says ""Hey, there are no wrong answers"" then there are no wrong answers.

Eagle Rants: July/August 2013





Eagle Rants: June 24, 2013





Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




[Editor's note: This editor understands that it's finals seasons, which means stress and tension; but please, Ranters, follow the rules of Ranting, and please don't be hateful against people or groups of people. Conversation, criticism and view-sharing are one thing; outright profanity, hate speech, racism, sexism, advocating illegal activity and just plain cruelty are another. To the Ranter who once asked how many Rants this editor deletes each day, I take back my response; we've gone well over a dozen today.]
•@women choose lower paying jobs. additionally, you need to look up the statistics that show that (white) women have to have a PhD in order to make the same amount as a man with a B.A. That means that women have to shell out more for more than 4 yrs of education in order to earn as much as a man who paid for 4.
•@women choose lower paying jobs. this is effing bs. how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president? how many of them keep those ambitions? it's because they get shamed into thinking they're not good enough for those jobs by society. I'm ashamed of YOU for buying into that bs.
•A woman with a weapon and knows how to use it. There is almost nothing hotter.
•I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside I've got the month of May, I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way? my girl.
•I want to take your advice and just go with it, but my history keeps me from taking that leap. I wish I could be bold, but I can't.
•So Eaglesecure started sucking again on my computer when I was forced to change my myAU password. I was able to fix it by going into the command line. I wonder how AU students who aren't super-technical computer geniuses are supposed to survive with this thing?
•One is not two countries. One is not meat corrupting. It is important to stay sweet and loving.
•What most people don't know is, if you have enough credits, you can lower your meal plan. Last year I only had 100 meal swipes second semester :D
•I have never saved the world. I have played beer pong. I'm okay with this.
•what makes you think a bunch of anonymous ranters who are probably most all undergraduates who don't know you or your boyfriend at all will somehow help you figure out his mindset and why he hasn't proposed if you as his girlfriend can't. what gives indeed
•@""Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours. Is this right? Just wondering?"" No. You can call the department and anonymously report her.
•Do I Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet–and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
•stop hating on the Eagle/the editor.. it's their job, let them do it because they do it well
[Editor's note: Aww thanks.]
•I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above
•You clearly didn't do any research if you think that women get paid the same as men do for equal work.  Women's Initiative is not saying that a female teacher should make as much money as a male lawyer.  WI is saying that a female teacher and a male teacher on equal ground should be paid the same.  Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.
•@person who didn't give consent- not saying anything does not ever mean it was consented to.. and about AU doing more to educate, if you took a look at Women's Initiative, you would see there is a sub-group called ""Consensual"" that is dedicated completely to educating students about consent. I would look there for more information and I am truly so sorry about what happened to you.
•@Dear SIS: THIS! Seriously, SIS you have your own building that's beautiful and new. Stop infringing on our space.
•Funny how a melody / Sounds like a memory / Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
•i've heard that AU is going on a witch hunt to dig up stuff about fraternities to try to get them kicked off campus in favor of fraternities that aren't as popular on campus but are loved by the administration. why does AU keep making up lies to get people in trouble and decrease the amount of fun????  this pisses me off...where's the transparency?
•@once you're pregnant, it's not just your body.
It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it. And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.
•@""I like you a lot too. We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious. Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward..."" It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Just go for it.
•STRESS
•@legal guardian of younger brother: You sound like a really great guy. If your gf can't give you the support you need then there are plenty of great local support groups for family members dealing with caring for a child with autism. You should check them out. Good luck!
•@sex in the library: sounds good.
•Can't remember my own age. ""Am I nineteen? I think I'm eighteen. yeah,I'm eighteen.""
•I feel like I should've taken better advantage of the potential to hook up and meet people this year. In just a few weeks, thousands of students will graduate and I'll probably never get the chance to meet/hook up with them again...
•@won’t be donating to AU bc of eagle rants: I will be donating money to AU every time they call BECAUSE of the eagle rants. They have helped AU become a community more than any other initiative. They provide a forum for free discussion. They give a daily boost of happiness. And they show how smart and supportive AU students are. And they give alumni a window into current AU happenings.
•I can't take this anymore. By stress blood pressure is through the roof.
•I want to go back to my high school reunion, but I was bullied a lot during high school and Im scared that some of my classmates will still be very immature and mean. Should I risk going or should I skip it and be ""that girl"" who didn't go to the reunion bc I had no friends in high school.
•@using a credit card at TDR: I am also surprised at how few people do this. Newsflash: You don't need (not do I recommend) getting a meal plan. They rip you off. Just go when you want and pay with credit card or cash.
•@”I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.” People like you make me ashamed to be an alum of this university. I’ve read eagle rants every day since the day they were invented and there have never been rants that promote “rape culture”. People who want women to be held to an equal standard than men while drunk are not promoting a “rape culture”.
•@”[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]” This was a rather rude reply. Why not apologize and then say what you said.
•@ranter who thinks rants support rape culture: The editor rightly made you look like a fool by pointing out that the eagle frequent does women’s issues stories especially when it comes to the rape issue (probably more so than any other college in the country due to AU’s extremely powerful lobby from Women’s Initiative being part of student government).  Please think outside your small bubble and learn to accept differing opinions and viewpoints.
•My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got my nerd friends (RPG, Halo, etc), my floormates (drinking, shenanigans), my occupy friends, hispanic friends. Its so goddamn difficult, because I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have to focus on my goddamn GPA and how I'm going to spend my life, when I really want to focus on getting a girlfriend and who I'm going to spend my life with. And at the moment, noone wants to be my girlfriend.
•Dear (who I can only assume to be) freshmen ranters:
You have made Eagle Rants suck.  The majority of what you post aren't even rants, they're just political crap or statements.  The last couple years had REAL rants.  I'm sure you have stuff you dislike about this crappy school of ours, so stop arguing about abortion and complain.
Sincerely,
Bored Upperclassman
•Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...
•I love the idiot hippies who protest events at this school when their hero Che said gems like “The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.”
•Why are you so talkative on words with friends but as soon as we see each other in public you shut right up? One out of ten games on words with friends ends up in a hook up and I want you to be that one!!
•Women’s initiative does not make me feel empowered. It only tries to make me feel like the world is a scary dangerous place full of evil rapist men. I look forward to the soon-to-be created conservative women’s group that will hopefully be much more empowering to women.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain.."" I find therapy very helpful. There student center on campus is great, and there are a lot of therapists in the area. It's good to just have an objective outsider to talk to sometimes. In a fix, videogames are pretty great too...
•I'm always scared that people will think that I wrote rants about them here.  It's kind of creepy how familiar some of these sound.
•OIT used Wikipedia as a source in their email in addition to terrible grammar. EVERYONE SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE AND CLAIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS OK WITH IT.
•@T.S. Eliot: HUGS HUGS HUGS
•@Night runner: See you tonight! :)
•It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle in Wednesday's post. The Editor's done a good job cleaning up Knepper's mess that she inherited. The Eagle Rants are so interesting because we--actual students--get a platform to say what we want. I commend the Editor for not censoring those rants. It encourages debate and discussion. Now you can actually see how much work needs to be done on the feminism front at AU if that's something you care about.
•that awkward moment at phonathon when the person you're calling has the same name as your high school principal and you get really scared for a second...
•I sit next to a beautiful girl at phonathon.
•It has gotten to the point where the only point I am relaxed is when I'm at work. Because I'm not allowed to do school work then
•It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes
•I am an Republican, but what's happening in Arizona is just plain wrong. Seriously someone needs to stop them. That abortion bill makes no sense
•I believe in God and believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. If you don't, then let's be friends
•Who wants to start a Fight Club? once we get enough members we will start enforcing the rules
[Editor's note: Rule #1 - Don't talk about Fight Club.]
•Need to heal emotional pain? Jesus will take the wheel. Prayer helps...and tea...and green trees.

•Welcome to the Emptiness
•Why are you so awesome? I'm weird but cool and so are you...how did we find each other? Thanks OKCupid, even though we didn't meet on there.
•Now that were good and lost lets party
•Why do I close up and get scared when you tell me how much you like me? The feeling is mutual, but it's always been a problem for me to share my feelings. I hope you can see how much I'm grateful that you walked into my life. Perfect timing.
•@ Whenever I e-mail a paper to myself to print, I write nice notes to myself in the subject line so I feel like there are people who love me and think good things about me.
I know its late, but I do this too!!!!!  From now on, I'll think of you as well each time I do this.  :D
•@""Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy."" Shall we rant about men? How about them crazy boys?!
•Roomie, I adore you. And I get that you like talking on the phone in the room, I do too. But somehow your voice is three times louder on the phone than on real life.....
•@""TA is making us pay"" Absolutely not. It may technically be legal if it's not her office hours, but it's rude and not why you should be a TA. There are other great resources-- the writing center, academic support, professors, friends. That TA just sucks. I ask my TA dumb questions all the time and he's fine with it. Better luck next time, and consider mentioning it to your prof.
•""you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life"" I love you.
•@""Lately, I've been going through some major life changes..."" Those are pretty major, I'd be surprised if she was completely not understanding. Maybe bring them up casually in conversation, gauge out her reaction?I have no idea. But if I were her, I'd probably be worried but not want to make you more worried about the new pressures. She might appreciate you bringing it up so she knows it's ok to talk about.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol."" Art? Throw some paint around, get your hands dirty, stop thinking for a bit. :)
•Why does is everyone so effing annoying? I'm so sick of dealing with this.
•I don't understand why my prof has such a high rating on ratemyprofessor... He assigns so much busywork, his grading system doesn't make sense, and the essay assignments he comes up with are just plain dumb. I've never hated a class so much before in my life...and this is my favorite subject, too. :/
•sometimes i think my HIGH libido talks for me...
•All I want is to sleep, party, and for someone to hold me when I need it until everything is all the way better.
•While I appreciate the sincerity about the fact we only want to use each other for hook ups... the fact that you can't hold a conversation has made you lose all chances you ever had with me. If you're that boring in conversation you must be boring in bed.
•@""What they promote is the idea that women CAN...""
Yeah. Sure. Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.

•@Increased Premiums: Actually, the law will decrease premiums for everyone. Right now premiums are high to account for everyone without insurance consuming health services without the ability to pay up. When everyone has insurance (especially when those formerly unable to pay can afford it), premiums will be lower because they won't need to account for other people's unpaid health bills. Check your facts before spouting your conservative propaganda next time.

2012-11-09,AU,conservative,"Two filmmakers want you to know that the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lies. 
At least, that’s what filmmaker Oliver Stone and AU Professor Peter Kuznick’s new documentary series wants you to believe. Stone and Kuznick screened an episode of their 10-part documentary series, “The Untold History of America,” and answered questions about the upcoming show and book at Ward on Nov. 8.
Stone is known for making politically charged films, so the pairing for the documentary makes perfect sense. His film “W,” which highlights the personal issues of President George W. Bush, made a splash in 2008, while his earlier military-driven films “Born on the Fourth of July” and “Platoon” were nominated for Oscars in the late ‘80s (with “Platoon” actually taking home the golden statue for Best Picture in 1986). 
Kuznick introduced the series as a “history of the American empire” ranging from World War I to present day, including the presidency of Barack Obama.  
The series, beginning Nov. 12 airing at 8p.m. on Mondays on Showtime, aims to “puncture the common American myths,” Kuznick said. It began as one documentary, based on the 1944 Democratic Convention when President Harry Truman was chosen to be on the ticket above the favorite, Henry Wallace.
The general idea behind exposing this injustice was to highlight the fact that had Wallace, a vocal supporter of equality and peace, been chosen, he could have gone on to become president and avoided Truman’s mistakes.
The first episode, shown at the event on campus, was about Truman’s decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The episode argues that Truman lied to the American people, making them believe that the bombs were necessary to win the war when the Japanese had surrendered three months earlier.
Kuznick and Stone have been working on the project for about eleven years, 11 of which were for filming, since the movie required extensive research. During that time, they also collaborated in the classroom, with Kuznick teaching a course titled “Oliver Stone’s America” at AU. 
The documentary project started when Stone sat in on one of Kuznick’s class and heard the story of Wallace. Stone was immediately hooked, saying he “could not get the story out of his head for years.”
Stone was raised in a conservative household and dropped out of Yale University to volunteer in Vietnam. Kuznick pointed out that several of Stone’s friends from the war claim that he even saved their lives. 
In regards to handling criticism, Stone said he is “empathetic towards these political figures, not sympathetic…and there’s a difference.”
The project was important to Stone because he “felt the urge to do something while [he] is still alive.”
“Only 12 percent of Americans are proficient in U.S. history, and the little that people do know, it’s often wrong,” Kuznick said. “That’s what we’re trying to combat.”
“It’s better to know the truth before you die,” Stone said, “or at least some version that’s a little closer to the truth.”

• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums. And yes. He's accountable to a Board of Trustees. It's how the real world works, and it's designed to benefit you to the fullest. Get. Over. It.

2014-03-08,AU,conservative,"The water delivered to parts of Northwest D.C. was declared safe to drink at 11:30 a.m. March 7, according to the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority. This lifted the March 5 boil-water advisory that affected more than 1,000 nearby homes and businesses, including AU. 
The water management service tested the water at several sites and at multiple times to ensure that all affected areas were now safe, according to a D.C. Water press release.
D.C. Water advised residents at AU on March 5 to boil water before use due to a power outage at the Ft. Reno pumping station. Ft. Reno is located one and a half miles from the AU campus. The reason for the power outage has not yet been reported.
The areas affected are all uphill of the Ft. Reno pumping station, causing those areas to lose water pressure when the station lost power March 5. D.C. Water was not able to send bacterial disinfectant to parts of Northwest D.C., creating concerns of chloroform contamination in the pipes, even when normal water pressure returned, Nicole Condon, D.C. Water’s water communications coordinator said.
Condon said the boundaries of the potential affected area were “conservative” to ensure the safety of anyone living in potentially impacted areas.
Ingesting chloroform can lead to gastrointestinal issues, including vomiting and diarrhea, Condon said. It was safe to shower as long as the water was not ingested, according to D.C. Water. 
University buys water for campus
AU responded to the advisory by distributing 5,900 water bottles, more than 830 gallons, to students, Camille Lepre, assistant vice president of communications, said in an email to The Eagle.
The supplies arrived the morning of March 6, and residence hall staff distributed the water to on-campus residents, Vice President of Communication Terry Flannery said in an email to the AU community. 
AU gave out three water bottles to each main campus resident, Flannery said. AU also sent more bottled water to the Eagle’s Nest and the Campus Store. 
Some on-campus eateries closed March 6 due to the advisory, including
●	Freshii
●	Global Fresh
●	The Davenport Coffee Lounge
●	Starbucks 
These food locations served food, but did not offer fountain beverages or coffee:
●	Elevation Burger, 
●	Subway and
●	Einstein Bagel Bros.
Elevation Burger provided canned soda or a bottle of water to any customer who bought a meal.
Megabytes didn’t sell any coffee or non-bottled water products, owner Tom Gera said. Megabytes was getting ice from outside sources, he said.
Nobody reported illnesses related to the water advisory to AU, according to Flannery. 
“D.C. Water assures us that there is no contamination of the system,” Flannery said in a memo to the AU community March 6. “This water advisory is a necessary health and safety precaution. We are taking steps to provide campus residents with drinking water and to advise faculty, staff, non-resident students and visitors what precautions to take, until the advisory is lifted.”
The Terrace Dining Room was open and was “taking appropriate precautions for food preparation,” Lepre said.
Specific AU areas not affected by advisory
D.C. Water released its original advisory around 6:30 p.m., Condon said. 
AU did not separately notify the campus community until 8 p.m. AU sent more text message and email alerts around 9:22 p.m. and 11:03 p.m. March 5 and 7:23 a.m. March 6. All further communications came from Flannery in university-wide emails sent at 4:08 p.m. March 6 and 3:04 p.m. March 7.
The water pressure returned later in the evening March 5, but students were advised to “continue precautionary use and boiling as directed,” according to an AU alert issued at 9:22 p.m. 
As of 7:15 p.m., low water pressure affected areas along Nebraska Avenue NW between MacArthur Boulevard NW and Connecticut Avenue NW, as well as a section of Wisconsin Avenue NW between Van Ness Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW, according to a map from D.C. Water. 
According to D.C. Water, only parts of AU’s campus were under the advisory. Leonard Hall, McDowell Hall, Hughes Hall, Asbury Hall, Watkins Building, Kreeger Building, the Public Safety building and Jack Child Hall as well as parts of the Mary Graydon Center and Butler Pavilion complex, Beeghly Hall, the Media Production Center, and Hamilton Building are not listed by D.C. Water as affected areas.
The Avalon, Greenbriar and Berkshire Apartments were not within the affected area, according to a list of affected premises provided by D.C. Water.
However, acting McDowell Hall Resident Director Timothy Staples said in an email obtained by The Eagle that McDowell, Cassell, Nebraska  and Hughes Halls were affected as of 7:15 p.m. March 5, as well as the Berkshire Apartments.
AU decided to maintain the water advisory until 12 p.m. March 7 for the whole campus to ensure safety and avoid confusion, Condon said. University Communications and Public Safety did not respond to a request to confirm this information. 
Eagle staff writers Jared Angle, Paige Jones and Samantha Hogan contributed to this report.

2015-01-08,AU,conservative,"Mary Cheney, right, with wife Heather Poe.
Mary Cheney, the younger of former vice president Dick Cheney’s two daughters, will be the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of 2015.
The Jan. 21 event will begin at 8:15 p.m in the School of International Service’s Abramson Family Founder’s Room.
Cheney’s career as a businesswoman and political adviser spans a wide range of occupations including independent strategic consulting, bipartisan government relations and task force management for AOL, according to a KPU press release. She also advised her father and George W. Bush as a campaign aide during the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, according to the press release.
During her speech, Cheney will address the future of the Republican party as it pertains to the LGBTQ community. While working at Coor’s in the mid-1990s, Cheney implemented a plan that ended a 20-year gay and lesbian boycott of Coor’s products. As a married lesbian herself, Cheney’s position on same-sex marriage has been controversial among her socially conservative family members.
Cheney’s appearance at AU comes 10 months after her father’s appearance at the University aroused student protests and attracted national media attention. 
KPU director Tyler Bowders said in a press release that he hopes Mary Cheney’s speech will complement and contrast with her father’s 2014 event.
“I am pleased that KPU has the opportunity to host a speaker who is able to showcase the future and diversity of the Republican Party,” Bowders said in the press release.

2015-09-10,AU,conservative,"Stephen Colbert. Photo by kpop im, Flickr.
My grandparents were big fans of Jay Leno. They liked his traditional monologue, his tried-and-true street bits. They think Jimmy Fallon is for “the youth.” Going by those standards, Conan O’Brien is for “the strange.” Jon Stewart was for “the liberal.” David Letterman was for ""the cynical."" But who is Stephen Colbert for? 
This is the question Colbert strove to answer in the premiere episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which premiered Sept. 8. Much has been made of Colbert leaving his crazed conservative pundit character behind in favor of a more authentic persona. In his first episode on network television, Colbert pushed the envelope just enough to show viewers that he hasn’t lost his satirical bite along the way. 
Some parts of the episode were unabashedly a part of the talk-show trope, especially during Colbert’s interview with George Clooney. There were attempts at deeper conversation, with questions surrounding Clooney’s humanitarian work in Darfur and his much-publicized marriage to lawyer Amal Clooney, as well as a short sequence of videos playing on a fake action film starring Clooney, hilariously named “Decision Strike.” But the segment was mostly fluff, interrupted at one point by the audience’s chants of “Stephen!” I could feel the pure excitement through the screen, threatening to take over the proceedings at any given moment. 
Other segments were more successful because they alluded to Colbert’s previous brand of political satire. An early bit comparing the media’s obsession with Donald Trump to an addiction to Oreos played well with the crowd, who, like myself, had been thirsting to see Colbert’s response to the bombastic Trump. In his interview with Jeb Bush, Colbert was unwilling to let the presidential candidate get away with typical political answers. Colbert threw him some softballs to start, but then compared the Bush brothers’ relationship to the dynamic between himself and his brother Jay, who sat solemnly in the audience. 
“I love my brother, even though we politically differ,” Colbert said during the show. 
Why couldn’t Jeb do the same with George? Jeb tried to slink out of the question, but Colbert waited for a substantive response, unafraid of scaring off other presidential candidates from appearing on the show. I was immediately drawn to Colbert’s commitment to getting something new from his guests, especially when that guest could become America’s next president. 
It was equally as fascinating to witness the moments when the political caricature bled into the host’s real personality, and his willingness to play off of the public’s knowledge of that character. When Jeb commented on the amount of portraits of the host in the newly renovated Ed Sullivan Theater, Colbert aptly responded, “I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit, now I’m just a narcissist.”
I could see the disappointment in the premiere on social media, mostly from dedicated fans who were struggling with the loss of a persona they looked to for the news every weeknight. Sure, this show doesn’t have the same mission that “Colbert Report” fans know and love. It won’t feel as righteous, nor will it claim to be. But it will be authentic Colbert: absurd, conscientious and sincere. The most beautiful and successful parts of the premiere--the introductory “Star-Spangled Banner” number, the startlingly fresh interview with Bush, the flurry of musical joy in Jon Batiste and Stay Human’s rendition of Sly and the Family Stone’s “Everyday People""-- were the most earnest, a quality that late-night television is desperately lacking.

2015-09-11,AU,conservative,"Comedian Jessica Williams speaks about her life in an event co-sponsored by KPU and the School of Communication on Sept. 10.
Comedian Jessica Williams spoke to a crowd of nearly one thousand students and faculty in Bender Arena on Thursday night about her career, urging those who are racial or sexual minorities to share their stories and break into the world of arts.
“Now is a good time to be any sort of minority or however you identify,” Williams said. “Because the stories right now are fucking old. They need you. You have something to offer. You are valid.”
Williams’ remarks ranged from light to serious, often eliciting laughter and applause from the crowd. She spoke about her journey from being raised in a black, middle class, conservative Christian household to becoming the youngest correspondent in program history on “The Daily Show.”
“I feel like I sort of grew up on ‘The Daily Show,’” Williams said. “It was the first time that I was really exposed to things that were just racism and pure hate.”
The writer and performer was hired for the show in 2012, while she was still in college at  California State University, Long Beach, and has been a correspondent for the past three years. She said she originally gained her sense of humor from her grandmother, who was physically immobile and watched a lot of television. Williams remembered watching comedic programs like South Park, Conan O’Brien’s late night show and Saturday Night Live while she was growing up.
“I saw that this was something that took her out of this prison that her body became, and I knew I wanted to do something like that,” she said.
Telling stories about her experiences with race, gender, mental health and religion, Williams said that her character as a correspondent is driven by raw emotion, especially when a tragedy or instance of police brutality has occurred.
“It's just the same circus, and the media perpetuates it, and we're supposed to just sit here,” she said. “A lot of times I feel like I am walking around just mad. I'm angry all the time. Sometimes I feel like I can just scream at any time because I'm walking around with this nuggets of pure anger [in me].”
During her remarks, Williams shared a clip of one of her more popular segments from the show, called “Frisky Business”, which mocks “stop-and-frisk,” a police tactic in New York City often used to profile young black residents. She said that piece was the first time she truly found her character.
Afterwards, Williams took questions from the crowd, including one from an Eagle reporter about where she draws the line between freedom of speech and sensitivity towards others when making jokes.
“I can only draw that line for myself personally because, at the end of the day, the only thing I can control is me,” she said. “Where I draw the line is things that push on or oppress people that don't need it.”
The event was sold out after 1,000 tickets had been made available online to the AU community. Williams ended her appearance on a positive note, saying that she felt less alone in her work because of other people of color and women who have told her how much they connected with her bits on “The Daily Show.”
“We all feel that sort of craziness, we feel that we are in this word where things are out of control,” she said. “What helps me sleep at night is knowing that I am not the only person, and if that is the case then I can create something or create art that people can identify with.”

2016-08-10,AU,conservative,"Krista Chavez (pictured left). 
In 2016, voters are using their relationships to swing the vote toward their own party. 
According to a new study by the Pew Research Center, few Clinton or Trump supporters look for friendships in the opposite party. Among registered-to-vote Trump supporters, only 4% have “a lot” of close friends supporting Clinton. This number is more dramatic in relation to registered-to-vote Clinton supporters, with only 2% saying they have “a lot” of close friends supporting Trump. Further, Trump supporters have a lot (44%) of friends supporting Trump, and some friends (38%) supporting him. 16% of Trump voters have “just a few” or “none” of their friends swinging for Clinton. The same goes for Clinton’s voters, with 31% saying they have no close friends who support the opposition.
The data tells us that people are less willing to build friendships with those who support different viewpoints. This explains the widespread polarization in media, pop culture, communities, and the United States as a whole. The age bracket of 18-29 -- Millennials, including college students -- reflects this isolated trend. With 58% of Clinton supporters saying none of their close friends support the other candidate, only 34% of Trump supporters say the same.
As I have different viewpoints than the majority of my peers on AU’s campus, these figures do not surprise me. Another study by Pew supports my feelings by reporting that 40% of Millennials ages 18-34 support the government censoring “offensive” speech. The data highlights the decline in acceptance of other views in America, and how alternative opinions are viewed on modern college campuses.
Examining this idea more in depth, OKCupid released a new study detailing how partisanship actually influences a person’s dating profile. Their research concluded that “the amount of OkCupid users who couldn’t date someone with opposing political views is at 50% — a number that’s been rising since 2008.” 
Apparently, voting even counts when seeking a proper life partner. Personally, this is not surprising. Most people seek a partner who holds their same values that can grow and thrive in a family. Therefore it is only logical that one chooses another to spread these values within the home.
The OKCupid study found that in dating profiles, liberals are likely to feature interests like “The Daily Show, Broad City, NPR, podcasts, and weed,” and conservatives are likely to use words like “Jesus, Faith, Country, and Guns.” Bipartisan overlaps for words include “INTP (a Meyers-Briggs personality type), Outlander, Indiana, iPhone, Adventure, Honesty, and Considerate.”
Examining these polls, both parties express different values that are not only attractive when voting, but also when choosing friends and partners. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is upsetting when a large portion of the U.S. youth population is wary to hear different viewpoints, unregulated speech, and expression. 
As a founding principle of the United States, free speech was intended to support minorities from the dictatorship of the majority. It appears that many millennials do not feel that way, especially when choosing friends and spouses.
At the end of the day, it is a good thing we can all agree: honesty and consideration are good characteristics for partners. But maybe appreciating our partners and friend groups’ differences can be just as valuable.

2016-09-12,AU,conservative,"On Labor Day, Phyllis Schlafly died at age 92. 
Immediately in response to the conservative icon's passing, the intolerant wing of the political left erupted in applause. Tweets arose, ranging from ecstatic approval of her passing, to disappointment that she lived such a long life, to one tweet which expressed hope that Mrs. Schlafly was murdered. 
Charming.
I won’t even feign surprise at
this animalistic behavior, as it mirrors the type of joyus celebration that occurred after the passing of
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year. After this most recent
instance, it seems clear that seeing the human side of someone who you disagree
with is an idea that the left finds abhorrent. I find it highly ironic that a
group that so nobly and passionately fights for the equality of all people
seems to forget about the different types of opinion that exist alongside the
different classes, races, creeds, etc. However, in this condemnation of the
left, I do not mean to excuse anyone of my own party who may, in the future,
celebrate the inevitable eventual passing of people like Trevor Noah or Lena Dunham.
But I will not be one of them.
There is little substance to the
hasty justification that Mrs. Schlafly does not deserve respect because, as
many on the left hypothesize, she spent her entire life mercilessly working to
“oppress” her fellow women by vehemently opposing the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA). It is her right as a citizen to disagree with this proposed amendment to
the Constitution--and to oppose it vocally. She did so respectfully, and mostly
on the legitimate grounds that she
believed that the amendment would take more rights away from women by forcing
them into the draft.
Being opposed to drafting women
is a position that is still held today, as an amendment to the federal budget that
would have required women to do so just narrowly passed the Senate but failed in the House back in June. Schlafly’s position, as
one might guess, has grown increasingly unpopular with time; I will acknowledge
that she set the gender equality movement back a substantial amount. It is
perfectly reasonable to disagree with her position, or even to hate her. I’m
not suggesting that you attend her funeral, wear black for the rest of the week
or celebrate her life in any way. I simply find it mind-boggling that people
are so quick to celebrate the end of a life.
While I’ll admit that I certainly
do not have any great love for Phyllis Schlafly’s opposition to the Equal
Rights Amendment, as a budding activist myself, it is hard not to credit her as
being one of the top political activists of her time. There is a very important
lesson that people of all political opinions can learn from her. With her work
against the ERA, she showed how one woman can change opinion on a “sure thing”
piece of legislation with sheer willpower,
political prowess and rhetorical might.
Sure, it might be easy to get
swept up in the celebration of one of your least favorite talking heads. Just
remember that she is someone’s mother.

2016-10-12,AU,conservative,"Sitting on my couch Friday afternoon, I got the flurry of the usual alerts from CNN, Fox, etc. that arrive when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says or does something outrageous. 
I opened a new tab in my browser, went to the Washington Post, and watched the leaked video of Trump on a bus before an Access Hollywood taping with former host Billy Bush in 2005. 
Listening to it, I was absolutely horrified. A grown man running for president of the greatest superpower in the world described violating women against their will. I know he may not have actually raped or sexually assaulted a woman, but he joked about a physical attack against another human being in the same tone that he would when talk about what sandwich he may or may not have previously consumed for lunch that day.
Using his own words, Trump lost the respect of many in his party and his country. He disregarded violence as ""locker room talk"" and showed the American people that he cannot be the leader of our nation. 
With his own words, he proves to us that he cannot be a just and stable leader. He proves that he does not care about the family. He proves that he does not care about the law.
As a conservative, I believe in the strength of the American family. Thinking of my mother, sister-in-law, future daughter and myself, I would never want them to be in a country led by a man who believes that women are playthings, to be touched and grabbed at any man’s will. Thinking of my father, brother, future husband and future son, I would never allow them to speak about myself or another woman in such a manner. By dehumanizing violence, Trump threw out the family values on which the Republican Party is based.
When speaking about the Hispanic community, the Khan family, the Muslim-American community, a Mexican-American judge, and more, Trump proved to the American people that he is unfit to be our leader. Most recently, he has proved to women that he does not respect their privacy. He has proven to the Republican Party that he is not worthy of our support. 
While I will not support Secretary Hillary Clinton in this election either because I cannot and will not support her big-government policies that steal from the American worker, to the conservatives still considering a vote for Trump, I say this: think about your values, your positions, your own future, and the future of your children. The person presented to us this election cycle has shown no respect for these key values, and I don't anticipate him changing any positions. I know you are scared for the future, as I am, but I encourage you to vote with your conscience and think about what kind of future you want for America. 
I suggest protecting down ballot candidates and ensuring the Republican majorities in Congress so there can be some balance, and that you consider third party candidates. However, if you decide to vote for Trump, I do not shame you. This election is difficult, and I do not blame you for voting for change, but I do not believe the change America needs can be found in Trump.
We are a great nation full of diverse people, and we have great powers as a people through our Constitution and Bill of Rights. We must think of those when voting. 
As a conservative, libertarian, Hispanic woman with deeply held values in the free market and principles of liberty, I cannot - and will not - in good conscience vote for Donald Trump this November.

2016-10-13,AU,conservative,"This November, across all 50 states, Americans will vote for a candidate for president. These people have traveled all around America, spending money, time and effort to win your vote. Although they disagree on many issues, each organized candidates have kept their arguing to a respectful minimum, in an effort to focus on themselves and the issues. That’s right, this election year Americans will vote for Green Party presidential candidate, activist and Doctor Jill Stein and Libertarian Party presidential candidate and past New Mexico Governor, Gary Johnson!
  If you're like most Americans and don’t know who Johnson or Stein are, that’s perfectly okay. It's not your fault there has been a distinct lack of media coverage for these candidates. However, if you’re a political WONK or a third party supporter, then chances are you know exactly who they are.
  Throughout this election, I have been shamed for sharing which third party candidate I will be voting for. The problem is that most of the shaming does not have to do with my candidate’s ideals or policies, but rather it is due to the fact that they are running for office to begin with. Although it may be evident on my online social media, offline and in person I have tried to keep my opinions to myself. 
However, friends, family and some professors have personally called me out and told me that my vote is either wasted, or indirectly supporting the candidate they dislike. Both Trump and Clinton supporters have used the same argument, saying that by not supporting their candidate that third party voters are supporting the candidate they specifically hate. While hate is a strong word, it seems appropriate to describe this election cycle.
  It’s understandable for voters to vote for a candidate they believe to be the lesser of two evils, however, that said, voting for a candidate that someone believes in is definitely something that should be pondered first. For me, along with many other Americans, voting third party is an investment in the future. Although the odds are heavily stacked against us, voting was never supposed to be about supporting a winner, but about actively organizing and supporting our ideals.
  The argument has been made that voting third party is a privilege. So far voting Democrat on American University’s campus seems like a privilege, with a heavily liberal leaning voice. Although third party voters would like to be accepted, many are instead shamed online and on campus. The same shaming can probably be seen at the many heavily conservative colleges in America. The fact that voting itself is looked at as a privilege is undemocratic. Many who perpetuate the argument usually cite race or economic inequality as a reason to vote for their candidate, saying that their nominee is the only chance in saving people of color or those from poor backgrounds. 
However, when looking at Clinton and Trump’s records and policies, both seem to care very little about both people of color and those from a low economic status. Both have supported the war in Iraq and increasing military intervention across the Middle East. Trump advocates for waterboarding, deporting and a downpour of bombing across the Middle East. 
Clinton hasn’t really touched upon her plans for the Middle East during the campaign, however, she has shown them extensively during her time as Secretary of State through helping to tear apart the Middle East and causing destabilization in countries such as Libya and Syria, thus giving rise to ISIS and fueling the refugee crisis. Clinton even approved drone strikes, which continue to kill many innocent bystanders, via her smartphone. 
Another country affected close to home is Honduras. Taking into account both Trump and Clinton’s records and views, it seems that privilege would be voting for either two party candidates, and turning a blind eye to the awful and violent policies they have and will continue to support. Although both Johnson and Stein have struggled extensively sharing their knowledge of foreign policy, both have actively supported anti military intervention.
  According to Real Clear Politics, evaluating the polls of Fox New, NBC, Bloomberg and 10 other well-known news sources, around 10 percent of Americans will be voting for either Stein or Johnson this election year. Last week both candidates were left out of the debate, due to a lack for either being able to achieve a 15 percent polling average from three major news organizations, something that even Clinton supporter Sen. Bernie Sanders said was too high. In effect, 10 percent of the nation was silenced during both presidential debates, which is run by both Republicans and Democrats.
  This election I have made my choice for which candidate I will be voting for. It’s perfectly fine to vote for Trump or Clinton this election if you want. However voting for either Jill Stein or Garry Johnson is not a wasted vote, protest or a privileged vote. This election does not just regard the presidency, but includes many local public offices. Voting on a local level for third party candidates or independents should not be discouraged as well. Picking on third party candidates is a petty and last minute act of desperation that both parties are trying force on the American public, and needs to stop. 
Purely pressuring people into voting for your candidate only annoys them, and doesn't change anybody's mind. If you want to convince someone to vote for your candidate then do it with respect. Find a common ground and refrain from name calling. That being said, here are links attached to both Dr. Jill Stein and Gov. Gary Johnson’s campaign sites, if you would like to learn more.

2016-11-11,AU,conservative,"In a week full of tension on campus, students and faculty came together in solidarity against members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who picketed outside of the University on Friday afternoon.  
As the sun began to set, between 500 and 800 students and supporters gathered along Massachusetts Avenue to rally against the ultra-conservative church group, whose members came to protest the resources the University offers to transgender students. 
Westboro Baptist Church is based out of Topeka, Kansas, and is known nationwide for its hate speech and protests against LGBTQ, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, political and Orthodox Christian communities. 
University police were present to keep students safe and prevent them from infringing on the rights of WBC members to protest. Approximately 25 faculty members were also adorned with red safety vests to keep students on University property, Senior Director of Student Activities Michael Elmore said. 
“We just want people to be as safe as possible, so [the red vests] are just simply a measure to identify who’s out here to support students and to try to work to make sure everything goes out safely,” Public Relations Manager Rebecca Basu, who was one of the faculty in a vest, said. 
Three members of WBC attended the protest and sang popular songs replaced with hateful lyrics. But their songs were drowned out by the chants of students saying “Love trumps hate!” and “Trans lives matter!” Students shouted out cries of goodbye and cheering commenced when the WBC members were escorted down Massachusetts Avenue at 4:30 p.m.
“[Transgender rights] is such a prevalent issue nowadays and I feel like if I don’t do anything and just stand back they would have more of a reason to shout out what they’re shouting out… it’s standing in solidarity with the people we appreciate — our class members, our peers, our student body,” Abrar Rahman, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences, said. 
Not all students found this rally to be a productive use of time however. 
“The fact that we keep giving people like this attention keeps them going,” sophomore Joshua Kerobo said. “Like if we had just stopped and people leave… it would have already been done, it would have already been over. They would have just stood there and been gone, they would have been singing to themselves and then they would have left.”
Caution tape kept students on University property, but that didn’t stop students from holding signs of LGBTQ support. As rush hour traffic began to roll by, cars honked their horns and chanted support for counter-protesters. 
“Here at American University, everyone is a part of the community no matter how you identity, no matter what you choose, no matter how you want to be seen,” Kendall Lawrenz, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, said. “We choose to see people the way they would see themselves, and I think it’s important to honor that. I think a group that comes here and tells us how we should see other people has no place in America, has no place at American University.”

2017-01-11,AU,conservative,"This article originally appeared in The Eagle’s December 9 print edition.
Looking back on this election, it has been a rough year and a half to be a Republican woman. Facing ridicule from every side, listening to your party’s nominee criticize women and trying to choose between compromising your values and voting for necessary change at the ballot box was maddening.
However, it is over now. The next President of the United States will be Donald Trump, and it is time for the nation to face that reality and move forward with a positive agenda for change.
Although I did not vote for or support Donald Trump during his presidential run, I wish him the best in office and I truly hope he governs well. Praying for his failure at this point does not hurt his reputation, but the American people as a whole. That is why we must be cautiously optimistic: we must support him and guide him on a path toward righteousness while at the same time be willing to criticize his administration when necessary.
Further, President-elect Trump will be complemented by both a Republican House and Senate, not to mention 33 Republican governors, 26 states under the control of both GOP executive and legislative branches and six state legislatures controlled by Republicans with Democratic governors. This is the GOP’s moment, and the party must deliver if it wants to maintain and grow party support in 2018 and 2020.
To do this, I recommend the following conservative policy proposals to limit government power, control spending, cut government waste and prove that success can be achieved under a Republican government.
Step 1: Reform the criminal justice system
One of the most corrupt institutions in American government is the criminal justice system. It is designed to over-incarcerate low-level, nonviolent offenders. Upon leaving prison, these offenders cannot successfully find a job due to their criminal records and become dependent on less-than-legal means to make ends meet. Often, they are reincarcerated and enter a viscous cycle known as “recidivism.” 
This issue disproportionately impacts minority groups, and it must be stopped. Moreover, the entire system costs a tremendous amount of unnecessary tax dollars (an additional $42 million in 2017 from FY2016) and needs to be consolidated and reformed immediately. To address these issues, a bi-partisan coalition of representatives has already proposed several bills to reform them.
Another way to improve the criminal justice system would be to expand programs that assist ex-felons in finding jobs after leaving prison. Companies like Apple, Hilton Hotels and Chick-fil-A hire returning citizens to begin reintegrating former felons into society. By using public-private partnerships with these and other companies and vocational organizations, the government can prevent the cycle of incarceration from continuing to plague our system, destroy the family and consume our tax dollars. 
Step 2: Simplify the tax code and loosen ridiculous regulations
There are areas in Trump’s tax proposal where taxes among certain higher-level income groups will be higher than under Clinton’s plan, according to the Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a center-left tax policy group. This is significant because Clinton claimed she would use taxes to crack down on the upper class.
Scholar Leonard Burman notes, “Trump’s 33 percent top rate kicks in at a fairly low income level for singles: $127,500 in 2017.” The Trump tax plan could generate more levels of revenue. It would remove personal exemptions and tax breaks which would consolidate the current 74,608-page-long federal code, making it more fair. If he implements this plan, it will cut the burden of taxpayers while not letting off the wealthier economic groups from contributing a sizable amount of income in taxes. 
It would also consolidate and simplify the tax code. By simplifying the code, this would allow Americans to better understand how the federal government collects tax dollars. If Trump goes through with implementing this plan, it would save Americans a lot of time, money and headaches trying to understand all the loopholes and tax breaks in the system of which big businesses take advantage.
Step 3: Create an environment inclusive to all Americans
Often, the political left claims that the GOP is waging a “war on women.” However, 42 percent of Donald Trump’s voters were women, especially college-educated white women, 49 percent of which voted for the billionaire. This happened despite Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emphasis on Trump’s history of bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monumental question is why these women still voted for him, and unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll have an answer until we actually ask these voters. Usually, these types of allegations kill political careers, such as was the case with Anthony Weiner. And yet, it has not derailed Trump.
The GOP needs to emphasize the benefits of limited government for minorities. While protections are necessary to ensure that discrimination is prevented, all people can be most empowered by freedom, not the state. The GOP has this platform, but it does not use it. To better project this ideal, Republicans should be more open to comprehensive immigration reform that opens the door to increasing legal immigration. Further, women could greatly benefit from voluntary Personal Care Accounts that encourage financial saving for leave time. Pre-tax dollars would be saved in this PCA, and it would be used to replace or supplement income during periods of leave. This would help the problem of paid leave or medical issues. Women and minorities in the GOP also need to be louder and prouder, stand up in the name of limited government and run for office.
Although I remain cautiously optimistic, I truly hope that the Trump administration is successful in its endeavors-not just for Republicans, but for all Americans. If he fails, we will all have to live with the consequences.

2017-10-12,AU,conservative,"“Fine messes”, “just wars”, “reliable rumors,” and American political “science.” I get a kick out of fun oxymorons. Okay, that last one isn’t so fun. It’s just painfully true. Let me explain.
Last week I stumbled upon a Ted Talk from a psychologist named Jonathan Haidt. Haidt is a New York native, a professor at NYU, and self-proclaimed liberal. He has a son and a wife, both of whom share his progressive world view. He is not a bipartisan man. Yet, in his talk, “The moral roots of liberals and conservatives,” Haidt says this: “...If we are going to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our lack of moral diversity is going to make it harder.” 
Haidt may be a Liberal, but he’s also a psychologist. He understands what it means to live in an echo chamber, and how dangerous it is to do so. Haidt’s point ends up being this: Liberals’ roles are to tear down faulty institutions and conservatives’ roles are to keep the ones that work. It’s an intricate balancing act -- Haidt even compares it to the yin and yang of Daoist mythology. 
American politics is in such a rut because too many liberals and conservatives hate each other’s guts. Now more than ever, our country is divided. Donald Trump’s election has resulted in not just a proposal for a border wall, but a real wall -- a partition between helpful conservative beliefs and helpful liberal beliefs. It’s so bad that in some parts of the country, “liberal” or “conservative” have become dirty words. They shouldn’t be. We need both. 
Just like Haidt, I’m firmly in the liberal camp. Both my parents are liberal, my father even radically so. But that doesn’t mean I should hate the other side. If the liberal’s role is to tear down the faulty institutions, then I should reserve my hate for the parts of “the other side” that need a wrecking ball and maybe even some dynamite for good measure. Apply the change not liberally (pun intended), but discriminately so.  
For example, the free market is an institution worth keeping.  Even Bernie Sanders, the patron saint of college socialists, would never propose something as radical as completely dismantling the free market. Despite its flaws, while plenty, there’s no denying the sheer efficiency of mostly unrestricted trade. The free market is the one of the most criticized aspects of America mainly because it is most successful. 
What are the institutions worth dismantling? In my opinion, there are many. The idea of traditional marriage is a good example. In 2015, the voice of the left, and even much of the right, agreed that to keep gay marriage illegal was to stay on the wrong side of history. So, it was changed. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the idea of gun control has once again sprung to the forefront of conversation. If it is popular enough, then it too shall change -- a triumph for liberalism. 
It may seem like there are exponentially more ideas worth changing than keeping. Indeed, it’s true. But this shouldn’t be misconstrued as a failure on conservatism’s part. Ideas become outdated or stop working. In the case of gay marriage, the idea was always wrong. Consequently, it’s easy to blame conservatism for everything wrong with America. After all, aren’t conservatives the ones supporting these archaic ideas? True, but they are not unique in doing so. Every established idea has had at some point popular support. Conservatives supported it, and liberals too.  
Yes, the ratio is skewed. And yes, the bad ideas often outnumber the good. But that’s not a terrible thing. That’s progress.

2019-03-08,AU,conservative,"John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate, has been named the 2019 Wonk of the Year, the Kennedy Political Union announced today. 
The politician will speak to students about the future of the U.S. and bipartisanship on March 21 in Bender Arena at 7 p.m.
Kasich began his career in 1978 as a state senator and later became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, notably serving 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee.
After leaving Congress in 2000, Kasich returned to politics in 2010 when he ran for governor of Ohio. He served two terms in the office before leaving the governor’s mansion in January. He is currently a senior political commentator for CNN.
In 2016, Kasich became a household name when he ran for the Republican nomination for president. Kasich “presented himself as a moderate alternative to front-running candidates,” KPU wrote in its press release. During his presidential run, he received the Republican endorsement from The New York Times but ultimately did not have the votes to beat Donald Trump, the party’s eventual nominee. 
“With a perspective unique to a public servant experienced in both the public and private sector, leadership on all levels of government, and work with major media organizations, Kasich will bring thoughtful discussion to American University on the topic of bipartisan solutions and the future of American politics,” KPU wrote in its press release. 
While many analysts place Kasich in the moderate wing of the party due to his views on immigration and other issues, critics have noted Kasich’s conservative record on abortion rights, same-sex marriage and cuts to public education, among other actions. 
Kasich once strongly opposed same-sex marriage, but following the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal in all U.S. states in 2015, he said the country needed to accept the decision and “move on.”
According to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Kasich signed 17 anti-abortion measures into law between 2011 and 2016. Those measures defunded Planned Parenthood and banned abortions from public hospitals as well as from receiving public funds. Ohio Right to Life has credited Kasich for the decline in abortions in the state.
The University has recently introduced initiatives promoting bipartisanship, including the launch of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics last fall. The institute, which is focused on creating bipartisan policy solutions, launched with a September event featuring former Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee). 
Previous Wonk of the Year recipients include Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist Malala Yousafzai, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, former First Lady Laura Bush and former President Bill Clinton.
The event, co-hosted with AU College Republicans, will require an Eventbrite ticket and valid AUID for students, faculty and staff. Doors will open at 6:20 p.m.

2020-09-10,AU,conservative,"The Mary Graydon Center, pictured in 2016. 
American University is projecting a potential budget loss between $104 million and $116 million for the 2021 fiscal year, resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, according to Matthew Bennett, AU’s vice president and chief communications officer. 
In an email to The Eagle on Thursday, Bennett said that some of the major causes of the shortfall include lower enrollment, a 10 percent tuition discount, and the loss of revenue from housing and dining, as the fall semester is essentially entirely online.
“The exact final shortfall will ultimately be determined by final enrollment numbers for the entire year, operating status in the spring, and other factors that are not yet finalized,” Bennett wrote.
Personnel and financial aid make up the largest share of expenses in AU’s nearly $777 million fiscal year 2021 budget, according to the University’s budget report, which was released in 2019. 
AU is considering an additional furlough week for University employees and is collecting input from the community regarding potential furloughs, according to Bennett. He wrote that AU is not considering large-scale layoffs, and the University “has not instituted any layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The Eagle previously reported that 180 food service workers were furloughed in March, after AU extended its virtual format for the spring semester. 
The University is also not considering cutting financial aid to reduce expenses, Bennett wrote. In June, AU committed to dedicating an additional $13 million to financial aid. 
In May, President Sylvia Burwell told the AU community in an email that, “using a more conservative approach,” the University could lose $100 million in revenue and increased costs for the 2021 fiscal year. To address the deficit, Burwell announced that AU would pause new construction, cut salaries for her and her cabinet, implement a hiring freeze, and stop merit increases for faculty and staff making more than $40,000 annually.
“We are acting decisively and prudently to mitigate these shortfalls, including extensive efforts to meet enrollment goals for current and incoming students,” Burwell wrote.
In a June email to the AU community, the administration announced that the University would suspend matching contributions for employees’ retirement plans from August 2020 through January 2021. The email said that AU is also using unrestricted endowment income to help mitigate the impact of the University’s budget deficit.
In 2019, the Board of Trustees voted to raise tuition by three percent in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. When AU reversed its hybrid fall 2020 plan on July 30, deciding to host classes entirely online and cancel virtually all on-campus housing, the University announced a tuition reduction for undergraduate and graduate students by 10 percent. AU discounted tuition for online classes this summer.
The price of tuition for the fall 2020 semester is $22,744 for full-time undergraduate students taking fewer than 18 credits.
Tuition and fees make up 92 percent of AU’s revenue, Burwell wrote in her May 26 email. In addition to discounting tuition for the fall, AU eliminated or reduced some fees for the semester, including the sports center and student activity fees. 
AU is allocating half of the over $6 million in COVID-19 relief funding it received from the Department of Education toward financial aid.
AU is one of many colleges in the United States facing financial loss amid the COVID-19 pandemic. George Washington University, which has higher enrollment than AU, estimates a $220 million budget shortfall. 
This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

2020-10-09,AU,conservative,"American University students voiced a variety of concerns following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, who will replace late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if confirmed by the Senate. 
From a shortlist of conservative political figures such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Trump ultimately decided on Barrett, who is known for her conservative stances on abortion, the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ+ rights, amongst other issues. 
The Executive Board of AU College Republicans said in a statement that they support the nomination. 
“In this time of unprecedented tumult and uncertainty, it is especially imperative that the Supreme Court be at full capacity, to remain a steady defender of the Constitution,” the AUCR Executive Board wrote in a statement released Oct. 2. “We strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett and look forward to her many more years of service to the United States of America and our sacred Constitution.” 
College Republicans declined to comment further. 
Many students said they are concerned that if she is confirmed, she will threaten the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision—a landmark case that protects a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction—and the Affordable Care Act. 
Jeremy Ward, the executive director of AU College Democrats, said that Barret’s nomination “shows that the Republicans don't care about health care.”
Roseanna Yeganeh-Kazemi, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, was also concerned. She cited Barrett’s use of religion to justify and support her legal opinions, such as with cases involving LGBTQ+ rights or abortion, as especially threatening, considering that the U.S. has no established religion. 
“We pride ourselves on that concept that we have a separation of church and state, and the fact that in a lot of opinions she's written and a lot of her stances she brings in Catholicism, which I think is a major problem,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
Several students said they were frustrated that Republicans plan to confirm Barrett with only a month until the general election. In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with eight months left until the election, but his nomination was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. 
“Then fast forward four years later, Justice Ginsburg's body is probably not even cold yet, it's just hours after she passed, and McConnell is saying that we are going to have a replacement,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
While some were upset, many students said they were not shocked, given the long-term political power the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers would acquire if Barrett is confirmed. 
“I was expecting President Trump to make a decision very quickly; I was expecting the Senate to be [quick] to confirm her,” said Ali Siddiqi, a freshman in the School of International Service who has been following Barrett’s rulings since she was on the shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. “She had no scandals or allegations to which the Trump campaign would want to deviate from, especially with Brett Kavanaugh. They want a clean judicial pick.”
Barrett’s confirmation hearing is set to start Oct. 12, and it is not yet known exactly how COVID-19 might affect the proceedings.

2021-01-02,AU,conservative,"The Keegan Theater’s virtual productions of “Trans Am” and “From Gumbo to Mumbo” ran from Nov. 12 until Nov. 29. “Trans Am” focused on LGBTQ+ rights, and “From Gumbo to Mumbo” explored race relations in the United States in a mostly personal manner, accompanied by expressive and powerfully emotional music. 
“Trans Am” is a rock musical and a solo act featuring Lisa Stephen Friday, a real-life rock star who formed a group called Lisa Jackson and Girl Friday. The play focuses on Friday’s life story as she transitioned and overcame the many challenges she faced from her childhood. 
Friday told the audience of her story accompanied by her acoustic guitar. She performed music by Lisa Jackson and Girl Friday after she shared specific experiences. When Friday recalled her experience of coming out as a transgender woman, it was particularly haunting. 
“You know how they say how people should treat us? I didn’t know how to tell my family how to treat me,” Friday said during her performance when recounting her coming out experience. 
Friday was raised in a conservative family in Fayetteville, Ga. She expressed frustration early in her performance about the binary social lens in which she grew up. Even when she came out in 2004, there was not the vocabulary that we use today to describe transgender or non-binary individuals. 
Friday also recounted her experience dealing with her family’s negative perception of her as a drag queen. This perception emerged when she was playing music with her group at the Parkside Lounge in New York City. She collaborated with people such as influential trans rocker Jayne County at the time.
In an interview with Metro Weekly magazine, Friday said, “Unless you have a trans person in your life, or you’re an extremely aware person, you don’t know what that struggle is.” 
She also pointed out that anyone who is not white, heterosexual and Christian is incredibly vulnerable and that transgender people are especially vulnerable to discrimination and prejudicial attacks. In “Trans Am,” Friday uses her own experience of coming out as a transgender woman to talk about how alone transgender people are when they transition. 
“And there I stood. Silent. Shamed. Judged. Completely alone,” Friday said during her performance. 
“From Gumbo to Mumbo” is a New Orleans-based play discussing race-related problems in the U.S. The play explores what it means to be “authentic” in American culture and politics and it reflects on the search for love and happiness.
The play features two local actors, Drew Anderson and Dwayne Lawson-Brown. Anderson is a former science teacher who founded Spit Dat, an open mic in Washington, and Lawson-Brown is a hip-hop artist. 
The play opens with New Orleanian music and a Family Feud spoof. The stage background, lighting and each actor’s colorful outfit reflected New Orleans culture. At the beginning of the play, Anderson’s outfit stood out particularly with a Zion Williamson New Orleans Pelicans jersey and multi-colored necklaces.
Anderson or Brown addressed race relations in their monologues, while footage of anti-Vietnam War protests and race riots in the 1960s and today was shown on a series of small TV screens. The discussion then shifted to police brutality and instances where unarmed, innocent Black men were shot and killed by police because of the color of their skin. 
Further imagery of candlelight vigils with faces of Black men and women killed by police showed the many people who died senselessly because of police brutality, while also keeping these names alive. 
Another powerful visual was Brown’s T-shirt, which showed names of police brutality victims. The combination of rap, hip-hop, poetry, New Orleans culture and visuals made “From Gumbo to Mumbo” an effective play for understanding the times we live in today. 
The play was nominated for a Helen Hayes Award.

2021-01-04,AU,conservative,"In March of 2019, the leader of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said in a speech to party leaders that the official platform on LGBTQ+ rights was, “not about tolerance,” ending his thoughts by emphatically yelling, “Stay away from our children!” In January 2019, the Russian LGBT Network reported that Chechen authorities detained at least 40 people in the previous weeks and killed two in a purge against LGBTQ+ residents. 
While it’s easy to dismiss these as similar but isolated incidents, they stand as a testament to the broader trend across Eastern Europe of persecuting LGBTQ+ persons under the guise of “traditional values.” Often cemented in religious or nationalist ideals, conservative parties such as Law and Justice in Poland and United Russia have evoked traditional values as a means of justifying discriminatory and often outright hateful agendas. 
What’s become increasingly clear over the last decade or so is a strong relationship between the rise of authoritarian regimes along with the evocation of “traditional values” in Eastern Europe and the scapegoating and persecution of LGBT persons and other sexual minorities. Less clear is what we can do to end the systematic human rights abuses or bring any meaningful form of justice. 
We’ve seen these values have been invoked in the passage of the infamous 2013 “gay propaganda” legislation in Russia, which obstensively banned any pro-LGBTQ+ sentiments in media or public discourse. The law has served as an anchorpoint for the intersection of traditional values and homophobia with lawmakers and activists alike using the law as validation that LGBTQ+ people pose a threat to the safety of their children and society as a whole. Similar homophobic overtones defined the declarations made by hundreds of municipalities in Poland that they were “LGBT-ideology free” areas. 
In politics, faith and public discourse, ‘traditional values’ have successfully managed to other LGBTQ+ persons, making them prime targets for persecution and abuse. Existing international human rights frameworks, such as the United Nations’ Convention on the Prevention and Punishment for the Crime of Genocide, fail to grant protected group status for gender and sexual minorities. This gap in protective status leaves LGBTQ+ people uniquely vulnerable to bias-motivated violence encouraged by far-right, authoritarian ideologies that identify homosexuals and gender nonconforming individuals as the source of nations’ misfortunes.
Tolerance for homosexuality varies considerably throughout the world, though the stark contrasts between public attitudes in Eastern and Western Europe highlight a significant point of concern for the future of anti-discrimination norms that outlaw violence against LGBTQ+ persons in the EU. Pew Research Center 2019 survery data assessing acceptance of homosexuality reveal median scores of 86% for Western European states and 46% for Central and Eastern European states.
Additionally, an analysis of legislation throughout Europe showcases another significant divergence between post-communist Europe and Western Europe. Conor O’Dwyer conducted a study of legislation using the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association-Europe’s rights index, concluding that Europian Union member states are significantly more protective of LGBTQ+ persons.
While this legal analysis is confined to Europe, the results speak to potential implications for the future of LGBTQ+ rights globally. Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU allows action to be taken to prevent such discrimination in member states. However, Poland President Andrzej Duda has campaigned using rhetoric that called the LGBT “ideology” worse than communism, while municipalities throughout the country continue to implement so-called LGBT-free zones.
The response from the leadership of the EU has been inadequate in preventing further discrimination, and the decisions that the institution makes now in response to Poland’s aggression will chart the course for the trajectory of LGBTQ+ rights in Europe and beyond.
When nations assault LGBTQ+ rights with impunity within the world’s leading coalition of democracies, we set the stage for the perpetuation of atrocities similar to those currently underway in Chechnya, where the Russian government has aided in the facilitation of torture and execution of gay men under the reign of Ramzan Kadyrov, who heads Chechnya. 
Mass atrocity warning signs have mounted considerably since Russia’s anti-gay propaganda legislation went into effect and efforts were made to legitimize discriminatory actions under the facade of moral sovereignty. Should the international community fail to intervene now, the foundations for the erasure of LGBTQ+ identities through cultural and physical genocide will be irreversibly cemented in the same region as the Holocaust of WWII.

2021-01-05,AU,conservative,"While so much of life now revolves around technology, it’s hard to find moments of escape from news alerts and social media scrolling, and it’s even harder to maintain our jagged and anxious attention. Film began as an imaginative outlook where the camera transformed our world, let us look at ourselves differently and took us to new places. All the time, and all at once, Americans have looked to film as a way to feel better in brief, collective moments, apart from their anxieties, fears and anger. Here are some great films that can help you escape, if only for an hour and then some.
Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) - Available on Disney+
Directed by artistically inclined director Wes Anderson, “Fantastic Mr. Fox” is a perfect, fall escapism film because it’s crafted to draw you in. The animals are cute, witty and motivated. The film is composed along symmetrical lines — Wes Anderson loves his vertical centers — with neat trees, buildings and color blocking. The precision is the exact opposite of the world around us, and it’s a pleasing relief. The film’s plot follows a family of foxes and their rodent neighbors, whose homes are suddenly attacked by neighboring produce corporations. Like the Robin Hood fairytale, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) decides to steal from the rich and save his home and friends. The plot is softly political, so conscious viewers will be eager to root for Mr. Fox and his cohorts, but it’s not jarring enough to keep your mind reeling with the reality of politics occurring outside of Anderson’s claymation creation.
Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) - Available on Netflix and Hulu
A grumpy, old man named Hec (Sam Neill) and a young, quirky kid named Ricky (Julian Dennison) adventure together through the New Zealand bush, on the run from child protective services and police. The pair come across unexpected, yet sympathetic characters - like a rural father-daughter duo and a man who goes by the nickname “Psycho” Sam (Rhys Darby). The film is sprinkled with emotionally sincere moments between the mostly comedic and ironic narrative orchestrated by director Taika Waititi. Waititi’s quick-hit comedy lines and the main characters’ unexplainable quirks are engaging and endearing, bringing any viewer along for an easy-paced film that ends with a touching realization of personal flaws and working together.
Ocean’s 8 (2018) - Available on HBO Max and Hulu (with certain subscriptions)
Beautiful, many famous, women commit crimes together — that’s the plot. Like any other “Ocean’s” film, this Sandra Bullock-led reboot has a simple mission made complicated by clever planning, sleuthing, lying and cheating to rob the glorious Met Gala in New York City. “Ocean’s 8” delivers intensity, comedy and teamwork through a wide-range of character types and fan-favorite actresses. Rihanna, who plays Nine Ball, subverts the nerdy hacker trope to one of cool mystery. Sarah Paulson makes the underestimated mother type an independent agent. Celebrity cameos give the film a hint of realism that makes it more fun to watch. “Ocean’s 8” is a good escape through its familiar plot but entertaining maze of planning that has a million-dollar payoff.
Catch Me If You Can (2002) - Available on Netflix and Hulu (with certain subscriptions)
Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio are always one-step in the wrong direction throughout this 2002 film, which is based on a true story. Hanks delivers his usual good-guy performance as an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, but he’s unrelenting in his pursuit of the most successful young robber and forger in American history. Hanks is a great liaison for the viewer, especially as DiCaprio’s character, Frank Abagnale Jr., seems to trick the untrickable and evade capture at every turn through complex schemes. Abagnale is able to disguise himself in plain sight as a pilot, doctor and prosecutor, all before he turns 19-years-old. But he has to be caught eventually, or else we’d never have this wonderful film. The joy of the chase is a great escape from the daily Zoom routines.
Dolemite Is My Name (2019) - Available on Netflix
This underrated movie about movies dives into the overlooked history of Black American filmmakers in the 1970s. Eddie Murphy plays the struggling entertainer Rudy Ray Moore, the man behind the cult-classic “Dolemite” films. Dolemite becomes Moore’s on-stage comedic persona and then eventually an on-screen karate-fighting, suit-wearing hero. “Dolemite is My Name” is a remarkable story about Black success and creativity in an industry in which they are often shunned. It’s also a fun yet sentimental return to the screen for Murphy, who hasn’t been in a film since 2016. “Dolemite Is My Name” is joyful, which is definitely needed these days. The outrageous camp costuming and funky music is a wonderful escape.
The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) - Available to rent on Amazon Prime for $3.99
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is a cult-classic, musical, science fiction (“double feature”) starring the unforgettable Tim Curry. This low-budget film barely made waves in box offices when it was released in 1975, but over the decades it’s grown to prominence in small-town art-deco theaters. When white-bread characters Janet (Susan Sarandon) and Brad (Barry Bostwick) stumble upon a castle in the woods, they meet mysterious and unpredictable characters with hidden secrets. This is a perfect escapism film because the plot is hardly existent, but the music and acting is so up-tempo and melodramatic that you’ll enjoy yourself, while also wondering what is happening on screen. Songs like “The Time Warp” and “Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me” are incredibly fun scenes, making subtle commentary on sexuality and conservative social norms of the ‘70s. The film features romance, infidelity, murder and aliens, so it’s a catch-all for any time you want some great, ‘70s rock songs with a dash of plot.
What a Girl Wants (2003) - Available on Netflix
When was the last time you thought about Amanda Bynes? It was probably 2003, when this teenage romantic-comedy was released. Bynes plays Daphne Reynolds, the tomboy teen who embarks on her independent journey to reconnect with her estranged father, Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a candidate for Britain’s prime minister. Bynes reminds her father of his younger rock-n-roll lifestyle while she faces public scrutiny from the media and her father’s fiancée for not fitting into the right mold. “What a Girl Wants” has typical 2000s montages, complete with the archetypal fitting room scene and a motorcycle ride around London, and cringeworthy moments that make the film funny and easy. With a familiar message of being yourself and reuniting with loved ones, “What a Girl Wants” is a great throwback to simpler times.

2021-11-11,AU,conservative,"Editor’s Note: The last name of an undocumented student has been omitted in this article for privacy and protection.
When law student Andrea Rodriguez Burckhardt arrived in D.C. to study at American University’s Washington College of Law, she was surprised by the lack of community with undocumented students on campus.
Burckhardt, a student in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, studied as an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin. At UT, Burckhardt said she felt community “from day one” as an undocumented student with a strong support system of student-led organizations at the public university.
According to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal, less than 20 percent of undocumented and DACA-eligible students attend private institutions as compared to public colleges.
Saba Ahmed, the supervising attorney for WCL’s “Defending the AU Dream Initiative,” is working to change that. Created in 2019, AU Dream operates out of WCL’s Immigration Justice Clinic and provides free legal support for immigrant and undocumented students. Ahmed hosted “DACA & Dinner” on Nov. 4 to allow students to learn about DACA under the Biden administration and undocumented students on AU’s campus.
Rodriguez, Ahmed and undocumented graduate student Ellie spoke at the event about their experiences at AU and encouraged students to sign a petition urging the University to publicly support DACA. The event was hosted by a coalition of student groups including the Asian American Student Union, African Students’ Organization, AU Por Colombia, AU League of United Latin American Citizens, AU Dream and the Center for Community Engagement and Service.
Ahmed’s vision is to expand the current services of AU Dream — asylum issues, humanitarian visas, family petitions, advance parole and more — to become a “hub of support” to holistically address the needs of undocumented and immigrant students. 
“I definitely have put in a lot of effort over the past few months to even have people aware that we exist,” Ahmed said in an interview with The Eagle. She added, “I think it’s hard to feel empowered to speak out if there’s no solidarity, and there’s no support.”
DACA and undocumented students find opportunity in AU Dream
After beginning her degree, Burckhardt anxiously anticipated the chance to study abroad. But as a student with DACA during the Trump administration, she struggled to obtain advance parole travel documents.
In September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced measures to reject any new or pending applications for advance parole.
Burckhardt found opportunity in AU Dream and worked with the organization for months to apply for advance parole to study abroad. But even with legal help from AU Dream, Burckhardt faced something else that is part of many DACA students’ experience — financial barriers.
“The cost of the application, not even to find out if you go or not on advance parole, is [$575],” Burckhardt said. “So I would be spending close to $600 more than any other student by trying to see if I could even get into a study abroad [program].”
Ellie also utilized AU Dream to help ease financial burdens. With the help of Ahmed and AU Dream, Ellie was able to receive tuition aid and internship opportunities. 
“I’m not qualified for DACA and I have to pay out of pocket,” Ellie said. “I’ve been supported by family overseas, but then COVID[-19] hits and everyone is in financial difficulty at this time.”
Though undocumented students are unable to qualify for financial aid, states like California and Texas, where Ellie and Rodriguez studied for undergrad, have opportunities for grants. California and Texas are the two states with the highest number of undocumented immigrants, with about 2.2 million and 1.6 million undocumented immigrants, respectively, according to Pew Research Center estimates.
Ahmed also cited housing and food insecurity as well as mental health concerns, particularly for those who are victims of crime or dealing with significant trauma. 
“Someone’s immigration status in itself can be a barrier to higher education,” Ahmed said. “And the students that we see in colleges and universities have had to work incredibly hard to overcome barriers that citizens students might not have.”
Turning the personal into passion — AU students advocate for undocumented community 
Ellie said she wants to see greater University-wide training for faculty who may encounter an undocumented student who needs assistance. When she first looked into resources on campus, Ellie was regularly referred to international student services, even though she was specifically seeking support for undocumented students.
Burckhardt said she believes the University’s next step could be connecting with affinity groups. 
“Living undocumented is a lot of hiding your status, especially when you’re growing up in small towns, or in more conservative areas, you have to hide your status; it’s a lot of living in the shadows,” Burckhardt said. “And having that support in UT allowed me to just stand forward to be heard and feel like I was a student with needs worth recognizing.”
Burckhardt works for the International Human Rights Law Clinic and is also a student who has benefited from its services. She said her experiences have shaped her passion for immigration law, but learning about immigration law started as a way to educate herself and her family.
When she was young, Burckhardt’s family came to the U.S. from Peru on a tourist visa. When the family learned their supposed sponsor was scamming them, they were left without money and papers. Burckhardt hopes she can change the story for future immigrant families.
“The law is something that I see as something that’s really unreachable for a lot of people, and in having the opportunity to learn it, I want to translate it and give it to a lot of others that don’t get the opportunity to do the same,” Burckhardt, whose family is Colombian, said.
Ahmed, Burckhardt and Ellie stressed supporting undocumented community members through listening to their stories and continuing conversations about undocumented students. 
“I do hope people who are undocumented or DACA [are] able to speak up and voice their opinions and talk to people at their comfortability and tell people that it’s important to let others know about this story; this community here,” Ellie said.
Correction: Burckhardt's work in the International Human Rights Law Clinic was misstated in a previous version of this article. This article has been updated with a more accurate and earlier memorandum from the Trump administration about advance parole.

2022-07-08,AU,conservative,"American University is known for its environmental consciousness, priding itself on being the first university to reach carbon neutrality. AU was recently selected as a 2022 U.S. Department of Education “Green Ribbon Schools'' Post-secondary Sustainability Awardee. Admittedly, AU has taken progressive steps in building sustainability plans to achieve groundbreaking goals and milestones. Yet, the impression of a green campus is a narrow, performative illusion that has overshadowed student efforts in maintaining this image. Students demand and deserve more communication, transparency and support from the administration to breed an environmentally sustainable culture involving all contributors, not just the students alone.
On April 14, the AU Community Garden announced that the garden will be demolished to build the new Center of Athletic Performance (CAP) in fall 2023 instead of the initial two to five-year plan to relocate the garden. The news shocked everyone as the garden has served the community by providing a safe and green space, carefully nurtured by its members and volunteers. On top of their regular duties and routines to take care of the garden and plan for next semester, the garden leaders have been working tirelessly to chase down responsible representatives that have not communicated clearly about the plan for the garden. During an April 11 meeting, Leonardo Casas, AU Senior Project Manager, told the gardeners that AU was destroying the garden in the summer without plans to restore it. This devastating update was debunked when the garden leaders met with Anthony Cortes, Director of Capital Management and everyone involved in the CAP project on April 18. A new timeline was introduced at the meeting and they guaranteed that the plan would include administrative support throughout the process of relocating and rebuilding the garden to build a bigger and better one. 
Thankfully, there is a more definite and optimistic plan for the garden now, but this would not have happened if it were not for the garden’s fearless leaders’ determination and resiliency in uncovering the ideas and decisions made behind closed doors without their input. 
The lack of communication and transparency is a consistent behavior of AU when it concerns environmental projects initiated by students. The administration’s inaccessibility for students to reach out to representatives and access resources hinders the garden’s progress and our goal of becoming more environmentally friendly. Even the Summary Narrative of AU’s application to Green Ribbon Schools heavily emphasized the role of the garden and the University’s financial support towards clubs dedicated to improving sustainable outcomes around campus. Yet, the so-called “sustainability fund” has never been consistent or enough for clubs like the AU Community Garden to utilize. The lack of funding restricts the garden to more conservative projects. Therefore, bigger and bolder proposals like building a greenhouse or a pond were pushed back or rejected. AU seems to only care about environmental sustainability for superficial purposes, such as the aesthetics of the Arboretum and the benefits of tourism and recruitment, greenwashing and fostering a culture of “look, but don’t touch.”
Unlike the “culture of sustainability” AU claims to have, there is a lack of unity within our community. Stemming from the lack of collaboration with administration, students feel as though no one is in the loop of knowing what is going on, including professors in the environmental science department and many other related departments. Garden members and other AU community members were distraught prior to the updated information the leaders unearthed by relentlessly hassling administrative people for answers. It was also disheartening to witness AU leaving sustainability behind again by leaving the garden out of the 2021 Campus Plan. Disjointed words about the garden were tossed around without consulting with the members who take care of the garden. Students are then forced to clarify the situation and make room for themselves when the administration should have guaranteed their space in the plan in the first place. 
Although progress is slow, students and faculty members remain persistent. For instance, Valentina Aquila, a professor within the Department of Environmental Science, created an email chain that links all environmental science and studies majors for better communication and exposure to opportunities circulating within the community. Despite the positives, many setbacks and unfinished projects were left behind due to the lack of commitment from AU. Students have presented projects that were approved by the Learning by Leading program. However, when it came down to funding and facilitation of implementing projects, students did not receive financial or actionable staff support. The program encouraged leadership in expanding student-run environmentally focused projects with scarce and unconstructive mentorship. Therefore, projects were rarely followed through due to financial concerns and a lack of resources. In the end, many promising projects are swept under the rug, neglected and left behind. 
The AU Community Garden and environmental advocates need more than verbal support. Although student activism is essential in building an inclusive green campus, the student effort has been one-sided and AU has been taking credit for their work without providing the support they need. Suppose AU will brand and brag about its commitment to building an environmentally sustainable space in the Bender tunnel and during campus tours. In that case, AU’s decision-making process should prioritize the garden and the needs of the students. A sustainability leader requires AU to approach with more top-down actions and united teamwork among administration, faculty members, clubs and organizations and the student body.

2022-11-10,AU,conservative,"D.C.’s major power players won big in the midterm elections Tuesday, as Mayor Muriel Bowser, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson were all reelected with overwhelming support.
Ward 3 D.C. Council
In Ward 3, which includes American University, Democrat Matthew Frumin cruised to victory in the D.C. Council race, defeating Republican David Krucoff by a margin of over 52 percentage points, according to preliminary results from the D.C. Board of Elections.
Frumin will replace retiring Councilmember Mary Cheh, who has held the seat since 2007. 
In a statement posted on social media, Frumin called his election “a dream come true.” He praised the candidates he defeated — nearly a dozen people ran in the Democratic primary — and pledged to help make the city “as safe, welcoming and green as it can be.”
Krucoff, who won the endorsement of The Washington Post but gained little traction among residents, congratulated Frumin on Twitter Wednesday. A self-described moderate Republican, Krucoff had tried convincing voters they should send a “passionately pragmatic” conservative voice to the entirely Democratic Council. 
Advisory Neighborhood Commissions
It will take several days to know who won the two ANC seats on AU’s campus. Neither district had any candidate on the ballot, but there appeared to be at least one write-in candidate for each seat: freshman Micah Rogers in 3E07 and sophomore Rohin Ghosh in 3E08.
Board of Elections data showed just three votes cast in 3E07 and 12 votes cast in 3E08. Because the elections board does not distinguish write-in votes by name in its preliminary results, it was not immediately clear whether Rogers or Ghosh were elected.
Initiative 82
One of the most hotly contested ballot measures was Initiative 82, which passed with 74 percent of the vote, according to preliminary data. This measure will alter the way tipped workers are paid in the district. The minimum wage will be incrementally increased for tipped employees each year until 2027 — it is currently at $5.35 — to match that of non-tipped employees, which is at $16.10. Prior to the initiative, employers were required by law to make up for their workers’ pay if the tips didn't reach minimum wage. 
Opponents raised concerns the initiative would hurt small and independent restaurants and bars especially after the pandemic. Additionally, many restaurants may implement service charges, leaving customers less likely to tip. Proponents argued the two-tiered wage system makes income too unpredictable and is inherently problematic, forcing workers to rely on strangers' biases as they decide how much to tip. 
Board of Education
Eric Goulet appeared on track to secure the Board of Education seat for Ward 3 against Michael Sriqui with nearly 54 percent of the vote as of Thursday morning, according to the D.C. Board of Elections. Current BOE seatholder Ruth Wattenberg did not run for reelection. 
After losing in the primary for Ward 3 Council earlier this year, Goulet launched his campaign for BOE and was endorsed by The Washington Post. Sriqui is a current ANC commissioner from the Palisades in District 3D04. His campaign was heavily focused on the fact that he was the only candidate with children enrolled in D.C. public schools; Goulet’s children attend private school. 
At-large
In the competitive race for an at-large D.C. Council seat, Ward 5 Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie ousted the incumbent progressive Councilmember Elissa Silverman by a three point margin.
The race was one of the most closely watched in the district. McDuffie, who represents Ward 5 as a Democrat, left the party to compete for the at-large seat as an independent after a judge found him unqualified to run for attorney general. Silverman conceded Wednesday night when a newly counted batch of mail-in ballots made McDuffie’s lead too large to close.
Democrat Brian Schwalb won the attorney general’s race unopposed, and at-large Democratic Councilmember Anita Bonds was also reelected. The at-large race allowed voters to choose two candidates among the eight on the ballot.

2022-12-08,AU,conservative,"Editor’s Note: This story contains references to sexual assault.
I was excited about the protest against sexual assault on Nov. 10. I was so happy there was something planned to bring people together to support survivors. But after reading the promotional infographics and seeing the photos everyone posted, no one even mentioned masks. A protest in honor of survivors was unsafe for the most impacted group: disabled women.
The disabled womens’ community has the highest rate of sexual assault out of any other group at 83 percent, according to a study by Thomas Weiss in Disabled World. Disabled people also make up a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths, up to 95 percent in parts of the U.S., according to Axios. The most conservative estimate shows that disabled people are 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19, and that’s only with one preexisting condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No matter the methodology, disabled people are at the highest risk for both COVID-19 and sexual assault. I thought that in a protest full of people claiming to support survivors, the most impacted community would be uplifted or, at the very least, safe. But in a sea of people wearing red in solidarity with survivors, only a handful wore masks. 
Optional masks are a segregationist policy, dictating what bodies are safely allowed in a space. In a protest setting, that means excluding the most impacted from fighting for their own rights.
According to the CDC, D.C. still has a substantial COVID transmission level. The Omicron variant makes up 99.8 percent of U.S. cases, according to GISAID. American University attests that the vaccine requirement makes unmasking safe, but the vaccine AU requires is only 50 percent effective against Omicron, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, and the efficacy wanes as more time passes. In other words, masking is how we can keep AU safe. 
The choice to not wear a mask communicates to me, as an immunocompromised individual, that I am not welcome at AU, let alone in a space for survivors nor in the space of support. My mask protects me briefly if I stand 10 feet from the protest, but that means I either have to look over my shoulder to make sure no one is coming too close or not attend at all. My unmasked peers have communicated that my safety is my responsibility, and they will do nothing to help others be safe. That sounds just like the sexual violence policy they’re advocating against. This is how I know that little real support or radical change can be found with most protest attendees.
It was clear to me as a disabled woman that most of the attendees’ support only goes so far as not to inconvenience themselves. They ask AU for bare-minimum precautions for survivors and safe, educational integration for women, but won’t provide either within the movement.
“Women on campus are in a state of fear,” said one of the protest’s speakers, according to a Twitter thread by AU student Isabelle Kravis. I agree. I am in a state of fear. I am well aware of the insufficiencies of AU’s Title IX Office. At least able-bodied women know that they can lean on their peers for support. My fear is of my peers, and I fear knowing that even the people doing the most work to uplift survivors and protect other students will not protect me. 
“I felt unsafe and excluded [at the protest],” Gretchen Venema, a disabled sexual assault survivor and senior in the College of Arts and Sciences, told me. “Seeing friends not wear masks is really harmful to me because I know that they do not value disabled people and disabled lives. It's isolating and hurtful.”
At AU’s protest, it seemed like the unmasked supporters were saying they weren’t okay with our sexual assault, but they were okay with our segregation or death. “Disability integration means an expectation of accommodations everywhere,” said Venema. “A movement that excludes disabled people is not as progressive as it thinks it is. [It shows] intersectionality is not important to them.” 
“We deeply wish we had made an announcement early into the walkout asking folks to wear masks,” said protest organizer and School of Public Affairs senior Lillian Frame, in an interview with me. “This was a failing of ours and something we’re working to better in the future.”
Frame and I are planning to work together to make future action accessible. Still, the fact that most protest attendees would have to be reminded speaks volumes about ableism within social movements.
Protesting without protecting the most impacted and vulnerable is performative at best and eugenist at worst. If any social change advocates want true justice, they must start by making their movements as survivable as possible.

2023-02-06,AU,conservative,"American University President Sylvia Burwell spoke alongside Ron Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University, and Taffye Benson Clayton, the vice president of inclusion and diversity for Auburn University, on the intricacies of free expression at universities with the goal of maintaining an inclusive and safe environment during a panel on Feb. 1 hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center.
The revised version of AU’s Freedom of Expression and Expressive Conduct policy was released in August 2022, which was a part of focus of the conversation around free speech. 
Burwell said the three key components of the new policy were nuance, practice in context, and values and mission, a part of the policy she continued to return to in the discussion.
“You have to consider those [components] in the context of values,” Burwell said. “What are the values we all hold? And that we are one community whether it is in the classroom, if it is in protests and having policies and approaches that are connected to your values.” 
Burwell said she hopes to see AU students focus on inclusion along with freedom of speech. 
“We believe we can't be a great university if we aren't inclusive, and ‘inclusive’ includes everything from issues of race, to disability, to the issues of our conservatives on campus and how they feel in the setting,” Burwell said.
Clayton discussed the importance of educating students on freedom of expression not being in conflict with inclusion, following a report from the Knight Foundation and Gallup demonstrating that college students believe otherwise.
Eighty-one percent of college students reported believing they should be exposed to all types of speech, even if it is offensive, but 76 percent of all students said diversity and inclusion frequently or occasionally come into conflict with free speech rights, according to the report.
With these findings in mind, Clayton said the approach to free speech on campuses must be inclusive and differentiated.
“Inclusive in the sense that everyone is included under the tent, and differentiated meaning we must be able to speak to the needs of diverse segments of the population very authentically,” Clayton said.
Daniels said it is the responsibility of university leaders to equip students to have difficult conversations with those of dissenting viewpoints by being committed to creating a space for that.
He called out educators who said there had not been enough done in regards to cultivating these environments for students and offered a solution of organizing speaker events featuring debates of conflicting views. 
Bamidele Idaomi, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a founding member of the Bipartisan Group of AU who attended the event. He explained this policy came at an opportune time as polarization continues to grow across the country and on college campuses.
“I think it's very good that universities are putting in the effort to making sure that there are some type of inclusive thoughts when it comes to different aisles of perspective,” Idaomi said.

2023-02-10,AU,conservative,"Sam Smith performing live in 2015 in Brussels, Belgium. 
Sam Smith performing live in 2015 in Brussels, Belgium. 
After months on end of “Unholy” filling our TikTok feeds, Sam Smith’s fourth studio album “Gloria” has arrived. 
Prior to the album coming out on Jan. 27, Smith was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on Jan. 21, and shockingly brought out their contemporary and collaborator, Kim Petras, to perform their fabled song “Unholy.” This performance radiated the essence of what Smith had intended for “Gloria” — a work that has proven to counter expectations of the artist’s typical soulful style. Most people are familiar with the four-time Grammy winner, but on “Gloria,” Smith makes an unapologetic reintroduction.
Back on their third album, “Love Goes,” we were introduced to a version of Smith beginning to celebrate themself, since they had recently come out as nonbinary. With groovy tracks like “Dancing With a Stranger” featuring Normani, we came to know Smith’s newest artistic intentions. On “Gloria,” Smith embraces their queerness, and seems to prioritize having fun with production and writing. 
To begin, the album leads with “Love Me More,” immersing the listener into the ethos of this record. “Every day, I'm trying not to hate myself,” Smith sings softly, ending the first verse with, “Maybe I am learning how to love me more.” 
Smith’s voice and lyricism pop out as the most rhythmic and luring aspects of the entire album. More importantly, this track speaks to the specific difficulties of learning to love yourself as a queer person in the limelight, where relentless homophobia and hate can feel inescapable. 
“I’m becoming the artist of my dreams,” Smith said in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music. Being queer in the music industry and public eye takes a toll emotionally, especially as a nonbinary person who pushes the bounds of gender expectations. From “In The Lonely Hour” to now, we’ve seen Smith come into their own, but as we know, it hasn’t been without tribulations. 
Even now, Smith has received backlash after releasing a music video for the disco-pop song, “I’m Not Here To Make Friends.” Throughout the video, Smith owns and displays performances of their sexuality, embracing their queerness through ostentatious fashion choices, among other things. Controversy sparked chiefly among conservative circles, claiming the video was oversexualized, while many analysts have determined these critiques to be homophobic.   
Although this album appears to be a celebration of Smith’s identity and newfound self, it does fail to excel in the artist’s typical levels of in-depth songwriting. “How To Cry” stands out as the track that reverts to Smith’s signature soul-bearing lyricism, yet it comes off as insincere placed next to “Unholy” on this record. Similarly, the title-track “Gloria” is a beautiful arrangement of religious church choir, yet it is sandwiched between “I’m Not Here To Make Friends” featuring Calvin Harris and Jessie Reyez, as well as a disappointingly cliche Ed Sheeran feature. Unfortunately, this track falls completely out of place, which is an absolute disservice as it’s the most spiritually composed ode to the constant struggle of achieving self love.
It’s impossible to look at this record and not talk about Reyez’s contribution to Smith’s full body of work. Reyez’ vocals are featured on three tracks, and Reyez has songwriting credits on “Gimme,”  which also features Koffee. On Smith’s first track featuring Reyez titled “Perfect,” a slow and low beat brings the audience to a self-acceptance anthem, highlighted by lines such as “I wear my flaws like jewelry.” Much like Smith, Reyez fuses rhythm and blues with other genres in her own music, which proves to be Smith’s symbolic choice bringing her on board this record. 
Even though “Unholy” stands out as the most famous song on this record, it still leaves something to be desired. Yet, the yearn for more from Smith means perhaps the artist will sink deeper, reflecting more on their next project. “Gloria” serves as Sam Smith’s scratch at the surface of understanding themself, which is not necessarily a bad thing. 
For now, “Gloria” is the artist's first real step into unapologetically loving themself, which is something to be applauded.

2010-02-11,AU,liberal,"The Democrats officially ceded the seat of their fallen hero — a seat they had held since the late Ted Kennedy’s brother occupied the White House — when Vice President Biden administered the oath of office to Republican Scott Brown last week. Brown’s arrival in Washington sounds the death knell for the dreamlike demands of President Barack Obama’s liberal base. Gone are the days of health care optimism and cap and trade consensus. Silence reigns where there were once cries for a second stimulus and righteous calls for a New York City civilian trial for Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 
At least Obama had fair warning. Fragmentation of Democratic majorities began last November in New Jersey and Virginia. At the time, I described the gubernatorial victories of Republicans Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell as needed boosts for a desperate Republican Party, not direct repudiations of Obama’s policies. For the GOP to continue such success, it would have to court Independents and field “the right candidate … trumpeting a tailored message.” Three months later, despite doomsday predictions of the Tea Party's rise, Republicans have utilized this game plan to perfection. The American public has indeed rejected the Democratic mantra of more: more spending, more debt and more centralization of power in Washington. Judging by history, however, Obama should be quietly cheering his party’s fall from grace this coming November. Yes, you heard me correctly — root for the Republicans, Mr. President. 
As a man who grounded his 2008 campaign in centrist rhetoric, Obama has been willing to punt the liberal agenda to Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill. On top of the criticism that boxes him in from his left and right, the president has watched the center slip from his fingers. Therefore, Obama cannot tie his legacy to Democrats in Congress if he has any hope of turning his fortunes. In fact, working with a resurgent opposition party after 2010 would insulate the president from warring factions in search of his head. Then-candidate Obama enraged many Democrats when he claimed that Ronald Reagan had altered the trajectory of the political landscape in a way Bill Clinton had not. He did not mention that, as Jonathan Rauch of the National Journal reminds us, both Reagan and Clinton, the most popular and successful recent chief executives, shared power for significant portions of their terms. Detractors to the divided government theory may argue that George W. Bush benefited from Republican majorities in Congress throughout most of his presidency. How did that go for him in the end?
Data derived from the American Presidency Project demonstrates the counterintuitive notion that a Congress run by the rival party need not cripple a sitting president. The combined concurrence percentage of combined House and Senate votes to the expressed wishes of President Eisenhower (an underrated president) was roughly 70 percent. This statistic is relatively high until you consider that less successful presidents like Jimmy Carter (77 percent) and G. W. Bush (81 percent) witnessed better levels of concurrence. Reagan left office with a 62 percent concurrence mark and a 63 percent approval rating. Clinton’s Congress voted for his policy proposals only 57 percent of the time, but he exited the White House with support from two-thirds of the nation.  
Christie, McDonnell and Brown are just the first wave. Voters are frustrated with the priorities of Democrats in Washington. The economy is slowly recovering, but it will be a long march out of the woods. Republicans are priming viable, jobs-focused candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Shift to the center and Obama could enjoy a Clintonesque revival after the midterm elections. Embrace arrogance and partisanship, and Obama’s legacy will follow the path blazed by Carter and Bush.

2010-10-12,AU,liberal,"One attribute you quickly acquire as a writer is thick skin. As an undergraduate columnist in San Diego, I once shadowed syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette for the day. After a brief introduction, he asked me to follow him upstairs. He led me to his office and asked if I’d hold on just a minute. After a few moments he waved me over, pointed to his desktop and I peered over his shoulder.  
I was stunned. The first words I read were: YOU (RHYMES WITH BUCKING) (INSERT RACIST SLUR HERE). He smirked and clicked on the next one. To the biggest idiot in San Diego! He shrugged. Then held the cursor on the scroll bar for approximately 10 seconds and said wryly, “Not bad for 12:00 p.m., eh?” 
“That’s enough insults to last a lifetime,” I replied. “Just wait till the east coast wakes up,” I stupidly muttered under my breath.   
The barrage of vitriolic e-mails was not an aberration. See for yourself. Many articles or op-eds posted online elicit disparaging ad hominem attacks. At times, they’re warranted (see the tasteless Alex Knepper column last semester), and sometimes they’re not (see columns I compose). I, for example, have been referred to as a dolt (fairly accurate), and criticized for being too smart (way off base) by using too many polysyllabic words for the same column. Even the Negative Nancy’s disagree over their disappointment.  
It begs a larger question, why are we more motivated to act when we’re angry or upset than when we’re happy? Why does it take a recession before people start saving? Why does a girl have to threaten to dump her boyfriend before he starts paying attention? Why do we slander a professor for an unreasonable exam and flippantly ignore the bonus points gifted the week prior? I could go on and on. 
Are we simply irascible and yearning to be ticked off? Or is our reluctance to show equivalent approbation under positive circumstances, a societal failing in need of repair? Either way, we’ve got one giant unattractive chip on our shoulders.     
Last week I watched our volleyball team dismantle Holy Cross and encore that performance by escaping a tough Navy team. The second match was exhilarating, with the second set going to a nail-biting 34-32 before the Eagles prevailed. Yet aside from both basketball teams and a few friends/parents of the team, attendance was sparse. I’ve seen more vegetarians at Burger King.
However, I presume if AU administrators were considering axing the volleyball program (they’re not thankfully), there’d be a campaign of letters and exponentially more fans overnight. The outrage would spread instantly and suddenly we’d all be cheering as loud as Blake Jolivette (you’d know if you were there) at home games.
Perhaps we’re all wound up so tightly in our jobs, internships, homework and personal lives, it’s a chore to take a deep breath, acknowledge the good, and go out of our way to demonstrate our satisfaction like we do when we’re incensed. Perhaps it’s an aggregation of these stresses that make us aggressive drivers or induced the need for Eagle Rants (which I wholeheartedly endorse). It’s great to have a forum to blow off steam, but too frequently that venue encroaches on our typical behavior.  
Let’s face it — we take the positives for granted. 
How often do we pull a professor aside and say thanks after an inspiring lecture? How often do we tip 30 percent instead of 20 percent for excellent service? How often do we deride our employers behind close doors, while rarely appreciating them signing our checks? 
Not as often as we should. And while AU students are admirably provoked by national and international injustices — we’re widely seen as the most (politically) active in the nation — inspiration to act should come from positive circumstances too.

2010-11-09,AU,liberal,"It took many years before I came to grips with my disability. I shunned it, stubbornly tried to compensate for it.  But as it worsened, it became increasingly difficult to ignore. Coworkers perceived me as arrogant and aloof.  Friends would approach and ask why I ignored them. When? I’d inquire. Just a few minutes ago, you walked right passed — didn’t you hear me call your name?  
Actually no, I didn’t. 
Eventually I was forced to action. For two years I delivered speeches on behalf of my employer in large auditoriums. On most occasions, I’d provide a disclaimer I wouldn’t be entertaining follow-up questions due to time constraints. But the time I forgot is the time I’ll never forget. After finishing my spiel, a few hands rose. Oh no, I sighed. One woman stood up in the back and asked something. I couldn’t discern anything she said. I asked her to repeat the question. Nothing. My face became flushed as the audience murmured amongst themselves, impatiently waiting my reply. I asked someone in front for clarity, but I couldn’t hear their response either. 
Ashamed, I abruptly apologized and walked out of the room humiliated. 
The following week I made an appointment with an audiologist and confirmed what I long knew. I have significant hearing loss. If normal people hear at a 60 decibels level, I hear closer to a baker’s dozen. 
Fortunately, AU is home to an excellent Disability Support Services, directed by Joanne Benica. Before I enrolled, I was reticent to schedule an appointment, I had numerous inhibitions. I needed accommodations, but I didn’t want to feel patronized. I didn’t want an automatic advantage over my peers. I wanted privacy. I didn’t want classmates to know and/or treat me differently. Thankfully, Joanne quelled my fears — “The purpose of disability accommodations is to equal the playing field, not to provide special services or unfair advantage.  The accommodation is meant to provide equal access,” Joanne told me.
I heard that loud and clear. 
Another concern was pacified when Joanne said my disability information would be kept confidential. An anonymous announcement would be made in class and that would be the extent of public notification. Students meet with professors during office hours to distribute and explain the relevant information — ideally, professors will act accordingly.   
In a survey conducted in 2008-2009, students with disabilities rated AU departments, faculty and staff, as 61 percent responsive to their concerns. Not too shabby, although not exemplary either. In my own experience, professors are amenable to the requests, but tend to forget unless reminded.     
For students with documented disabilities, utilize the resources on campus. As an undergraduate, I didn’t have the courage to accept my deficiency. I saw it as a weakness, unwilling to submit to its command. At times, I’m still self-conscious (especially when I’m sporting hearing aids), but I’ve slowly learned to accept it as a part of who I am. 
I recommend AU students without disabilities make a concerted effort for flexibility and understanding. Be cognizant that many around you (about 450 documented at AU) struggle each day with their unique problem. Many classmates may be annoyed to have their views partially obstructed by the 6’2” giant head (me) constantly occupying the front seat of class. I don’t do it to be a brown-noser, I do it because I need to. 
We can’t expect anyone to predict who has disabilities (if not apparent), but as a rule, acquiesce (if asked to move or speak up) out of consideration because it may be more of a necessity than a request. Since we don’t know the intricate details about strangers, it’s best just to cut them some slack. If you notice an odd proclivity of a classmate, they may be compensating for something you’re not privy to. They may have a disability. And even if they don’t, you could do worse than obliging out of courtesy.

2010-12-06,AU,liberal,"This will be my final column as an opinion writer for The Eagle. In this space, I’ve argued for drug liberalization, urban renewal projects, and a greater focus on our long-term fiscal health. I discussed the importance of living within one’s means, lamented our dysfunctional political system, and criticized our incoherent foreign policy. 
What I never wrote much about was American University, and for that, I’m sorry. I know that I wasn’t your first, second, or even third destination when you wanted to read a view of the political scene. 
I also apologize to those who were looking for more partisanship and found my writing muddled in the middle. Actually, I take that back. I can’t stand fringe politics, Left or Right. Ideological polarization is tearing this country apart. Regardless, if you ever stumbled across my column, I do hope that you found my thoughts insightful, temperate, and, above all, reasonable. 
However, I want to devote my parting words not to opinion or policy, but to everyone and everything that made American University special during my years here. When I submit my senior thesis next week, I will conclude a journey that began in August 2007. Less than three and a half years later, I can proudly say that I wouldn’t trade any of it for the world. 
So here’s to you, AU:
To the Letts third floor of 2007-2008, where I spent countless nights in the South side lounge and started friendships that will last a lifetime. 
To Letts’ sixth floor sky lounge, where residents know not to enter if the lights are off and the two couches are pushed together. Trust me, stay away.  
To Centennial Hall, where sophomores go to pretend that they are moving up in the world and where I fell in love. 
To the four knuckleheads that I chose as roommates for the last few years, thanks for all the nonsense and the endless laughter. 
To the Terrace Dining Room, where I’m an endangered species: a senior in a sea of freshmen and sophomores. To the most underrated cafeteria on campus, thank you for feeding me.   
To the men’s basketball team, for winning back-to-back Patriot League crowns in 2008 and 2009. Facing the fourth-seeded Villanova Wildcats in the opening round of the 2009 NCAA tournament, the 13-seeded Eagles played unconscious basketball for more than half of the game. AU led by as many as 14 and held a 10-point lead with under 13 minutes to play. It was some of most inspired basketball I’ve ever seen. Somewhere, Garrison Carr is still knocking down 25-foot jumpers. 
To the now-defunct School of International Service pit, I miss your character and sheer depth. In all seriousness, it’s been exciting to watch this campus develop since 2007. The new SIS building and the Kogod School of Business addition are helping to put this university on the map. It will be interesting to see how the administration transforms the Nebraska Parking Lot in the coming decade.   
To Professor Cynthia Bair Van Dam, whose College Writing Seminar on the Politics of Education drove me to be a better writer. 
To Professor Robert Johnson, who showed me the distressing reality of our prison system and altered my stance on the death penalty.  
To Professor Alan Kraut, whose masterful lectures on the Civil War made me want to put down my pen and just listen. His oratory skills were that powerful. 
To three School of Communication professors, Rick Horowitz, Lynne Perri, and Rodger Streitmatter, who deepened my passion for journalism and media studies.
To Professor Leonard Steinhorn, my Honors Capstone advisor, whose tremendous insight and guidance have proven invaluable. 
To everyone at the American University Career Center, from Elaine Salisbury to Bridget O’Connell to Lara Ferraiolo to Chris Hughes to Susan Gordon—you’ve all been integral parts of my professional growth and career exploration process. It’s going to be hard to let go. 
To The Eagle, thank you for giving me a voice and granting me a platform. 
Farewell, AU. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.

2011-01-11,AU,liberal,"It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve. 
Big Brother has proven inept and can’t be trusted. It’s about time we stick up for ourselves and start advocating transparency.

2011-01-11,AU,liberal,"F. Scott Fitzgerald famously once wrote “There are no second acts in American lives.” When Fitzgerald, then a forgotten man on the cusp of death, wrote that back in 1940 it was true. Yet ironically enough, Fitzgerald experienced a huge revival decades later and is now considered one of the great American writers. Therefore, his story serves to exemplify one of the most persuasive and ingrained traits of 21st century America. There are no longer any one-act plays in American lives. Today, every single fleeting celebrity has their 15 minutes of fame extended indefinitely. So we must ask, how did we get here and what does it mean?
Maybe it all started with Fitzgerald, or perhaps it began with Richard Nixon. This nation’s 37th president was infamous for his ability to survive scandals and setbacks from the Checkers speech, to the 1960 election, to even earning respect after Watergate. In fact, the political arena has become one of the main stages for this “never-ending story” phenomenon. For instance, one would have thought that federal indictments would have been the end for politicos Tom DeLay and Rod Blagojevich. But no, respective stints on “Dancing with the Stars” and “The Apprentice”, brought them back and are what most Americans will probably remember them for. Even Eliot Spitzer of call girl ring fame, is set to make a return to honorable discourse as a co-host for a primetime news show on CNN. 
Of course, the other major setting for this phenomenon is pop culture. Today, D-list celebrities have their pick of reality shows to join. In fact, now with original reality shows like “The Hills” and “Jersey Shore” celebrities are born so that they can gain popularity, and then create spin-offs, which creates new stars who then create their own spin-offs, and so on and so forth. Before you know it, there is a whole colony of people who are just famous for the sake of being famous. 
There seems to be two main causes responsible for this trend in our culture. The first is our media culture demands this phenomenon and therefore created it. Think about it, if there are going to be hundreds of cable channels, then they need shows, and they need people, any people, to star in those shows. Additionally, over the past few years, our news programs have shifted to gossip in order to attract more viewers. And of course, the Internet provides a limitless vacuum of information to fill. So altogether our 24/7, TV-meets-Internet, media requires us to have thousands of celebrities in order to meet the massive insatiable demands of our instant gratification culture. 
The second cause, though, may be seen as a more positive explanation. That is, that Americans love a happy ending. In the past, a major figure like Britney Spears for instance, would gradually lose her fame and end up a wreck. Today, though, she can have a “comeback” and be the “new Britney.” Put simply, Americans have become addicted to the sweet and optimistic classic three-act structure: rise, fall, and redemption. This has so become our obsession that we are merely repeating this cycle over and over again. Which begs the question, is repeated sanitized story-telling healthy for us? I can only imagine what Fitzgerald would think.

2011-03-01,AU,liberal,"Say you’re riding the Metro. You glance around scanning for a seat, anxious to rest your legs from a long day at work. Your eyes drift down to The Eagle, eager to get your rant fix for the week. Suddenly, the rants zoom up close and personal as a stranger bumps into you, sending the paper violently into your chest. You look up angrily to reprimand the person, only to notice you’re witnessing an altercation that has nothing to do with you. 
The man was shoved. A fuming passenger begins yelling, chasing the man who bumped you with his fists raised ready to fight. 
Or say you’re going for a jog outside on a balmy afternoon. Justin Bieber kicks on your iPod as you approach a hill. You’re zoned in, ready to tackle the climb. You’re huffing and puffing by the end and you crouch down with your hands on your knees to catch your breath. As you turn to continue, you notice a woman dragging a dog on the sidewalk, the leash choking the puppy as it yelps in pain. The woman yanks forcefully as the bark becomes audible over the music. You look on disgusted and press pause on Beebs. She’s scolding the dog and in her fury, kicks it in the mouth. 
What do you do? 
Hopefully, you have never or will never encounter such a grotesque scenario. But you might. Odds are each one of us has been confronted with a similar dilemma at least a few times in our lives. We could each share a troubling anecdote about a schoolyard bully, sexual harassment, or violent parents whacking their child in public. 
Should we intervene? If so, to what extent? What’s the proper protocol? 
There’s no uniform answer. No simple one either. At times, I’ve spoken out in defense of a stranger. Others times I didn’t. Sometimes I regretted my action or lack thereof. Other times I felt proud I was brave enough to interfere to potentially resolve a conflict. 
Obviously, each scenario is unique and can’t be completely anticipated. These events are spontaneous, and it’s impossible to ascertain precisely how you’d react under the intensity of the moment. However, it’s a good idea for us to begin asking these hypothetical questions so we’re more prepared when things happen.
The Center for Women in Transition has a few tips. “In order to create a safer community, everyone can take steps to be an active bystander.” For example, “Ask yourself, ‘If I were in this situation, would I want someone to help me?’” Also, “Just distracting someone, saying something, checking in with a person can stop the momentum of something bad.” Other suggestions include the basics like calling the police.
Practice makes perfect. For those who are naturally shy or timid, positive intervention may be the first place to start. Deliver a sincere compliment to a stranger. By getting out of our comfort zones, we can adapt and feel more at ease under tenser conditions. The world could certainly use more compliments anyhow. 
Some incidences can escalate quickly and if you intervene you may face personal harm. Speaking out may be righteous and admirable or it may be unnecessary and imprudent. There’s always risk incurred in these circumstances.  
Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: ‘If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?’? But ... the Good Samaritan reversed the question:? ‘If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?’”
Your level of engagement is up to you. I’m not endorsing blanket intervention. But do take a stand for what you believe is right.

Dear Eagle,
Can you please actually cover all the interesting events that Women’s Initiative is hosting this month? They seem to all fall on times when I have class, but I would like to read about them before I graduate. Thank you.
why am I always the person who people come to talk about their problems with? Sure, I would always help a friend who needs to talk about a crazy boyfriend or what they want to do after graduation, but I get sick and tired of people whining about having homework, going to work or waking up at 8 a.m. Meanwhile, I have a mother diagnosed with a non-curable form of cancer, a father who has been unemployed for a year and I wake up at 6 a.m. Mon-Friday. I don't mind being the ""dependable"" friend, but it would be nice to have SOME type of recognition or for somebody to have the same consideration I show for them. So next time you're whining to a friend about how you didn't get the yoga class you wanted, think about what they might be dealing with while they listen to your meaningless rant. THANKS
No. WONK and Roosevelt Institute both live on the same level of Hell. Do not try to compliment WONK like that.
You are wrong. I can be a housewife after college while at the same time being a feminist. Why does raising the future generation of children get such little respect? The whole issue of family is completely ignored by feminist groups.
You know what I want? I want a guy to hook up with who won't either treat me like crap whenever I'm not naked or become clingy and needy and try to ask me questions about where this is going. Can't we just have sex, be friends and not take anything too seriously?
To the girl who yelled at me for trash talking Blends at Acapalooza: Yeah, I shouldn't have said anything in public. It was rude, I know. However, being out of tune is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact, and Blends was SO out of tune.

@ The Eagle article on the number of people AU students sleeps with was completely disgusting and one sided to me.  My number is one and it is going to stay that way for the rest of my life. Unless I know I am with the one person I am going to spend the rest of my life with, then I am not just going to hand over my body like fast food to some guy I meet at a party. Respect yourselves, people.
I didn't read that article, but my number is 9 and I don't think I have a problem with self-respect. I don't ""hand it over"" to ""some guy"" when I have a one-night stand — my body is MINE and when I have sex it's because I'm respecting my body's needs. I sleep around because I like to have sex. Having sex with someone doesn't mean they own you — it means both of you (hopefully) had a good time and shared a connection. That's it. Self-respect means I do what I want with my body without caring what judgmental pricks like you have to say about it.

Dear Student Health Center,
I came in and spent $35 for you to tell me that I'm not sick, though clearly I am. But that's not even why I'm mad. You. Lost. My. Forms. That's ridiculous. It can't be that difficult to put a paper in a folder. I saw it done right before my eyes when I filled it out a SECOND time. Not only is it unprofessional, it's insulting. I don't particularly enjoy writing down all of my family's serious illnesses. It borders on ethics. There are certain negative aspects that come with the territory of acquiring medical care. I'm fine with that. Forcing me to recount my family's hardships is not one of those acceptable tribulations. AU, the Student Health Center is clearly understaffed/under-trained/whatever. If I'm paying all this tuition money, I expect my forms TO BE IN MY FOLDER! ...That is all. Thank you.
Why must you have a girlfriend? You obviously have a crush on me and it's driving me nuts in class when I see you sneaking looks at me. Argh.
I don't smoke, but I'd rather hang out with smokers than all the uptight jerks in this week's rants. Seriously, stop parroting everything you learned in your high school health class! Everything causes cancer. And even if you're allergic to smoke or something, stop whining — it's not that hard to avoid on campus. I can't even remember the last time I smelled smoke on campus and it was probably when I was voluntarily hanging out with friends who were smoking. If you're annoyed by people smoking near you, move! It's not like they're smoking indoors! And if you happen to walk through a cloud of smoke, get over it — the world does not revolve around you and it will not end because something smelled bad for .5 seconds in your life.

Dear Greek Week,
I have not problem with you all going all out and raging for a week, celebrating your brotherhood and sisterhood and sharing all the good things about greek life with the rest of us. There are great aspects of greek life like philanthropy, support and the dedication to having a good time. It reminds me that while not a good fit for me, greek life is a great opportunity for many students.
But please. Clean up after yourselves. Did you even take a backward glance after you left Tenley on Saturday? It was absolutely disgusting both outside on the field and inside the building. Mud was tracked everywhere, and I know you don't have control over the weather but a little consideration for the space you occupy would go a long way. Don't litter, we don't need to live the rest of our weekend with your leftover shit everywhere.

Dear Bike-Haters,
In D.C., it's totally legal for bikes to ride on the sidewalk. The only exception is downtown where there are clearly marked and established bike lanes. Furthermore, cyclists are allowed a FULL lane of the road, though some cyclists find it more comfortable to ride at the sides of the lanes. These laws change when in different Md. counties. Maybe do some research and get your facts straight before you receive a U-lock to the face.

But I really like this other guy who I’ve hung out with a few times, and he's accompanying me to formal. Should I stick with the safe option (aka the formal date?) or should I hang out with the guy who's been very nice/genuine yet is possibly sketchy? Ahh.
AUNP came to facilitate a simulation in my IPCR class and it absolutely solidified my decision to go PCR for my functional field. Thanks AUNP for reminding me why I'm an SIS major in the first place! :D :D

The ninjas who are in Jacobs Monday and Wednesday nights are absolutely BAMF. You guys(and gals) frighten me a little bit.

OMG I'M SO EXCITED FOR COLIN POWELL I CAN'T EVEN HOLD IT IN NOT FOR ONE INSTANT. COLIN. FREAKING. POWELL. I love you KPU.
The only place in D. C. where riding on the sidewalk is illegal is in the central business district. I'm sorry if someone made it impossible for your posse to walk in a three-person-wide, four-person-deep huddle for a total of two seconds as he passed you. I'm extra sorry if you had to step off the sidewalk to let someone pass because everyone knows grass and dirt combine to make lava.
I think AU should offer an HFIT meditation class. It would make so much sense.
Didn't I go to school for 12+ years before coming to AU to become “generally educated”?  And didn't I have to prove that with a whole bunch of sufficient or above scores before I was accepted to study at AU?  Thought so.  GFY Gen Ed requirements.
Phonathon is where dreams go to die.

GREEK WEEK IS THE BEST WEEK OF THE YEAR.
No one is entitled to anything.
@personal family issues ranter
My family is totally dysfunctional too. I hate the fights over rent money and everything. The bright side is that it gets much better when you graduate and become independent. The possible downside is that when you do find that real love, you may feel guilty that you love that person more than you love your own family. It's not necessarily a bad thing but a very awkward, unexpected feeling.
I recently noticed a sharp uptick in the number of bottle refilling spouts attached to water fountains. I am now so much more hydrated. AU WIN!!
Stats on Greek Week 2011:
Greeks Give Back collected almost 1,000 items of non-perishable food and over 1,400 cards for overseas troops. *EVENT OPEN TO ENTIRE AU COMMUNITY*
Pi Kappa Phi Wheelchair Basketball raised $4,000. *EVENT OPEN TO ENTIRE AU COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD*
SigEpic Comedy Night was also OPEN TO ALL AU STUDENTS.
Yes, some of the other events were targeted towards greeks. About 20% of students at AU are affiliated in a greek organization. If you can find a good reason why these students shouldn't be proud of their organizations, let me know. The Greek Programming Board worked for months to fundraise for the week, organize events, get sponsors and make the week as successful as possible. The events went on even with cold temperatures, rain storms, hail storms and more rain storms.
Stop complaining about how much fun greek life had last week and plan your own week of fun. They enjoyed it and have sunglasses to prove it.
Wait, why is Nate Bronstein such hot commodity around here? Really guys? I mean, he's a nice enough person, I guess, but nothing that special. Am I the only one who doesn't think he walks on water?
""uhhhhh green tea has no caffeine. Where have you been?""
Umm green tea has four times as much caffeine as white tea and over half as much as coffee. What planet do you live on?
Dear SG,
Please do something about the horrific Health Center policies. Why can they bill my doctor's appointment fee home but are incapable of billing the $20 co-pay home? This makes no sense. And if I have to pay $20 to go to the health center, I will just not go, and instead spread my untreated STDs around campus. You're welcome.
Do you seriously think you are CONSIDERATE for throwing your cigarette in the trashcan SOMETIMES instead of throwing it on the ground? Wow. Your narcissism astounds me. Smoking in public is narcissistic. Smoke in your own house/apartment and give YOURSELF cancer. The rest of us prefer to see our future grandkids grow up, thank you very much.
Why does TDR never have blackberries?
I miss Dairy Queen.
To the smoker who dislikes the lack of disdain for drug dealers: Last time I checked, prostitution and marijuana don't cause cancer. SMOKING CIGARETTES DOES. I work hard to stay healthy. If you want to smoke yourself to death, do it in your own residence, not on AU's campus.
Agreed. Green tea keeps me up all night. To the person who is ignorant about caffeine content: I recommend you use 'the internets' to gain yourself some sense (and some basic knowledge about caffeine).
To the selfish people who walk around campus smoking: Some people have asthma or severe allergies and your smoking puts them in danger. It's more than just an inconvenience. Please be considerate of others. And my professor is pregnant. I'm sure she doesn't appreciate her baby being subjected to secondhand smoke because you are too selfish to smoke in private.
I'm really sick of all the class warfare on campus. Yes I have a $10 million trust fund. But I shop at thrift stores (on the rare occasions I do shop) and I am not flashy with my money. Stop judging everyone and dismissing them just because they are rich. I want to devote my life to solving international conflict for little to no pay. I am NOT shallow just because I have money.
I wish someone were generous enough to offer free meal swipe for students like me who live off-campus.
- Student who is hungry and wishes to have some good TDR food!
I love the penis-shaped and breast-shaped lollipops! We should have more of those to suck on daily!
:o
I told my mother I have a girlfriend. Her first answer was ""Does she know?""
Dear Eagle Rants Editors,
Do you really not fact check idiotic false statements people make that are easily googleable? Green tea DEFINITELY has caffeine. Everyone knows that (except last week's confused ranter).
[Editor’s Note: The Eagle only edits Rants for occasional grammar, spelling and Associated Press style errors. We leave accuracy and opinion up to you ranters.]
It's kind of messed up how a romantic interest can control your emotions and well-being. I haven't hooked up / been involved with a single person at AU and I am totally fine with that. 
To the person who says we should get off the smokers' backs because lots of people have alcohol vices: If someone wants to get drunk until they throw up, that is their own health problem. It isn’t affecting MY health. I would have no problem with smokers if their habit were only affecting them (i.e. if they smoked in their own room). But I have a problem with smokers walking around smoking and spreading toxic cancerous fumes for people who DO NOT chose that lifestyle. They are forcing their bad habits on me. And that is not okay. When will AU join the hundreds of other colleges around the country that have become tobacco free?
I wish I had a puppy. I need someone/something to love me.
To the person who says we shouldn't care about smoking because everything causes cancer: Wow. You really need to take a health class or a statistics class. Or just get some common sense. Smoking doesn't just possibly lead to some negative consequences. It's been proven above and beyond to be extremely toxic. Have you seen pictures of babies born to mothers who smoke? Well, THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO THE REST OF CAMPUS.
The worst kind of hypocrites are people who claim to care about the environment, but then go out and smoke, releasing toxic chemicals into the air and accelerating global warming.
Dear Eagle Rants Editors,
Please learn your grammar. I submit Eagle Rants with correct punctuation and then you change them.
Correct Example: I am going to the store to buy milk, eggs, and cheese.
Incorrect example: I am going to the store to buy milk, eggs and cheese.
Note the comma.  And please stop erasing the commas from my Eagle Rants because you destroy the rants and create needlessly long sentences that were meant to be compounded by a comma.
[EDITOR’S NOTE: We take out the comma because Associated Press Style dictates that there is no comma before the word “and” in a list. But we appreciate your concern for our writing skills.]
Dear girl in the library who is alternately laughing and crying loudly,
Please leave. You're weirding me out.
Okay, seriously, where are the single people?
What is up with all the self righteous a*******. Everyone has some sort of opinion or trait that they think trumps everyone else's. Count the number of rants that say ""some of actually"" followed by something very elitist.
Am I the only one that thinks livetweeting reactions to Colin Powell was a bad idea? Seriously, a bunch of kids tweeting while you're speaking to them? Talk about rude.
To the girl who wrote,
""I let my friends walk all over me. I pay dues to a sorority whose girls collectively don’t give a shit about me or my wellbeing. I drunkenly hook up with random guys well past the point where I would soberly say stop. I hope one day I stop feeling so worthless and isolated and gain some self-esteem.""
 Your rant really affected me. I have been in the same position many times before. I know that it sounds stupid, but the best advice someone ever gave me was that you won't be loved or respected if you don't have love or respect for yourself. It made me really angry when I first heard it, but eventually I built up my self-confidence, it took a long time, and it wasn't easy. Although, you’re already a member of sorority maybe you could try joining an on-campus club or at least go to one of their events to give yourself a change of scenery where you can meet new people who might share the same interests as you. At the very least it will give you a break from your negative surroundings and you'd be doing something that you find interesting or enjoy with other people with similar interests. I just want to tell you that you're not worthless and to keep your head up. Don't let people walk all over you. I tried for years to make everyone around me happy and as a result sacrificed my own happiness. It's time you put yourself first. I'm not trying to preach to you. But, I hope in someone you get this message and it makes you feel better by knowing that there are people out there who care.

To the guy that helped the door open for me as I was running to the East Quad Building: Thank you. You brightened my morning and proved that nice guys actually exist.
Colin Powell was AWESOME ... That is all.
To the people running the front desk every time I try to pick up a package:
Your job isn't that hard. Seriously, stop looking at me like I asked you to fly to the moon to pick up a box for me.
 
How many Wonks does it take to fix the flagpole?
I can't believe that so many people went to hear Colin Powel in Bender Arena. This guy has blood on his hands, lied to the entire population for the sake of his career and ideology, and when he comes here to explain that he is raising fund for a visitor center at the Vietnam War Memorial, you applaud him? There wouldn't be any need for Vietnam War Memorial without people like him. When I was 8, my country was bombed for more than a thousand days, because of people like him, forcing me to move and become a refugee. Shame on you who welcomed him like a movie star. You encourage the next generation of hawks.
I'm doing my internship back home this summer, and I still have to pay AU tuition. I'm lucky enough to get paid $3,500 by Americorps for my work, but I still have to pay AU upwards of $4,000! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!
Alright listen you self righteous brat, I know you think your crap don't smell and I know you love love LOVE to hear yourself talk, but you are not the professor, so shut the hell up.
Here's something you don't read everyday — I know secrets that can bring down some very important people here at AU. Keep reading ...
Even though you guys rag on me, I still love ya.
The reason 51 percent of AU students say they don't drink is because everybody knows if you tell AlcoholEdu you don't drink, the test is shorter. Nice try.
Gott ‘em.
This rant page was super long.
Dear housemate, you are not the queen of the universe. Just because you are the ""artist"" that does not mean that everyone must love you as much as you love yourself. No one wants to use their keys to open the front door. But no one expects the door to open for them, except you. You are in the real world, deal with it. MTFU.
RE: If you push the automatic door-opener in MGC or Ward or any of the other buildings and are not visibly disabled (including on crutches), carrying something large/heavy or elderly, be aware: I am judging you.
I don't give a crap, and you seem to have an awfully high opinion of yourself to think that this rant will make me.  Seriously, don't be a tool.
Dear Dav,
You have a Narnia reference in Harry Potter font.  Unacceptable.  You should know better.

What's more annoying than the obvious common sense PA announcements in Metro stations about how to use the Metro? The tourists who need those announcements blasted even louder into their ears because they have no common sense.
So you can talk the talk, but can you wonk the wonk?
... You can't force a dance party, you can't force a dance party, but for you I'll try ...
Today on the AU shuttle, some incredibly handsome young man started dancing, singing and clapping his hands. He kept insisting through song that he was on a ""party bus."" He then impressively improvised verses about how society made him feel he couldn't express himself and since he couldn't take it anymore, he was going to dance and sing in public. He invited everyone on the bus to join in, but we all declined. Why are we so afraid to dance and sing in public? I want to get on the party bus.
Quiet floor. No talking. Damn wonkers.
Dear ranters, if you're trying to send somebody a message through Eagle Rants, be sure to have enough clues of who you are so nobody gets confused. Because I'm really confused wondering if what I just read pertains to me. DAMN YOU ANONYMITY!
I chose to study abroad in the fall because D.C. in the spring is so great. OK D.C. ... It’s time to start getting great.
I don't understand you. You seem to tell me one thing and do the other even though you know, at least you should know, that it hurts me. I'm shutting down, now, and closing myself off. Have fun slowing killing me on the inside.
I hope the twitching tree in the library gets new leaves this spring. It's looking sad.
This week two of my rants were published. I shat myself with pride.
Dear Professors,
Can we please all just sing Kumbaya and have excellent class discussion without the papers and project? I'm really not feeling it.
Sincerely,

I just wanna say: The Tenleytown Starbucks is an absolute excellent place to study.  The customers are generally friendly, the drinks delicious and the baristas know my drink when I walk in the door.
I'm ranting instead of paper writing. WHY?
I was hanging with the fellas
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous
I was hoping that I'd never see you with him
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him
Heh
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none
And I can tell by looking that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked
His style is wack, clothes are bad
Come on, girl, let him go
I want you back
@Can we publish the year’s eagle rants in a book, please?

2011-04-12,AU,liberal,"A fat redneck and a skinny redneck jump off a cliff. Who wins? Society. 
Why do men want to marry virgins? They can’t stand criticism.
From the late, great George Carlin: “So, if there is a God, I think most reasonable people might agree that he’s at least incompetent, and maybe, just maybe doesn’t give a crap. Doesn’t give a crap, which I admire in a person, and which would explain a lot of these bad results.”
I love racist jokes. I love religious jokes. I love sexist jokes. Jokes make us laugh; they lighten our mood, they lengthen our lives. Jokes are therapeutic — they can mitigate conflict, help remind us of the absurdity of assumptions and pacify anger. Obviously, not every funny joke targets a specific segment of society, but some of the best ones do. 
Think about it. Do you like South Park? Do you watch Family Guy? Do you think Chris Rock is hilarious? How about Dane Cook? Sarah Silverman? Woody Allen? Howard Stern? If the answer is yes to any of the above, then are you racist or misogynist? Are you complicit in stereotyping? Are you reinforcing or ignoring norms that need to be challenged? Are you trivializing real issues and avoiding painful truths by laughing at legitimate problems instead of addressing them?  
Some of these accusations have been leveled at those who laugh at the list mentioned above. I disagree. If actions speak louder than words, then my activism and advocacy prove I’m an ally of many causes I mock in jest. I’m a white male, but I laugh at white-male jokes. I have Jewish lineage, but I laugh at anti-Semitic jokes. I’m a feminist, but I laugh at Peter Griffin’s buffoonery constantly. 
Some folks don’t think this type of humor is funny. They think it does more harm than good. Sometimes they’re right. A joke belittling women in the workforce may be humorous in the right circumstance (especially between two liberal women). But if an elderly male in the Deep South is telling it, is it really so funny? When the person who’s telling the joke has proven to actually believe what he ridicules, maybe it’s not funny after all. 
Besides our actual feelings toward the group, a couple of other prerequisites might include that we have to laugh at ourselves (or our identity group) and that no groups are immune or excluded from the roast. If those three things are fulfilled, I think it’s perfectly permissible.    
Additionally, context and intent are crucial. When friends and I hang out over a beer, we tell jokes we would otherwise refrain from telling in public. If you have the wits of a flagpole, odds are you’ve bitten your tongue in certain situations when you had a clever pun to share. It’s called being tactful. All of us can relate stories of a joke gone awry that we wish we could yank back like a fishing rod. It’s that remorseful feeling we get when that happens that illustrates our sensitivity and true sentiments. 
One of my friends asserted that the reason I’m able to laugh at these offensive jokes is because I’m insulated and remain unaffected by them. For example, it’s easy for an affluent white male to laugh at jokes and go about his day because of white male privilege. But what about the numerous blacks who laugh at Chris Rock’s jokes ridiculing blacks. What about women who love Family Guy?  
Laughing at offensive jokes doesn’t invalidate our true, inner feelings. Sometimes it’s solely a coping mechanism for dealing with the challenges we face in overcoming these issues. It would do us all some good to lighten up and use humor as a tool — not as a means of cloaking prejudice or to deflect taking action. We should know why we’re laughing.

Sure the guy's an alumni, but this is absurd.

Dear AU Financial Aid Office: Please make a note of all of the students who left campus just before midnight on a Sunday evening so that they could go rally at the White House about the Bin Laden killing. Clearly they don't care about studying during finals week, and since the Metro was closed, they had enough income to spend on a round-trip cab ride. I don't have that kind of money, I'm studying hard, and I really need more financial aid. Just keep that in mind, plzkthxbai.
Smoking cigarettes is not ""immoral behavior.""  It's a choice and its MY choice. If you have a problem, see me in person. Say something if I'm smoking a stogue. Yell at me if I flick my butt in the bushes. EagleRants won't get the job done.

It's fraud the way doctor's offices try to make you think a pap smear is required to get birth control. It is NOT required! European countries find it backwards that American doctors would withhold birth control until they get to ""examine"" you. Why are women standing by this oppression? Why is women's initiative not fighting for women's equality and instead wasting their time on trying convince us that all men are rapists and drunk sex is rape. True feminists should not stand for this. Women: Did you know you are NOT required by law to get a pap smear before being given birth control? The student health canter (and likely any other health center you go to) will try and push one on you because it is an way for them to make $$$$. Are they screening you for colon cancer? Lung cancer? Lymphoma? (all of which occur more frequently than cervical cancer) Nope. They are using your female sexuality against you and charging you for pap smears when you ARE NOT required to get them. What is Women\'s Initiative doing about this (the most gender oppressive issue in our nation)? NOTHING. Take a stand.
If you are not an AU student, then that makes sense that you do not get free security. Security for an event, is a privilege for AU students because they are paying the salaries. If you are not an AU student it makes sense that you do not get any of the paid benefits students receive, such as the UES center. -resp to article

Is it just me, or does some variation of the phrase ""I pay full tution X amount of money to go here"" precede the most trivial rants in the world. Its like when people say ""no offense"" and then say something offensive... it isn't a magical card that gets you out of the obnoxiousness of your statement.
I pay full tuition to this school. The fact that I have to open my window or else I die from heat stroke is ridiculous. Also I'm dying from the allergies so having my window open does not help. Even in the third world I don't have to deal with this.
Dear AU Tour Groups,

Actually you moronic Dung Beetle, people invited to attend the Washington Semester Program have grades that are probably better than yours. What they also can do is pay full freight for the semester.

•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you ""down there"", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.

•Dear ""#richgirlproblems"" whose trust fund hasn't come in yet,
Some of us actually have to do something I'm sure you're not aware of called ""work"" to get our money instead of waiting around for someone else's money to come in. Here's some advice while you're waiting, get some real problems.
Sincerely,
Everyone
•Dear fellow biddies, let's save our biddie-ing for the weekend. I have to study for finals.
•So I deactivated my Facebook in order to have to distractions during finals and with the multiple papers I have due..... and yet, I've spent all my time I'd normally spend on Facebook on EagleRants.... #procrastinationproblems
•@Person in American Political Parties Class ranting about a girl in there class: omg there's a girl like that in my World Politics class. I want to bang my head on my desk whenever she asks a question (i.e. rambles on forever without making a point with far too many likes and ums)
•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!
•Confused by eye contact. What does it mean??!! I'm worried that I've accidentally been flirting with people because of my type of eye contact.
•You know what I want?
Editor rants.
•Someone Like You by Adele has 25 plays on my iTunes right now, those are all from the last 3 days
•Every floor of the library has specifications as far as volume limit, accepting phone calls etc. But honestly, I just want to know where I can fart freely. #realtalk

•@SORRYNOTSORRY: It's ""YOU'RE."" And ""In all."" Get your slobby grammar checked out.
•@""If Greece defaults on their debt, what does that mean for Greek Life!?!"": Is this an actual serious question...?
•@""You're a crazy psycho"": Is it really necessary to call someone ""fat"" as an insult?
•@person from arkansas: if you don't pronounce it ar-ken-saw... how do you say it?
•Winter Break:
#OccupyMomsKitchen
Write ALL the papers? :(
•Ugh, my iPod keeps cutting off songs before they finish and I have no idea why. They play fine on my computer. /firstworldproblems
For once, a yay!rade: THANK YOU, PROFESSOR, FOR MOVING BACK THE DUE DATE FOR OUR FINAL PAPER. YOU ARE MY FAVORITE.
•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.
•I will take your 29 pages and raise you 43 pages.  And it's only Tuesday.
•You know what I wish we had more of? Petty, shallow, pedantry to read in the Eagle Rants. It just seems to be lacking
•That awesome moment when two of the rants apply to you floor...
•YES! MEMES! Someone in Leonard has a trollface in their window. I want to meet them!!
•""Ohhhhh my gooood! Im awake!""
""Wow! Im awake too! This is awesome!""
•@ ""jogging as a first date"" responses. We both run, and at times I feel like it would be a good idea, but i prob wont end up doing it. there are better options out there. btw, did any of you guys read the other answers? your opinions varied from one extreme to the next haha.
•On the subject of favorite memes, mine's Forever Alone.  Because it's true.  And funny.
Just in case you were wondering.
•@""That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.""
AMEN. If I wasn't absolutely sure I had not written this, I would have thought I wrote it.
•My day has been horrible, but I just realized that I am so thankful for all that I have in my life, I have no right to be sad.
•@#winning...I don't believe you.
•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.
[Editor’s note: The writers of the sex column this fall and last year both used their real names. The lack of anonymity was not a deterrent for them.]
•Dear girl worried you are his booty call: If his facebook doesn't list you as his girlfriend and you are hooking up with him, you're his booty call.
•@""You're wrong to have a long distance relationship"" Sorry you're jealous that your long distance relationship didn't work out while other people's did. I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for 4 years now. 4 more years to go while as my bf just started med school. And I have no doubt at all that we will make it.
•@""All the normal people who read these"" First off, it's sad that you pride yourself on being ""normal"". Have fun with your average life. Secondly, actually eagle rants were created exactly for relationship issues and policy debates. Get a clue.
•That time where you think you might be pregnant during finals...EFF my life.
•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH."" You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.
•Women needs to quit trying to make the marginalized male population from conforming to their standards.
•@""My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning"" You must be a business major.
•@guy needing good first date idea: Do to the botanical garden down by the capital building. It's free. It's super romantic. And it's all decked out with holiday decorations!
•WHY CAN I NO LONGER TAKE GEN-ED COURSES PASS/FAIL?
•I am writing a paper and every time I finish half a page I reward myself with a Christmas song.  :)
•@Aspiring drag queen: Athena's on facebook, friend her!
•i didn't hate AU until they got new academic regulations. NOW I NEVER WANT TO RETURN FROM ABROAD OMG.
•This I feel like is a legitimate complaint, why doenst AU have a Fall/Spring Fest type weekend, or day, where we bring a cool musical act to campus, and have them perform on the quad? Plenty of other schools have this, and it seems awesome.
•I keep seeing rants that sound exactly like they could be my ex and getting mildly concerned....
•If you came from North/Upstate NY to DC, you have NO right to complain about the lack of snow. Did you not realize you were going SOUTH?
•dear x & y...good luck
•Dear boyfriend,
I love you very much, but it is time for you to do some ""oh-my-gosh thanks for putting up with me"" loving. I would like it to come in the form of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
Sincerely,
Your Overly Supportive Girlfriend
•lol the poor kid wondering about the jogging date is probably more confused than ever...
•@AUConservative: I feel like that sometimes but I hail from liberal NJ so I'm used to it.
•I have major, major issues with my professor right now. Like built-up, long-term, legitimate resentment. I'm not an angry person, either.
•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!
•@""Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one"" - You're looking for every single brother in AEPi ;)
•Are there no boys out there who like a cute chubby girl? I've been slaving away at the gym, but nothing :[
•You led me on, I kinda fell for you, and now you just want to be my ""friend""? If only I could change your mind...
•#myholidaystyle ~ DIP MA HOUS~ MA RYDE~ ERYTHAN I HAV~ ERYTHAN AZ FAR AZDA EYE CAN C~ DIPT IN GOLE~ DIP DA HOEL WORLE IN GOLE ~ #MARYXMAS ~
•That awkward moment when it turns out that I'm smarter than the OIT guy who's trying to help me solve a tech issue.
•I want to do naughty things with my TA. Let it be known.
•Is it bad that I really want a girlfriend to go on springbreak with? And that this is actually bugging right now? :/
•Thank you AU for putting hazardous metal bars and AC's near my bed so that every time I move or try to get comfortable I hurt myself.
•Why is it so hard to approach a beautiful girl who is always surrounded by a group of people.
#shyfreshman
•@Beware the Jabber WONK... can we be friends? I just died laughing.
•Well buddy, you whined about wanting someone to write a rant about you, so here you are. Your very own eagle rant because this is how much I lub uuu
•stop complaining about stupid stuff. i hate bad rants!!!
•@person who loves AU and dislikes complainers who like to complain for no reason
...do you know who I am? Do you know my story? No...so back off, dude and don't judge.
-person who dislikes people who like to judge other people after hearing something vague
•Ya know, in the scheme of things, so I get some ""average"" grades, I'm still going to bake some really delicious cookies for my kids some day.
•@""Take some Midol and get over yourself"": Good for you that you don't have hormone issues! Some of us (actually a lot of us- you'd be surprised) have any number of a plethora of medical problems that cause intense emotional imbalance during ""that time."" We are trying our best not to annoy you while we are going crazy on the inside, so please don't demonize us. Just because YOUR body doesn't react the way other people's do doesn't mean everyone else is faking. -Take Some Midol For Your Attitude
•That awkward moment when you realize that Elian Gonzalez is no longer a cute little boy, but an extremely attractive adult.
•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]
•@Nicholas Kristof is god - No. He reported that 400,000 people died in Darfur when the number is actually closer to 70,000. Maybe he is god of sensational journalism?
•What did the chemist say when he found two isotopes of Helium? Hehe
[Editor’s note: Lovin’ these jokes!]
•Cute guy in the library... (please don't be a freshman, please don't be a freshman, please don't be a freshman!)
•I'm sorry Subway sandwich guy for having my feet on the chair that you needed. I was so uncomfortable any other way and I thought my friend would come back and take that seat :(
•THESE ACADEMIC RULES ARE ABSOLUTE CRAP! SG GET INVOLVED NOW TO REPEAL THESE. GEN EDS NO LONGER PASS FAIL? SERIOUSLY!
•I heard that every time Old Man Kerwin needs a pickle jar or something opened, he calls Nick Rangos to help
•Mixed signals are the devil.
•Dear AU,
We would like to have our Naked Juice option back.
Sincerely,
I-pay-you-more-than-45k.
•What / where is the tumblr for AU memes??
•Have to say it, Letts 5 north is the loudest, most obnoxious floor. There is this one kid with this big smile though, he seems so cute. So if you're gay, find me (:
•Will the real slim shady please stand up?
•#Occupyvendingmachine: nothing of value in Nebraska hall vending machine. SADFACE SADFACE SADFACE

•Dear people sitting behind me in the Sky Lounge: we are quietly doing our homework on one side of the room.  You are on the other side making sheep noises instead of studying.  I know that this isn't the quiet floor, but please keep it down.
•Dear Stat Professor,
I would like to take this time to thank you for your obvious lack of respect for your students. Also, I really appreciate how unprofessional it was of you to fall asleep during my group's presentation.
Thanks Again,
Glad This Class is Almost Over
•So my genius grad school gives us zero days break between spring and summer terms and a 4 week break between summer and fall terms. In what world does that make sense? Way to screw over everyone in long distance relationships. F U
•Eagle Rants have gotten so less substantive since they've gone to daily... I mean I obviously still read them religiously but still... I think we need to go back to the weekly Rants.
•Is there a person on this campus who is interested in national politics but is NOT a poli-sci/SPA major?
•Couple I'm sharing a table with at the library: please, for the love of everything, stop kissing every other second.
•Thank you person who turned in my ID to Public Safety. I really appreciate it!
•If something's upsetting you and you don't want to talk, please just say that. I won't make you talk. But giving me the cold shoulder and just leaving makes me feel like I did something wrong. I understand needing your space but theres no need to be rude.
•I don't like Lady Gaga....bring it
•Occupy the Phonathon!!!
•its 7pm and there are no new rants for today. what am i suppose to do at phonathon now??
•Rants should have their own Twitter; just think reading new rants all throughout the day!
•That awkward moment when you know that the medicine you took earlier isn't doing a damn thing to help you feel better, but you're afraid to take another dose because you've still got hours left until the last dose expires.
•@Anti football girl   What makes you think that all ""jocks"" (read: athletes) can't think with their brains, and thus use their fists? Clearly you are as close-minded as the imaginary jocks you fear.
•M,
I've fallen out of love with you.

•did rants stop being a daily thing on the website? it's dark out and i don't see any new rants... step your game up, eagle!
[Editor’s note: These eaglets have finals and work and internships too. Please be patient.]
•Giant Orgy
•Why are you withholding the rants from us? Its December 7th at 21:35:20 pm. Post the damn rants already. Goddamn.
•The 1% must control the weather. What else could explain the storm on December 7th happening on the same day that Occupy AU went down to K Street?
•Ah my friend, when I am writing my paper and you are singing loudly and I ask you nicely to stop, it is generally frowned upon for you to start making an equally loud sound of a different sort not five minutes AFTER I asked you to quiet down. I am not a mean person, I'm just trying to get my facts straight about the Rwandan Civil War and you're not helping.
•WHY ARE THERE NO DECEMBER 7TH EAGLE RANTS??? MY LIFE IS RUINED!
•No eagle rants on December 7th?? Sad day :(
•All I want is to literally have one week of break and to come back. I am -200% excited for home. After the first week, I will be crying myself to sleep every night wishing for mid-January to come faster. I guess I should be thankful enough to be able to come back. As for all of those out there that cannot come back because of family/financial problems, I have tremendous sympathy for you. Hang in there. Hope you'll all be back.

•If you came from North/Upstate NY to DC, you have NO right to complain about the lack of snow. Did you not realize you were going SOUTH?
•dear x & y...good luck
•Dear boyfriend,
I love you very much, but it is time for you to do some ""oh-my-gosh thanks for putting up with me"" loving. I would like it to come in the form of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
Sincerely,
Your Overly Supportive Girlfriend
•lol the poor kid wondering about the jogging date is probably more confused than ever...
•@AUConservative: I feel like that sometimes but I hail from liberal NJ so I'm used to it.
•I have major, major issues with my professor right now. Like built-up, long-term, legitimate resentment. I'm not an angry person, either.
•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!

•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

• ""...because you didnt work hard enough to get to a better school""
There's only so much you can do to compensate for a 440 math SAT score, even if you did get an 800 on the reading part and a 4.0 hs gpa. Not a matter of failing to work hard. I'm happy to be at AU because it actually is a great college, and the only time I felt disappointed was when I heard people whine about how they're not at Harvard. Disappointed in those students, not AU.
• @Editor's response to ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!"" I'm sorry you missed The Room reference and responded with N*SYNC lyrics instead. You also responded with the wrong quote to the LOTR's rant on 2/6/12. It's not your fault you aren't a nerd.

[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?]
• It makes me a little sad to think there are so many people in the world who have not and will not ever experience bacon.

• People who believe the Earth was created in literally 6 days over 6,000 years ago ARE crazy. Sorry.
• I'm drowning in responsibilities. Go away, to-do list. Go very very far away.
• Doesn't anybody like Age of Empires II anymore?  I know it is over 10 years old, but greatness doesn't go out of style.  Or am I just one lonely AOE girl stuck in the 90s?

• @Guy with a drug problem because of his mom. I'm here for you. I totally and definitely get the condescending mom thing and how it can get to you. You. are. not. alone.
• ""I wish my self esteem wasn’t too low to make friends."" can I be your friend?
• @""Is it bad that even though I have a boyfriend, all I want to do is have sex with other guys? Im simply not satisfied and require the extra meat!"" Grow up and get some morals. And some honesty. If you want to mess around then you break up with your boyfriend and live the single life. Otherwise, don't break his heart.
• Cute smoker boy, if only I could get close to you... cough!
• I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.
• I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot your wife is dead!
• Maybe it’s time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn’t give birth to you.
• @ranter criticizing paying for a degree that a person won’t use in the “professional world”: When did AU become a vocational school? Last time I checked, I chose to go to a liberal arts college to expand my knowledge on as many topics as I cared to learn about. Sure I will probably never use my poetry class in the “professional world”, but maybe we shouldn’t live our lives catering to what corporate America tells us to be.
• @""because you didn’t work hard enough to get to a better school: Actually many people at AU got into higher ranked schools, and chose to come to AU because it is an amazing school, an amazing location, and amazing, student body, amazing professors, amazing student clubs, amazing student activities each day, etc. But as always, haters gon hate. It speaks to their own depression rather than the actual quality of the school.
• @if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Does is not sadden you at all, the Americans define a person’s worthiness of education by their career path?
• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?
• @person saying the stay at home mom shouldn't spend money on grad school because it is selfish: How dare you. And actually if this girl greatly desires a graduate education, then not going to grad school would be selfish to her kids because who wants to have a mom with low self-esteem who is brooding about how she wishes she would have gone to grad school, but instead she saved the money to use it on the kids.  I would not want to inflict that kind of guilt on a family member.

• AU needs an undie run. who's with me?
• Ditto to the Anderson 6 North shower rant. I saw it too and I just wanted to die.  THE WATER TOUCHED IT AND THEN TOUCHED MY FEET. aksjks. so. gross.
• so, two people responded to my rant about how ""if you like me, show it, if you don't show it, pick a side"", and even though we go to a school of thousands, I hope to god one of those people are you. I don't think so though: I've seen your computer history, and there are no rants in it.
• You ""want to keep Star Wars pure,"" and yet you're going to see The Phantom Menace in 3D?  Fail.  There are only 3 Star Wars movies, and Han shot first.

• Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks.
• Several laptops have been stolen from the dorms recently, mine included. I am absolutely devastated by this and am desperately seeking any tips on who the culprit may be. Please post @ me if you know anything!
• Reading Eagle Rants makes me feel sorry for Nick Rangos.
• I really want to host a StarCraft tournament on campus. Anyone interested?
• My Case Competition teammates have made me embarrassed to be at AU. I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school.
• I started working out recently because I'm getting pudgy.  Sometimes, though, I'll come back from a really good, hard work out feeling all good about myself, and then I'll take my shirt off to go shower and see how fat and disgusting I still am :(
• I think people have formed a hate against me by joking and telling me I'm pretty and kind. If I were so pretty, and so nice, than why am I single? #AUFemaleProblems
• To any freshmen that feels like they don't fit in - Take it from a senior that had that same problem for four years... Just be yourself. NEVER EVER settle for anything less. Even if no one can relate to you, when your on the verge of graduating, everyone else will be worried about their future and identity while you stayed true, which is the best way to find the right career path... good luck and always keep your head up :)...
• Sometimes a lady just wants to get laid.
• I'm really worried, I just had to reassure your roommate that you be fine. I'm not sure I believed it myself.
• I don't agree with horrid weather like this unless it's going to snow for real. I'm tired of the ""will I/won't I?"" game you're playing forecast!

• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?
• @person saying the stay at home mom shouldn't spend money on grad school because it is selfish: How dare you. And actually if this girl greatly desires a graduate education, then not going to grad school would be selfish to her kids because who wants to have a mom with low self-esteem who is brooding about how she wishes she would have gone to grad school, but instead she saved the money to use it on the kids.  I would not want to inflict that kind of guilt on a family member.

I know at least two people who would definitely do it.
• If you think the 2 billion Christians in the world ALL take the Bible completely literally, then you're the crazy one. And I think you missed the point.

I don't know your situation, but if you did leave your door unlocked or your stuff unattended, I do not feel sorry for you at all. Learn some common sense.
• @""I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school."" This is true of any business school. New york times ran stories on this issue a few months back about how business students never develop their full potential of critical thought because they are always doing group projects and never get to think independently.
• @people who think eagle writers/editors/photographers get paid: lol Are you really that clueless? Can you name one college newspaper in the country that pays its writers? It's a college extracurricular, not a career.
• @future SAHM (mom lingo for stay-at-home-mom): Don't let naysayers get you down. I also want to be a stay at home mom right after college and grad school (well, for me right after two grad degrees). I want to study anthropology and creative writing in grad school. And I know fulfilling my academic goals before I am a mom will make me a more mature and confident mother.

We talked all night for 8 hours straight and no one had ever gotten so deep into my mind like that and understood me so well.  I would think you would know by a week or a month if he is the one, but definitely by 5 months. But you’re def not weird.
• AHHHHHHHHHHH GENEEEEEEEEE!
• @” Your friendly neighborhood McRanter” Students have been trying for years to get AU to be a smoke free campus and town halls have also been held for years. Try and keep up. The majority of students do not like walking through toxic fumes on their way to class. Everyone deserves to breathe smoke free air. If you want to smoke, do it in your own house. Don’t subject innocent people to your bad decisions.  I don’t walk around spraying carcinogenic chemicals in your face. Stop being selfish.

• @smokers who want to smoke on campus: I’m not sure if you are aware but there is this invention called the nicotine patch. The high you get from smoking comes from nicotine. Scientists have figured out how to isolate the nicotine into a patch that you can wear. These are available at any local drug store. Are you not aware of this invention or do you just enjoy being villainous and causing others to inhale the toxic chemicals you blow out into their path walking to class? I want an explanation.

I, personally, do not smoke, and dislike having to inhale secondhand smoke. However, I have mixed feelings about the smoke-free campus plan.

What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.

• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.

• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!

• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much.

• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.
• Guys. Hot TA who's a grad student, I'm a sophomore. Anything possible there? Grad students, help me out.
• Eagle Rants Editor: Are you male or female? Jw so I could put your editor's notes in better context. I know the original rants editor was male. And then there was a female. And you are the third editor right?
[Editor’s Note: I am everything.]
• Editor, are there going to be rants over break??
[Editor’s Note: Probably not. Maybe once on Wednesday]
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.
• @To straight female conservative republican: wow. People like you are the reason conservatives are demonized on campus and the epitome of what I dislike about liberals.

• To everyone on the side of Kogod facing Hughes: Hope you enjoy the shows~ We'll be here all week. XD
• To the editor: You make my day with your comments, especially since you love Christine like I do too. Keep on being awesome. :]
• To the smokers: maybe a smoke-free plan wouldn't even be necessary if you actually listened to the 25 feet rule? Just saying, it's not that hard and could make everyone's life easier. Could even save you from dealing with a smoke-free campus policy. Hm, novel idea? Sounds like it to me.
• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]
• @Meet us at 6am Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the fitness center wrestling room.  We won’t judge you, we will train you.""  -... what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I'm kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.

Congratulations! I may not know who you are, but I want you to know that I am proud of you for your progress. I just went today for my initial appointment and I felt so relieved even after that. They are really great at what they do, and I can't wait for another appointment. I hope things continue to go well for you!
• @""its just smoke""
are you serious, or just completely uneducated on this topic? its ridiculously carcinogenic, and while i couldn't care less if thats your habit (i have several friends who smoke, and i respect their choices), don't you dare belittle the risks involved.
• I'm sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished when in actuality it is the hard work of many others over several years who have worked to get a victim advocate on campus.

• Yo sexy business major in my art class, wanna get in my business this weekend??

• Oh boy! the SG dumped more tuition dollars into a Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator! Excellent use of tuition money, especially since there are so many sexual assaults on campus as to overwhelm the existing resources for dealing with them. Just kidding. There are virtually no sexual assaults on campus and there are already adequate resources available.

• @""Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc..."" Um, maybe some of us are just fulfilling our natural sexual urges and comfortable with our human sexuality? I occasionally sleep around and I am perfectly happy with who I am personally and sexually. I don't need anyone's help. You have no right to try to make me ashamed of that.
• We should ban anti-smokers at AU! It's bad for my brain to process such filth and unnecessary thoughts

• @""Who doesn't want to see a little more booty?""  Me.
• Let's be real, no guy looks at a Victoria's Secret model and thinks to himself ""I wish she would tell me her problems, because I'm in love with her and I want to be someone she trusts.""   When it comes down to it, men like REAL women, so don't sweat the small stuff.

• I don't know whether you think i'm just weird or crazy...
• @I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
It's not RHA persey, I'd blame the RA's who don't bother looking up at the front desk when you walk in and offing public safety. This would all be so much easier if we just had freaking security cameras in the dorms like other colleges...
• @""Why can’t Eagle Rants be clever and contain basic English. I’ve read other schools rants (UNC-Chapel Hill) and they surpass us in ranting.""
I am 99.9% sure I know who you are, and you annoy the sh*t out of me. Go to UNC already if you really think the kids there are so much better than the AU student body.
• The next time I see someone say that AU is a politically active campus, I'm showing them the list of candidates for this year's SG elections and laughing in their faces.

Was this on Southside? On the top floor of Letts/Anderson. Around... 11 or 12 o'clock at night on Monday. If so, that ""30 year old man"" was me. I'm 19. I was looking for a friend of mine. Sorry to be a burden.

• If anyone's taking Metro this weekend, do take note of the Red Line closure between Van Ness and Dupont Circle. You might want to save yourself some stress and take the N6 bus straight from campus to Dupont Circle instead.
• Hey guess what? Who I sleep with is none of your business unless I'm sleeping with you. Why do you even care? It has NOTHING to do with you. So why don't you focus on your own life instead of judging other people, because no one asked you.
• Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.
• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.

2012-03-11,AU,liberal,"Political activist Angela Davis told students radical feminism is crucial to fighting sexism and racism in the 21st century at a speaking event on campus.
“This is a great time to talk about feminism and activism,” Davis said in her March 7 speech in MGC 1, sponsored by Women’s Initiative and the Kennedy Political Union.
Students welcomed activist Davis to with a standing ovation.
Davis, a former Black Panther and member of the Communist Party, spoke about liberal feminism and how it emphasizes social change. Liberal feminism fights against the idea of the individual as the unit of society, she said.
“The struggles were not so much about the individual, but uplifting the entire community,” Davis said.
Davis said women’s rights have improved over the last 40 years, especially in the number of career opportunities offered to women.
But she said certain demands, like birth control and childcare, are available for the first time but can too expensive for working class women.
“I think the economic issues complicate and further emphasize the social issues and vice-versa,” Davis said in an interview with The Eagle.
Davis also said this perspective must be used to examine racism and inequalities for women.
“Anyone who’s truly averse to racism also has to stand up against sexism,” Davis said. “And anyone who’s against sexism must be opposed to racism.”
In her speech, Davis pushed for feminism that does not only involve white women.
“Racism is more entrenched in the 21st century,” Davis said. She later explained that there is an unequal balance of race in the American prisons.
Although Davis advocates for equality for women, she does not believe feminism focuses only on women’s rights. Instead, she believes that feminism is comprised of many issues, including environmental and same-sex marriage.
Davis emphasized the importance of education and knowledge to activism.
“I’ve always believed that knowledge should be transformative,” Davis said in an interview.
As a professor at University of California Santa Cruz, she encourages her students to follow their own career choices.
“Not everyone needs to do the same thing to transform the world,” Davis said in the interview.
However, she emphasized the importance of helping the community. 
“My mother gave back and she constantly encouraged us to give back,” Davis said in her speech. “And I guess that’s why I became an activist.”

•I intern, have a job, volunteer, take 16 credits, and have a pretty active social life. But what am I thinking about most of the time? How excited I am to have explosive sex with my f*** buddy.
•@Pitt bomb threats--yes.  My house is a few minutes away from one of the campuses.  It is very sad to see this happening.
•Do you want to know why I hate the feminists on this campus? It's because they never shut up- I am in the same sociology classes with you semester after semester and I am tired of hearing what you have to say. The classes I am in are not about feminism, so if you could STFU I would appreciate it...
•You got that something that keeps me so off balance.
•@""there are people in this world who would kill you, your family, your friends, anyone who is opposed to them in a heartbeat. But there are people out there stopping them.""  The world is not black and white like you portray. It’s not ‘the bad guys vs us, the good guys’. People don’t randomly hate other people for no reason.  Maybe think about WHY they hate us and what we CAN DO to rectify this anger (hint: more bombings and killings are not helping the situation, only making it much much much worse).

•@join AUCR's and try to make that more prevalent on campus but please do not create this club” Are you serious here? The college republicans disgust me. I identify as libertarian. But I would totally join the conservative feminist group because women’s initiative doesn’t actually accomplish any substantive policy that would help women. Maybe the conservative group would.
•People say the anonymity of the internet brings out the worst in people. But I couldn’t disagree more. Anonymous eagle rants are so full of support for others and concern for helping our community. It really warms my heart when strangers reach out to ne another. Anonymity is totally awesome. (Or maybe the editor is filtering 10 nasty mean rants for every nice rant that is posted. Hmmm)
[Editor's notes: This editor filters the extremely mean, curse-filled, racist, hateful, etc. Rants.]

•It’s I’m an idiot WHO likes boys, not THAT likes boys. Do we really need to go over this basic grammar concept yet again?
•So conservative women don’t like the abortion stuff, and liberal women want women to be able to not have to worry about getting pregnant. So can we all just rally together around making birth control more accessible? This leads to fewer abortions (which should make the conservatives happy) and more ability to plan one’s own timing of when to start a family (which should make liberals happy). Do we have a deal?

•Question for women who don’t believe in legal abortion : Do you just sit around wishing that women will stop having abortions or do you actually think about how to rectify the situation, like having over the counter birth control pills so women who don’t want to be pregnant never end up getting pregnant in the first place (and therefore will not need abortions).  This is a serious question, and I would love an answer from a conservative female who opposes legal abortion.
•Remember the time Gary Johnson came to AU? That made my life. Gary Johnson 2012! No more foreign wars. Fixing the deficit by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Marriage equality.

•Guys at this school need to learn that ""jokes"" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is.

It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.

•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.

•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually ""promiscuous"" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.

•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

Eagle Rants: July/August 2013





Eagle Rants: June 24, 2013





Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




•Someone remind me why I stayed at AU while the rest of my family is on vacation... on a beautiful island far from the wicked stench of DC sewer air...
•I like you a lot, but I'm worried if I tell you, hanging out will just get way too awkward.
•""And I have known the eyes already, known them all...""
Thank you other Eliot ranter :)
•Seriously, stop caring about other people's sex lives. It's none of your business what I choose to do. Stop trying to force your values down my throat, because I didn't ask for your opinion.
•congratulations, you read an article on promiscuity. now read one on sincerity and come back when you give a crap about how 'depressed' we're going to be for our 'promiscuity'.
•I intern, have a job, volunteer, take 16 credits, and have a pretty active social life. But what am I thinking about most of the time? How excited I am to have explosive sex with my f*** buddy.
•@Pitt bomb threats--yes.  My house is a few minutes away from one of the campuses.  It is very sad to see this happening.
•Do you want to know why I hate the feminists on this campus? It's because they never shut up- I am in the same sociology classes with you semester after semester and I am tired of hearing what you have to say. The classes I am in are not about feminism, so if you could STFU I would appreciate it...
•You got that something that keeps me so off balance.
•@""there are people in this world who would kill you, your family, your friends, anyone who is opposed to them in a heartbeat. But there are people out there stopping them.""  The world is not black and white like you portray. It’s not ‘the bad guys vs us, the good guys’. People don’t randomly hate other people for no reason.  Maybe think about WHY they hate us and what we CAN DO to rectify this anger (hint: more bombings and killings are not helping the situation, only making it much much much worse).
•@""(I'm going to continue posting this until someone replies that they picked it up... hopefully whoever lost it sees this!)"" Um what if they picked up their stuff at lost and found but they don't read eagle rants. Just sayin...
•I hope the person who ranted ""finally free. you held me down for far too long"" was not my ex-boyfriend. I hope that was not how you felt about our relationship because I thought it was pretty great
•When we first met, I was 100% positive you were gay...Then we became friends and I learned you are straight. I'm still waiting for the day you realize you're gay.....
•@join AUCR's and try to make that more prevalent on campus but please do not create this club” Are you serious here? The college republicans disgust me. I identify as libertarian. But I would totally join the conservative feminist group because women’s initiative doesn’t actually accomplish any substantive policy that would help women. Maybe the conservative group would.
•People say the anonymity of the internet brings out the worst in people. But I couldn’t disagree more. Anonymous eagle rants are so full of support for others and concern for helping our community. It really warms my heart when strangers reach out to ne another. Anonymity is totally awesome. (Or maybe the editor is filtering 10 nasty mean rants for every nice rant that is posted. Hmmm)
[Editor's notes: This editor filters the extremely mean, curse-filled, racist, hateful, etc. Rants.]
•@lost and found ranter: Why don’t you just go to lost and found and ask if someone picked up what you dropped off?
•What does FTL mean? Can we PLEASE stop making up acronyms. K thanks.
•@liberal housewife after college: Me too! Why does everyone assume housewives have to be conservative?  So annoying.  I plan on adopting very liberal parenting methods for my kids and cooking organic vegan meals every night. Yay liberal housewives!
•It’s I’m an idiot WHO likes boys, not THAT likes boys. Do we really need to go over this basic grammar concept yet again?
•So conservative women don’t like the abortion stuff, and liberal women want women to be able to not have to worry about getting pregnant. So can we all just rally together around making birth control more accessible? This leads to fewer abortions (which should make the conservatives happy) and more ability to plan one’s own timing of when to start a family (which should make liberals happy). Do we have a deal?
•@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?
•My word search was defective. Not cool. Not cool.
•How few calories does one have to consume before one has an eating disorder? -scared I may be anorexic
•So I pooped at my boyfriend's apartment and forgot to flush the toilet. He definitely saw. How do I fix the awkwardness?
•Question for women who don’t believe in legal abortion : Do you just sit around wishing that women will stop having abortions or do you actually think about how to rectify the situation, like having over the counter birth control pills so women who don’t want to be pregnant never end up getting pregnant in the first place (and therefore will not need abortions).  This is a serious question, and I would love an answer from a conservative female who opposes legal abortion.
•Remember the time Gary Johnson came to AU? That made my life. Gary Johnson 2012! No more foreign wars. Fixing the deficit by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Marriage equality. Where is all the AU support for this socially tolerant and fiscally conservative presidential candidate? You know he is going to win right?
•Can we really not choose who we fall in love with? This has to be an urban myth. TELL ME THIS IS JUST A MYTH?
•If you were my girlfriend,
I'd respect you absolutely.
I'd protect but not cage you.
I'd write poetry about you, even if you weren't around to hear it.
I'd dance with you into the wee hours of the night.
I'd make you laugh without trying.
But you are not my girlfriend.
You're the girlfriend of the guy who just called me ""broseph"" and told me how hard he was going to ""tap that"". Such is life.
•One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today.
•I hate phone interviews!!! I hate them!! I hate all kinds of interviews!!!! Waaahh!! Can't we just, like, I duno, pretend that my resume says EVERYTHING about me, and leave it at that??? gughhghgh so nervous!
•To the absolute moron who is cheating on his beautiful girlfriend: I'm on to you. The only reason I'm not going to kick your ugly rear from here to Japan is because I know you're getting busy with another guy. I would never out you to the world, but I swear to science if you don't own up to your girlfriend about what you're doing...
•Guys at this school need to learn that ""jokes"" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is. I was involved in a sexual harassment case recently, and it is just wrong for someone to make my situation seem more okay for the perpetrators through ""jokes"".  It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.
•Look over there!
Look over there!
Somebody loves you THAT much!
•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.
here's the big problem. I'm a WOMAN, a PERSON, not a GOOD OR A SERVICE. bite me.
•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually ""promiscuous"" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.
•I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(
•That awkward moment when you go to a party full of alumni who have been called by the phonathon and have to defend the phonathon and its workers to them...
•Long Islanders, please join me in prayer for everyone dealing with the brush fire back home. My heart goes out to everyone, and I hope that by the time this is posted, it will be quelled and there will not be too much damage.
•This eagle rant does not exist.
•All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
All men are Socrates.
•To the 25 year old girl with no close female friends: I'm also 25 and have no close female friends. Just know you aren't alone!
•Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...
•And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
•People can hate all they want on TDR, but their mashed potatoes last night were DREAMY.
•What about military doctors? What about service people who get their MD's? I just blew your minds ranters
•Who just posted some TS Eliot? ...I love you.
•what's the point of take back the night?
[Editor's note: ""Take Back the Night seeks to end sexual violence in all its forms including sexual assault, sexual abuse, dating violence, and domestic violence ... Take Back the Night's goal is to create safe communities and respectful relationships through awareness events and initiatives.""]
•@Pitt Bomb Threats - I was between Pitt and AU...this is reason #1001 that I'm glad I came to AU! But I've been following it and I'm very concerned because I have a lot of friends there :/
•@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?
[Editor's note: Uhh, that's way complicated. Why not just meet up somewhere?]
•when i say i miss you i mean it. when i say i love you i mean it.
maybe we should be more than friends, but i dont know if you feel the same way :( #onemonthtoshowyouiloveyouforreals
•North Korea! Stop sending nuclear rockets in the direction of my family!!!!!!!! seriously, stop. No one will think you are cool.  Not even China.  They don't even really like you anyway.  You don't even really like you. god!
•@""condoms in the wellness center could have holes too"" It's not my logic! it's the logic of AU. now see why I'm ranting?
•Where are the lesbians on this campus?  Is there some secret underground lair that I don't know about?
•Editor...please keep editing for content. It's very disappointing scrolling through a list of boring, repetitive rants day in and day out. I very much appreciate the fact that u are not allowing certain ones, it makes it better for the rest of us :)
[Editor's note: Then this editor gets ""yelled"" at for alleged censorship...]
•To the person on the 6th floor that complained about a black male sleeping on the north lounge couch in the wee hours of sunday morning, i hope public safety comes after your ass someday. people do know him on the floor and the fact that you felt the need to report him based off of his race shows how f-ing ignorant you are. racial profiling at its best @AU!
•You see the sizes S, R, L and you think they'd be small, regular, and large. But no. The creators of tampons apparently wanna fuck with hormone-crazed women. They did the complete opposite and renamed internationally recognizes sizes to super, regular, and light. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
•I need to stop creeping on your facebook/twitter. It makes me miserable yet I can't stop doing it. Anyone else have this problem??
•PLEASE just get up with me already, i enjoy hangingout/hookingup with you but i can't take this waiting game!!
•Why is amword so bad? I feel bad for ranting about how bad it is but the most recent issue was awful. Most of the photographs were pixelated or blurry and some of the text was illegible. Please, get your act together. This isn't even the first time this has happened.
•I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????
•I promised myself not to text you too much in order to avoid looking desperate and/or creepy...But at the same time constantly refreshing Facebook chat waiting for that little green dot to pop next to your name is only slightly less stalkerish. And inevitably more frustrating.
•Lets face it. Mark Zuckerburg is the root of all evil when it comes to academic productivity
•How anybody at the Facebook offices ever get anything done is beyond me. Their stalking skills must be at ninja levels now
•I'm feeling the J. Alfred Prufrock as well.
•I thought my gay-dar was bad, but my ***hole-dar is even worse.
•Running at night is the best
•I love literature so much. I love my classes. I love everything we read, and our discussions. I just hate having to write papers SO MUCH. I've written exactly three sentences in four hours.
•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?

2012-04-10,AU,liberal,"Aaron Cohen woke up to a text message around 5:30 p.m. one afternoon saying the AU College Democrats were going to host political consultant Kim Christiansen.
Cohen decided to go to the event, not thinking that anything would come of it. 
Just a few months later, with Christiansen’s help, Cohen was working on Rep. Matt Campbell’s, D-IA, congressional campaign against Rep. Steve King, R-IA.
Campbell went on to win his primary but lost the general election. 
Cohen also worked on a campaign for Francis Thicke, who later became Iowa Secretary of Agriculture. Cohen took a “stagnant operation and turned it around” by raising about $350,000 in a month.
A mere junior in the School of International Service, Cohen now works as a consultant with the objective of adding “value at the community level” to his clients.
He also is the chief communications officer of Sawmill Hollow Family Farm in Iowa, which sells jam — all without ever taking a business class.  
One thing Cohen says he misses about being on the campaign trail is the sense of purpose.
“You wake up every day with a mission,” he said.
On campus, Cohen was both the debate chair of AU Dems and the economic policy chair of the Roosevelt Institute his freshman year. 
Cohen has an air of professional friendliness. But when he needs something done he can be frank and forceful, a skill that came in handy when he was working with campaign staff. 
He says he misses some of the direct contact with the public and making good impressions on people.
“Folks know good folks when they see them,” Cohen said.
When it comes to management, Cohen “loves to talk to interns about strategy in a dialogue” rather than a lecture.
He also feels that if an employee really understands why they are doing something, they are more likely to be invested in the task they are completing. For this reason he admires Sally Shelton-Colby, diplomat-in-residence at AU, because she takes the time to discuss the “why” behind any work she assigns.
In terms of politics, Cohen doesn’t like to be “pinned down” by traditional political labels.  
“I’m a Democrat, but [I’m for] a small and effective government,” Cohen said.
He went on to say that the regulatory system is more difficult for small businesses to maneuver in than big businesses, which stifles growth. 
“I am particularly passionate about growing rural communities,” because he grew up in a small community in Kentucky, “America’s heartland.” (Cohen says he is a fan of the Kentucky Wildcats and has been since before they were popular.)
He is fiscally conservative but socially liberal and insists he is more of a populist than a libertarian.
“I think Republicans have monopolized talking about values, and I hate that because I love talking about why I love America,” he said. 
Cohen is for gay rights and “anti-abortion, pro-choice.” 
“I would never judge anyone,” he said. “I just have a problem with it personally.” 
Whether he is talking about his success in business or as a political consultant, Cohen says, the key to success is knowing how to work with people.
“It’s all organizational theory,” he said.

•I REALLY have to poop but don't want to pack up or leave my stuff alone in the library since there is no one around to ask to watch my stuff. SO FRUSTRATING.
•I want to tell you that your ex boyfriend didn't cheat on you with ""just some girl,"" it was me. But I also want to tell you that it wasn't consensual. But I am too scared to tell you, or anyone else. I am so sorry this happened, to both of us.

•The Eagle should learn to stop editing the work of contributing writers when it doesn't have any grammatical errors. The editor completely mangled a key sentence in my article.
[Editor's note: We edit any submissions for clarity, relativity, length and profanity, in addition to grammar and AP Style. But send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we'll look into it. Also, this editor doesn't know who you are or what you wrote, but just wants to point out that Eagle Contributing Writers are part of The Eagle staff who have written a handful of articles; content submitted by members of the AU community to the Opinion page is not written by ""contributing writers;"" it's written by people who submit content and, thus, do not have the title ""contributing writer.""]
•Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy. I know everyone wants to get a word in, but people want to read something different on their rants. :\
•Dear Editor, thanks for censoring my rant (but really), I wanted to take back what I said after I sent it in!
[Editor's note: Anytime!]
•END OF THE YEAR SEXUAL TENSION. Glad to see I'm not alone in this one.
•I'm sorry I disturbed your mom last night on the quiet floor *raises eyebrows up and down repeatedly*
•LADY MARGARET! LADY MARGARET! A kindly bridge-troll let us in... SILENCE BRIDGE TROLL!
•HI PEGGY!!!
•Why do you even come here Papaya? No body likes you.
•Cucumbers have wicked souls...
•And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?
•To everyone who responded to my postings of T.S. Eliot; thank you as your kind words really touched me (no joke). I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.
•No gorganzola on my turkey cranberry salad from the Tavern?!! Oh HELL NO!! THIS WILL NOT STAND.
•Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours.  Is this right? Just wondering?
•WHY are the einsteins employees so slow!??!!? Seriously someone needs to give them a lesson on assembly lines. I'm not hating on the dining staff, I'm simply asking for faster service.
•If I could choose to be a lesbian, I would at this point. I've had too many bad experiences with guys lately.
•What is a Pitt bomb threat? Can someone please explain this?
-confused alum
[Editor's note: This editor thinks they mean the recent string of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh.]
•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.

•@”@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?” Dang, being editor is complicated.  But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology. Like where you could click a rant and reply to it anonymously and then the person who originally submitted the rant could look at all the anonymous replies and reply to them. Awesomesauce
•morning rants are da bomb
•@”I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.
•It's always nice to pay for a class where the teacher doesn't teach.  Particularly an elementary mathematical modeling class where you have to find your own practice problems on the internet.

•P.S. Please pass me elementary mathematical modeling teacher, even though you can't teach...
•Editor: About how many rants are submitted each day that break the rules and are not posted? jw
[Editor's note: Usually only a few. Depends on the day though. This editor can tell its finals season because Rants are getting angry!]
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling.  You make math tutors angry.
•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...

•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..
•to the ranter who started with ""If you were my girlfriend"" ILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. I'm not actually desperate and I don't really want a relationship you seem like a genuinely nice guy, sometimes hard to find here
•To the lady who just called out a room of girls being too loud: rock on.
•@@where do Au students go to party? : ""Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm ""glad"" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize ""no,"" that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•""@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?""
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since ""repairs"" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since ""safety inspections."" I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

•@""I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left..."" PLEASE SWIPE ME INTO TDR EVERYDAY!!!! -hungry upperclassman with no meal plan and no money
•I REALLY have to poop but don't want to pack up or leave my stuff alone in the library since there is no one around to ask to watch my stuff. SO FRUSTRATING.
•I want to tell you that your ex boyfriend didn't cheat on you with ""just some girl,"" it was me. But I also want to tell you that it wasn't consensual. But I am too scared to tell you, or anyone else. I am so sorry this happened, to both of us.
•So you always used to booty call me but now you don't answer when I booty call you, which is a bummer because I really liked having sex with you
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" the dav
•goal before graduation= have sex in the library. any takers?
•@""Where are the lesbians on this campus?"" women's initiative
•@""One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today."" Story of my life. I feel so much better knowing that I'm not the only one!!
•The Eagle should learn to stop editing the work of contributing writers when it doesn't have any grammatical errors. The editor completely mangled a key sentence in my article.
[Editor's note: We edit any submissions for clarity, relativity, length and profanity, in addition to grammar and AP Style. But send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we'll look into it. Also, this editor doesn't know who you are or what you wrote, but just wants to point out that Eagle Contributing Writers are part of The Eagle staff who have written a handful of articles; content submitted by members of the AU community to the Opinion page is not written by ""contributing writers;"" it's written by people who submit content and, thus, do not have the title ""contributing writer.""]
•Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy. I know everyone wants to get a word in, but people want to read something different on their rants. :\
•Dear Editor, thanks for censoring my rant (but really), I wanted to take back what I said after I sent it in!
[Editor's note: Anytime!]
•END OF THE YEAR SEXUAL TENSION. Glad to see I'm not alone in this one.
•I'm sorry I disturbed your mom last night on the quiet floor *raises eyebrows up and down repeatedly*
•LADY MARGARET! LADY MARGARET! A kindly bridge-troll let us in... SILENCE BRIDGE TROLL!
•HI PEGGY!!!
•Why do you even come here Papaya? No body likes you.
•Cucumbers have wicked souls...
•And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?
•To everyone who responded to my postings of T.S. Eliot; thank you as your kind words really touched me (no joke). I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.
•No gorganzola on my turkey cranberry salad from the Tavern?!! Oh HELL NO!! THIS WILL NOT STAND.
•Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours.  Is this right? Just wondering?
•WHY are the einsteins employees so slow!??!!? Seriously someone needs to give them a lesson on assembly lines. I'm not hating on the dining staff, I'm simply asking for faster service.
•If I could choose to be a lesbian, I would at this point. I've had too many bad experiences with guys lately.
•What is a Pitt bomb threat? Can someone please explain this?
-confused alum
[Editor's note: This editor thinks they mean the recent string of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh.]
•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.
-a true feminist who care about true issues that are negatively affecting females
•@”@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?” Dang, being editor is complicated.  But this is an awesome idea. I bet future AU students will have this technology. Like where you could click a rant and reply to it anonymously and then the person who originally submitted the rant could look at all the anonymous replies and reply to them. Awesomesauce
•morning rants are da bomb
•@”I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(“ I feel ya. And why do people get weirded out if I send them a friend request when we haven’t met before. It’s saying “hi, I don’t know you but you seem interesting and I would like to get to know you.”
•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side? Oh and don’t forget to add ‘all hail great leader’ to the end of each rant.  Actually we probably should just get rid of the whole idea of free speech while we’re at it. Great idea ranter; You’re so smart.
•It's always nice to pay for a class where the teacher doesn't teach.  Particularly an elementary mathematical modeling class where you have to find your own practice problems on the internet.
•@”What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to. Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married” This is a very logical feminist position. If only the Women’s Initiative were actually this logical.
•P.S. Please pass me elementary mathematical modeling teacher, even though you can't teach...
•Editor: About how many rants are submitted each day that break the rules and are not posted? jw
[Editor's note: Usually only a few. Depends on the day though. This editor can tell its finals season because Rants are getting angry!]
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling.  You make math tutors angry.
•My friend just got engaged. She's had 4 boyfriends in the time I've been with my same boyfriend and my bf STILL hasn't proposed. Guys, how do I get him to speed it up and pop the question already? We're in grad school btw, so we aren't too young. And we wouldn't actually get married until we are both finished with grad school. So what gives?
•What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of t his stony rubbish?  Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.
•Soooo.... how about them Red Sox?
•Elementary Mathematical Modeling should not be offered as a course if there is no one to teach it well
•All of my rants about the SG are now going to involve references to the Spartan ephors. Thank you, Eagle, for this clearly appropriate metaphor.
•I like you a lot too.  We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious.  Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward...
•If you're a guy, Take Back the Night is about realizing how many people you know are survivors and how oblivious you were.
•Loving whoever it was that posted La Cage aux Folles lyrics.
When the world spins too fast
And your bubble has burst
Someone puts himself last
So that you can come first
•Love who ever posted Billy Joel lyrics!!

•I don't want to be recognized as ""feminist"" or ""anti feminist"".  I want to be recognized as a HUMAN BEING. Gender is not the epitome of the human person, it is not even the defining characteristic.
•@ Running at night is the best. YES. i try to run in the Tenleytown/Friendship Heights area every week. See ya at midnight?
•I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.
[Editor's note: This editor has been trying to promote peer education and let Ranters direct conversation instead of stepping in. This editor has tried to aid the conversation and provide definitions when appropriate, like by defining stalking and explaining Take Back the Night. This editor tries not to let her personal views stymie conversation, although that often causes her to cringe when reading some Rants. That said, this editor has worked tirelessly to ensure The Eagle covers issues of sexual assault and rape culture this year through extensive coverage of events like Take Back the Night and Don McPherson's speech on feminism, the appointment of Daniel Rappaport, the start of Men of Strength and other gender-based violence issues. This editor cares passionately about such issues and has tried to make that known throughout her tenure as editor-in-chief. (Now that the cat's out of the bag, if you don't read the masthead regularly and haven't put two and two together, this editor is soon to be former Editor-in-Chief Lindsey Anderson.)]
•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, ""You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants...""
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?

Conversation, criticism and view-sharing are one thing; outright profanity, hate speech, racism, sexism, advocating illegal activity and just plain cruelty are another.

•@women choose lower paying jobs. additionally, you need to look up the statistics that show that (white) women have to have a PhD in order to make the same amount as a man with a B.A. That means that women have to shell out more for more than 4 yrs of education in order to earn as much as a man who paid for 4.
•@women choose lower paying jobs. this is effing bs. how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president? how many of them keep those ambitions? it's because they get shamed into thinking they're not good enough for those jobs by society. I'm ashamed of YOU for buying into that bs.
•A woman with a weapon and knows how to use it. There is almost nothing hotter.
•I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside I've got the month of May, I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way? my girl.
•I want to take your advice and just go with it, but my history keeps me from taking that leap. I wish I could be bold, but I can't.
•So Eaglesecure started sucking again on my computer when I was forced to change my myAU password. I was able to fix it by going into the command line. I wonder how AU students who aren't super-technical computer geniuses are supposed to survive with this thing?
•One is not two countries. One is not meat corrupting. It is important to stay sweet and loving.
•What most people don't know is, if you have enough credits, you can lower your meal plan. Last year I only had 100 meal swipes second semester :D
•I have never saved the world. I have played beer pong. I'm okay with this.
•what makes you think a bunch of anonymous ranters who are probably most all undergraduates who don't know you or your boyfriend at all will somehow help you figure out his mindset and why he hasn't proposed if you as his girlfriend can't. what gives indeed
•@""Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours. Is this right? Just wondering?"" No. You can call the department and anonymously report her.
•Do I Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet–and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
•stop hating on the Eagle/the editor.. it's their job, let them do it because they do it well
[Editor's note: Aww thanks.]
•I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above
•You clearly didn't do any research if you think that women get paid the same as men do for equal work.  Women's Initiative is not saying that a female teacher should make as much money as a male lawyer.  WI is saying that a female teacher and a male teacher on equal ground should be paid the same.  Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.
•@person who didn't give consent- not saying anything does not ever mean it was consented to.. and about AU doing more to educate, if you took a look at Women's Initiative, you would see there is a sub-group called ""Consensual"" that is dedicated completely to educating students about consent. I would look there for more information and I am truly so sorry about what happened to you.
•@Dear SIS: THIS! Seriously, SIS you have your own building that's beautiful and new. Stop infringing on our space.
•Funny how a melody / Sounds like a memory / Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
•i've heard that AU is going on a witch hunt to dig up stuff about fraternities to try to get them kicked off campus in favor of fraternities that aren't as popular on campus but are loved by the administration. why does AU keep making up lies to get people in trouble and decrease the amount of fun????  this pisses me off...where's the transparency?
•@once you're pregnant, it's not just your body.
It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it. And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.
•@""I like you a lot too. We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious. Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward..."" It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Just go for it.
•STRESS
•@legal guardian of younger brother: You sound like a really great guy. If your gf can't give you the support you need then there are plenty of great local support groups for family members dealing with caring for a child with autism. You should check them out. Good luck!
•@sex in the library: sounds good.
•Can't remember my own age. ""Am I nineteen? I think I'm eighteen. yeah,I'm eighteen.""
•I feel like I should've taken better advantage of the potential to hook up and meet people this year. In just a few weeks, thousands of students will graduate and I'll probably never get the chance to meet/hook up with them again...
•@won’t be donating to AU bc of eagle rants: I will be donating money to AU every time they call BECAUSE of the eagle rants. They have helped AU become a community more than any other initiative. They provide a forum for free discussion. They give a daily boost of happiness. And they show how smart and supportive AU students are. And they give alumni a window into current AU happenings.
•I can't take this anymore. By stress blood pressure is through the roof.
•I want to go back to my high school reunion, but I was bullied a lot during high school and Im scared that some of my classmates will still be very immature and mean. Should I risk going or should I skip it and be ""that girl"" who didn't go to the reunion bc I had no friends in high school.
•@using a credit card at TDR: I am also surprised at how few people do this. Newsflash: You don't need (not do I recommend) getting a meal plan. They rip you off. Just go when you want and pay with credit card or cash.
•@”I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.” People like you make me ashamed to be an alum of this university. I’ve read eagle rants every day since the day they were invented and there have never been rants that promote “rape culture”. People who want women to be held to an equal standard than men while drunk are not promoting a “rape culture”.
•@”[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]” This was a rather rude reply. Why not apologize and then say what you said.
•@ranter who thinks rants support rape culture: The editor rightly made you look like a fool by pointing out that the eagle frequent does women’s issues stories especially when it comes to the rape issue (probably more so than any other college in the country due to AU’s extremely powerful lobby from Women’s Initiative being part of student government).  Please think outside your small bubble and learn to accept differing opinions and viewpoints.
•My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got my nerd friends (RPG, Halo, etc), my floormates (drinking, shenanigans), my occupy friends, hispanic friends. Its so goddamn difficult, because I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have to focus on my goddamn GPA and how I'm going to spend my life, when I really want to focus on getting a girlfriend and who I'm going to spend my life with. And at the moment, noone wants to be my girlfriend.
•Dear (who I can only assume to be) freshmen ranters:
You have made Eagle Rants suck.  The majority of what you post aren't even rants, they're just political crap or statements.  The last couple years had REAL rants.  I'm sure you have stuff you dislike about this crappy school of ours, so stop arguing about abortion and complain.
Sincerely,
Bored Upperclassman
•Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...
•I love the idiot hippies who protest events at this school when their hero Che said gems like “The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.”
•Why are you so talkative on words with friends but as soon as we see each other in public you shut right up? One out of ten games on words with friends ends up in a hook up and I want you to be that one!!
•Women’s initiative does not make me feel empowered. It only tries to make me feel like the world is a scary dangerous place full of evil rapist men. I look forward to the soon-to-be created conservative women’s group that will hopefully be much more empowering to women.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain.."" I find therapy very helpful. There student center on campus is great, and there are a lot of therapists in the area. It's good to just have an objective outsider to talk to sometimes. In a fix, videogames are pretty great too...
•I'm always scared that people will think that I wrote rants about them here.  It's kind of creepy how familiar some of these sound.
•OIT used Wikipedia as a source in their email in addition to terrible grammar. EVERYONE SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE AND CLAIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS OK WITH IT.
•@T.S. Eliot: HUGS HUGS HUGS
•@Night runner: See you tonight! :)
•It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle in Wednesday's post. The Editor's done a good job cleaning up Knepper's mess that she inherited. The Eagle Rants are so interesting because we--actual students--get a platform to say what we want. I commend the Editor for not censoring those rants. It encourages debate and discussion. Now you can actually see how much work needs to be done on the feminism front at AU if that's something you care about.
•that awkward moment at phonathon when the person you're calling has the same name as your high school principal and you get really scared for a second...
•I sit next to a beautiful girl at phonathon.
•It has gotten to the point where the only point I am relaxed is when I'm at work. Because I'm not allowed to do school work then
•It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes
•I am an Republican, but what's happening in Arizona is just plain wrong. Seriously someone needs to stop them. That abortion bill makes no sense
•I believe in God and believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. If you don't, then let's be friends
•Who wants to start a Fight Club? once we get enough members we will start enforcing the rules
[Editor's note: Rule #1 - Don't talk about Fight Club.]
•Need to heal emotional pain? Jesus will take the wheel. Prayer helps...and tea...and green trees.
[Editor's note: Hoped this editor edited your Rant right!]
•Welcome to the Emptiness
•Why are you so awesome? I'm weird but cool and so are you...how did we find each other? Thanks OKCupid, even though we didn't meet on there.
•Now that were good and lost lets party
•Why do I close up and get scared when you tell me how much you like me? The feeling is mutual, but it's always been a problem for me to share my feelings. I hope you can see how much I'm grateful that you walked into my life. Perfect timing.
•@ Whenever I e-mail a paper to myself to print, I write nice notes to myself in the subject line so I feel like there are people who love me and think good things about me.
I know its late, but I do this too!!!!!  From now on, I'll think of you as well each time I do this.  :D
•@""Alright, half of the rants were about conservative women, liberal women, contraceptives, abortion- PLEASE, this is crazy."" Shall we rant about men? How about them crazy boys?!
•Roomie, I adore you. And I get that you like talking on the phone in the room, I do too. But somehow your voice is three times louder on the phone than on real life.....
•@""TA is making us pay"" Absolutely not. It may technically be legal if it's not her office hours, but it's rude and not why you should be a TA. There are other great resources-- the writing center, academic support, professors, friends. That TA just sucks. I ask my TA dumb questions all the time and he's fine with it. Better luck next time, and consider mentioning it to your prof.
•""you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life"" I love you.
•@""Lately, I've been going through some major life changes..."" Those are pretty major, I'd be surprised if she was completely not understanding. Maybe bring them up casually in conversation, gauge out her reaction?I have no idea. But if I were her, I'd probably be worried but not want to make you more worried about the new pressures. She might appreciate you bringing it up so she knows it's ok to talk about.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol."" Art? Throw some paint around, get your hands dirty, stop thinking for a bit. :)
•Why does is everyone so effing annoying? I'm so sick of dealing with this.
•I don't understand why my prof has such a high rating on ratemyprofessor... He assigns so much busywork, his grading system doesn't make sense, and the essay assignments he comes up with are just plain dumb. I've never hated a class so much before in my life...and this is my favorite subject, too. :/
•sometimes i think my HIGH libido talks for me...
•All I want is to sleep, party, and for someone to hold me when I need it until everything is all the way better.
•While I appreciate the sincerity about the fact we only want to use each other for hook ups... the fact that you can't hold a conversation has made you lose all chances you ever had with me. If you're that boring in conversation you must be boring in bed.
•@""What they promote is the idea that women CAN...""
Yeah. Sure. Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.
•To the T.S. Eliot ranter: I want you here, please don't leave.
•Do you know what's a real tragedy? That WI thinks that people are ignoring the rape of women and that people ""aren't taking rape seriously"". Seriously? If anything it's women who are ignoring the consistent sexual abuse of men by fostering a culture where men are supposed to protect women, and where men ""can't"" be abused. Not only that, but it was incredibly hard to study during ""Take Back the Night"" and it achieved nothing than furthering the goals of the female circlejerk that is Women's Initiative. It is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.
•My boyfriend and I (long-distance) have planned on getting married for a long time. Now he's saying he's not happy, and he might want a break. Suddenly all that Vicodin leftover from my surgery is looking pretty freaking good.
•You're strong, reliable, and authentic, and you'll make it through to the other side of all of this.
•I took her out, it was a Friday night - I walk alone, to get the feeling right. We started making out, and she took off her pants, but then I turned on the TV... and that's about the time she walked AWAYYY FROM MEEE. Nobody likes you when you're TWENTYYY THREEE and I'm still more amused by TV shows; what the hell is ADD? My friends say I should act my age... what's my age again? What's my age again?
•Omnivores: please do not take tofurkey for the novelty, or I will carve a V into your face
•@The love for the La Cage and the Billy Joel lyrics posts: Thanks for all the love! I just saw La Cage earlier this semester at the Kennedy Center and loved it!
As for Billy Joel fan, I've been nonstop listening for the last few days. I can never get enough of his songs! :D #proudlongislandboy
•I hate to break it to you guys, but the original free speech board wasn't taken down because of speech issues, it was taken down because people drew penises all over it.  Turns out some college students still don't really have much to share with the public besides their genitalia.
•@Dear SIS: I was thinking the exact same thing. I realize that Katzen is a big space to put events. I do. But blocking several classrooms with tables all day is ridiculous. Half of those tables were not even used. They were set up around 10 am and were not taken down until around 8 pm. The fact that they don't even let students know what events will be happening when is very inconsiderate.
•Hey ANTH 225! Why do you stare like you have no light going on in your head. When the teacher says ""Hey, there are no wrong answers"" then there are no wrong answers. And I see writing notes, but you know thats not gonna do you any good in a class MOSTLY ABOUT PARTICIPATION! Stop wasting everyones time and participate, you are paying 50,000 to be here...
•I think that someone suggested a chess club a while ago, but I forgot to reply. Anyway, if there was a chess club, I would definitely join it!
•Why is this so much fun?
•The azaleas outside Kreeger are magnificent! I think the azeleas on the eastern back side of Kay feel jealous, since they're so little and dinky.
•I swear, one of my professors is creating some kind of Pavlovian response in me- as soon as I see the phrase, ""Well, you're off to a good start!"" I immediately know I failed.
••I'm a GW Student. An AU friend told me about rants, and I've been reading them for awhile. I have lots of boyfriend issues too. Am I allowed to rant?
[Editor's note: Rants are anonymous so no one will ever know. Well, until you tell ...]
•Dear roommate, can you please stop changing your nail polish every single day. The fumes from the nail polish remover give me a headache. And I don't see why you think you need a new color every day. It makes you look like you have too much time on your hands.
•Why are guys so clueless? I wasn't looking for a genius solution, I was looking for SUPPORT! Why can't you just agree with me that I was screwed over and feel sorry for me and kiss me? Why must you launch into inferring that you told me so. I makes me feel very inferior.
•@everyone submitting poetry: Can we please cite who wrote the poetry at the end? I'm pretty sure ranting without citations is still plagiarism. And if you are writing your own poetry and want to remain anonymous, just sign it ""self"".
•I think the eagle should publish 'about me' information for every current editor editing rants. The ranters deserve to know who is commenting on their personal issues. (Btw this editor has been my favorite commenter so far.)
[Editor's note: Aww thanks. The reason why Rant editors refrain from identifying themselves is so everyone has the space and privacy to share on Rants. This editor wouldn't want her classmates or friends to refrain from Ranting just because they know she's editing them. Make sense?]
•What am I supposed to be addicted to once Desperate Housewives is on the air? Does anyone have suggestions for shows that are equally as awesome as Desperate Housewives? (Besides Grey's Anatomy, of course).
•@everyone supporting the LDR support group idea: I've taken the first steps to try and form the group. Hopefully it will be up and running in the near future.
•I love you like crazy.
•@tampon ranter: I am equally outraged at the confusing labeling of tampons. I've started using the birth control shot so that I only have 4 periods a year. I haven't had any side effects with it yet.
•Why do I have so many pimples? It's so unfair.
•It's 4:23 and there are NO RANTS UP YET. Not cool. Not cool.
[Editor's note: Apologies for the tardier-than-usual-ness, but please relax. This editor was down at the D.C. court all day covering two murder trials for her internship.]
•I am a transfer student and no matter how hard I try, just can't make friends. It seems like People in my dorm are never in the lounge and clubs meet too infrequently/just have speakers which does not allow me to interact with others. Is there any other way to make friends besides academic/sport clubs, dorms, and class?
•I've clearly been spoiled by morning rants...it's 4:30 and I need my fix!
[Editor's note: See above.]
•Hey editor,
You know that by taking extra time to edit rants before you post them makes you pretentious right? Who are we if not your humble subjects? I mean I understand editing the nasty and hateful ones but editing for content and pick and choosing? Where do you get off?
[Editor's note: Huh? This editor's a bit confused at what you're asking. This editor does not edit Rants, merely deletes the inappropriate ones. (See link to rules at the top.) Clarity, please?]

Eagle Rants: July/August 2013





Eagle Rants: June 24, 2013





Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




[Editor's note: This editor understands that it's finals seasons, which means stress and tension; but please, Ranters, follow the rules of Ranting, and please don't be hateful against people or groups of people. Conversation, criticism and view-sharing are one thing; outright profanity, hate speech, racism, sexism, advocating illegal activity and just plain cruelty are another. To the Ranter who once asked how many Rants this editor deletes each day, I take back my response; we've gone well over a dozen today.]
•@women choose lower paying jobs. additionally, you need to look up the statistics that show that (white) women have to have a PhD in order to make the same amount as a man with a B.A. That means that women have to shell out more for more than 4 yrs of education in order to earn as much as a man who paid for 4.
•@women choose lower paying jobs. this is effing bs. how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president? how many of them keep those ambitions? it's because they get shamed into thinking they're not good enough for those jobs by society. I'm ashamed of YOU for buying into that bs.
•A woman with a weapon and knows how to use it. There is almost nothing hotter.
•I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside I've got the month of May, I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way? my girl.
•I want to take your advice and just go with it, but my history keeps me from taking that leap. I wish I could be bold, but I can't.
•So Eaglesecure started sucking again on my computer when I was forced to change my myAU password. I was able to fix it by going into the command line. I wonder how AU students who aren't super-technical computer geniuses are supposed to survive with this thing?
•One is not two countries. One is not meat corrupting. It is important to stay sweet and loving.
•What most people don't know is, if you have enough credits, you can lower your meal plan. Last year I only had 100 meal swipes second semester :D
•I have never saved the world. I have played beer pong. I'm okay with this.
•what makes you think a bunch of anonymous ranters who are probably most all undergraduates who don't know you or your boyfriend at all will somehow help you figure out his mindset and why he hasn't proposed if you as his girlfriend can't. what gives indeed
•@""Our TA is making us pay for her services outside of her office hours. Is this right? Just wondering?"" No. You can call the department and anonymously report her.
•Do I Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet–and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
•stop hating on the Eagle/the editor.. it's their job, let them do it because they do it well
[Editor's note: Aww thanks.]
•I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above
•You clearly didn't do any research if you think that women get paid the same as men do for equal work.  Women's Initiative is not saying that a female teacher should make as much money as a male lawyer.  WI is saying that a female teacher and a male teacher on equal ground should be paid the same.  Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.
•@person who didn't give consent- not saying anything does not ever mean it was consented to.. and about AU doing more to educate, if you took a look at Women's Initiative, you would see there is a sub-group called ""Consensual"" that is dedicated completely to educating students about consent. I would look there for more information and I am truly so sorry about what happened to you.
•@Dear SIS: THIS! Seriously, SIS you have your own building that's beautiful and new. Stop infringing on our space.
•Funny how a melody / Sounds like a memory / Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
•i've heard that AU is going on a witch hunt to dig up stuff about fraternities to try to get them kicked off campus in favor of fraternities that aren't as popular on campus but are loved by the administration. why does AU keep making up lies to get people in trouble and decrease the amount of fun????  this pisses me off...where's the transparency?
•@once you're pregnant, it's not just your body.
It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it. And don't tell me ""omg that's a living thing you're talking about""...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.
•@""I like you a lot too. We wouldn't hang out with each other if we didn't like each other, so all it would really be is stating the obvious. Which I would do, except that I'm afraid it would be awkward..."" It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Just go for it.
•STRESS
•@legal guardian of younger brother: You sound like a really great guy. If your gf can't give you the support you need then there are plenty of great local support groups for family members dealing with caring for a child with autism. You should check them out. Good luck!
•@sex in the library: sounds good.
•Can't remember my own age. ""Am I nineteen? I think I'm eighteen. yeah,I'm eighteen.""
•I feel like I should've taken better advantage of the potential to hook up and meet people this year. In just a few weeks, thousands of students will graduate and I'll probably never get the chance to meet/hook up with them again...
•@won’t be donating to AU bc of eagle rants: I will be donating money to AU every time they call BECAUSE of the eagle rants. They have helped AU become a community more than any other initiative. They provide a forum for free discussion. They give a daily boost of happiness. And they show how smart and supportive AU students are. And they give alumni a window into current AU happenings.
•I can't take this anymore. By stress blood pressure is through the roof.
•I want to go back to my high school reunion, but I was bullied a lot during high school and Im scared that some of my classmates will still be very immature and mean. Should I risk going or should I skip it and be ""that girl"" who didn't go to the reunion bc I had no friends in high school.
•@using a credit card at TDR: I am also surprised at how few people do this. Newsflash: You don't need (not do I recommend) getting a meal plan. They rip you off. Just go when you want and pay with credit card or cash.
•@”I'm disappointed at the Eagle for publishing so many misogynistic, anti-feminist, and victim blaming rants. I'm glad to be graduating and i won't be donating any money to this university until we stop validating rape culture though student publications.” People like you make me ashamed to be an alum of this university. I’ve read eagle rants every day since the day they were invented and there have never been rants that promote “rape culture”. People who want women to be held to an equal standard than men while drunk are not promoting a “rape culture”.
•@”[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]” This was a rather rude reply. Why not apologize and then say what you said.
•@ranter who thinks rants support rape culture: The editor rightly made you look like a fool by pointing out that the eagle frequent does women’s issues stories especially when it comes to the rape issue (probably more so than any other college in the country due to AU’s extremely powerful lobby from Women’s Initiative being part of student government).  Please think outside your small bubble and learn to accept differing opinions and viewpoints.
•My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got my nerd friends (RPG, Halo, etc), my floormates (drinking, shenanigans), my occupy friends, hispanic friends. Its so goddamn difficult, because I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I have to focus on my goddamn GPA and how I'm going to spend my life, when I really want to focus on getting a girlfriend and who I'm going to spend my life with. And at the moment, noone wants to be my girlfriend.
•Dear (who I can only assume to be) freshmen ranters:
You have made Eagle Rants suck.  The majority of what you post aren't even rants, they're just political crap or statements.  The last couple years had REAL rants.  I'm sure you have stuff you dislike about this crappy school of ours, so stop arguing about abortion and complain.
Sincerely,
Bored Upperclassman
•Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves...
•I love the idiot hippies who protest events at this school when their hero Che said gems like “The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.”
•Why are you so talkative on words with friends but as soon as we see each other in public you shut right up? One out of ten games on words with friends ends up in a hook up and I want you to be that one!!
•Women’s initiative does not make me feel empowered. It only tries to make me feel like the world is a scary dangerous place full of evil rapist men. I look forward to the soon-to-be created conservative women’s group that will hopefully be much more empowering to women.
•@""How do I deal with emotional pain.."" I find therapy very helpful. There student center on campus is great, and there are a lot of therapists in the area. It's good to just have an objective outsider to talk to sometimes. In a fix, videogames are pretty great too...
•I'm always scared that people will think that I wrote rants about them here.  It's kind of creepy how familiar some of these sound.
•OIT used Wikipedia as a source in their email in addition to terrible grammar. EVERYONE SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE AND CLAIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS OK WITH IT.
•@T.S. Eliot: HUGS HUGS HUGS
•@Night runner: See you tonight! :)
•It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle in Wednesday's post. The Editor's done a good job cleaning up Knepper's mess that she inherited. The Eagle Rants are so interesting because we--actual students--get a platform to say what we want. I commend the Editor for not censoring those rants. It encourages debate and discussion. Now you can actually see how much work needs to be done on the feminism front at AU if that's something you care about.

It seems like People in my dorm are never in the lounge and clubs meet too infrequently/just have speakers which does not allow me to interact with others. Is there any other way to make friends besides academic/sport clubs, dorms, and class?
•I've clearly been spoiled by morning rants...it's 4:30 and I need my fix!
[Editor's note: See above.]
•Hey editor,
You know that by taking extra time to edit rants before you post them makes you pretentious right? Who are we if not your humble subjects? I mean I understand editing the nasty and hateful ones but editing for content and pick and choosing? Where do you get off?
[Editor's note: Huh? This editor's a bit confused at what you're asking. This editor does not edit Rants, merely deletes the inappropriate ones. (See link to rules at the top.) Clarity, please?]

After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The controversy has forced our nation into intense self-examination: of its gun policies, of race relations, of police practices. What else has this tragedy exposed? And what can we learn from it?

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

2012-11-09,AU,liberal,"• Good things come to those who wait.
• Tell your boyfriend who wants a sexually open relationship to go f*** himself.  If he loves you, and if the two of you want to start a family together, then he needs to be in a place where he can support you unconditionally.  End of story.  It sounds like he's more concerned with himself than he is with you, and that's a sign that you should kick him to the curb.  I promise that you can find a better guy out there who would love you more than he does.
• As a guy, I can tell you that there are A LOT of us who would never dream of cheating, or even want an open relationship if our partners were okay with it.  Your boyfriend sounds like a major douche, and that's not something I would normally say to someone.
• @netflix you tool: clearly you can't read. My original rant was asking for an alternative to Netflix. The person who responded recommended imdb. Then i thanked him. Try and keep up.
• @Tried to ask a girl out last night and couldn’t work up the courage….urghh maybe I’m not ready :( What is the first letter of her name? 
• ADBLOCK SUGGESTER, I LOVE YOU 
• To EVERYONE complaining about CAUS. I get why your mad but yo there where flyers everywhere. And don't act like you were sleeping. It happened so get over it
• There's a chance we could make it now; we'll be rocking til the sun goes down
• @""I can't wait to meet you""- me either ;)
• Girl desperate for her bf to propose: what he is doing is extremely manipulative, and it sounds like you're in a relationship that's hurting you more than it's helping you. As hard as this sounds, you need to break it off. There IS someone out there who will treat you better and want monogamy. You deserve so, so much better. Good luck!
• ""Turn out the light Don't try to save me Well you may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right""
• meh meh meh meh meh
• You ask the most annoying/interesting questions in class everyday. I can't make up my mind whether I hate you or not. 
• There is no such thing as bad publicity.  Way to go CAUS.
• To the cute guy with curly hair sitting in TDR with your friends on the cereal side...you're cute :)
• Liking to be dominated is not super kinky.  It's more like french vanilla.
• Wow @ all the people complaining about the CAUS making noise. I was in the library at the time and it was really not all that disturbing and 11:15 isn't exactly the dead of night. I didn't take part in this thing since I didn't know about it, but it's so lame that the rich kids here would rather pay thousands of dollars more in tuition than make some effort to fight this if it means making some noise (or disturbing poor Kerwin's sleep, as if his tuition hikes aren't going to screw us all over in our personal lives way more).
• The hot tub's too hot.
• @RE:@super bummed: I am talking about you, E.J. with two E's! When do you want meet? How's Monday ~11:45 at the dav? I'll be inside!
• Anyone saying the CAUS protest was too disruptive has clearly never heard of protesting. 
• To the people that complain about eagle rants...if you don't like them, don't read them.
• I'd love to know what ""student body"" the CAUS claims to represent when they do nothing but bash every single student who disagrees with them. Their facebook page includes comments like ""f student government"" (Newsflash: it's the group that's ACTUALLY elected to represent. Y'all just decided you're representative) and diatribes basically bashing every STUDENT group that doesn't worship at their unwashed feet. Get over yourselves and stop embarrassing this campus. 
• @""bf of 4 years said he would propose and we can get married if I agree to a sexually open marriage."" Woah woah woah. No, men don't always cheat, he's just got no self-control. He's probably cheated on you already, get out of there.
• Yes. I really miss talking to her, that’s all!: Yeah, I'm trying. It's weird when they've moved on, but you haven't. It'll come though, in time. We got this :)
• @ ""I actually really hope family values are destroyed.  Families are dumb.""  Congratulations, I think you pretty much just summarized the DNC platform.  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools. 
• @ ""When I read Liberals R Tools’ posts, I imagine a tiny little man frothing at the mouth and rolling on the ground spewing nonsense.""  That's funny - when I read liberals' posts, I imagine a dirty hippie with an attitude and a sense of entitlement.  Oh wait...that's reality.  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools.
• Can we start talking again? I know you don't want to be anything more, you have your girl. Please, I miss you in my life and your hilarious personality. Answer my texts, even if they're late at night, just answer them in the morning or whenever. I miss being the friends we were like two weeks ago. I'll take the friendzone over this zone of nothingness.  
• sorry I'm not screwing up my life, but just because you are doesn't make you better than I am.
• Learned something today small talk=friend zoned, flirting=relationship (possibly)
• Today I learned it's not just guys that participate in No-Shave-November....didn't think I needed to know that
• @""grindr suicide"":  Yeah, but maybe the people you blocked won't notice, or you can block them again, change your picture/headline so they don't notice, etc. Is the cutie worth it? ;)
• @""grindr's sketchy as anything."" I completely understand everything you've said and I really really appreciate it. It's definitely sketchy, but I don't use it for random/weird hookups cause that's not my thing.  But anyway, it's nice to know there are other quality gay guys out there. Maybe we'll meet someday, and if not, I hope at least you find one of the great guys in our ""boat.""  Thanks again. -Gay Ranter
• @more organic student-set-up-dating service: I agree! forget the student government and hall councils, you're right! my bad :P
• @open relationship proposal: what. the. actual. f*ck. He's not being ""honest,"" he's being stupid.  I don't care what you learned in whatever class, but ""it still hurts"" for a reason.  I'm a guy, and if I'm going to propose to someone, I'm going into it with the intent of "" 'till death do us part.""  Not "" 'till I eventually cheat.""  I know people do open marriages, but you don't sound too fond of it. There are PLENTY of guys out there who will want to marry you and be with you-and only you.
• I love my roommate, really, but she's such a hypocrite and completely intolerant. I respect her outrageous religious views she forces on everyone and I don't say a word when she constantly tries to up one everyone, but tonight when I was watching the Youtube video on Obama tearing up whilst thanking his staff, she storms in and goes ""He's a lying thief"". Im sorry, what? I never said a word to you! We just had a lovely evening. I've never been that blunt about things about her I don't like, but maybe I'll start to be
• does know who i is? does you listen to music? do you watch tv? DO YOU CARRY A LUNCHBOX?!
• Craig Ferguson is hilarious
• We need white voters; not just blacks and hispanics.  Saying its not a white election is racist and it only furers the discrimination that divides our nation. 
• don't stand so close to me
• Call me old-fashioned, but for me the purpose of marriage is for two people (regardless of gender identity) to proclaim to each other and their loved ones that they deeply love each other and they want to only be each other for the rest of their lives. The fact that he's saying ""most men cheat anyways"" tells me that a) he has no self control and b) he will end up cheating on you. 
• And I bet you any money that if you took advantage of the openness of this marriage, he would have a problem (no matter what he says now). You have to leave this guy. If after 4 years he still doesn't want to commit to you and only you, chances are he's not going to anytime soon. 
• Brace yourselves, the CAUS reply rants are coming...
• Yeah, Obama authorized drone strikes which killed civilians and children. It's a tragedy. But Romney would have done the same thing, and he would have taken our country back 50 years. So that's why we're celebrating. Should we be mourning the fact that some third party candidate who statistically had no chance of winning didn't win?
• Ward is full of gorgeous ladies right now. YAY
• Wooohooo a bunch more just came in. 
• wait, this must be a trap... ALL MEN GET OUT OF WARD IMMEDIATELY
• ""I should just buy the United States"" - Mitt Romney
• Eagle rants needs a trigger warning. Editors, consider that or perhaps limiting the obscenely offensive comments. (I mean, whatever happened with the whole hate speech? That isn't protected under any law, FYI)
• CAUS deserves all the hate it gets here on Eagle Rants. They are simply dogmatic, obnoxious, whiners who don't understand the mechanics of the real world. Every CAUS member I've talked to has never had to truly work for themselves and is more disrespectful of personal rights than anyone else I know.
• I think I'm getting sick for the third time this semester :(
• I really like this girl on my floor.  We went to lunch and I had a great time.  I really hope it works out this time.
• DO NOT MARRY HIM. He probably is already cheating and that's why wants an open relationship. You are young. You deserve someone who won't make you hurt. Kick his sorry a*s to the curb. 
• glad you're taking the hint and being more of a Lship biddie than a bear. 
• lol, CAUS has become the most hated entity on AU since Alex Knepper.
• You keep saying exploited... I do not think that word means what you think it means.
• Hey Everyone! I know what we should do! Since none of us have anything better to do and our lives are so meaningless that the only way for us to find joy is in *itching about EVERYTHING, irregardless of its relevance in our own lives, lets all act like a bunch of petulant children and bang on pots and pans in the middle of the night... oh wait, we already did that.  
• I sometimes, check that, ALWAYS wish I had never met you. You communist kids without a caus (haha see what I did there) are always looking for something to champion. It really is too bad that you don't see how most of the problems you want to ""fix,"" you created in the first place. 
• When I talk to you, I like to think that Darwin would be disappointed. 
• I wish I was your second derivative so I could investigate your concavities. 
• Wanna expand my polynomial? 
• All that Communism needs to make it successful is someone to feed and clothe it.
• @Open marriage girl.  Yes you are wrong to agree to that.  Statistically the younger you get married, the more likely you are to get divorced.  Wait until you find someone who's ready to commit to YOU.
• Most people who read ""The Communist Manifesto"" probably have no idea that it was written by a couple of young men who had never worked a day in their lives, and who nevertheless spoke boldly in the name of ""the workers"". ~Thomas Sowell
-Sound like anyone else we know? (cough, cough, CAUS, cough)
• Can someone explain why someone yelled ""sell your house"" at Neil Kerwin in that Caus video? Really? Sell your house? What good would that do? Herp de derp, we want tuition to go down, herp de derp, sell your house! Just no.
• There are 5 people in my contemporary Africa class paying attention right now. I have no idea what the point of his lecture is as usual. WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
• @Iwould’vewhistled  Cut the patriarchy and check your privilege.
• @Sexism Erm, no.  That's called prejudice.  You can't be sexist against men because, definitionally, 'sexism' and 'racism', and all other 'isms' imply a societal stance against a particular group.  You can be PREJUDICED against men, but then there's not much you can do about it, as a woman.  Ergo THE DIFFERENCE.
• @Ican'tstopcutting  Talk to somebody.  Do you want me to give you my doctor's name?
• @""Let's go to all the CAUS members' doors in the middle of the night and yell and scream at that. See how that feels."" Uh pretty sure they're not the ones making me go even further into debt next year and the year after to keep going to AU. Anyway I think the whole point is that it doesn't feel so good to be waken up by banging pots

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

• I wrote this song a real long time ago - a real long time ago - back in 94
• People on here are honestly so pathetic, cuddling, relationships, and hookups through eagle rants? 
• I hate my life 
• Tried to ask a girl out last night and couldn't work up the courage....urghh maybe I'm not ready :(
• I would've whistled as you walked by, but we were on the silent floor ;)
• Why did CNN completely ignore the over a million votes that Gary Johnson got? Wtf
• Number of Yemeni civilians killed by Obama's drone strikes: 60-163 
Number of Yemeni children killed by Obama's drone strikes:24-34

• When you're feeling terrible just remember; Edward Furlong made an album of terrible songs.
• You may be right. I may be crazy. But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.
• @Super bummed..........I think you're talking about me, you're from Texas, right? I was wondering why you hadn't texted me! I had really wanted you to :)
• There are absolutely some women and some men who hate other men strictly because they are male.  This is sexism.  Just because it isn't common doesn't mean that it doesn't occur.  
• @pandora for tv shows: it's called netflix you tool
• Dear CAUS- If you're going to hold a protest how about not doing right next to my room while I'm trying to do homework. 
• CAUS- I'm all for freedom of assembly but respect your peers and don't bang pots and pans at 11 PM. That does not get the administration's attention, it just annoys other students. 
• wish that i believed in fate. wish i didn't sleep so late. 
• C'mon CAUSE, it's quiet hours!
• Why does Shepard Smith still work at Fox News? He must have the patience of a saint.
• @Congrats, liberal tools: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought equal rights, pay equity, addressing health disparities, and accepting ALL  families WERE FAMILY VALUES. 
My bad.
(Also, I'll take that veiled insult as a point of pride.)
• There is such a large population of student-athletes who are participating at the club level at AU and they continually go without any praise/coverage/respect. This semester the Equestrian Team placed 5th on the east coast and the Women's Rugby team won the Potomac Rugby Union Championship... Cmon Eagle, I thought you were a ""campus"" newspaper. 
• CAUS I don't who's your chief organizer for protests and such but fire them because judging from LA quad residents's statuses you might have lost a good chunk of support because of tonight's stunt
• @""Hope the taste of division and destruction of family values is nice for you"" I actually really hope family values are destroyed.  Families are dumb.
• @Young Justice fan, Nope you are not alone :)  Signed a fan of cartoons and great animation
• 23 rants posted the day after the election? AU you confuse me
• Eagle Rants bored me today :( Where'd the fun go...?
• I'm thinking people didn't rant much on the 7th... Or their rants just didn't meet the requirements ....??? Where'd everyone's random thoughts go?? 
• I love how quiet hours only matter to people when the CAUS is outside yelling. My floor sounds like that every night
• Re: Assissins Creed commercials. American Revolutions weren't singing ""America the Bueautiful"". Just sayin
• Can't wait to go to Colorado for Christmas break and smoke a shiz ton of legal weed. Boo yaaaaaa

• When I read Liberals R Tools' posts, I imagine a tiny little man frothing at the mouth and rolling on the ground spewing nonsense. 
• I am so kinky, and no one would ever be able to tell. I like a guy dominating me.
• To the kids who woke me up by protesting high tuition outside of my window, I need sleep so I can wake up and go to my two jobs tomorrow to support myself and pay for school. As an American you have the liberty to choose where you go to school. If you don't like how much you pay, get out.
• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums. And yes. He's accountable to a Board of Trustees. It's how the real world works, and it's designed to benefit you to the fullest. Get. Over. It. 
• The CAUS is annoying, skews facts to fit their worldview, underlines the obvious and managed to disturb every single person on campus tonight. I rarely side with the establishment, but seriously, come on. If you wanted to have a stake in your tuition, it make sense to go to a public university.
• The Marxists need to go away. Go debate about the merits of the 4th Internationale vis-a-vis the Comintern away from my Rants.
• finally an election not won by the rural white people 
#obama2012 #coalition of young ,women , latino and black voters

• “I feel you, closure is just what I need. It would be great to just stop all those feelings, you know?"" - Yes. I really miss talking to her, that's all! She was just a huge part of my life, there's still a void I've been trying to fill. I think maybe talking to your ex would help you find that closure. I hope to find that for myself.
• ""I totally support the single’s get together or speed dating idea!  Hall councils, student government? Get to it. *clap clap*"": No, let's make this single's dating service something we students set up organically! *Spontaneous order*! But seriously. . . let's get on this, okay?
• @""Can someone at the Eagle explain why AU students going to an Obama rally get coverage, while Republican students have been doing the same stuff and get no coverage"": AMEN! Thank you for noticing this!!!!
• @""And more often than not, they have quite a sexual drive under that nice religious guy exterior. Anyway, good luck!"" - Speaking as one of the ""nice religious guys"", I can tell you that whoever made this observation is 100% correct. We're looking for love, for the woman who will draw us closer to God. . . and not all of us believe in pre-marital chastity :)
• Dear ""<3 hot single girl"": If we flirt with you, ask you for coffee, etc, we're NOT gay. Short of initiating sex with every girl he meets, what does a straight guy at AU have to do to convince you ladies that we're not all gay?! Seriously! - Exasperated Straight Male
• @""whatever floor"" girl in McDowell: I can't wait to meet you :)
• ""How do you get your friends to stop coming and staying in your room every single evening/night without being rude? It's becoming and a habit and it's starting to get annoying…"" - I think I know who you are. Just ask them to stop, explain you have work sometimes or are really tired. Offer to grab lunch or coffee with them during the day. They should understand.
• ""If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal."" - Yup. @RulingPoliticalClass
• Seriously AU: SPEED DATING let's make this happen okay?
• ""I am so sick to my stomach for what tomorrow will be like at AU. I'm devastated for the country but everyone else will be celebrating."" Agreed. Can we set up a conservatives' support group? I feel like AUCRs is already becoming that :/

How can you so enthusiastically celebrate this man's reelection? According to multiple reports you can find from The New York Times, Washington Post, etc, he personally signs off on every drone strike. This is horrific and a clear abuse of human rights on par with the Bush years. Where is the outrage?
• ""Sometimes I just want a friend. I'm lonely. But then I remember that I don't like anyone (including myself)."" I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'd definitely recommend joining a student club or group of interest to you. If you're religious, look into joining a church, temple, synagogue, etc (or if atheist/agnostic/humanist there are many secular groups). Hang in there ;)
• @""SO many people read eagle rants everyday."" True. I have no idea if you meant to be writing to me hahaha, but I hope you're doing okay. If you are who I think you are: I miss you so much come back into my life!
• @""i just wish you’d talk to me again"": I feel the same way :)
• @""Im too sexually frustated ... this sucks its like drinking is the only way to hook up with girls :("" - I'm sorry you're frustrated with that. I'm in the same boat as you are, man. Trust me, from my experience, hooking up while drunk is a BAD idea. If you want to meet a girl who you'll really like, who will be great for you, the time is not when you're both drinking and dealing with baggage and sadness from the past.
• @""My heart hurts."": I'm sorry for your pain. Mine does too :( Why does yours hurt? Hope you're doing okay!
• @""I'm sorry. So sorry."": Why are you sorry?
• @"" I'm scared I'm going crazy."" Why???
• @"" I'm sure that guy I saw wearing a t-shirt with ""vagitarian"" written on it gets laid like JFK."" I sure hope not. If he does, women at AU need to raise their standards. . . .

IT DOES! mmmmmm equality yumyumyum.
• CAUS is destorying the opportunity to reason with the administration of American University. What are you willing to give up for a tuition freeze, CAUS? That isn't free. This is a tuition based institution. How did you go from 5% tuition increases to a tuition freeze? What happened to the 5% we can compromise on? Your extremism does not display your dedication to the cause; it displays your dedication to the CAUS. There is an important difference between the two.
• @ Family values: bet that's what people said 50 years ago when we elected presidents who would fight for desegregation. There is only one ""family value,"" and that's love. 
• @bipartisan relationship: Why are you dating a man who doesn't know when election day is in the first place?
• seriously, CAUS? what the hell is wrong with you? banging pots and pans outside of someone's door at 11:30 pm is OBVIOUSLY  a really smart way to get a serious quote and a really thoughtful discussion on tuition freeze...

• girl desperate for a proposal here. So my bf of 4 years said he would propose and we can get married if I agree to a sexually open marriage. He said all guys eventually cheat and at least this way he is honest with me from the start and never hides things. I know from my evolutionary psychology class that men are not programmed to be monogamous creatures. Cognitively I understand. But it still hurts. Although I think it will hurt less than not having him in my life. Am I wrong to agree to the open marriage?
• I'm sorry, but CAUS rioting outside of Kerwin's home is stupid. Just stupid. I don't want tuition hikes either, but going to his home? Claps for you guys for giving AU students a bad name.
• A guy in the dav currently has whiskers painted on his face and is wearing cat ears. I just want to know why.
• The eagle just isn't interesting anymore. The articles used to be so much more politically aligned and controversial. Now its just boring news that we for the most part already know. This editor is the worst I've seen in my 4 years here.

• Someone in my 200 level political theory class didn't know who Nietzsche was. She then proceeded to make a considerable fool of herself.

• My roommate is the one who ranted a couple days ago about how she didn't remember if she ranted the ""I think I'm going crazy"" rant. She just said ""You're going to die"" completely seriously and out of the blue. Then she said she had no idea why she said it. She IS going crazy.
• Geez you annoy me, why do I have to live with you.
• Don't know why some of my friends are complaining about the CAUS march last night. I'm already in debt and will be way more so if these tuition hikes happen so it's good to see people really getting on Kerwin's case about this. Wake the guy up every night if it'll encourage him to back off the hikes in order to make it stop! Hope there's more stuff like this.

• I'm aware that you're an attention whore and that you need everyone to know you're here all the time, but I am literally the only other person in this stairwell, which I purposely entered because it's quiet and I wanted to study.

• Hey you. I know you rant almost day so I know you will read this. I don't know what more I have to do to say I'm sorry. I was an idiot when I ended our friendship and you won't respond to my texts now. I miss being friends with you and spending late nights at the library with you. I won't take you for granted and I was a huge idiot. Please forgive me because I miss hanging out with you.
• @Hughes4th - the woozles will cool down eventually. Sooner or later they'll all get in one mass hookup and realize they hate each other. Then: Peace.
• No matter what you think about Neil Kerwin as a professional, he's entitled to the human courtesy of having privacy at his personal home. Let's go to all the CAUS members' doors in the middle of the night and yell and scream at that. See how that feels. It's just rude and disrespectful to him and his family. 
• Hate CAUS. They don't represent the larger student body, they represent the 20 of them who like to whine about EVERYTHING. To them, no one has rights except for them. Do other students have the right to quiet in the middle of the night? Nope. Do businesses like Bon Appetit have the right to fire employees who break their established rules? Nope. Does Kerwin have the right to a private life? Nope. I literally hate them and their entitled attitudes. Please leave AU. We all hate you.

• @Can someone explain why someone yelled “sell your house” at Neil Kerwin in that Caus video?: So I've stayed out of responding to the CAUS rants, because most of them would just lead to giant and pointless fights. That said, for factual clarification I'll jump in. People were screaming ""sell your house"" because AU pays for his house. Our tuition dollars go towards his personal residence. By selling his house, AU would be saving millions of dollars that could go to other, more important services.
• My hope has always only ever been to do hard work in service to my country, instead of staying comfortably at home only serving myself.

If you want the experience at AU to keep improving, tuition has to get raised. Stop being selfish and only thinking about yourselves- think about the rest of the community and the students to come.

It was *I* who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

2012-12-09,AU,liberal,"• Tonight at the graduate reception in mgc, there was a beautiful, sexy man in a blue suit with a light blue shirt underneath his dark blue blazer. Dark hair, dark eyes, Latino. HE WAS THE SEXIEST MAN I HAVE EVER SEEN AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. Why has it taken this long? I stalked him the whole night. He was beautiful. QUIERES CASARTE CONMIGO!?!? por favor.

Yes, I too, masturbate in public. Would you like to join me for some public masturbation? I will be in the Dav at 1:00 masturbating to crappy prog-punk rock and Christmas songs. And if any of the Dav staff are reading this, I publicly masturbate best to Hall and Oates.

• @""SOC is House Greyjoy.""  Ha.  Implying SOC kids actually have a backbone.  No way they're the badass vikings from A Feast for Crows.  
• The CAUS is either House Arryn (led by a whining, epileptic child) or House Stark (overly idealistic and self-defeating).  
Kogod is House Lannister.  They're calculating and they seem like they'll get ahead, but things have changed in the global order and they might not be as well off as they think.
CSA is House Martell.  You forget they exist, but they'll be the truly successful ones.
Eagle ranters are all Ser Jorah.  Pining, sad, and alone.

2013-01-01,AU,liberal,"• I loved being home until tonight, Christmas Eve. I fought with my mom over the stupidest thing and now she barely wants anything to do with me. I had a moment of weakness and cut myself for the first time in months. Happy holidays to me.
• Doctor Who is ruining my life. I can't stop watching it because it's brilliant, but I'm in the post-season two depression stage.
• @""WHY IS EVERY HARDCORE LIBERTARIAN I MEET SO PERSONALLY IMMORAL?"" - That's interesting, the few I've met here are to me more likeable than many of my fellow liberals. (Shoutout to the libertarians from Letts 3N last year)
• @A woman on Reddit 
I'm a gay lady on reddit too! I'm sensing a trend...
• i love you, dont kill yourself please 
• Speaking as a guy, I would never be unfaithful to a girl and I would never willingly help a girl cheat on her boyfriend either. If I found out that crap was going on, I'd lose all interest in you immediately. You can dump your boyfriend if you want to (sounds like he deserves it), but you should be honest with people about your relationship status.
• Person with the brother, you sound like a good person. Hope everything gets better for you two. :/ 
• Pot smoking hedonists? This makes me want to be a libertarian even more!
• Yeah... my brother relapsed a day later.  Sucks.  I had hope after the emergency room since he seemed so much happier, but I guess he just doesn't want to be sober right now.  The hardest thing about it is that I know he's suffering and every instinct I has says that I need to help him, but there's literally nothing I can do if he doesn't want to be sober.
• What does everyone think about putting a Cosi where the McDonalds used to be?
• Dear fellow ranters: I would like to just say that I love AU and am really glad that I have the opportunity to go here! To all those who are having a tough time this holiday: please hang in there! The season is tough but the pain you're going through now will make spring so much sweeter. PLEASE do not hurt yourselves–even if you think you're alone, you're not (you have your fellow ranters, at least)! Things will get better <3
• Thanks, Editor, for still putting rants up during the holidays. Props! 
• The only person to wish me Merry Christmas was the automatic text from Words With Friends.
• TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KILL THEMSELVES/OD: DON'T. Someone out there cares. I care. Please, please. Talk to someone you trust. It will get better, I swear to you, I've been in a similar place, you just need to know that it will get better, and take active steps to help yourself. Go to the counseling centre. Please. 
• I have so much anxiety that I can't get through more than a few pages of the new book I just got on conquering anxiety. Oh irony..
• I flew home for Christmas even though I didn't want to and I could have stayed with my bf instead. But I went home because my dad wanted me to. I get home for Christmas and none of my siblings even came over to see me. FML
• Reddit is a magical land of internet awesomeness, full of hilarious, witty people (and yes-just like everything in life-occasional downers and trolls). It's got a ""front page"" where the most popular stuff culminates, and then a ton of ""subreddits"" to fit what you enjoy, ex) ""Awww"" for cute things, or ""WTF"" for crazy weird stuff, news, pics, videos, politics, etc..go check it out.
• whoever responded with the ""come"" pun in response to the film porn club....seeing as I was going to use that same response, I tip my hat to you good sir, you clever bastard.
• @”Home for the holidays (in the boondocks) and the nearest guy on grindr is 56 years old and 7 miles away…”  Although I’m not in the boonies, I’m back home to a grindr of mostly uneducated, poser @$$hole guidos, so there’s that. I feel your pain.
• I want to feel your heart beat inside of me
• “I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break. Trying to hold on but the gnawing pain in my heart won’t go away. Help?”  No one should ever feel scared in his or her own body.  You control so much of your life, you really do have the power to change things.  Please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if it gets really serious.  Or, talk to anyone-a parent, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker…it’ll surprise you how many people really truly care for you.
• Whoever you are with the detoxing brother-you're an awesome person and an even better brother.  Friends come and go--sure you could have been partying somewhere like those kids across the street--but family lasts forever.  Props to you for helping your brother through a difficult time. 
• I totally fell in love with the girl who cut my hair today.  And then I forgot to tip her.
• I think I'll start talking to girls.  What is the point of being completely awesome and hilarious and really really really ridiculously good looking if I don't talk to anyone?
• I feel bad for the basketball players...they only got four days off from this whole  entire break. I plan on going to the first home game when we come back from break. who's with me? :) 
• @I really want to ask the cute dance team girl from across the hall out to coffee on Nov. 5 you probably should ;) hahaha yes, I am that bored that I went  all the way back to November rants...
• What does it mean if i enjoyed high school way more than I enjoy college right now?
• Drunk snapchat is the best snapchat. 
• When did you become such a shallow, self-centered, groupie? It's like I don't even know you anymore. When we met I admired how you didn't care what people thought of you. Now all you seem to care about is feeling popular and ""in"" with your friend group, since you never had that in high school. Why don't you think about the choices you're making before you keep going down this road. You can stop anytime, you just have to want to live a moral life. You used to think that personal integrity and values matter. What happened to you?
• Russian women are finnneee!
• Surgeries suck :'(
• If you are suicidal, seek help from a therapist. Preferably one that does Cognitive Behavioral therapy (because that's the best kind of therapy), but any therapist will do. Whatever problems you have are fixable, you just need some support. When you're back at AU, visit the counciling center.
• Whoever posted ""And by “sex” I mean me putting my arm around you and you squirming away because you just wanna stay friends"" Dude I legitimately lol'd. 
I've come to realize that although it's not always obvious, but there are some pretty f'ing funny people at this school. Wit. I like it.  Can the funny people be more outgoing? We'd all benefit.
• Unfortunately, short guys finish last.
• that awkward moment when you realize that everyone in your new town knows what you have been doing at college and not one of them is your friend on FB...
• I'm scared to come back to AU after abroad. It just seems so terrible now.
• I don't even want to go back to school because I have to spend hours in a room with my whole sorority and some of them are awful people.
• @""I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break."" Please, please, PLEASE don't do it. Find professional help and figure out why you're feeling like this (or if you know why, figure out why it's driven you to this point).
• And this Monday/Tuesday will mark the 22nd year I haven't had a New Years Kiss. Or a kiss at all.
• Last night I had a dream that someone raped one of my friends and stalked her afterwards.  The legal system couldn't stop him, so I killed him to give her peace.  I was sentenced to prison, and inside I killed another inmate because he was plotting to harm a guard.  Once I was released I felt like there was evil in the world that I had a duty to stop, but I came to the conclusion that I was really just a serial killer justifying my murderous needs with that mentality.  So I killed myself.  How f***ed is that?
• So on Christmas Eve, I was mugged. Well, mugged might be kind of inaccurate. It wasn't violent, but a person ran up to me and grabbed my bag and ran away. My phone, camera, money and key were in there. There's nothing to be done but I can't stop dwelling on it. It's not my fault but, I can't help blaming myself. Like, I could have been more careful or something. I've never felt so powerless. It's sh*tty.

• I HATE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS! 
• It doesn't make for a good night when an unknown number starts texting you every half hour to say that your brother's hallucinating, crying, talking to people who aren't there, and lighting french fries like cigarettes.  Whoever it is wants to know what to do.  Luckily, I've had a crash course in that the past few weeks.
• Ughhh Fraternity rush is approaching!! I just want to go PIKE but I don't think they like me. Maybe I flirt with them to much?
• Why can't I just tell this kid that I'm not interested?! He's been in the friend zone for like 5 years now, but I don't think he knows and that makes me feel bad. But I don't know how to let him down easily, other than talking about my boyfriend to him. Which isn't even working. UGH!
• @• My peanus has never been kissed. Do you vvant to kiss my peanus with your mouth?-- You are a moron.
• @• My brother just came upstairs and asked if anyone was taking parts of the wall away, and whether any of my sisters friends have been doing work on the house. I said no to both, obviously, and then he went back to the basement again. I literally feel sick to my stomach."" Context?
• @How terrible is it for me to just pretend I’m single on okcupid?-- Your boyfriend is an ass and clearly doesn't care about you enough or he wouldn't want it to be open. It's not fair for him to be able to have other partners but he expects you not to- that's a classic double standard. You can find a much better guy, trust me. I know of some people who prefer open relationships, but they (in my opinion) tend to be selfish and really just self-interested people primarily concerned with their own gratification. 
• @• I’m feeling sick, so now I’m going to go the line for Santa Clause at the mall and spread as many germs as possible.  &@&# everyone up real bad before Christmas.-- At first I found myself thinking 'wow you're a terrible person', and then I realized I was laughing hysterically at the hilarity of it. Am I a sadist now?
• @Why can I only talk to people when I’m drunk?:
1) something happened to you which makes it hard for you to let loose around people without alcohol in you?
2) low confidence from any number of sources, including possible emotional or psychological trauma?
3) guilt over something unresolved on your end?
(most likely) you just might be a bit shy. Surround yourself with people who love you and who inspire you to be a better person.

• Taylor Zimmermann, two for you. Glenn Coco? FOUR for you, Glenn Coco! You go, Glenn Coco!
• I have this theory, that if you cut off all her hair she'd look like a British man. 
• It's not that I don't want to talk to you anymore. Don't hate me. You just aren't moral enough for me, sorry. You've taken your values and turned them upside down just to fit in and feel like you belong. You were a better person when we first met. Look at your life choices.
• I like this guy but I think he still likes his ex a lot. She treated him terribly in the end, and I'd never treat him like that. How can I show him that I'll love him for who he is and never hurt him? He says he's afraid of trusting again.
• @single on okcupid: Um.. better make that single thing permanent. If this guy doesn't respect you enough to make it a mutual open relationship, or listen to what you want, then you should get out of it. You're worth more than that. 
• lol, all you angry white folks start a damn ""caucasian club"" already. what would your activities be? playing croquet and eating egg salad sandwiches with the young republicans? or is that...RACIST!?!111

Jason Aldean is rapping on my television right now, but I wrote that and many other classic rants which I'm compiling into a book called ""Don't Put That Thing Where I Think You're Planning on Putting It."" Ryan Seacrest looks despondent not having frosted tips anymore. Wait, what? Anyway, nice to know my bits of humor are appreciated. Happy New Year!
• I got my first kiss on the first day of 2013. Happy New Year's indeed!

• I've only been abroad 1 day and I hate it here already.
• My brother is making a way stronger push to get sober after Sunday's episode, but withdrawal has been brutal. Every single minute he needs help not to use. I am 100% happy to be able to be here and help, but being on duty 24/7 has just been draining. Couldn't do this without the people who have helped hold me up from afar.
• Reddit is filled with racists and pedophiles. Read /r/circlebroke or SRS.

I'm awesome and cooler than I think i am and I've got to stop focusing on the negative and think good thoughts about myself, right? Gotta stop giving a crap about what society and people and all that think about me 'cause I'm already 20 and I don't think I've actually started living for myself yet. I can do this.

The alumnus/alumna you mentioned probably attended AU many years.  AU has been going experiences rapid changes lately.  I bet the alum you mentioned would be shocked that current AU students can't properly differentiate between alumnus/na and alumni.

• Despite staying sober, my brother has sharply spiraled downwards in terms of mental health over the past few days.  He's having severe anxiety and hallucinations, thinking he has a time machine and being afraid that the nurses are corpses.  Addiction used to be his only problem, but that's small time in comparison.  I used to think he was the strongest man in the world, and it’s terrible to see him reduced to this.  Those of you who fought with your family over vacation, please don’t waste your time with them while you still have it.  Love you bro.

2013-02-11,AU,liberal,"• The only places I know of that support women's only gym hours are in countries where women are expected to cover their hair and bodies to prevent men from taking advantage of them. I am a woman who used to be incredibly insecure, but I freaking grew some ovaries and got strong as sh!t. Now *I* intimidate *men* at the gym. Grow up or get out. 
• People please, get over yourselves. Someone asking you to think about how what you wear can affect other people is not an attack on your free speech. No one is forcing you to change your clothing. However, if you use your free speech to wear something that is mysoginistic, I (as well is the rest of the community we live in) will exercise our right to call you mysoginistic douchebags. Can't we just go back to ranting about whoever died in Downton or whatever the hell kids are watching these days?
• why did everyone only take away ""omg women's only gym hours"" from that op-ed? you're ignoring the important parts of the piece. p.s. sexism against men doesn't exist plz cry more

• Being white and being mostly attracted to white people doesn't make someone racist.. people are attracted to whom they're attracted, and can't really help it (at all). Personally, I'm a white girl and I don't tend to be attracted to people of other races. It's not because I'm racist, because obviously I've seen attractive people of every race, it's just that I tend to find white guys more attractive. I can't help it, that's just how I am. Maybe that'll change one day, but not yet.
• I'm not a girl and I'll admit when it comes to feminism I only absorb what it is the professors and friends tell me about it, plus being raised by two fairly liberal hard working parents seems to make me think I'm a moderate so I'll say this having women-only hours at the gym to me seems like a step backwards for women's rights, I mean I remember about fifty years or so ago when activists wanted to ban the whites-only bathrooms and water fountains. I'm just saying equality means everyone regardless of race, color, creed, and GENDER.

• I'm pretty sure the average straight white-male has a pretty strong case of yellow fever.
• @Women only gym hours is just going too far.  Agreed.  If we are accepting of both genders, then giving preferential hours to women is discriminatory, and its completely unfair.  Let's make a Men's Initiative to balance out the Women's Initiative and keep gym hours the same- unless you make both men and women gym hours....but that wouldn't be inclusive.  Give me a break

2013-09-12,AU,liberal,"Krishna Temple in Udupi
I’m a “When in Rome” type of person, and by that I mean that I try to fit in when visiting a foreign country. 
All too aware of the stigma attached to Americans abroad, I try my best to be culturally sensitive and respect the locals. Sometimes I can tell this is appreciated. Other times it ends in hilarity.
By my pale skin alone, it’s clear that I am foreign. Still, I dress in traditional Indian clothing, stand up when professors enter the room and eat exclusively with my right hand, sitting on my left to avoid making a giant faux pas. 
But India is a place of tradition and rituals like no other, and since I came here knowing next to nothing about them, the learning curve has been steep. The smallest things bring me back to freshman year when I didn’t know how to use the laundry machines and got lost going to Tenleytown. 
Even things like crossing the road are different. Traffic not only comes from the opposite direction, but crosswalks and sidewalks are nonexistent. If they do appear they are not respected by the motorcycles, cars, auto rickshaws, bicycles, pedestrians and animals that all use the streets of Manipal. Within my first week I learned from experience that perhaps the only time a rickshaw will stop to let you cross is when you slip and fall in its path. Maybe I was just lucky.
A pinnacle of this learning process came during a Krishna Janmashtami celebration a couple weeks ago. Krishna Janmashtami is the birth of the Hindu deity Krishna. A few of us decided to go to the service at the local temple, wanting to experience the holiday. The service was completely in Sanskrit, but we sat cross-legged in the crowd, attempting to follow along. When people stood, I stood. When gongs and bells sounded, I tried not to jump. When people lined up to receive a blessing, I followed, not knowing what the blessing was, but dutifully taking the holy water and thanking Krishna as I put it on my head.
Finally, the ceremony ended, and it was time for the free food promised to us from the beginning. Like most college students, free food is one thing that I know. I am good at receiving free food. But instead of Georgetown cupcakes, these baked goods were easily 95 percent sugar, had a texture resembling chalk and were liberally piled on my plate. The main dish was not pizza, but a heavy rice dish with coconut. I soon realized that there was no way I could finish this small mountain of food. 
And this was a problem. As part of the ceremony, you have to finish since the food was blessed by Krishna. The temple was soon empty with only our group of Americans and half-full plates remaining. As the priests started cleaning up, our desperation grew. Looking around for a trashcan or stray dog, I slipped a few of the baked goods into my bag to make my plate look emptier and motioned for others to do the same. We discreetly stacked our plates with the empty ones on top, concealing the mounds of leftover curry. With my bag full of baked goods, I guiltily left the temple, feeling more American than usual. 
Forgive me, Krishna, I thought. I’m but a mere foreigner.

2015-09-10,AU,liberal,"Stephen Colbert. Photo by kpop im, Flickr.
My grandparents were big fans of Jay Leno. They liked his traditional monologue, his tried-and-true street bits. They think Jimmy Fallon is for “the youth.” Going by those standards, Conan O’Brien is for “the strange.” Jon Stewart was for “the liberal.” David Letterman was for ""the cynical."" But who is Stephen Colbert for? 
This is the question Colbert strove to answer in the premiere episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which premiered Sept. 8. Much has been made of Colbert leaving his crazed conservative pundit character behind in favor of a more authentic persona. In his first episode on network television, Colbert pushed the envelope just enough to show viewers that he hasn’t lost his satirical bite along the way. 
Some parts of the episode were unabashedly a part of the talk-show trope, especially during Colbert’s interview with George Clooney. There were attempts at deeper conversation, with questions surrounding Clooney’s humanitarian work in Darfur and his much-publicized marriage to lawyer Amal Clooney, as well as a short sequence of videos playing on a fake action film starring Clooney, hilariously named “Decision Strike.” But the segment was mostly fluff, interrupted at one point by the audience’s chants of “Stephen!” I could feel the pure excitement through the screen, threatening to take over the proceedings at any given moment. 
Other segments were more successful because they alluded to Colbert’s previous brand of political satire. An early bit comparing the media’s obsession with Donald Trump to an addiction to Oreos played well with the crowd, who, like myself, had been thirsting to see Colbert’s response to the bombastic Trump. In his interview with Jeb Bush, Colbert was unwilling to let the presidential candidate get away with typical political answers. Colbert threw him some softballs to start, but then compared the Bush brothers’ relationship to the dynamic between himself and his brother Jay, who sat solemnly in the audience. 
“I love my brother, even though we politically differ,” Colbert said during the show. 
Why couldn’t Jeb do the same with George? Jeb tried to slink out of the question, but Colbert waited for a substantive response, unafraid of scaring off other presidential candidates from appearing on the show. I was immediately drawn to Colbert’s commitment to getting something new from his guests, especially when that guest could become America’s next president. 
It was equally as fascinating to witness the moments when the political caricature bled into the host’s real personality, and his willingness to play off of the public’s knowledge of that character. When Jeb commented on the amount of portraits of the host in the newly renovated Ed Sullivan Theater, Colbert aptly responded, “I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit, now I’m just a narcissist.”
I could see the disappointment in the premiere on social media, mostly from dedicated fans who were struggling with the loss of a persona they looked to for the news every weeknight. Sure, this show doesn’t have the same mission that “Colbert Report” fans know and love. It won’t feel as righteous, nor will it claim to be. But it will be authentic Colbert: absurd, conscientious and sincere. The most beautiful and successful parts of the premiere--the introductory “Star-Spangled Banner” number, the startlingly fresh interview with Bush, the flurry of musical joy in Jon Batiste and Stay Human’s rendition of Sly and the Family Stone’s “Everyday People""-- were the most earnest, a quality that late-night television is desperately lacking. Perhaps that’s who Colbert’s newest endeavor is targeted at--not “the youth” or “the liberal,” but rather, “the earnest.”

2016-01-12,AU,liberal,"Caylee Watson prepares for a loosen-up swim after competing at the Patriot Invitational in November 2015. Watson is one of seven AU swimmers who have competed in the Olympics.
Twenty-three flags line the walls of Frailey Pool, each one symbolizing a country that has been represented by a student-athlete on the AU swim team. When Caylee Watson joined the team two years ago, swimming head coach Mark Davin added a new flag to represent her home -- the U.S. Virgin Islands. Just last month, Watson, now a junior in the School of Public Affairs, earned an honor much bigger than a flag: a spot on the U.S. Virgin Islands Olympic team.
Competing for AU in early December, Watson touched the wall after her 100-meter backstroke race in 1:05.21 at the Navy Long Course Invitational, hitting a season best time and topping a 17-year-old school record in the process. Her time and previous performances at World Championship events, such as the 2015 Summer World Championships in Russia, earned Watson enough FINA points to receive a call from the president of the Swimming Federation in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Watson said she texted the president of the federation after finishing her 100 backstroke swim, and he responded that the committee would meet to discuss the Olympic team the following day. That night, Dec. 12, Watson’s phone rang with the good news. She had made the Olympic roster. 
The opportunity to compete at the Olympics represents the culmination of a journey Watson began as a 12-year-old swimmer in the Virgin Islands with a 100-yard freestyle race and ultimately brought her to American University six years later. 
Life as an Eagle
Headlights cut through the dark sky as Watson and her roommates drove to practice for another 6:15 a.m. workout. Top 40 pop music filled the car while suspense and anticipation hung in the air in between the swimmers; all three athletes quietly prepared themselves for the grueling three-hour session ahead of them. Seven days had passed since the start of the January winter training, and Watson's arms ached with soreness as she departed the vehicle and readied her body for the cold pool. The collegiate swim season at AU lasts six months with a focus on the conference championships in February, but Watson keeps her mind focused on Rio. 
Pushing through the exquisite pain of a lactate threshold set, Watson took another stroke. Seven thousand yards later, she popped out of the pool, threw on shorts and a T-shirt and headed to the gym to lift. Twenty hours a week during the school year, the ‘eat, sleep, swim, class’ schedule fills Watson’s days, and she’s found success balancing her swimming commitments in the pool with her academic and extracurricular responsibilities. 
In her previous two Patriot League Championship appearances, Watson earned Top-10 finishes in multiple events, and last season broke a school record in the women’s 400-yard freestyle relay with teammates senior Paris Wood, junior Julianna Cavano and sophomore Shannon Exley. Named the team’s MVP in 2014 and 2015, Watson scored 13 points at her most recent  Patriot League Championship meet in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. and finished her fall semester with a 4.00 GPA. Her performance in and out of the pool helped her earn distinction on the Academic All-Patriot League Team, and she credits her accomplishments at AU and her Olympic qualification to Davin. 
“Mark Davin has been my best coach, and he’s got lots of wisdom and experience, and he pushes me which is good,” Watson said. “Coming to American has made all the difference. I remember freshman year, I was very nervous about coming in here and swimming in general. I was just like, ‘just hold out one year, that’s all you need, just give it a try,’ and it turned out well.” 
Davin, who coached 1996 Olympian Casey Leger for the Atlanta summer games, said the credit belongs to his athlete. 
“I do think that it’s less me, truthfully, and more her,” Davin said. “Whatever we do, she embraces all of it. She’s kind of like a sponge that’s soaking up everything. I think if you just tell Caylee, ‘this is going to help you,’ she’s all about it, always. And it’s fun to be part of it. I think she likes to be with people that are having a lot of fun and working really hard and racing really well and being good teammates and doing well academically and having a full happy life.” 
“I wanted to go to Wesleyan” 
When Davin first received an email from Watson about training at AU, he almost denied her a roster spot. One year later, the head coach changed his mind. 
“I sent him an email, and he was like ‘no, you’re too slow,’ Watson said. “And then I sent him another email another year that I was coming, and he was like, ‘welcome to the team.’”
Even before Davin’s initial hesitation, however, Watson admitted AU was not her top choice. She said she never visited the school or toured the campus prior to her enrollment but remained interested solely because of the swim team and the opportunity to study political science in the District. 
“I didn’t even want to come here, honestly,” she said. “I wanted to go to Wesleyan.”
Watson said that Wesleyan, a small school in Connecticut, appealed to her because of its size and liberal arts curriculum. After conversations with her family, however, Watson ultimately packed her bags for D.C., but not before competing on the world stage yet again. Just weeks before moving into Letts Hall to start her freshman year at AU, Watson represented the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 2013 FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. She returned to Spain last winter to compete in the Ciudad de San Sebastian meet with former teammate and 2015 School of Communication alumnus Charlie Taffet. According to Davin, Watson’s international experience helps her approach races with a different mindset than other athletes. 
“She had some world-class experience before she came here. She’d gone to some international meets and that kind of thing, and I think that as an athlete, I do believe it gives you a different outlook on what you’re doing, having had those experiences,” Davin said. “One of the reasons I set up the meet in Spain is I think the people that have made that trip, it’s changed them. Sometimes they go, and it’s just so overwhelming and so new. The second time they go, they really get it. They really start thinking about the Olympians that are there, how they’re racing, and they’re looking for more than, ‘how do I function?” 
Watson said the thought of competing in arguably the most prestigious swimming event in the world keeps her motivated through long practices, and her hard work continues to pay off. 
“I’ve definitely been more on the backstroke side this year, and I’ve been focusing a lot on rotation and making sure I’m connected even on harder sets,” Watson said. “I know I’ve been a lot more confident going into sets this year...so that’s gone well. I’ve definitely been able to do sets that I was not able to even think about doing in the past.” 
Every day at Frailey Pool, the U.S. Virgin Islands flag waves in the wind, reminding Watson where she comes from. Imagining herself competing at the Olympics in the uniform of her home country gives her added motivation at every practice. But for the next two years, Watson will also sport the red, white and blue of AU as she continues to represent the school that helped her to earn a trip to Rio.

2016-02-12,AU,liberal,"Ward 5 D.C. Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (center) has proposed a bill addressing the city's special police officers (Cuneyt Dil/The Eagle).

	Neighborhood leaders are blasting a D.C. Council bill that would give college police departments in the District the authority to patrol outside campus bounds.

	Last Wednesday, the Spring Valley/Palisades Advisory Neighborhood Commission passed a resolution 6-1 opposing the bill.

	Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie introduced the Special Police Officer Enhanced Security Amendment Act of 2015 back in December 2015. Among other provisions, the bill mandates special police officers in the city undergo additional mental health and behavioral training.

	More controversially, however, a section attached at the end of the legislation allows college police departments to submit a “public safety plan” for approval. Under such a plan, which would need approval from the D.C. police chief, campus police could exercise their authority to enforce a college code of conduct in specifically defined off-campus areas.

	The bill was co-introduced by seven councilmembers, including Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh, giving it enough theoretical support to pass the full 13-member council if it comes before a vote. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) has said that he will hold a hearing on the bill, which is assigned to his Judiciary Committee.

	“We think there’s a number of areas that are overly broad, that are ambiguous, that give us cause for concern with how those provisions are going to be applied,” Commissioner Stephen Gardner said at the ANC meeting. “Students who live off-campus are concerned that having campus police in their neighborhoods will lead to inherent conflicts between student disciplinary rules and D.C. laws”

	D.C.’s liberal marijuana laws could create that kind of conflict. In the District it is legal for a person over 21 to use marijuana on private property. But possession and use of pot violates American University policy, and the bill would extend the ability of campus police to enforce University rules off-campus.

	AU’s external community relations director, Andrew Huff, was present at Wednesday’s neighborhood commission meeting andsaid that the bill is far from what the University wanted.

	“The legislation in its current form is not the intent [of American University],” Huff said at the meeting. “American University and the presidents of other universities have no interest in expanded police power or jurisdiction.”

	If the bill became law, Gardner said he is worried about a possible increase in armed campus police.

	“We think this legislation provides an impetus for campus police officers who do not carry firearms to start carrying firearms,” Gardner said. The prospect of armed campus police officers alarmed Gardner because college police officers do not have to undergo the same kind of training as Metropolitan Police Department officers.

	“There’s a huge discrepancy between the required training of an MPD officer and a campus police officer,"" Gardner said.

	Conrad DeWitte was the sole commissioner who opposed the ANC’s resolution against the bill.

	“I understand where the universities are coming from in terms of trying to put together as best they can whatever tools they can to help combat noise in the neighborhood,” DeWitte said.

	Other neighboring ANCs that are located near universities in the city have been concerned as well. The Foggy Bottom/West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which represents George Washington University, held a special meeting last Wednesday.

	“This legislation is atrocious. It defies any kind of functional government,” Palisades/Spring Valley ANC Chair Thomas Smith said, adding the D.C. Council failed to consult with the ANCs before introducing the legislation.

	“Just for the record, we invited Councilman McDuffie or his staff person to come to our ANC meeting last month to talk about this legislation, and we never heard back,” Smith said.

2016-03-12,AU,liberal,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a crowd of AU students, staff and international media in the School of International Service Atrium on Friday morning that young people need to challenge the status quo if they hope to see change in the world.
“[Current leaders] need you to be thinking and challenging us about why we’re doing this, why we’re doing that, why we’re not doing this, how we’re doing this differently, and that doesn’t just mean speaking up,” Trudeau said. “It also means getting involved. It also means understanding that your voices are an essential part of the mix to challenge us to think about your future.”
Trudeau’s stop at AU came as part of a larger trip to Washington D.C., the first by a Canadian Prime Minister in 19 years. Earlier during his visit, Trudeau spent time with President Barack Obama at the White House, attended a State Dinner studded with appearances by politicians, celebrities and entrepreneurs and paid respects at Arlington National Cemetery.
Since his election in October 2015, Trudeau has committed his time in office to implementing his liberal ideals in Canadian policy. Trudeau became the first Prime Minister to have gender parity in his Cabinet when he chose 13 men and 13 women to fill the roles. He is also well-known for labeling himself as a feminist and supporting his stance on the issue by saying, “Because it’s 2015,” last year.
“There are lots of extraordinary women standing up for women’s rights, but I need more men to do that. It’s fighting for rights, it’s fighting for equality, it’s fighting for basic respect, and I keep having to update this, but it’s 2016 guys,” Trudeau said at today’s event.
Additionally, Trudeau discussed his commitment to take action against climate change which he also shared with Obama during their meeting yesterday.
“That idea of giving up on economic progress to protect the environment no longer makes sense because the only way we’re going to build a strong, sustainable economy is by cherishing ecosystem services and natural resources that underpin everything else,” Trudeau said.
In light of the current election cycle occurring in the United States, Trudeau said he was not concerned about an influx of Americans immigrating to Canada should people disagree with the United States’s next president and said that he would be willing to work with the person ultimately elected. He also commented on Canada’s recent decision to end its role in bombing ISIS, choosing instead to send in ground troops to help civilians build the ability to support themselves. Trudeau said that this type of diplomacy work is essential to creating long-term security and is something Canada can offer.
During his speech, Trudeau also called for a greater appreciation for diversity and creating opportunities for all kinds of people to succeed as important to developing the economy. He said that in the past, many people’s careers had a linear trajectory, but that isn’t the case today.
“Right now the career paths that we’re going to have will jump around everywhere. I mean, it’s preposterous to think that a former snowboard instructor and nightclub bouncer could end up the Prime Minister of Canada,” Trudeau said, poking fun at his own path to becoming the Prime Minister. “But the experiences we accumulate along the way of multiple career paths and multiple engagements that define us and shape us as individuals and leaders are extremely important and extremely varied and that’s one of the really exciting things for me about this generation.”
Trudeau said that he built his campaign to office based on a pure idealization of what Canadian citizens hoped their government to be, including openness and cooperation, and he plans to keep his promises and maintain Canada’s relationship with the United States.
“People need to understand that the rights and freedoms that keep us free and democratic societies aren’t always easy, aren’t always sort of knee-jerk, adapted to how we’d like the world to be, but they are essential in terms of being the countries we are,” Trudeau said.

2016-04-11,AU,liberal,"More often than not, self-sufficiency is the type of independence to be admired. When it comes to helping other countries gain this same type of independence, the U.S. plays the role of the suffocating parent—and the same goes for aid in Afghanistan. 
For example, a 2012 survey of women across Afghanistan by the charity ActionAid discovered that nine out of ten feared the departure of the international community because they felt their lives would significantly deteriorate. Since departure, violence against women has never been higher, with  87 percent of women reporting domestic abuse. And of the 5.8 million people without access to healthcare in Afghanistan, 4.4 million are women. Although international aid has helped shift the public eye to supporting these Afghani women in their communities, an emerging pattern says Afghan women need international aid in order to gain rights in their own country. 
The revolution of women in Afghanistan is a fight for their own rights, something a foreign man in a soldier’s uniform can’t manufacture. Women like Zainab, the first woman to ever run a marathon in her country at only 25-years-old, are inspiring women and children all over Afghanistan to be brave in what they love. When training, Zainab spoke about her experiences running outdoors where children would throw stones.
“Prostitutes, why don’t you stay at home? You are destroying Islam,” people would shout at her and her friend.
Most of the time, Zainab had to practice her 26-mile trek running circles around her own backyard. Attempts to play sports for women in Afghanistan, especially those in public, is hard. In the past, Zainab enrolled in a girls' taekwondo club, but shortly after police shut it down. When Zainab ran the marathon in Bamiyan, a more liberal and safer area of Afghanistan.  
“Bamiyan is a good place for this. In other places, they would be killed,” the region's governor, Zahir Tahir, said.
Recently, a mob beat a 27-year-old woman to death after arguing with a mullah, a man trained in religious law. Following this woman’s murder, for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, raising the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves; openly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets.
Through it all, women in Afghanistan are people seeking their right to run outdoors, have opinions and wear what they want. The only difference is they live in a country that a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll ranked in 2011 as one of the most dangerous places for women to live. But these women, through their own efforts and bravery, are seeking ways to have a voice. 
The Afghan Rug Project, an organization founded by James Opie in 2008, is a social enterprise that sells rugs weaved by women in Afghanistan in America or Europe. Its mission is to use rug weaving as an avenue to foster independence for Afghan women. The organization is built on the concept of exchange, expanding the business reach for these women without forcing them to rely on handouts from the Taliban, hard labor in the fields, or charity. 
With around 300 women already weaving, the Afghan Rug Project began not to solve complex political or military problems, but to address important needs of village-dwelling families harassed by members of the Taliban who roam the countryside. With organizations like this, women in Afghanistan can support themselves and their families self-sufficiently—a stepping stone for future independence.

2016-04-13,AU,liberal,"Syrian dissident and activist Ahed Al Hendi spoke to AU students about raising awareness for the Syrian refugee crisis and his work to help refugees during an event hosted by the Kennedy Political Union on April 11. 
In his opening remarks, Al Hendi, who founded the pro-democracy organization Syrian Youth for Justice and spoke on behalf of the Help Syria Now group, made clear the difference in the freedom of speech between Syria and the United States.  
“If we were in Syria, we would all be arrested,” Al Hendi said. “Because over there, it is illegal to listen to different ideas.”
Al Hendi was a student activist in Syria living under President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and participated in a series of protests for greater freedom of expression. He said that many liberal students were arrested and banned from the country for speaking out and that many of the protests were violently squashed. 
Al Hendi said he was arrested in 2007 for allegedly logging into certain websites that were forbidden by the Syrian state. He was held for 40 days as a political prisoner and escaped to the U.S. after he was released. Since then, Al Hendi has worked to connect with both Syrian refugees and civilians still living under the Assad regime. Some of this work involved sending cameras and providing internet access to Syrians in order to record the government crimes against civilians, according to Al Hendi. 
The Syrian Civil War that arose after the Arab Spring in 2011 has resulted in the arrest and killing of  thousands of students in colleges and universities across Syria for chanting for freedom, according to Al Hendi.
“Atrocities in Syria are the most heinous crimes of the century,” Al Hendi said. 
Al Hendi also said that the recent attacks on cities around the world by ISIS and other extremist groups have given rise to extremist right-wing groups in both Europe and the U.S., with both kinds of terrorist groups presenting dangers to Syrian refugees seeking safety. Negative portrayals of Syrians are also amplified by social media, and have resulted in a greater need to empower moderate voices in Syria to speak out, Al Hendi said.
In an interview with the Eagle, Al Hendi also spoke about the U.S. presidential race and comments made by Republican candidates on immigration and the treatment of Muslims. Al Hendi said that he remains optimistic about the policies that will result from the election.
“I think that the majority of Americans are welcoming [towards refugees],” Al Hendi said. “And I don’t think the Constitution will allow [the president to ban Muslims from entering the country or refuse to accept refugees].”
Al Hendi urged students who are interested in the Syrian crisis to go to syriastory.org to sign a petition and learn more about the issue.
“As a student, I believe in the power of students,” Al Hendi said. “I believe we can bring a lot of change.”

2016-08-10,AU,liberal,"Krista Chavez (pictured left). 
In 2016, voters are using their relationships to swing the vote toward their own party. 
According to a new study by the Pew Research Center, few Clinton or Trump supporters look for friendships in the opposite party. Among registered-to-vote Trump supporters, only 4% have “a lot” of close friends supporting Clinton. This number is more dramatic in relation to registered-to-vote Clinton supporters, with only 2% saying they have “a lot” of close friends supporting Trump. Further, Trump supporters have a lot (44%) of friends supporting Trump, and some friends (38%) supporting him. 16% of Trump voters have “just a few” or “none” of their friends swinging for Clinton. The same goes for Clinton’s voters, with 31% saying they have no close friends who support the opposition.
The data tells us that people are less willing to build friendships with those who support different viewpoints. This explains the widespread polarization in media, pop culture, communities, and the United States as a whole. The age bracket of 18-29 -- Millennials, including college students -- reflects this isolated trend. With 58% of Clinton supporters saying none of their close friends support the other candidate, only 34% of Trump supporters say the same.
As I have different viewpoints than the majority of my peers on AU’s campus, these figures do not surprise me. Another study by Pew supports my feelings by reporting that 40% of Millennials ages 18-34 support the government censoring “offensive” speech. The data highlights the decline in acceptance of other views in America, and how alternative opinions are viewed on modern college campuses.
Examining this idea more in depth, OKCupid released a new study detailing how partisanship actually influences a person’s dating profile. Their research concluded that “the amount of OkCupid users who couldn’t date someone with opposing political views is at 50% — a number that’s been rising since 2008.” 
Apparently, voting even counts when seeking a proper life partner. Personally, this is not surprising. Most people seek a partner who holds their same values that can grow and thrive in a family. Therefore it is only logical that one chooses another to spread these values within the home.
The OKCupid study found that in dating profiles, liberals are likely to feature interests like “The Daily Show, Broad City, NPR, podcasts, and weed,” and conservatives are likely to use words like “Jesus, Faith, Country, and Guns.” Bipartisan overlaps for words include “INTP (a Meyers-Briggs personality type), Outlander, Indiana, iPhone, Adventure, Honesty, and Considerate.”
Examining these polls, both parties express different values that are not only attractive when voting, but also when choosing friends and partners. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is upsetting when a large portion of the U.S. youth population is wary to hear different viewpoints, unregulated speech, and expression. 
As a founding principle of the United States, free speech was intended to support minorities from the dictatorship of the majority. It appears that many millennials do not feel that way, especially when choosing friends and spouses.
At the end of the day, it is a good thing we can all agree: honesty and consideration are good characteristics for partners. But maybe appreciating our partners and friend groups’ differences can be just as valuable.

2016-10-13,AU,liberal,"This November, across all 50 states, Americans will vote for a candidate for president. These people have traveled all around America, spending money, time and effort to win your vote. Although they disagree on many issues, each organized candidates have kept their arguing to a respectful minimum, in an effort to focus on themselves and the issues. That’s right, this election year Americans will vote for Green Party presidential candidate, activist and Doctor Jill Stein and Libertarian Party presidential candidate and past New Mexico Governor, Gary Johnson!
  If you're like most Americans and don’t know who Johnson or Stein are, that’s perfectly okay. It's not your fault there has been a distinct lack of media coverage for these candidates. However, if you’re a political WONK or a third party supporter, then chances are you know exactly who they are.
  Throughout this election, I have been shamed for sharing which third party candidate I will be voting for. The problem is that most of the shaming does not have to do with my candidate’s ideals or policies, but rather it is due to the fact that they are running for office to begin with. Although it may be evident on my online social media, offline and in person I have tried to keep my opinions to myself. 
However, friends, family and some professors have personally called me out and told me that my vote is either wasted, or indirectly supporting the candidate they dislike. Both Trump and Clinton supporters have used the same argument, saying that by not supporting their candidate that third party voters are supporting the candidate they specifically hate. While hate is a strong word, it seems appropriate to describe this election cycle.
  It’s understandable for voters to vote for a candidate they believe to be the lesser of two evils, however, that said, voting for a candidate that someone believes in is definitely something that should be pondered first. For me, along with many other Americans, voting third party is an investment in the future. Although the odds are heavily stacked against us, voting was never supposed to be about supporting a winner, but about actively organizing and supporting our ideals.
  The argument has been made that voting third party is a privilege. So far voting Democrat on American University’s campus seems like a privilege, with a heavily liberal leaning voice. Although third party voters would like to be accepted, many are instead shamed online and on campus. The same shaming can probably be seen at the many heavily conservative colleges in America. The fact that voting itself is looked at as a privilege is undemocratic. Many who perpetuate the argument usually cite race or economic inequality as a reason to vote for their candidate, saying that their nominee is the only chance in saving people of color or those from poor backgrounds. 
However, when looking at Clinton and Trump’s records and policies, both seem to care very little about both people of color and those from a low economic status. Both have supported the war in Iraq and increasing military intervention across the Middle East. Trump advocates for waterboarding, deporting and a downpour of bombing across the Middle East. 
Clinton hasn’t really touched upon her plans for the Middle East during the campaign, however, she has shown them extensively during her time as Secretary of State through helping to tear apart the Middle East and causing destabilization in countries such as Libya and Syria, thus giving rise to ISIS and fueling the refugee crisis. Clinton even approved drone strikes, which continue to kill many innocent bystanders, via her smartphone. 
Another country affected close to home is Honduras. Taking into account both Trump and Clinton’s records and views, it seems that privilege would be voting for either two party candidates, and turning a blind eye to the awful and violent policies they have and will continue to support. Although both Johnson and Stein have struggled extensively sharing their knowledge of foreign policy, both have actively supported anti military intervention.
  According to Real Clear Politics, evaluating the polls of Fox New, NBC, Bloomberg and 10 other well-known news sources, around 10 percent of Americans will be voting for either Stein or Johnson this election year. Last week both candidates were left out of the debate, due to a lack for either being able to achieve a 15 percent polling average from three major news organizations, something that even Clinton supporter Sen. Bernie Sanders said was too high. In effect, 10 percent of the nation was silenced during both presidential debates, which is run by both Republicans and Democrats.
  This election I have made my choice for which candidate I will be voting for. It’s perfectly fine to vote for Trump or Clinton this election if you want. However voting for either Jill Stein or Garry Johnson is not a wasted vote, protest or a privileged vote. This election does not just regard the presidency, but includes many local public offices. Voting on a local level for third party candidates or independents should not be discouraged as well. Picking on third party candidates is a petty and last minute act of desperation that both parties are trying force on the American public, and needs to stop. 
Purely pressuring people into voting for your candidate only annoys them, and doesn't change anybody's mind. If you want to convince someone to vote for your candidate then do it with respect. Find a common ground and refrain from name calling. That being said, here are links attached to both Dr. Jill Stein and Gov. Gary Johnson’s campaign sites, if you would like to learn more.

2017-10-12,AU,liberal,"“Fine messes”, “just wars”, “reliable rumors,” and American political “science.” I get a kick out of fun oxymorons. Okay, that last one isn’t so fun. It’s just painfully true. Let me explain.
Last week I stumbled upon a Ted Talk from a psychologist named Jonathan Haidt. Haidt is a New York native, a professor at NYU, and self-proclaimed liberal. He has a son and a wife, both of whom share his progressive world view. He is not a bipartisan man. Yet, in his talk, “The moral roots of liberals and conservatives,” Haidt says this: “...If we are going to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our lack of moral diversity is going to make it harder.” 
Haidt may be a Liberal, but he’s also a psychologist. He understands what it means to live in an echo chamber, and how dangerous it is to do so. Haidt’s point ends up being this: Liberals’ roles are to tear down faulty institutions and conservatives’ roles are to keep the ones that work. It’s an intricate balancing act -- Haidt even compares it to the yin and yang of Daoist mythology. 
American politics is in such a rut because too many liberals and conservatives hate each other’s guts. Now more than ever, our country is divided. Donald Trump’s election has resulted in not just a proposal for a border wall, but a real wall -- a partition between helpful conservative beliefs and helpful liberal beliefs. It’s so bad that in some parts of the country, “liberal” or “conservative” have become dirty words. They shouldn’t be. We need both. 
Just like Haidt, I’m firmly in the liberal camp. Both my parents are liberal, my father even radically so. But that doesn’t mean I should hate the other side. If the liberal’s role is to tear down the faulty institutions, then I should reserve my hate for the parts of “the other side” that need a wrecking ball and maybe even some dynamite for good measure. Apply the change not liberally (pun intended), but discriminately so.  
For example, the free market is an institution worth keeping.  Even Bernie Sanders, the patron saint of college socialists, would never propose something as radical as completely dismantling the free market. Despite its flaws, while plenty, there’s no denying the sheer efficiency of mostly unrestricted trade. The free market is the one of the most criticized aspects of America mainly because it is most successful. 
What are the institutions worth dismantling? In my opinion, there are many. The idea of traditional marriage is a good example. In 2015, the voice of the left, and even much of the right, agreed that to keep gay marriage illegal was to stay on the wrong side of history. So, it was changed. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the idea of gun control has once again sprung to the forefront of conversation. If it is popular enough, then it too shall change -- a triumph for liberalism. 
It may seem like there are exponentially more ideas worth changing than keeping. Indeed, it’s true. But this shouldn’t be misconstrued as a failure on conservatism’s part. Ideas become outdated or stop working. In the case of gay marriage, the idea was always wrong. Consequently, it’s easy to blame conservatism for everything wrong with America. After all, aren’t conservatives the ones supporting these archaic ideas? True, but they are not unique in doing so. Every established idea has had at some point popular support. Conservatives supported it, and liberals too.  
Yes, the ratio is skewed. And yes, the bad ideas often outnumber the good. But that’s not a terrible thing. That’s progress.

2018-08-10,AU,liberal,"Maria Butina, a recent master’s degree recipient from American University’s School of International Service, was arrested by the FBI on July 15. She was charged with conspiracy and acting as an unauthorized Russian agent. While she undoubtedly tried to boost her stature among her fellow students in the “my internship is cooler than yours” banter, she was still an AU wonk through and through, right? Not exactly. 
Court documents state that “although she attended classes and completed coursework with outside help, attending American University was Butina’s cover while she continued to work on behalf of the Russian Official.” The documents later affirm that, “the FBI believes that (Butina) was likely in contact with the FSB throughout her stay in the United States.” Not only did Butina use our own School of International Service as a cover for her real position as a Russian operative collaborating with their Federal Security Service, but she used one of the top international relations schools in the world to obtain her visa in August 2016. 
American University students reacted in many ways. Most students found humor in the arrest, shown in the increasingly popular “#FreeMariaButina” movement, based on the all too familiar phrase, “Wonks Support Wonks” or cultural comparisons, such as to Jennifer Lawrence in the 2018 spy thriller, Red Sparrow. 
However, for as enjoyable as the parodies have been, other students, including myself, realized that there is more to the mysterious case of Maria Butina. The news about Russia was brought, through Butina, to where we live, work and study. International news became local news. It may have even startled some to realize that they likely crossed paths with an active Russian agent. But, the unfortunate reality remains: she was sent by a government that has little regard for human rights, democracy or stability. If nothing else, Maria Butina conjured up a conversation about just that.
I am pleased to say that a few other students and I are restarting an organization on campus this fall to have these exact conversations. The Alexander Hamilton Society is a non-partisan, not-for-profit national organization with over 60 chapters focused on foreign policy and national security issues. At AU, the Alexander Hamilton Society will bring some of the leading national security professionals to debate a few of our own professors, discuss national security issues with the AU community and develop the chapter’s members into future leaders. 
But for Hamiltonians, the name given to members, not much is surprising about Maria Butina’s political influence and intelligence activities; here’s why: she is an agent of a hostile foreign power that has defied some of the most basic international norms. Russia, within the last decade, has invaded a neighboring country, shot down a commercial airliner with a surface-to-air missile,  is responsible for chemical attacks in Syria, and more recently, sent agents to execute poison attacks in the United Kingdom. Regrettably, however, many more nations and non-state actors are cut from the same cloth. The barbarity of these nations and organizations is indisputable and widespread, but the real difficulty is in calculating a response. These are the conversations that the Alexander Hamilton Society will have.
In these conversations, Hamiltonians hold a few strong beliefs, such as the notion that the United States should be a global leader that provides an example of a representative government that protects its citizens’ liberties. Hamiltonians also believe that the United States should deter the malign intentions of illiberal foreign actors, not only for our immediate national interests, but also for the benefit of humankind. 
But should the United States lead in this way? I think we should, but whatever you believe is worth a thoughtful discussion.

2021-01-02,AU,liberal,"In honor of “No Nuance November,” I posed a question on my Instagram story to my followers, asking them about their unpopular opinions. The answers I received were interesting, to say the least, and different from what’s “socially acceptable.” They ranged from believing that working class Donald Trump voters are going to be an important part of the progressive movement, to thinking that golfing should be banned. 
A person would usually respond to these ideas with, “Wow! I never saw this issue from that perspective,” which for most of us translates to, “Wow! The media usually shows a one-sided point of view that makes people share a single idea and you’ve challenged the status quo.” This is called the false consensus effect, which is the idea where we think that our own opinions, attitudes and beliefs are common, so we believe that others may feel the exact same way. When we hold a certain belief, we tend to estimate that belief to be more ubiquitous than it actually is.
With the frequent sharing of opinions and information on social media, one can be easily blindsided by the thoughts of other users or even their own friends. Limiting our sources of knowledge to those with similar views makes us subconsciously believe that we hold the “model belief” and that the opposing side is completely undesirable because they don’t “get it” and aren’t as morally superior and intelligent as we are. Subconscious actions like these prevent us from having productive, nuanced conversations and are overall counterproductive if we strive to be understood ourselves. How can we attain collective liberation if we aren’t able to converse within the communities that we reside in?
This shouldn’t be interpreted as going out to meet with a full-blown racist and discuss politics over coffee. Rather, we must prepare ourselves to enter into every issue with a possibility that we might be incorrect and that our ego bubbles should be popped. Self-aggrandizing behaviors were most apparent during the presidential election, where many white liberals coerced members of the Black community to vote for a specific candidate that made them comfortable in their own racism. It’s impossible to consider yourself an “ally” for BIPOC communities only to turn around and belittle those who don’t agree with your performative activism. 
On the other hand, the act of trying to engage in discourse with an individual that ends up making no progress is unproductive. With this uprising of online activism, white people are still asking Black people to teach them how to understand white privilege and racism. The problem with this? The information, statistics, documentaries and numerous studies had already exposed these issues in its raw form. Black individuals having to operate under this repressive system for centuries makes the act of white people asking how they can care now borderline offensive.
After reading the book, “Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race” by Reni Eddo-Lodge, I wholeheartedly agree with the opinions presented. This doesn’t apply to all white individuals, but to the number of them who refuse to accept the existence of structural racism and how they’re actively upholding it. I see an emotional disconnect that a white person displays when I explain my experiences as a Black woman. This stems from being oblivious to the fact that their skin color is the default and anything darker is “other.” 
Many Black individuals tread carefully when sharing their experiences, because once we show any signs of frustration or exasperation, people will tap into their preconceived racist notions about “aggressive” Black people who are supposedly a threat to them. Even if they claim to “hear us,” they’re not really listening. 
Nonconformists, during this social media age of “hot takes,” often have to undergo self-censorship to avoid the reprisals of challenging the beliefs of others. It isn’t fair to live with a never-questioned entitlement and to expand your superiority complex - it perpetuates a cycle of intellectual stagnancy. 
The next time that you repost information on your social media concerning current events, I challenge you to ask yourself why you’re doing so. Does it provide information of a perspective that you haven’t previously shared? Or does it conform to your preconceived ideas that you share within your circle of friends?

2021-06-10,AU,liberal,"This article is an opinion piece and does not necessarily reflect those of The Eagle and its staff.
While education is inherently necessary for its practical utility, what is the true impact of higher education? Should American University and other higher-educational institutions relegate the exploration of knowledge simply to career development, or is there a deeper and necessary aspect to education that seeks to cultivate curiosity, creativity, skepticism and, above all, critical thinking in the individual? 
These values make up the foundation upon which many medieval European universities were first established, influenced by economic circumstances, as well as the schools of classical antiquity in Athens and Rome from which the term ‘classical studies’ originates. These institutions sought to discover truth for the sake of truth and pursue knowledge because of the value of knowing. In Plato’s Apology, Socrates states that “the life which is unexamined is not worth living,” indicating that the pursuit of knowledge in its own right is invariably interlinked with the pursuit of humanity. This legacy of humanistic inquiry through art, literature, language, history and philosophy constitutes the essence of modern classical studies, which seeks to cultivate critical thinking and dialogue as a form of educational empowerment.
However, in contemporary times, many American universities have decided to stray from the humanistic roots of education. As of this year, Howard University, the only historically Black college or university (HBCU) in America with a department in classical studies, decided to end its program, despite its existence since the school’s inception. Citing educational prioritization and university resources, Howard University joins the fray of countless other American colleges and universities who have divested liberal arts and humanities programs over the course of the last several decades. Institutions such as the University of Vermont, University of Kansas, Elmira College, Guilford College and many others have systematically gutted programs in liberal arts and classics education with the veneer of “prioritization,” stifling formerly successful and worthwhile academic programs. The introduction of Howard University to the list of schools disinterested in cultivating humanistic inquiry creates a disturbing image for the future of higher education in America. 
So why are the classics worth saving? Are we not simply expelling dispensary knowledge from the university system in order to pursue an education that will be practical for young people in the workforce? Furthermore, aren’t programs such as the ‘classics’ fundamentally alienating for non-Western students and considered too esoteric to be egalitarian? 
To claim that the classics are not worth saving is to deny that learning is valuable in and of itself. Certainly knowledge is needed to produce money, to create entertainment, to erect roads and bridges, to govern,and to continue the basic functions of modern society. But what is the purpose of learning how to live if we do not also explore how we ought to live? Practical knowledge and humanistic knowledge are key components of one another if we are to create a generation of truly well rounded people. The conquest of the entire enterprise of higher education into practical application can only have detrimental effects on the future development of society. 
Beyond the fact that education in the humanities is key to understanding individual human purpose, the criticisms of classical learning as a perpetuation of the Western crimes of racialization and elitism are entirely unfounded. In fact, the opposite has consistently occurred historically — countless movements and leaders of social justice were inspired by the classical literary canon. Particularly for African American freedom movements in the United States, classical thought inspired leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Huey Newton and W.E.B. Du Bois. This is because the Western canon, more than anything, is a cultural and historical conversation about humanity- one that becomes enriched with the contributions of each new generation, culture,and civilization that interacts with it. 
The modern humanities combine the stories of Homer and the knowledge of Plato with the literature of Mary Shelly and the soaring revelations of Martin Luther King Jr. The study of modern humanities is therefore inclusive, rather than exclusive, expansive rather than narrow, and a fertile field for tolerance and social change. Remember that our founding fathers themselves were steeped in the classical tradition, reaching back to ancient Rome and Greece, as they led the American colonies to shake off the shackles of monarchical tyranny. 
The classics are an inherent and foundational component in the study of the humanities. And the intercultural dialogue that this study creates fosters in us an individual responsibility toward one another and a desire to learn for learning’s sake. I can think of nothing more liberating or egalitarian than the pursuit of knowledge for the purpose of human development. Classics studies as well as great books programs, such as the Lincoln Scholars program at American University, allow the individual to learn for the sake of learning in addition to gaining the practical education one needs in order to succeed in later careers. Moral and intellectual development, furthermore, are crucial components of education that bring the individual closer to the answer of what it means to be human, lifting them above what W.E.B. Du Bois described as the “veil” of oppression and out of what Socrates characterized as the “cave” of ignorance. And so, in the pursuit of true learning, I ask AU and all other institutions of higher education throughout the country to preserve this human community influenced by the classics.

2021-10-12,AU,liberal,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
This year’s display of sticky note messages on the inside of residence hall windows lacked the pizazz students had come to expect from their peers.
The messages, made out of hundreds of individual sticky notes, reflected a steep decline from previous years in terms of quantity, variety, and creativity, according to students familiar with the situation.
“During the Democratic primaries in 2020, everyone would spell out which candidate they were supporting,” junior Linda Estrada said. “Now it’s like a heart here, a smiley face there. How are we supposed to keep up our reputation as one of the most liberal colleges in the country with those sort of amateur tactics?”
Only 30 percent of this year’s sticky note designs have anything to do with electoral politics, according to an Eagle tally — an all-time low for the University. 
Another point of contention among students concerned is the perception that fewer students care about decorating their windows this year. 
“I remember in my freshman year someone organized the whole fifth floor of Letts to spell out a sentence going down the line of windows,” senior Delia Mathis said. “Now the freshmen claim they have more important things to do like studying for class. Give me a break!”
Students are not the only ones impacted by this trend.
“I’m really miffed that students aren’t taking their window decorations seriously,” said Celia Bennett, director of undergraduate admissions. “A robust sticky note display on the residence hall windows can help us entice prospective parents. It shows them that AU kids don’t have enough time to drink and carouse if they’re designing, planning and arranging intricate sticky note designs on their windows.” 
Students reported a conspiracy theory circulating, which implicates disgruntled George Washington University students in the demise of AU’s creative sticky note messages on windows. The connection between GWU students and the lack of creativity of AU students remains to be seen.

2022-01-06,AU,liberal,"About Sex Work AU is a new campus organization bringing awareness to students about the sex worker community in the D.C. area. 
The organization began as a group project in Adjunct Instructor Aimee Richardson’s HLTH-323 Issues in Women’s Health class. 
“We look at health and we take health for granted,” Richardson said. “Being in the AU community, we live in this bubble. Our expectation is that health is eating right and exercising and for some people, it's really just getting general care.”
In the class, students create community-based learning projects centered around women’s health. Students indicate their topic of interest, and Richardson assigned them groups from there. 
“It’s not just about learning, it’s about giving back and working with communities that need assistance,” Richadson said. 
These projects, which have been a part of the class for several years, are more than just learning about women’s health, they’re about reaching into the community, Richardson said.
“I think it’s something that's really important and something that the AU community should be interested in,” Richardson said. “Especially living in the District of Columbia where sex work is a big part of the city.”
Matilde Eckford, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences, was interested in studying the health of sex workers. But soon, the class project turned into a club. 
The About Sex Work AU club is active on its Instagram page, where they post educational infographics, including the history of the sex work industry. Additionally, the club has been tabling inside the Mary Graydon Center to reach students. 
“It’s really just showing people that [sex work] is very normal. This is a real profession,” Eckford said. 
The main goal of the organization is to destigmatize sex work through education. On their Instagram, they’ve done this by posting information on where they post educational infographics, including the history of the sex work industry.
The organization used Instagram to properly define terms within the sex work industry. For example, the club defines sex workers as individuals who accept payment in return for sexual services as well as other commonly used terms like commercial sex, clients and third parties. 
“When you learn about specific terminology, and the ways in which those terms impact sex workers, and what terms are preferred, it helps break down stigmas,” Eckford said. “Then also you can use language that is not nearly as offensive and is better for education.”
According to About Sex Work AU, stigmas are the biggest barriers to the decriminalization of sex work. For example, sex workers living with HIV are faced with negative stereotypes. On its Instagram, the club also shares statistics about sexual violence and sex workers — sex workers have an increased chance of experiencing sexual violence while working and sex workers of color, migrant sex workers and transgender sex workers are at an even higher risk. Looking into the future, the group plans to break down these stigmas with students on campus. 
“It’s one of those things where I know a lot of people have a relatively liberal attitude towards sex work, but I think not too many people know more than OnlyFans or the real issues that a lot of sex workers face,” Eckford said. 
The group plans to become an official club this semester, with hopes to reach into the D.C. community by partnering with other organizations.

2022-09-07,AU,liberal,"THE EAGLE
Last Monday, a recent Eagle article reported that after 486 days at the bargaining table followed by a week-long strike organized by the American University Staff Union, an agreement between the union and the University. 
An email sent by Provost Peter Starr set the tone for the events that unraveled during the strike, emphasizing that the University negotiated in “good faith” and expressed several times in the email their disappointment in the union’s choice to strike. With the University having an email platform that’s able to reach thousands of families, it has an unfair advantage over the union, misconstruing their message into making the AU community think the strike is reactionary and unproductive. 
What started as a smooth sailing strike soon turned into an overwhelming situation for all parties involved, including student workers such as orientation leaders and RAs. Due to the amount of staff protesting, the University had placed responsibility on student workers to conduct crowd control of the strike and help move families into the dorms in the hot weather. Many joining in on the strike may have been unaware that part-time student workers are unable to unionize, leaving student workers vulnerable to harassment and calling these workers “scabs.” The University placing workers in difficult situations like these portrays them as if they’re against the goals of the union and as union-busters. 
For many families, seeing AU staff members stand outside the freshmen dorms, demanding that their employer pay them a wage that can fund their next meal, is their first impression of the University. Unaware of the entire situation between the union and the University and being kept up-to-date mainly through President Sylvia Burwell’s emails, parents directed their anger toward the union for “ruining” their child’s first-year experience. Many staff members who were part of the strike had mentioned that they didn’t wish to be on strike and did so as a last resort. Striking within a private sector has consequences for both the employer and the employee — the employer will economically suffer and the employee stops receiving paychecks, making striking less common among unions. 
In response, the AU Staff Union had addressed during the strike and on social media that they always emphasize “students first” and had fellow faculty members take each other’s shift at their jobs when one was out protesting. Staff never forced students to join the strike and allowed them to make their own judgments and rather hope to educate them on the issues they’re fighting for.
AU administration leading the staff union strike directly impacts the bonds formed between students and staff. Many staff consider working at AU as a dream job and once they experience the work environment and inequitable pay, they are forced to find positions elsewhere, often in the middle of the semester. The majority of The Eagle editorial board noted that each of them had multiple first-year advisors or academic advisors during their time at AU. A number of advisors and other staff members went above and beyond what's required of their job positions to ensure student success, some working for decades and had made one of the lowest salaries expected of their position and tenure. 
For other families and students, it brings an interesting observation to see that a large portion of union members are AU alumni and leads one to wonder how AU truly values student success throughout their careers. A few first-year students noted that they chose AU over other schools thinking it was the “most liberal” but found out that it was more of a reflection of the students and staff rather than the administrators themselves. 
Though the AU community’s willingness to organize together toward a common goal is extremely admirable, the low effort it takes for others to blindly follow a movement without first taking the time to educate themselves can be concerning. The freshmen class look to the opinions of the student body and follow the common belief, which led to their walk-out of convocation when Burwell was introduced. Despite being a monumental action, a number of students may have viewed actions like these as a way to challenge authority for the fun of it and wrongly group all administrators as ones who make the executive decisions at the bargaining table. 
As much as the contract agreement was long overdue and felt purposely orchestrated to be announced after the strike, the fact that administration had agreed to the demands despite its advertisement as a business entity positively reflects upon them. Nevertheless, The Eagle is in solidarity with the AU Staff Union and hopes that all promises made by administration are executed in a timely manner.
We urge the AU community to continue to stand up for the injustice that staff members still endure, as they’re the ones who make AU, AU.

2022-11-10,AU,liberal,"As we find ourselves at the mid-semester mark, many freshmen, including myself, are moving past the “honeymoon phase” of the first weeks of college. With this comes the realization that American University, the alleged most liberal university in the U.S., is still a money-hungry, capitalist institution. 
It’s no secret that we are paying an arm and a leg in tuition and room and board, not to mention books and various other fees. Just a few weeks ago, Housing and Residence Life announced a new egregious policy, stating that “students will now be allotted two lockout requests per semester and, on the third request, will be charged an administrative fee of $25 per lockout.” This news further amplifies the commonly asked first-year question: where is our money going? 
After a five percent tuition increase this year, the thousands of dollars we already pay evidently do not guarantee freshmen a pleasant living environment. As a resident of the infamous Letts Hall, I can attest to the many things that wrongly slip through the cracks. 
In the first two months on campus, residents of Letts have experienced mold in the already empty soap dispensers;fleas in the south side of the building; faulty showers that lead to students standing in two inches of water because they don’t drain; out-of-order laundry rooms for days on end; 80 degree rooms; and stoves that only work occasionally, just to name a few. Instead of using the money that we pay to live here to fix those things, AU decided to implement yet another unnecessary cost for students who simply make a mistake and forget their One Card. 
From the get-go, the idea behind this policy is flawed. No students, especially first-years who are still getting used to carrying their ID everywhere, are intentionally getting locked out of their rooms. A potential $25 fee is not going to cross every student's mind each time they exit their room, magically deterring them from mistakenly leaving their One Card behind. Not to mention there are extenuating circumstances that may arise that require students to leave their room in a rush and possibly forget their One Card, such as the multitude of fire alarms that go off every week. 
This is not just an issue of an unjustifiably explained fee; it also does not take into account the financial implications that this may have on students. Many students who attend AU are making extreme financial sacrifices to receive their education from this school. In fact, Ohio State University’s National Student Financial Wellness study found that 70 percent of college students are financially stressed. With  An extra $25 could be the difference between making tuition payments on time or not, or a trip to the grocery store to avoid consuming rock hard mystery meat from TDR. No student should have to undergo even more financial stress than is already present when attending a school with increased tuition costs simply for slipping up three times.  
There is an extreme lack of transparency between HRL and the AU administration with the students. Where are the thousands of dollars we spend on housing going if not to ensure we have basic necessities available to us? Where would this $25 fee end up after the students pay it? This is a flagrant cash grab on behalf of AU. No student should ever be expected to pay in order to be allowed back into the room that we already pay for. Instead of creating flawed policies that have no measurable benefit, the University should focus on using the money we already pay to fix the things that actually negatively impact students.

2023-04-12,AU,liberal,"A class-action lawsuit against American University for partial spring 2020 tuition refunds will proceed after a district court judge ruled the University is not exempt from consumer protection laws. 
The plaintiffs, who originally filed the lawsuit in May 2020, say they paid thousands for in-person learning – an experience cut short in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The plaintiffs also argue that AU broke an implied contract by continuing to advertise on-campus experiences during the admissions process, while students paid the same amount for remote learning.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia gave the go-ahead to students’ claims for partial tuition refunds, following the Court of Appeals’ reinstatement of the case in March 2022. A lower court had initially dismissed the case. 
“With respect to the breach of contract claim, the court held that ‘Plaintiffs adequately allege the Universities breached an implied-in-fact contract to provide in-person education in exchange for tuition,’” Judge Christopher R. Cooper wrote in the opinion.
AU motioned to dismiss the case by arguing the University is not subject to the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act, since it is a nonprofit that provides “training or credentialing activities.” Cooper ruled AU does not qualify as a nonprofit exempt from CPPA liability, since the D.C. Council would have explicitly included educational activities in the law if the exemption was meant to cover colleges and universities. 
“As a matter of common parlance, ‘training’ and ‘credentialing’ bear a business and professional connotation distinct from ‘educating,’” Cooper wrote in the opinion.
CPPA prevents deceptive business practices, such as breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment occurs when one party confers a benefit onto another without the proper restitution required by law. 
The Court of Appeals previously upheld the plaintiffs’ claims that AU breached a contract to provide in-person education in exchange for tuition payments. Additionally, Cooper ruled that fees charged for access to on-campus facilities, like the sports center fee, do not qualify as “membership services” under the CPPA nonprofit liability exemption. 
Cooper said in the opinion that designating such fees as membership services would be a “cryptic way” for the D.C. Council to describe the facilities and extracurriculars at universities. 
Students are seen as consumers since they are purchasing a service of personal nature, according to Cooper. Since schools like AU are marketed as liberal arts to achieve well-rounded students, Cooper said undergraduate education is still a consumer service protected by CPPA.
“To the extent American suggests, as a general rule, that all college students seek out higher education only for business or professional—rather than personal—purposes,” Cooper wrote in the opinion. “That notion is contradicted by the University’s own stated mission to ‘advance knowledge, foster intellectual curiosity, build community, and empower lives of purpose, service, and leadership.’” 
After a lower court dismissed the case in June 2020, finding AU didn’t violate any contractual promises, plaintiffs urged the Court of Appeals to revive the case. The Court of Appeals revived the case in March 2022 and found that the plaintiffs had presumably alleged AU breached the implied-in-fact contracts for in-person learning. 
Roy Willey, attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on the matter at this time when contacted by The Eagle. 
Since Cooper of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled against AU’s motion to dismiss the case, students can proceed with their COVID-19 refund claims in the lawsuit. 
“This is an ongoing legal case currently in the discovery phase, so we are unable to comment beyond that,” said Jasmine Pelaez, AU’s internal communications manager.

2023-05-04,AU,liberal,"Bridget Trogden will start as the dean of undergraduate education and academic student services on July 1, Provost and Chief Academic Officer Peter Starr announced in an email to the American University community Thursday. 
Trogden, previously an associate dean and professor in the department of engineering at Clemson University, will supersede Dean Jessica Waters, who announced her departure from the position in October 2022. Waters will remain at AU as a full-time faculty member in the School of Public Affairs. 
Trogden, who holds a PhD in chemistry from the University of Illinois, will also be a tenured professor in the School of Education.
In her time at Clemson University, Trogden oversaw efforts to implement a new curriculum with interdisciplinary and engaged learning to improve general education, according to the email. 
“A strong believer in the value of a holistic undergraduate experience, Dean Trogden has played a key role in leading curricular innovations in general education at Clemson,” Starr wrote in the email.
Trogden also led STEM efforts at Clemson and is a principal investigator on multiple grant-funded initiatives in STEM education. 
Before her time at Clemson, Trogden served as the director of Research that Reaches Out in the Office of the Provost at Mercer University. In this role, she “enhanced” retention rates and education through research that focused on local, national and global issues. Trogden also taught in Mercer University’s College of Liberal Arts, specializing in chemistry and the Honors Program. 
In the email, Starr thanked Waters for her work on AU’s core curriculum, first year advising, student wellness and more. Waters began as dean of undergraduate education and vice provost for academic student services in 2016. She earned both her B.A. and J.D. from AU. 
“I am deeply grateful to Jessica Waters for her extraordinary work as dean over the past seven years,” Starr wrote. “Throughout her tenure, she has been an instrumental part of the university’s efforts to enhance the student experience.”

2010-02-11,AU,Democrat,"The Democrats officially ceded the seat of their fallen hero — a seat they had held since the late Ted Kennedy’s brother occupied the White House — when Vice President Biden administered the oath of office to Republican Scott Brown last week. Brown’s arrival in Washington sounds the death knell for the dreamlike demands of President Barack Obama’s liberal base. Gone are the days of health care optimism and cap and trade consensus. Silence reigns where there were once cries for a second stimulus and righteous calls for a New York City civilian trial for Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 
At least Obama had fair warning. Fragmentation of Democratic majorities began last November in New Jersey and Virginia. At the time, I described the gubernatorial victories of Republicans Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell as needed boosts for a desperate Republican Party, not direct repudiations of Obama’s policies. For the GOP to continue such success, it would have to court Independents and field “the right candidate … trumpeting a tailored message.” Three months later, despite doomsday predictions of the Tea Party's rise, Republicans have utilized this game plan to perfection. The American public has indeed rejected the Democratic mantra of more: more spending, more debt and more centralization of power in Washington. Judging by history, however, Obama should be quietly cheering his party’s fall from grace this coming November. Yes, you heard me correctly — root for the Republicans, Mr. President. 
As a man who grounded his 2008 campaign in centrist rhetoric, Obama has been willing to punt the liberal agenda to Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill. On top of the criticism that boxes him in from his left and right, the president has watched the center slip from his fingers. Therefore, Obama cannot tie his legacy to Democrats in Congress if he has any hope of turning his fortunes. In fact, working with a resurgent opposition party after 2010 would insulate the president from warring factions in search of his head. Then-candidate Obama enraged many Democrats when he claimed that Ronald Reagan had altered the trajectory of the political landscape in a way Bill Clinton had not. He did not mention that, as Jonathan Rauch of the National Journal reminds us, both Reagan and Clinton, the most popular and successful recent chief executives, shared power for significant portions of their terms. Detractors to the divided government theory may argue that George W. Bush benefited from Republican majorities in Congress throughout most of his presidency. How did that go for him in the end?
Data derived from the American Presidency Project demonstrates the counterintuitive notion that a Congress run by the rival party need not cripple a sitting president. The combined concurrence percentage of combined House and Senate votes to the expressed wishes of President Eisenhower (an underrated president) was roughly 70 percent. This statistic is relatively high until you consider that less successful presidents like Jimmy Carter (77 percent) and G. W. Bush (81 percent) witnessed better levels of concurrence. Reagan left office with a 62 percent concurrence mark and a 63 percent approval rating. Clinton’s Congress voted for his policy proposals only 57 percent of the time, but he exited the White House with support from two-thirds of the nation.  
Christie, McDonnell and Brown are just the first wave. Voters are frustrated with the priorities of Democrats in Washington. The economy is slowly recovering, but it will be a long march out of the woods. Republicans are priming viable, jobs-focused candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Shift to the center and Obama could enjoy a Clintonesque revival after the midterm elections. Embrace arrogance and partisanship, and Obama’s legacy will follow the path blazed by Carter and Bush.

2010-06-02,AU,Democrat,"Individual rights are too important to let partisanship cloud our judgment. Strangely, this is a hard lesson to teach on our nation’s college campuses.
While the Supreme Court considers whether belief-based student organizations deserve equal rights on campus, two more universities have been facing this very issue. Georgetown University is facing it over a pro-choice group, the University of Arizona over a pro-life group. 
At Arizona, Students for Life’s application for official recognition was initially denied because the group requires that its members share beliefs “that life is sacred and that the intentional killing of human beings through abortion, euthanasia, and murder, and that all forms of eugenics are morally reprehensible.”
Yet, a public university bound by the First Amendment may not deny the basic right to freedom of association, and the university quickly reversed its decision. Universities don’t like to be shown up as hypocritical when it comes to freedom of speech or freedom of association.
The shoe is on the other foot at Georgetown University, which has prevented a pro-choice group from receiving fair treatment on campus. Georgetown is a private university not bound by the First Amendment, but it is bound, morally and contractually, by its own promises. Georgetown entices students by telling them, “A university is many things but central to its being is discourse, discussion, debate: the untrammeled expression of ideas and information.” Georgetown adds that “Catholic and Jesuit tradition, far from limiting or compromising the ideal of free discourse, requires that we live up to that ideal.”
Georgetown is failing to do so. Just ask H*yas for Choice Vice President Erica Slates. She says that her group has about 100 active members with a mailing list of 1,000. They want to be allowed to be an official student organization and get that asterisk out of their name. Georgetown has been saying no.
According to Georgetown’s Vice President for Student Affairs Todd A. Olson, “As a Catholic and Jesuit university, our policies must reflect our identity and our values,” but H*yas for Choice promotes ideas “inconsistent with Roman Catholic moral tradition” and must remain off of the list.
At Georgetown, College Democrats is on the list. Students for Justice in Palestine is, too, and of course, so is Right to Life. Not H*yas for Choice.
What about the great Catholic and Jesuit moral tradition of permitting untrammeled expression, as Georgetown promised?
Besides, the Muslim Students Association and the Jewish Students Association are on the list. Someone should ask Olson how these groups — in both their expression and their conduct — square with the university’s Catholic and Jesuit identity.
According to Georgetown’s Director of Student Programs, Erika L. Cohen-Derr, “Our goals and yours are the same: to provide high quality programs that reflect Georgetown’s diverse community.” Nevertheless, H*yas for Choice is apparently too far beyond the pale to deserve any official university support. So much for reflecting the actual diversity of views at Georgetown.
Wouldn’t a great university want to give students even greater protection to “think the unthinkable, mention the unmentionable,” as Yale University promises, than even the First Amendment offers citizens at large? Why should a university restrict rather than expand the right to free speech?
 H*yas for Choice isn’t even asking for such a noble educational environment as that. It just wants equal treatment under Georgetown’s actual policies.
However you feel about abortion, if you think free speech principles and promises mean anything substantial, you should be protecting the equal rights of pro-life students at Arizona and pro-choice students at Georgetown. How can one group expect equal treatment if it refuses to advocate equal treatment for all, despite fundamental disagreements?
This is a good question for Georgetown and all citizens to take to heart.

2010-06-02,AU,Democrat,"Clarification and Correction Appended
Josh Levitt, a newcomer to the Student Government, was appointed director of the Kennedy Political Union in a vote of 14-5-3 during Sunday’s Senate meeting.
The process of appointing Levitt caused an extended debate in the Senate. Vice President Maia Tagami said in an interview that some controversy arose after an application from the current deputy director of KPU, Greg Martin, was turned in to Student Activities six days after the application deadline.
The applications for director of KPU were accepted until April 8 at 5 p.m. Tagami received Martin’s application at 9 p.m. on April 13 after she and her fellow executives had already conducted interviews with the two on-time applicants.
“I went to Student Activities to see the status of the application [and] if it could be accepted or not,” Tagami said. “Later that week Andrew Toczydlowski [program adviser of Student Activities] said because the applicant didn’t give any sort of indication [that] his application would be late, I was only to consider the two applicants that had turned it in on time.”
The panel of SG executives decided to recommend Levitt for appointment to the position. Levitt then went before the Committee of Rules and Privileges, where he was approved, and was then presented for consideration to the entire Senate.
Levitt was deemed qualified for the position largely due to his experience as director of speakers for the College Democrats. The club notably brought Ted Sorensen, speechwriter for John F. Kennedy, and Senator Arlen Specter, D-Pa., to campus this year.
Current KPU Director Will Hubbard expressed concern for Levitt’s lack of training and experience with KPU directly, such as volunteering for events during the year.
“Are you willing to put thousands of dollars of funds into the hands of someone who has had no training in KPU?” Hubbard asked the Senate.
However, Tagami said she thought Levitt’s past experience made him “unquestionably qualified.”
“He has a certain sense of duty that he carries for any of his responsibilities and [he has] undoubtedly showed us he was going to be dedicated to the office of KPU,” Tagami said.
Other senators vouched for Levitt’s motivation, including Class of 2012 Senator Seth Rosenstein.
“He is one of the finest gentlemen I’ve had the privilege to know,” Rosenstein said. “He’s an extremely hard worker, and when he sets his mind to something, he will get it done. While some [of the] concerns might be valid, I don’t think they are hurdles that can’t be overcome.”
Levitt plans to embrace quality over quantity in choosing speakers for next year by bringing in the people AU students want to see.
“I’d love to go big, in general,” Levitt said. “I’d like to do events that would make the campus community proud.”
Levitt also plans to reach out to the campus community to determine exactly whom students want to see on campus. 
Levitt said AU can look forward to some big KPU events next year that will be relevant and exciting.
“I offer the idea that this campus community deserves to hear the best speakers possible that will not only give them a universal perspective but bring a large amount of energy to the campus,” Levitt said.

Clarification: Student Activities supports the decision of the SG to not accept late applications, however they did not instruct the SG to deny or allow the applications. That decision was made solely by members of the SG.
Correction: Deputy Director of KPU Greg Martin turned his application into Student Activities April 13th, not April 15th as originally reported. Vice President Maia Tagami received the application the following day.

2010-07-01,AU,Democrat,"In his first visit to AU as president, Barack Obama laid out the framework for his idea of comprehensive immigration reform July 1 — including a pathway to citizenship as well as increased accountability — but did not announce any new policy initiatives. 
About 250 invited guests filled the atrium of the new School of International Service building in its inaugural event to hear Obama’s nearly 40-minute-long speech. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, the Rev. Al Sharpton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus filled the first few rows of the atrium. AU officials, professors and a small group of student leaders were also in attendance.
“In sum, the system is broken,” Obama said. “And everybody knows it. Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling — and to the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.” 
The president said he hopes Congress can pass an immigration reform package soon, but did not address whether he had the support to pass any legislation before the end of the year. The majority of Democrats and Americans want to move forward with reform, and it’s up to Republicans to make the next move and create bipartisan legislation, he said.
While he did not offer many specifics, Obama expressed support for the DREAM Act, a bill before Congress that would provide a pathway to permanent residency for illegal immigrants who graduate from a U.S. high school and show good character. 
School of Public Affairs Dean William LeoGrande was in the audience and said he thought Obama gave a successful speech. Primarily, Obama was challenging the Republican Party to step up and support immigration reform efforts, LeoGrande said.
 “I think the White House is signaling that it really wants to try and push ahead on this issue now and not wait until after the election or next year,” he said. “But he also was very clear that there has to be Republican counterparts who are willing to cooperate in this. Democrats by themselves don’t have the votes to do this.”
Nearly half of the Main Quad and portions of New Mexico and Nebraska Avenues were blocked. Since the speech was invitation-only, students filled Ward 2 to watch. 
Rebecca Paley-Williams, a junior in SPA, watched the speech from Ward. She said she and a lot of the people with her at the watch party were annoyed the event was not open to students and the public. 
“I felt like [Obama] was coming here — this is our campus,” she said. “They probably should have let us see the speech or [provide] some sort of benefit for being a student here.” 
Sara Torneden, a sophomore in SIS, said that while she is disappointed more students were not let in to the event, she understands why the White House selected a smaller venue.  
“[The building choice] is very representative of how [Obama] wanted it to come off,” Torneden said. “He didn’t want it to be in a huge arena with hundreds of thousands of people cheering and everything. He wanted people who were interested in pursuing this in higher education to hear this and take this and motivate them to learn more about it in their studies.”

2010-09-08,AU,Democrat,"Chris Matthews said the current state of bipartisan politics is driving the nation in a downward spiral in a speech Tuesday night in Bender Arena.
Matthews, the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of the year, said the Democratic and Republican parties need to put their rhetoric aside and work together.
“Excessive partisanship, excessive commitment to the notion that anything goes, that anything you can do to win is OK ... disrupts the system. It ruins it in many ways, and nothing gets done,” he said. “The pettiness between the parties [is not] even strategic — it's just crankiness.”
He went on to explain that the key to solving our problems in American politics is to elect good leaders without looking at partisan issues.
KPU Director Josh Levitt agreed with Matthews’ assertion that the two parties need to work together.
“As Obama said, we cannot expect to solve our problems if all we do is tear each other down,” Levitt said.
In an interview before his speech, Matthews said he hopes students attending his speech could come to fully understand a few key problems in the country and find ways to change them.
“I hope that people understand the question, which is 'what’s wrong with politics today?' ” he said. “Why is it so cranky and unproductive? Maybe [they can] begin to set some standards to change it.”
Matthews, who spent many years in politics and government, transitioned to print journalism working as the Washington bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner from 1987 to 2000. He is currently the host of ""Hardball,"" a daily news show on MSNBC and ""The Chris Matthews Show,"" a weekly syndicated public affairs program.
“I’ve watched politicians from the inside, and if you do that you’re able to understand what they’re doing,” he said.
Matthews said he knows how politicians speak and work because he worked as a presidential speechwriter for former President Jimmy Carter. He uses this knowledge of politicians to better understand his guests and inform his audience.
“I think I know what the politicians are up to better than a lot of other people,” he said. “I watched politics from the inside, and if you do that then you are able to understand what they are doing from the press releases, the speeches, the positioning, the dodging.”
Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the first post-apartheid presidential election in South Africa in 1994, the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 and the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.
“Those were great moments for me, and of course all of the presidential elections are fun,” Matthews said.
Matthews believes Democrats are demoralized and disappointed with their own party, but Republicans are angry and energized by the current state of politics.
“Fear makes people angry, and this election this November 2, it’s going to be an explosion of anger,” he said.
Matthews pointed to a rise of unemployment, overflow of government spending and the national debt as a few problems currently facing the nation.
Matthews said there has been speculation in the past that he may return to politics and possibly run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, but he said he does not want to give up his jobs as a news commentator and a reporter yet.
“I thought a lot about it in this [election] cycle and it would have meant giving up what I have spent years developing,” he said.

2010-09-11,AU,Democrat,"The AU College Democrats and College Republicans both have many plans for expanding their groups on campus and becoming more involved with the D.C. community, starting with the National Day of Service and Remembrance on Sept. 11.
The College Republicans participated in the Freedom Walk. This event was created in 2005 to establish a national tradition of remembrance of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, according to College Republican President Stephen Laudone.
The College Republicans will also be working on a community service initiative at Walter Reed Hospital on Nov. 11, Veterans Day.
The College Republicans and College Democrats have also doubled their outreach efforts, with revamped websites, new Facebook groups and fan pages for members to join and stay in touch.
College Democrats President Bo Hammond said the College Democrats have added an internship board to their site for the first time. He said this has been set up to help members of AUCD get jobs, and in the past has secured internships on Capitol Hill and at WeatherizeDC, a non-profit based campaign in D.C. focusing on home efficiency.
The College Republicans have arranged several outings, starting with a meet and greet session at the Tenleytown Z-Burger, followed by a weekend trip to a Nationals game. They have also booked a number of speakers for the upcoming months, such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., sometime in September or October and former United States Senator Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in November.
The College Republicans are also co-sponsoring the Kennedy Political Union's Family Weekend event on Oct. 23. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and presidential candidate, is scheduled to speak. 
Laudone said he is focused on expanding the community service wing of his organization.
“It is important for the [College Republicans] to walk the walk on this [service] issue, so you will see us engaging more than in past years in community service initiatives of our own and with the Community Service Coalition,” he said.
The College Democrats have a themed schedule entitled, “Blue Rising.” This is a six-week period during which they have scheduled many events, starting with advertising and recruitment in the first couple of weeks.
Hammond believes that this will be the best year for the College Democrats.
“We are going to have more members and more resources than we have ever had in the past,” he said.

• I am so insecure. It sucks. I've been here only a couple weeks and already I feel like I'm going out of my mind. I finally decided to go out last night and the guy I took with me turned out to be straight. Of all the gay people here, I had to pick the straight guy. Seriously? This is a joke, right?

• I want someone I can run up to and put my arms around.
• Dump your unaffectionate, inattentive boyfriends! Best decision I ever made. They aren't worth it. And you deserve better!
• 1. To affluent law student: this is to not say you are unsuccessful but someday you will thank your parents for making you appreciate paying for things on your own.  Believe in yourself and know that you paying for things on your own will be beneficial.
2. Yes AU rules.
3.  Off campus living is nice but I can assure you that you are not alone. Even living in the Berks has made me feel alone. I stare out my window and there's no life in each apartment.

• To the person complaining about getting kicked off campus: 
My roommate and I went to the room draw last semester, and even though we both had really high lottery numbers, we got a room in Centennial. Easily. It was wide open. You obviously didn't really care that much about living on campus and just like to bitch and whine.
• If I needed another Chris Matthews to express their sourpuss attitude and liberal opinions towards the upcoming election, when the Republicans WILL take the House, I would have applied to AU.
oh, wait...
• Eagle rants is not an advice column. Eagle rants is not a relationship column. EAGLE RANTS IS NOT FOR SOLACE, IT'S HERE TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
• Whatever happened with Artemas Ward Week last year? Did that ever end up happening? If not, will we have two this year to make up for it?
• Dear everyone with relationship issues: Talk to your significant other about it. Seriously. It doesn't matter what’s bothering you. It is astounding how much easier it is to work through issues together.
• What's with the bureaucracy here at American? None of the people who work at the school or in the registrar know what's going on. Last week I was trying to get an override form for a class I needed, I asked three different people and got three different answers. So much for paying almost $50,000 a year, right?
• Why are only a small minority of the AU events made into Facebook events?  Is it that hard to make a Facebook event?  Note to people creating events at AU: If you make a Facebook group for it, then more people will show up. Pretty simple.
• I'm sick of being sick!
• Bilingual guys are very hot. I love you all.
• Where is our POTUS op-ed!?!? Eagle editors, get with it!

• I miss the old days when I could get drunk any day of the week. Now I'm working two jobs and would rather go to bed by 11 p.m.
• Dear College Democrats,
Why would you close the doors to the event on Thursday night after it started?  Some people have evening classes and would have liked to have slipped in late without making a disturbance. Think about that in the future please.
• I'm a very quiet person, I've had people say that they think I'm stuck up cause I don't talk much, but in reality I just don't want to say something awkward and stupid.

2010-10-12,AU,Democrat,"AU was put on the map last week. On Oct. 7 the Tenley Campus served as the starting block for the final leg of the Sudan Freedom March, which began in New York City on Sept. 15. Thousands walked the 6.2 miles from our campus to Capitol Hill for a rally in support of “democracy and freedom from genocide and slavery?throughout Sudan.”
Last week’s rally highlighted the historic opportunity facing Sudan on Jan. 9, 2011. That day a referendum will be held on whether to split into two nations. The referendum is one of the remaining milestones of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 that ended decades of civil war in ethnically and religiously divided Sudan. Another referendum will be held the same day in Abyei state, one of the disputed areas along the north-south border, to decide whether it will join the North or South. 
The referendum was spotlighted on Sept. 24 when President Barack Obama participated in a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that focused on Sudan. The message from Obama to Vice President Osman Ali Taha, who was representing Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, was clear: The referendum must be held on schedule or there will be consequences. 
Will that alone do the trick?  Unlikely. The South (Abyei in particular) contains most of the country’s oil reserves. The Government of the North — led by Bashir, who has been indicted twice by the International Criminal Court for war crimes — is unlikely to let the South secede smoothly. Although he has pledged to honor the outcome of the referendum, the prospect of an independent South will mean revenue losses for the North. Voter manipulation — practiced with impunity during Sudan’s national elections in May — will be a real threat.
There are yet more obstacles to a timely referendum. The North’s ruling party — the National Congress Party — wants the border officially demarcated before the referendum, even though that isn’t required by the CPA. Voter registration was recently delayed until mid-November. The commission overseeing the referendum was only officially constituted on Sept. 15. The Southern government is trying to repatriate the hundreds of thousands of Southerners living in the North. Citizenship policies remain unresolved. With only three months until the referendum, the road ahead is foggy.
I have not mentioned Sudan’s main humanitarian crisis: Darfur. In September, I visited the Woodrow Wilson Center to hear Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the lead prosecutor of the ICC. In his discussion of his case against Sudanese government officials, Ocampo noted that Darfur and the referendum are not separate. In fact, a former Interior Minister charged with managing the Janjaweed and later the Humanitarian Affairs Minister is now the governor of South Kordofan, a border state next to Abyei and potential flashpoint like Darfur. One of the key actors in Darfur and closest confidants of President Bashir is positioned at what could be the eye of the storm. 
For AU students interested in conflict, political development and humanitarian affairs in Africa the Sudan referendum is significant. If it is stalled or manipulated the South will be deprived the right to self-determination. If mishandled, the chance of another civil war, and violence spread to the Democratic Republic of Congo and other neighbors, is possible. U.S. security interests are also at stake. Combating terrorism in the Horn is well-served by an empowered South. 
What can be done from our end?  U.S. pressure on the parties is imperative. Economic incentives and disincentives, along with the prospect of normalized relations, are important carrots and sticks. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have recently ramped-up this effort. This should continue. A bill introduced last week by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., — the Sudan Peace and Stability Act — shows congressional interest. Urging your elected officials to prioritize Sudan or teaming with an advocacy group is a great way to help further this objective.
There are less than 100 days until Jan. 9. Sudan should stay on the front-burner until then — and beyond.

2010-11-12,AU,Democrat,"Robert Wexler said the best solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be a two-state solution during a speech Wednesday night in the University Club.
A democratic Jewish-Israeli state and a Palestinian state should both exist with internationally recognized borders, “most likely mirroring the 1967 lines with swaps in a way that almost 80 percent of the ‘settlers,’ can be assigned within the internationally recognized borders of Jerusalem,” Wexler said in the Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event.
The former Democratic representative of the 19th District of Florida and current president of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace said one of the major obstacles in solving the conflict is overcoming bias.
“Many of us come with bias, I do, I readily admit that,” Wexler said. “From my 13 years in Congress and six years in the Florida State Senate, I have been deeply committed to the unbreakable bond between the U.S. and Israel.”
The Israeli youth that Josh Halpren, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, met on a visit to the city of Ashkelon were unwilling to change their negative perceptions of Palestinians, Halpren said during the question-and-answer portion of the event.
“There has been a demonization of the other side, in some cases a dehumanization, which is terribly unfortunate,” Wexler responded. “People have developed these ideas because of the experiences they have lived through. We can’t undo those experiences. All we can hope to do is create a political dynamic in which they can see hope.”
Now that the settlement freeze has expired, leaders have returned to discussions over settlements. However, Wexler said settlements were a distraction to the real peace talks that would solve the crisis.
“The moment we have a discussion, the issue of settlements will be cast to the side and will allow [President Barack] Obama, [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas to engage in the real end-of-conflict discussions that need to happen,” he said.
Wexler said a uniting factor between them is that both countries share a common enemy in Iran.
“The national security interests of the state of Israel and the Arab world is essentially identical,” Wexler said. “They share a common thread: extremism in Iran and a nuclear weapons program there, which threatens to ignite a nuclear arms race in the region.”
While the current economic sanctions have done significant damage to Iran, they have not proven whether they are deterring nuclear proliferation, Wexler said. Wexler said Iran felt most vulnerable after witnessing the U.S. defeat the Iraqi army after seven weeks.
“I think we have a very limited time for diplomacy.” Wexler said. “I’m not advocating military action, but you have to put every option on the table because if you don’t, the Iranians will take advantage of it. Remember, the game of chess was invented by the Persians ... they are great manipulators.”

2010-12-06,AU,Democrat,"Something wicked this way comes — it lurks in our skies, awaiting the return of innocent college students from winter break. It will drop around the beginning of February, wreaking havoc not only upon Washington, but the rest of the East Coast as well. 
People will rush to the grocery stores and Terrace Dining Room, which will run out of food within a week. The Metro system will shut down and cars will be inoperable, making the only viable mode of transportation cross-country skiing. Classes will be canceled day after day, while a civil war breaks out at Dupont Circle. 
Civilization as we know it will cease to exist and D.C. will descend into chaos, buried under a thick blanket of fluffy, white snow. 
Snowpocalypse 2011 is coming — are you prepared? Heed The Eagle’s warning and use this guide to start a survival kit before it’s too late.
Powdered milk
Since the Eagle’s Nest and local stores will face a milk shortage, be sure to pick up at least five industrial-size boxes of powdered milk. Even if the pipes freeze, use the abundance of snow outside to your advantage and mix it in for a truly ice-cold drink.
Hot Pockets
Stockpile as many frozen entrees as will fit in your freezer. Hot Pockets are the best bet because of their nutritional superiority and tendency to make you too nauseous to eat more. Not only will you have enough food to last through the crisis, but you’ll gain some extra padding against the bitterness of winter as well.
10-layer cake
Celebrate the impending end of the world by eating one layer of cake for each day of being trapped on campus. For more creative types, you can decorate each layer with the circles of Hell as you descend further into cabin fever.
Alaskan dog sled
Though snowshoes and cross-country skis will work for a while, save your legs and invest in an Alaskan dog sled with a few strong Huskies. It’s fast, fun and furry — and you’ll look that much cooler arriving at the 2,000-person Dupont Circle snowball fight on a wintry chariot.
Well-stocked entertainment system
Nothing fends off boredom like a five-day Mario Kart tournament. Pit Democrats against Republicans, East Coast natives against West Coast natives, School of International Service majors against School of Public Affairs majors — you get the idea — for the title of Snowpocalypse King. If holding such an event off campus, don’t hesitate to include alcohol to make each game truly warm, fuzzy and much more memorable.
Remember that Snowpocalypse 2011 is deadly in many ways — do not, under any circumstances, walk under campus buildings that seem to be in danger of collapsing. And please, enjoy battling the Snowpocalypse responsibly.

2011-01-11,AU,Democrat,"It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve. 
Big Brother has proven inept and can’t be trusted. It’s about time we stick up for ourselves and start advocating transparency.

2011-02-09,AU,Democrat,"Political strategist Ed Gillespie has been involved in Washington politics since his college days.
The former Republican National Committee chairman began at the bottom of the food chain. He worked as a Senate parking lot attendant while he was a student at the Catholic University of America.
Gillespie spoke at AU Feb. 7 about his own career and the future of his party in what he calls a “center-right nation.”
“The great thing about going to school in D.C. is being able to intern. The great thing about politics is that it’s a meritocracy and you can work your way up,” he said.
Gillespie, chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the state level is an important arena for politicians.
“It is a training ground for new Republicans. There are innovative ideas and policy proposals, as well as working to increase diversity.”
After winning a historic 690 new state legislative seats in 2010, Gillespie has high hopes for future Republicans.
“There are great opportunities in the Senate and whether President Obama re-elected or not, we’re likely to hold the House given the size of the margin and the nature of redistricting,” Gillespie said.
He predicted eight to 10 Republican candidates in the 2012 primaries.
“There are a lot of really good potential candidates that are going to run, bringing new faces to the party,” Gillespie said.
The most important issues in the election, he believes, will center around government spending, the economy and jobs.
“The most important factor will be what is the unemployment rate,” Gillespie said. “The real overarching dynamic is where are the jobs? Do people feel like they’re coming back?”
He said Republicans should recruit minorities and female candidates.
“It’s a long term concern, a demographic challenge. We need to do better with minority voters, most acutely with Hispanic voters,” Gillespie said.
But independent voters are important too, he said, saying the “overwhelming” support of this group was crucial to the 2010 victories.
Gillespie also said he believes the tea party movement will assimilate into the mainstream Republican Party, comparing them to Catholic Democrats joining the party in the 1980s and the Ross Perot supporters in the 1990s.
“Growing pains are better than shrinking pains,” he said.

Howard Dean confused AU with a cross-town rival during a Feb. 8 speech.
The former Democratic National Committee chairman had discussed immigration last week with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich at George Washington University.
Dean told the GWU audience Americans need to be welcoming to immigrants.
But at AU, Dean made a gaffe.
“Raise your hand if you have Native American blood in you,” Dean said at AU. “Everybody else is an immigrant, everybody else had someone in their family who scrubbed floors so you could be here at George Washington.”
Chuckles broke out and Dean joined in, realizing his mistake. But the School of Public Affairs Undergraduate Council, the sponsors of the event, had the last laugh when they presented Dean with an AU mug as a parting gift.
“And it says American University on the inside,” said one College Democrat member. “So you’ll always know what you’re drinking from.”
Besides that faux pas, Dean spoke about the current youth grassroots movement, saying change comes from the ground up — not down from the presidency.
He said while President Barack Obama should not have a problem getting out the youth vote in 2012, much of his younger base from 2008 is disenchanted with the administration’s performance thus far.
“It’s natural for you at your age to be very idealistic,” Dean said. “But it’s also natural for you to be easily disappointed.”
Dean also predicted a victory for Obama in 2012 based on this generation’s diversity and acceptance of others.
He described the audience as “the first multicultural generation.”
Dean also spoke about the war in Afghanistan, saying he supports the war but has some reservations about pulling troops out.
He said he is worried about how Afghan women will be treated if the U.S. leaves the country.
“I’m a politician because I believe deeply in social justice,” Dean said. “When we leave, women will be treated worse than slaves.”

2011-03-03,AU,Democrat,"Former D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee said the state of the U.S. public education system today “sucks.”
Rhee spoke to students March 2 in a panel event sponsored by the Roosevelt Institute at AU, after a screening of the documentary “Waiting for Superman,” a film about the nation’s public schools system. 
 “We are supposed to be living in the best country in the world,” Rhee said to a packed audience. “The land of opportunity, and whether or not kids get a good education is dependent on luck and the spinning of the wheel.”
The documentary says Rhee simultaneously drew praise and criticism during her tenure as chancellor. During that time she cut over a hundred jobs in the D.C. Central Office and closed 23 schools in D.C.
Her alliance with former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty made waves during the mayoral election earlier this fall. Rhee resigned after Vincent Gray was elected.
Rhee talked about her stance on teachers’ unions, saying she was surprised that President Barack Obama has advocated for holding accountable and even firing underperforming teachers. 
“I don’t think you can overstate the importance that he has had over the debate of teacher quality over the last two years,” Rhee said.
She said while Obama has held teachers more accountable, Republicans primarily criticize the teachers’ unions. A Democrat herself, Rhee said that stance needs to change. 
However, she said she has seen Republicans, Democrats and independents alike calling for reform, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and her fiancé, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a Democrat.
“Democrats have been resistant about saying that within the last 10 years and I think that with some of the stuff that’s going on in Wisconsin, it is actually a different dynamic that’s happening there,” she said. “I think that you can hold unions accountable and draw very strong distinctions in what they ought to be doing and fighting for.”
Zachary Kolodin, director of the Future Preparedness Initiative for Roosevelt Institute, also served on the panel and said it is not productive to vilify the unions. 
He said that while the recession and deep deficits across the country have hit budgets hard, money should still be directed towards education.
“In Wisconsin, there’s a real demonization of unions and public employees and I think that reflects something real in our economy,” Kolodin said.  It’s really not the unions’ fault that America is such a ruthless place for the middle class right now.”
But Rhee said that in New Jersey, thousands of dollars are spent per child with disappointing results. 
She said that the root of the problem doesn’t come from poor districts or lazy parents, but the poor performance of teachers and attitude in the central office. 
“Once we as a school district do everything that we’re supposed to be doing, then we have the right to go to the parents and the kids and hold them accountable too,” Rhee said.
Rhee has continued her crusade against the unions by establishing her own interest group called StudentsFirst. 
Rhee said she believes that the failure of the system now is that there are advocates for adults but none for kids.
“The education landscape over the last few decades has been driven by special interests groups: textbook manufacturers, teachers unions, testing companies, et cetera,” she said. “We don’t have a system that is set up to protect children, we have a system that is set up to protect adults and their jobs.”

2011-08-12,AU,Democrat,"Though public officials reached a deal on the debt ceiling Aug. 2, many student government presidents from across the country are unhappy with the deal.
Before the agreement was made, more than 120 student government presidents from 40 states, including AU Student Government President Tim McBride, signed a letter demanding Congress come up with a solution to raise the national debt ceiling and prevent the U.S. government from defaulting on its loans.
The letter, asking “Do We Have a Deal Yet,” says the student government presidents support the proposals of the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Gang of Six, a group of senators containing three Republicans and three Democrats. There are no particular provisions of those recommendations the group supports, but it does urge congressmen to accept a “bipartisan framework,” according to Andy MacCracken, executive director of the D.C. Student Alliance and former SG president.
Now that a default has been avoided, the group is disappointed the deal includes the founding of a commission to continue to debate debt reduction that is tasked with finding more cuts by November. 
“It’s very unfortunate that our leaders kicked the can down the road even farther,” MacCracken said. 
Though the group has no “grandiose” ideas that their opinions will suddenly cause bipartisan cooperation on the Hill, a few of the students, including MacCracken, were granted a conference call with President Obama and members of his staff on July 26 and a meeting with staff in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office on Aug. 1 regarding the letter.
“That speaks volumes to the impact we’ve already started to have,” MacCracken said.
Student leaders will continue to advocate to members of the new commission to reduce the deficit. 
They want politicians to focus “on what the ramifications are going to be for the next generation as opposed to what short-term benefits might be for the next election,” MacCracken said.
The student presidents’ main hope is to encourage students to get involved and take a stand on debt negotiations by calling their representatives or senators and getting their opinion heard, McBride said.
Some of those student government presidents held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. July 21, garnering media attention from CNN, NPR, ABC, FOX, and the Huffington Post.
“We’re not telling our leaders what to do,” MacCracken said. “We’re just telling them to lead.”
The difference between this lobbying group and others is that they are not asking for favors, according to McBride, who signed the letter July 12. Instead, these student leaders are still looking for a deal that will not bankrupt the country that some of these students will one day lead.
“We have a unique message that needed to be heard,” McBride said.
As Obama echoed in the conference call, students have the most to lose from any failed debt reduction negotiations. 
“Young people will shoulder the consequences of gridlock during a time that requires bold action,” the letter reads. “Your decisions will determine what kind of country we will inherit.”

2011-09-13,AU,Democrat,"President Barack Obama will be re-elected next year, according to AU Professor Allan Lichtman’s predictions.
The AU College of Arts and Sciences professor, who has correctly guessed the outcome of every presidential contest for the last 30 years, is beginning to get notice from various news outlets such as U.S. News and World Report and Fox News.
According to Lichtman, it’s quite simple to predict the winner.
There are 13 “keys,” or factors, that can go for or against the party controlling the White House.  If the party in power has six or more keys going against them, they lose, according to Lichtman.
 “You don’t even have to take your shoes off to find out who’s going to win the White House,” Lichtman said.  “You just have to count to six.”
 He was able to compile his system through presidential election campaign history going back to 1860, the beginning of the two-party Republican-Democratic dichotomy.
 Lichtman first developed the system in 1981, and used it to successfully predict the re-election of President Ronald Reagan three years later and again during every subsequent presidential campaign, coming out correct every time.
 Lichtman explained that leading up to the election in 1984, economic conditions seemed poised to make Reagan a one-term president. However, Professor Lichtman’s keys, such as substantial policy change in his first years in office and the lack of a third party challenge, showed a re-election on the horizon.
 He did not develop this methodology alone, citing assistance in developing his “keys” system with Russian geophysicist Volodia Keilis-Borok.
 “Geophysics, specifically earthquakes, are all about whether there is either stability or upheaval, and the same could be said for political campaigns,” Lichtman said.
The only “key” that Republicans can fully control this campaign season is their candidate’s charisma. However, that he doesn’t see much promise in that area for the Grand Old Party, Lichtman said.
 Chris Litchfield, the president of AU College Democrats, agreed with Lichtman’s speculation that the Republican field candidates will be unable to attract the same amount of voters as President Obama. However, he is apprehensive about basing electoral hopes on predictions made months in advance.
 “By any means, I urge [Democrats] to realize that we can’t write this election off,” Litchfield said.
 AU College Republicans did not respond to requests for an interview in time for publication.
 Professor Lichtman, who has given speeches across the world regarding his system, is ready to stick to his process even among skepticism.
“Despite vast changes [in the American political system], the keys stay the same,” Lichtman said.
Lichtman’s 13 Keys to the White House
1 Short-term economic conditions: The economy can’t be in recession during the campaign in order to have the incumbent party win this key. Thus, it’s unclear which party the key will fall on.
2 Long-term economic conditions: The economy is still in a recession, causing President Obama to LOSE this key.
3 Success in foreign or military affairs: Obama WINS this key, as Osama Bin Laden has been killed.
4 Failure in foreign or military affairs: There have been no massive military failures, which gives Obama a WIN for this key.
5 Presidential Scandal: President Obama WINS this key, as the Obama Administration has not had a major scandal.
6 Incumbency: Obama automatically WINS this key, as he is the incumbent president.
7 Domestic social unrest: There have been no large-scale riots or other large domestic disturbances in the course of the administration. President Obama WINS this key.
8 Charisma of the incumbent: President Obama hasn’t used his charisma effectively in the debates over health care and other legislation, causing him to LOSE this key.
9 Charisma of the opponent: The opposing field doesn’t have someone who can rally large amounts of the electorate through the candidate’s charisma. President Obama WINS this key.
10  Third party challenge: As of now, there is no serious third party challenger for the presidency, allowing President Obama to WIN this key.
11  Primary election challenger: Likewise, there is currently no serious challenge to President Obama within his own party for the upcoming Democratic primaries, giving President Obama a WIN here.
12  Significant policy change: However unpopular among some his proposed legislation may be, there have been significant achievements, be it the stimulus or health care reform, among others. President Obama WINS this key.
13  Party mandate (whether the President’s party holds more seats in the Congress after the midterm elections than the previous term): The Democratic Party’s loss of the House of Representatives in last year’s midterm elections gives President Obama a LOSS in this key.
Total: 9 keys in Obama’s favor, three keys against him, with one undecided

2011-10-11,AU,Democrat,"Audiences may mistakenly expect “The Ides of March” to be a dramatic parallel to the rise and fall of Julius Caesar. Instead, the film depicts a different type of fall for all its characters.
The film follows a press secretary, Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling, “Drive,” “The Notebook”) who works for Democratic Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney, “Up in the Air” and also the director of the film). Morris is a potential presidential candidate and Myers is along for the ride. The film is based on the play “Farragut North” by Beau Willimon. 
“The Ides of March” is a powerful drama that thrills viewers with its meaningful score and striking acting performances. 
“The Ides of March” is not missing the dishonest characteristic of a political story. The twists in the film, therefore, lack the element of surprise, yet still satiate a need all viewers have. Audiences want to experience the secret sense of pleasure that follows a scandal. Viewers love painful moral twists, and “The Ides of March” fills that desire with ease.
Though most of the screen time is spent with Meyers, “The Ides of March” has no single narrator or viewpoint. Viewers are allowed the time to gain perspective from multiple characters, but never gain a detailed insight into any. 
Powerful acting by the well-chosen cast portrays the small but potent glimpse into each character’s motivation. Viewers are always given just enough information to keep the action interesting.
Clooney’s direction reflects his appreciation and understanding for the art of acting. 
The acting in “The Ides of March” is poignant, yet subtle. Gosling is convincing as an idealistic young man in a position of power in a corrupt system. 
And Clooney has a gregarious yet dark persona befitting a rising politician. The Oscar-winner usually plays the charming gentleman with ulterior motives, so this role perfectly suits him.
Though pivotal to the film, women get little acting time. 
Molly (Evan Rachel Wood, “Across the Universe”) is a witty young intern who plays a powerful role in the progression of Morris’s and Myers’s lives. 
Viewers are intimate with her in some moments and shockingly distant in others. Her story leaves something to be desired, yet allows for intrigue. 
Wood’s performance on screen incites varying emotional responses, but they are always strong. 
Scenes focusing on Molly are rarely  accompanied by instrumentals. On the other hand, the pivotal moments with the leading men are commonly complemented by a strong score, which adds the thrilling dimension to their story filled with conventional political corruption. 
Though not revealing of unknown truths, “The Ides of March” speaks to politics’ transformative power.

2011-12-07,AU,Democrat,"From sleeping on sidewalks to organizing vigils in McPherson Square, AU students in Occupy AU and other student groups are giving their continued support for the Occupy D.C. movement. Here are what each group is doing to support the Occupy movement.
Community Action and Social Justice Coalition
CASJ is leading AU student engagement in Occupy D.C. The coalition acts as an organizing collective for 14 campus clubs that coordinates independent events and directs interested students to clubs within the coalition, according to Mitch Ellmauer, a junior in the School of Public Affairs. 
CASJ started in the 1960s as an anti-war and anti-draft counseling center and is not funded by AU. CASJ clubs including Movement for Global Justice, Student Worker Alliance and Fair Trade Student Association have had student representation at Occupy D.C.
During the first two weeks of Occupy D.C., CASJ had 10 to 12 students and alumni actively participating together in the events, some of which stayed overnight in sleeping bags at the protests. 
“The point is to try to get people to see and know what’s going on in the city in terms of activism,” said Mary Donoghue, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Participation has lately been on a more individual basis and has been less consistent.
“The thing about Occupy is that it’s trendy, so people will go once or twice then lose interest,” said Rachel Mandelbaum, a junior in the School of International Service.
CASJ will be focusing on student democracy next semester, which would include increased student input in University decision making that goes beyond student government. The coalition hopes to put an elected student with voting power on the Board of Trustees.
Students for Justice in Palestine
While many members of Student for Justice in Palestine have participated in the Occupy movement independently, the group helped organize a vigil Nov. 6 in McPherson Square for the victims of Operation Cast Lead, the 2008-2009 war in the Gaza Strip.
The vigil was not an official Occupy D.C. event, but many D.C. occupiers joined in, Steve Demarest, a junior in SPA, wrote in an email.
SJP also protested Israel’s use of Caterpillar bulldozers during Operation Cast Lead to destroy homes, factories, food and water systems, Demarest said. 
“There is a diverse group of political views within the Occupy movement, but I think the one common thread that unites protesters is opposition to corporate abuse, i.e., putting profit over people,” Demarest said.  
Eco-Sense
Eco-Sense has been advocating for sustainability and environment awareness in the Occupy D.C movement. Members volunteer and engage in political activism on environmental issues on campus and in D.C. A handful of Eco-Sense members were recently involved with the Occupy D.C. movement.
Mandelbaum; Megan Lyle, a sophomore in CAS; and other AU students attended the Anti-Tar Sands Keystone XL rally Nov 6. The rally was not directly a part of Occupy D.C., but many occupiers attended it, Lyle said. 
The protest focused on stopping the construction of the Tar Sands Keystone XL pipeline, which could potentially pollute major water supplies and transport tar sands oil that burn dirtier than other oils, according to Mandelbaum. 
The pipeline would stretch across thousands of miles from Canada, through the continental United States, to Texas to transport unrefined oil, Lyle said. 
American Vegan Outreach
American Vegan Outreach has not been directly involved with Occupy D.C., but numerous AU vegans have joined the Occupy D.C. movement, according to Paige McNamara, a sophomore in CAS. 
The Occupy D.C. Declaration directly mentions opposition to factory farms, a key AVO issue, McNamara said. 
McNamara held teach-ins about veganism at Occupy D.C., offering the platform for discussion on why veganism should be a viable option for all people.
“I hope to be able to introduce the idea of veganism as a tool of liberation, not just for animals but for workers, people, consumers to the people at McPherson,” she said. 
McNamara also said sustainable living practices are a major theme at the Occupy D.C. camp. McNamara said it is only natural that veganism will be the next major discussion at Occupy D.C.
Justice Not Jails
The prison reform advocacy group took part in a march from the McPherson Square to a Wells Fargo bank Dec. 2 to protest the bank’s investment in the GEO Group. Demarest said the GEO Group is a private prison company that cuts costs by assigning one doctor for every 1,300 prisoners at the Rivers Correctional Institute, where many D.C. residents are held.
He saw “a decent amount” of people at the protest.
“Once we got to Wells Fargo, many people spoke about their own thoughts and experiences with private prisons and the prison system in general,” Demarest said. 
College Democrats
College Democrats is one of the largest clubs at AU and has differing opinions when it comes to the Occupy D.C. movement, said Chris Litchfield, president of College Democrats and a junior in SPA and CAS. 
College Democrats agrees with Occupy D.C.’s major issues, but not with the methods the group has proposed for solutions, he said.
One of the major issues that College Democrats has focused on is wealth inequality. The Democratic Party is looking for a more equitable tax structure to help shrink the wealth divide between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, Litchfield said. 
“I think there is still a role to play when it comes to advocacy in government,” he said.
He also said he sees a lot of overlay between the future of the Democratic Party and Occupy participants.
“Occupy is not an arm of the Democratic Party, but moving forward, this will be a very defining time,” Litchfield said. “It is nice to see other people than the Democratic Party talking about these issues.”
On campus, College Democrats hosted a panel on debt negotiation Nov. 30 after the failure of Congress’ Super Committee and plans to host events in the near future focusing on student education of important issues facing the United States and AU.

2012-02-07,AU,Democrat,"Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler is surprised Maryland hasn’t moved to legalize same-sex marriage sooner. 
A state senate committee is expected to vote on a Gov. Martin O’Malley’s same-sex marriage bill in the next few weeks.
“Ten years ago, people would think, ‘there's no way in the world,’ ‘it's like walking around on Mars,’ ‘there's no way same-sex couples are getting married in this country,’” Gansler said at a speaking event Jan. 31 in MGC 3, sponsored by AU College Democrats. “Ten years from now, they are going to look back at it as if it was some sort of quaint debate: ‘You know that was weird. Remember when they didn't let same-sex couples get married?’""
Gansler also called the issue a “Republican” one, saying that he believes Republicans see homosexuality as choice and “believe that they can be changed to no longer be homosexual.”
“There’s no issue — it seems to me right now — that’s a social issue that’s more Republican,” Gansler said.
Lawmakers also remain undecided on whether the state should recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
""There's five states in the middle where we say marriage is between a man and a woman, so we don't allow same-sex marriages in the great state of Maryland,” Gansler said in his speech. “But we will, and we are silent on what we are going to do about these other marriages [same-sex marriages from other states].”
Gansler testified in favor of same-sex marriage at a Maryland senatorial hearing Jan. 31, a move Gansler considered risky.
""I knew if I talked to my political people — as you see everyone is over-coached these days — they'd say that was a really stupid idea politically,” Gansler said. “But I thought it was the right thing to do, and I get paid less than paralegals that work at big law firms, so I thought, ‘you know, what if I'm going to be doing this job, I might as well do what's right.’"" 
The State Senate legalized same-sex marriage in February 2011 but it failed in the State House that March. Gansler hopes both chambers will pass the bill this year.
Gansler was elected attorney general in 2006 and is in his second term. He is also the president-elect of the National Association of Attorney Generals, the assembly of all the attorney generals in the United States.
Gansler teaches as an adjunct professor in AU’s Washington College of Law, where he teaches Criminal Trial Advocacy. 
He supports the unionization of AU adjunct professors, saying it gives adjunct professors an opportunity for competitive pay. 
“If in fact it passes, the next issue is: What will the union do for the adjunct professors?” Gansler said.
He encourages students to vote whenever they can, but also to take their time in college to pick a side of the political spectrum.
“I don't think people should pick a party based on what their parents are, but they should understand the issues and figure out which party is more aligned with their views,” Gansler said. “And then get involved the party.""

That being said, I really hope that you don't have that experience, love is a beautiful thing.

• @""I want to get into shape"" But if you do feel uncomfortable, the best times to go to the gym before 9 am when there's only old people there, between 3-5 pm since most people are in class, and between 10:30pm and midnight when most people are starting to do the homework for the next day.

Don’t subject innocent people to your bad decisions.  I don’t walk around spraying carcinogenic chemicals in your face. Stop being selfish.

Are you not aware of this invention or do you just enjoy being villainous and causing others to inhale the toxic chemicals you blow out into their path walking to class? I want an explanation.

2012-03-06,AU,Democrat,"First I wanted to introduce myself, for the majority of campus who probably doesn’t know me. My name is Chris Litchfield; I am President of the AU College Democrats, and a proud AU Student. 
That is, I was until today.
Two Fridays ago, American University College Republicans invited Gov. Jan Brewer to speak on campus. In response to her presence, a number of individuals, myself included, organized a demonstration against the legislation she has implemented in Arizona. As Governor, she has supported not only SB 1070, the controversial bill that codified racial profiling into the Arizona criminal justice system, but additional legislation HB 2281, which bans the teaching of multicultural studies. 
In both instances the laws have been crafted to place immense pressure on enforcers of the law, police officers and schoolteachers and to conform to a racist ideology which vilifies Latinos as ‘illegal’ because of their immigration status. 
This culture of racism has directly affected students at AU and across the United States, and to show opposition to this culture, we disrupted her event. Controversy ensued.
However, this is really the beginning to the story, a story that while not unique to The American University, defines our campus every day. 
This academic year, organizations on campus such as the College Republicans and the Youth for Western Civilization have organized multiple events targeting certain demographics with hateful programming and consistently pushed rhetoric that targets AU students with personal attacks. 
On the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah, the AUCRs hosted a pig roast on the Quad titled the Carnivore Initiative, affirming their “right to eat meat.” I suppose this was a show of bravado against the vegetarians and vegans on campus trying to “force feed” them greens or the folks of the Jewish faith who were observing a High Holiday “too faithfully.” 
On the first day of Latino History Month, AUCRs fliered the campus with posters as part of their Anti-Che Day. While there perhaps needs to be a discussion of Che Guevara’s status in pop culture, the event was targeted too specifically to be anything less than racism and intimidation.
We are a campus that prides itself on our diversity. Many voices exist at AU, and allowing them to be heard is of the utmost importance. But there is a difference between free speech and intimidation – dialogue and hate. 
AU students on the whole vehemently oppose racism, but in practice we refuse to admit our hand in perpetuating it. It happens every day in our classrooms, dorms and apartments. But we instead blind ourselves with the next electoral race or internship on the Hill or prestigious speaker. It’s easier, and we have all done it, but we can no longer make those excuses. Not if we care about our fellow students.
I am not immune either. As College Dems President, no matter which issue we faced I tried to argue that the organization should stand by the principles of the Democratic Party to stand up for those marginalized by economic inequality, racism and gender and sexuality norms. 
And yet time and time again, be it in the call for sexual assault education on campus or in the face of targeted racism, the organization I love stood silent. It was easier to play politics, to spin the story or dodge the question, than it was to stand up for our beliefs. 
We did everything that Congress does, and then we went back to our dorms and wondered about our spineless politicians: how the agency of a woman could be rolled back, how fair access to health care be challenged and how laws limiting the freedom of Americans, be them undocumented workers in Arizona or union firefighters in Wisconsin, could be passed.
But it starts here. It starts with our own attitudes. The politicos on AU’s campus, myself included, saw it only as a game to be played and a line on a resume – not the very future of our country. We took the easy path and oppression perpetuated itself.
Our campus should be a safe place for all of our students. However, it isn’t when certain groups continually harass certain demographics of students. Gov. Jan Brewer’s unchallenged presence on campus represented this tacit approval of hate. 
After a semester of feeling abandoned by the campus at large, disrupting Jan Brewer’s speech seemed like the only way to send this message. How do we live by the beliefs we all are so quick to espouse? Paul Wellstone once said, “If we don’t fight hard enough for the things we stand for at some point we have to recognize that we don’t really stand for them.”
As of today, I am resigning from the College Democrats, an organization I dearly love but of which I am also ashamed. 
Our political lives begin today, and I know the AU community can address the real issues of oppression here on campus, if we stand by our beliefs. They run much deeper than a single banner or speech or op-ed.

• Dear guy in SIS who thought his headphones were plugged in but was actually just playing music really loudly: That was hilarious and thanks for looking rightfully embarrassed when you realized your mistake!
• To straight female conservative republican. Wow I wasn't even trying to be mean with that first post. You have your whole life to be a racist, bible-quoting, million(miscalculated) mom joining, human rights offender. Why start in college? Keep pretending that your conservative boyfriend doesn't hate gay people because he's in the closet himself. Or that his huge gun makes up for his less than adequate bedroom abilities. If I could legally spit on you I would.
• My RA tells me to watch out for EI guys on my floor because they steal laptops. But just the other day we catch a mysterious man in his mid 30s walking our floor, looking around. I blame the RHA for letting a 30 year old man enter the dorms.
• I was so mad when I found out how much we were paying for Gym Class Heroes. WE COULD HAVE BROUGHT LIL B! Now you touring heavy and your show cost 30 G's! DAMN BASED GOD, YOU DOING EVERYTHING!
• Guys, the rants were so good today! Eff those smokers!
• @LanaDelRay Hunger Games lyrics poster: this district smells like rat piss my name is Katniss...
• @gentlemen get screwed over. Maybe she just wasn't into you. She's allowed to not be into you.
• I also find myself becoming more conservative here, but I'm not sure if it's just that a lot of the liberals here are really obnoxious.
• Reading some of these rants makes me wonder if I was ever actually like this while being an undergraduate.
• ICE TRAIN RAGE BIG!!!!
• that awesome feeling when you need emergency counseling and the person answering phones tells you the next available appointment is for thursday. What if I don't have until thursday!? #Suckstosuck
• feeling better than ever. #masturbationinthelib
• To the girls to my right on the silent floor - stop trying to have a conversation here. The whole floor can hear every single word you're saying. Neither of you are capable of whispering. Go chat in the Mudbox, some of us are ACTUALLY trying to be productive.
• @“my roommate has an std and is a slut. i do not respect her and never will.” Awesome job with the slut shaming! please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality."" Preach.
• @Team Gale. Serious? How do you read those books and come out liking Gale?
[Editor’s Note: An answer in the form of a fan-fiction short story would be preferred]
• That moment when at the end of a busy, productive phonathon shift, you start singing ""closing time"" to yourself, and your supervisor hears you and puts the song on.  :)
• To AU's spitting image of Christian Bale: God, you're a gorgeous specimen of man.
• Why did you have to leave?
• i really really miss you =/
• @""I want to hang out with you but I have to play the game…""  Don't play games, games get you nowhere
• I've been wearing more dresses just because of how many guys have been ranting about them!
• @""is the extremely attractive blonde on hughes 2 really a lesbian? help!"" No we have no blonde lesbians on our floor
-Hughes 2
• Eaglesecure is making it impossible to have a Disney sing-a-long.
• @""[Editor’s Note: Time McBride = Sitcom spinoff wherein Tim McBride discovers a time machine and explores the history of AU?]"" EDITOR YOU JUST MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD. I LOVE YOU.
• no....you're douchy.
• What qualifies someone as a ""Public Figure""?? I feel like there are so many people's full names used on here that it seems like anyone does.
• I agree about the Adele chick. She's in my class and I want to play with her boobs. :)
• Sorry editor...it's kinda why fat people are fat tho...they stay home and eat. #reality
• Why do none of my friends want to discuss politics?! I feel like I am suddenly at the wrong university
• The fact that Eagle Rants has an editor is maybe the most hilarious thing since Hope-Change
• I know I'm driving everyone crazy, but I can't stop talking about you. You are my drug
• @”facebook timeline advocate: I love the concept of the timeline, but there are a few really annoying bugs in it that I can’t figure out.  On the “map” feature, whenever I click on a city I have been to it only lets me add a single year. What if there are cities I have been to multiple times on various different years? I would prefer to just click on the cities I have been to without adding dates, but it won’t let me do that either.
• I really don't see the problem with the smoke free campus plan... if I were an alcoholic I wouldn't  be aloud to drink a beer right after I get out of class no matter how much I craved one. Just saying. Or you know what, if you want a cigarette, you can walk across the street and smoke there. Problem solved.
• @""To be honest, the whole concept of Greek life families really just annoys me..."" Couldn't agree more. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. Your right, where are their priorities?
• When rants have curse words in them, do the eagle staff just delete them or do they switch in asterisks for the curse words? I’ve always wondered if the asterisks were left by the ranters or if they are the product of censors curse words.
[Editor’s Note: I just delete them when they use curse words]
• ThEagle.  I love Regular Show. Thank you for putting it as your TV pick.
• @“I want to get into shape” You shouldn't care what anyone else thinks, I know it is hard. But making this decision for yourself is a tough one to make, and you obviously have courage and drive to have made it in the first place. First and foremost do what is best for you, don't think about other people, especially people that judge you - they dont mean anything anyways. good luck!
• I think I am the Adele
• @hipster girls are gross: You have it all wrong. Hipsters smoke weed. Goths smoke cigarettes.
• I HATE SOCIAL GREEK LIFE. There I said it. It separates everyone into different groups and the rest dont have a group (not that they want one...). Everyone fights for equality and no cliques or bullying but thats what greek like does (a lot of the time, not generalizing).
• @everyone trying to get in shape who keeps complaining about the gym being crowded: You are aware that you don't need a gym to work out right? They do allow runners outside. Running is actually possible without treadmills. And there is a pool at AU too. And tennis courts. Etc.
• @dated ex for 4 years and it ended horribly: May I ask what happened?
• KONY2012
• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day. He says it is embarrassing to him when I wear sweat pants and should instead wear one of my pretty dresses or nicer pants when I go in public. I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.
• Was it rude to protest Brewer? Yes. You know whats ruder? Racism.
• Dear Eagle's Nest,
I would like to bring your attention to the current dearth of ice cream selections. Never have I seen a more disappointing sight than the empty shelves of the ice cream freezer. One question: Why?
Sincerely,
Jamaican Me Crazy

• THE WOMBATS ARE COMING TO THE 9:30 CLUB!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
• @hates Greek families, we're not all awful, I'm in a non-social frat and I'm super excited about my new family! It's a way to make new friends not get rid of old ones, so if your friends can't deal that's their problem not the institution's.
• @""In this world, gentlemen get f***ed"": good job standing by your beliefs, I guess, but be careful not to take an isolated incident and extrapolate too much. ""Old-fashioned"" romance doesn't work for everyone; I personally wouldn't like it if someone talked to my parents about dating me before they talked to me about it.
• ""I'm in love for the first time, don't you know it's gonna last"" I swear music always knows how to say things when you don't.

• Why can't Eagle Rants be clever and contain basic English. I've read other schools rants (UNC-Chapel Hill) and they surpass us in ranting. It must say something when a student bodys' rants are from illiterates and numbskulls. Can't there be a smart rant every once in a while. Do you guys even know the meaning of a rant?

2012-04-10,AU,Democrat,"Aaron Cohen woke up to a text message around 5:30 p.m. one afternoon saying the AU College Democrats were going to host political consultant Kim Christiansen.
Cohen decided to go to the event, not thinking that anything would come of it. 
Just a few months later, with Christiansen’s help, Cohen was working on Rep. Matt Campbell’s, D-IA, congressional campaign against Rep. Steve King, R-IA.
Campbell went on to win his primary but lost the general election. 
Cohen also worked on a campaign for Francis Thicke, who later became Iowa Secretary of Agriculture. Cohen took a “stagnant operation and turned it around” by raising about $350,000 in a month.
A mere junior in the School of International Service, Cohen now works as a consultant with the objective of adding “value at the community level” to his clients.
He also is the chief communications officer of Sawmill Hollow Family Farm in Iowa, which sells jam — all without ever taking a business class.  
One thing Cohen says he misses about being on the campaign trail is the sense of purpose.
“You wake up every day with a mission,” he said.
On campus, Cohen was both the debate chair of AU Dems and the economic policy chair of the Roosevelt Institute his freshman year. 
Cohen has an air of professional friendliness. But when he needs something done he can be frank and forceful, a skill that came in handy when he was working with campaign staff. 
He says he misses some of the direct contact with the public and making good impressions on people.
“Folks know good folks when they see them,” Cohen said.
When it comes to management, Cohen “loves to talk to interns about strategy in a dialogue” rather than a lecture.
He also feels that if an employee really understands why they are doing something, they are more likely to be invested in the task they are completing. For this reason he admires Sally Shelton-Colby, diplomat-in-residence at AU, because she takes the time to discuss the “why” behind any work she assigns.
In terms of politics, Cohen doesn’t like to be “pinned down” by traditional political labels.  
“I’m a Democrat, but [I’m for] a small and effective government,” Cohen said.
He went on to say that the regulatory system is more difficult for small businesses to maneuver in than big businesses, which stifles growth. 
“I am particularly passionate about growing rural communities,” because he grew up in a small community in Kentucky, “America’s heartland.” (Cohen says he is a fan of the Kentucky Wildcats and has been since before they were popular.)
He is fiscally conservative but socially liberal and insists he is more of a populist than a libertarian.
“I think Republicans have monopolized talking about values, and I hate that because I love talking about why I love America,” he said. 
Cohen is for gay rights and “anti-abortion, pro-choice.” 
“I would never judge anyone,” he said. “I just have a problem with it personally.” 
Whether he is talking about his success in business or as a political consultant, Cohen says, the key to success is knowing how to work with people.
“It’s all organizational theory,” he said.

2012-04-12,AU,Democrat,"Former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman will be speaking on April 18 in the University Club.
He will be the Kennedy Political Union’s last speaker for the year, co-sponsored by the AU College Republicans.  The event will start at 8:15 p.m.
KPU Director Alex Kreger thinks Huntsman will be a good speaker because he was so recently in the national spotlight.
Huntsman dropped out of the Republican presidential primary in mid-January.  His campaign featured his daughters, who created a series of campaign videos for him. The videos were posted on their YouTube channel, Jon2012Girls.
Prior to his campaign for president, Huntsman served two terms as the governor of Utah and spent time as the American ambassador to China under President Barack Obama.
Kreger said Huntsman has some of the freshest political ideas right now and will be able to speak to Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike. 
“I think there will be a lot of excitement and people will be interested because he is a unique candidate,” she said.
Tickets are not required for the event.

After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The controversy has forced our nation into intense self-examination: of its gun policies, of race relations, of police practices. What else has this tragedy exposed? And what can we learn from it?

Perpetuating hate and injustice

Stand your ground

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. The controversy has forced our nation into intense self-examination: of its gun policies, of race relations, of police practices. What else has this tragedy exposed? And what can we learn from it? Our quick take columnists weigh in:

Perpetuating hate and injustice

Stand your ground

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys.

Do what you  want to do, and if they ever get married, they can plan their weddings whatever way they want.  This will be a memory that will last forever.  Don't let your wishes and memories be shaped by what other people want you to do.



•Stop with the biddie hate, being a biddie is fun, try it sometime.
•@ ""Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough?""
That's just man's natural defense mechanism against needy women.
•@ Guy who wore biking spandex into The Dav.
Of all the people you had to bend over in front of you chose me. I have one question. WHY?!
•@Allison DuBois: I’m not saying that they didn’t use it in court, I’m saying that mostly everyone that she claims to have worked with openly deny that fact or say she wasn’t helpful at all, not just in court. One officer even stated that she was trying to get information off of him. This all draws one huge FAKE sign in my head.
•@Allison DuBois cont’d: mind DNA? You’re really just throwing anything out there to try and make sense. If she had some new kind of DNA, why doesn’t she let scientists test her DNA? Or study her brain for a few days until she gets a vision? That would surely give us some answers and probably lead to a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the brain. But no, she just writes books and goes on tour and tells people how to do it herself. And no, one guy at the University of Phoenix who studies psychics doesn’t mean anything.
•@Allison DuBois cont’d: If you want to believe its real, you must first believe that souls and ghosts and goblins exist. It doesn’t matter how much you watch “Ghost Hunters” and think that's real too, there is absolutely zero scientific evidence that any of that stuff exists. What is easier to believe, that this woman really has supernatural powers, or that she is deceiving everyone to further her career? No, there’s no way ANY human would do the latter, right? Just like every other fairy tale, I will believe its real when there is actual, empirical, scientific evidence for it.
•@Allison DuBois (one last time): If its Allison's policy that nobody can say she worked with them, then that should really be another red flag. And yes, I can create visions in my head whenever I want. I can call them dreams too if I felt like. And your comparison with washing hands before delivering babies doesn't work because its actually testable and verifiable.

•I posted a rant regarding Sarah McBride that was not hateful, just simply posing the other side of the argument and how I don't necessarily understand it but that got censored.. so I think your censoring rules are bogus you just censor anything bad regarding McBride
[Editor's note: When it comes to this topic, Sarah is being considered a private figure. No one deserves to have everyone comment on their gender and sexuality.]
•My roommate/best friend is possibly transferring next semester to a better school but hasn't gotten a letter yet.. I have to leave without knowing if I'll see her next year and I don't know how to tell her how amazing she is and how much she has changed my life
•All McBride did as SG president (as it seems by the Eagle article) is work towards issues with LGBT.. while important, really? that's all he did? kind of biased..
•If I wasn't at AU, I'd still be at University of Maryland (I transferred). It makes me sad when people bitterly complain about AU. You guys really have no idea how good you have it.
•Nice spamming,SG senators. As someone who DOESN'T work for the Eagle, and used to be a senator, I'll second their report- You guys are awful. You take credit for things you had barely anything to do with, you pass moronic resolutions (TAMPON, anyone?) and you generally think this is an episode of West Wing. So yeah, hop off. But also, I believe there were TWO SG reporters and they were both really nice. The other one had to leave to take a SG position. But let's give credit where credit is due- good work Zoey too!

•@""""The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?"" Are you stupid? No.""- clearly someone doesnt get the humor in this. the original ranter was implying that the scenario which takes place (hot guy who turns out to be gay) is very reminiscent of an AU situation
•@""animal- free food is often cheaper and provides something that everyone can enjoy."" mmhmm cuz TDR's tempeh is just soooo delicious... uh, NOT. Spoiler, not everyone enjoys squished soy cubes. We evolved to have our taste buds enjoy meat because it gives us the protein and salt we need. TDR is the reason I STOPPED being vegan. Ick.
•@Wish I could just have a hook up... Hey, I'm in the same boat. It seems as tho the men-folk really have  only school on the brain... FOR LIKE THE FIRST TIME EVER!
•I miss my dog, but I'm not going home this summer.. Waaaaahhh
•It's three in the morn' and I'm lookin' for the porn.
•Either the editor didn't post my rant, or I just forgot to submit it. Probably the latter, but I'm not sure. I was pretty sleep-deprived.
•Went to a Nats game this weekend, watched the WONK campaign evaporate my tuition dollars before my eyes. Seriously, what kind of self-respecting university advertises themselves that much at a ballpark? WONK needs to burn in hell.
•Gender identity disorder is the formal psychological term for those who are transgender/transsexual. It will be called gender dysphoria in the DSM-5, and will still cover these topics. Personally, I do not believe it should be considered a ""disorder"", the same way homosexuality isn't considered a disorder (though it used to be), but there are certain benefits with it being a diagnosable disorder, including that insurance companies will cover things like gender reassignment surgery. There's debate about the topic among psychologists and just people in general.
•@why am i so lonely?
I used to feel that way until I found God and rediscovered  my faith in Jesus Christ.  God made you in his own image.  He will never leave you alone.
•@girlfriend needs to grow up: Instead of criticizing her, try explaining logically what  she did and how it negatively affected you. Speak in terms of “I feel x and y”, rather than “you always do x and y”. If you accuse of things she will be less likely to listen to you. Positive affirmation is always better at changing behavior than negative affirmation. I recommend the book “The Truth About Love” by Dr. Patricia Love PhD for more relationship tips.
•I also thought the werewolf rant was some twilight reference. Now I looked it up on wikipedia and saw that it is a real thing. To answer your question seriously OP, yes AU is very accepting of all types of conditions and lifestyles. You will love it here. Hope to see you next year!
•I like it when u call me big pa-pa.
•You laugh at my dreams and you don't accept my life goals. It really upsets me and makes me feel less valued.
•@way out of control promotion of “sexual assault awareness” ranter: I completely agree. Whenever I have friends visit me at AU, they think AU is a college full of rapists. AU probably has a much much lower rate of date rape that most of other colleges in the country (for one, because so much of the population is gay). The whole overdramatization of the rape awareness campaigns are actually hurting real victims by making AU look stupid and by turning the whole issue of date rape into a cry wolf situation.
•Why does no one reply to the Gary Johnson rants? Ron Paul gets some love. Come on now. There is no way I am the only Gary Johnson supporter at AU. He embodies the best of both parties. Fiscal responsibility from the republicans and civil liberties and equality from the democrats. Gary Johnson 2012!
•Woah, woah, woah. Someone is dating their big??? WTF??? That is the worst greek incest.
•@Editor- So if I publish an op-ed saying that I'm very secure in my gender, and my personal opinion is that there are psychological explanations behind gender identity disorder, are you going to censor the rants disagreeing with me? What Sarah did is beautiful, and brave, and I'm happy for her, but I think that those who had issues with her op-ed deserve to be heard the same way she got an opportunity to be heard. Don't encourage an atmosphere of division here by only publishing one side.
•I know Sarah, and she's been wonderful and receptive to answering people's questions about her transition. Eagle Rants is an excellent platform for people who don't know her, and have confusions. If you don't publish the negative (but not hateful...) rants, these people who don't know anything about transgendered people won't have the opportunity to have other people answer and respond. You're basically facilitating ignorance about this... I'm really disappointed in the Eagle.
•the editor just answering nope= complete BS.. you know you're wrong, McBride gave up the privacy by posting the article and just replying with nope is a cop out because you know you should've posted those rants
•Are you sad to see the editor of Eagle rants go?
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•Sarah McBride is a private figure who you can't negatively comment on.
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•I don't think the issue of on campus food is about the variety of food... it's more about the price. There is a ridiculous  mark up on everything on campus. My bank account can't handle it!
•On my to do list I made last night for the rest of finals, I've only been able to cross one thing off so far. This is not good.
•I think it's wonderful that Sarah was able to come out to a very accepting environment and I am very proud of her decision. However, if you're going to uphold her status as a non-public figure don't publish ANY rants about her.
•OK, I can understand the Student Union being upset about the fact that students have no say with regards to raising tuition and what's going into the McDonald's, but I really don't have sympathy re: being a dry campus. That's been a policy for a loooong time; you should've known that when you signed on.
•The idea of the unpaid internship is a completely immoral concept and a violation of labor laws. AU (and all other colleges) need to stop encouraging immoral corporations to take advantage of desperate students and needs to stop giving ""college credit"" for ""internships"". College is for learning. Not for paying 3k to AU in order to work for free as an envelop licker.
•As a redhead, I'm so sick of the word ""ginger."" Ugh.
•I once had to fart really badly in a literature class. So, ladies, I am single and available. #realtalk
•From NYT : “When I lived in D.C., it astounded me that the nation's best and brightest college students, hoping to go into politics, worked for senators and congressmen unpaid. Not only was this surprising because of the amount of work D.C. interns actually did on the Hill, but also because it meant that only the wealthier college students could afford to work these unpaid ""jobs"" and, therefore, meet the people and get the experiences that would be integral if they chose to continue on in politics. And we wonder why our politicians tend to come from the ""1 percent.""”
•Did anyone else read the New York Times article “The Outsources Life” about how we are outsourcing intimacy in the form of hiring therapists/life coaches/wantologists because we view sharing our problems with friends as burdening them? When did we become too busy to care for others? Thoughts?
•@Person ranting about Sarah McBride's Op/Ed, she wrote that to appropriately explain, as outgoing president, what was happening.  The AU community deserved an explanation about this public figure.  She did not write it to be criticized for her feelings and decisions.  And what do you care if she did or not?  It's her life, not yours.
•@""AU really isn't vegan-friendly at all...."" FALSE. We were ranked 10th this year. Check yo self.
•I made the best rants of the year TWICE and I am embarrassingly proud.
[Editor’s Note: Kudos!]
•Dear one girl sitting with all of AEPi in the library: I don't know what weird, deep psychological need you're trying to fulfill, but you just look pathetic and you're not cute. P.S., everyone is annoyed by how loud you guys are being.
•If you whine about not getting a place to replace McDonalds look no further than the fanatical green movement on this campus. The reason no company took the lease is because there is a clause for carbon neutrality. Do not let the eagle article trick you into thinking companies pulled out do to a lack of interest from corporate. It is due to these idiotic green eagles that we can not have a normal place to eat at on our campus.
•@Editor: Ohhh editor, let us call a spade a spade and admit. You like Sarah or support the situation they are going through so you are avoiding dissident press. I have no qualms with it but do not postulate you are doing it for some moral inclination, being her privacy. Coming out like that was no private matter and you have not posted rants that did not even attack Sarah but rather ask provocative questions about trans sexuality. Just admit it.
•All I seem to be doing lately is playing with fire.
•@Person who asked a question about a cow: You shouldn't get spoiled milk, you'll be buttering it up if you do it right.
•@Hate -I probably am a terrible person. I would still like to have a discussion in person so we can end the year like the friends we once were.
•Has anyone ever told you that you're a passive-aggressive low life? It's no wonder you have a whopping two friends here. Have fun abroad because I never want to see you again after what you've said. La chatte!
•Amie Krupnick? YOU BET.
•I have three roomates. I love two of them dearly but we all hate the third one. How can we convince her to move ouuuut?
•Go SG!
•Im thankful for the blog.
•Fun fact. Racism is still funny.
•As a woman, I'm all for gender equality, but do you think next year Women's Initiative we can tone it down a bit? My grandmother came to pick me up and I'm trying to explain to her I don't go to a school of rapists. If she passes out....
•I am so grateful for your blog post.Much thanks again. Want more.
•The myAU Portal is totally broken right now. Great. It's not like I need to see what my grades are or anything.
•I had too much sex this semester.
•I don't know how to tell you how much your friendship has meant to me this year. It's too important to do it over text message, and if I say it in person I might end up hugging you and crying, even though I am neither a hugger nor a cry-er. Thanks for putting up with my brattiness, and for helping me get swoll.
•Impeach the Eagle Rants Editor!
•I missed puppy day :(
•Hey Eagle Rants editor, if I make an inappropriate comment toward some random transgender person without mentioning a specific name, will you still censor me? What if this person doesn't even exist? And what if my comment is not geared toward all transgender people, but just this one person who I won't name? Will you still censor me then?
[Editor’s Note: The Eagle does not publish hate speech, so probably not.]
•Seeing as how The Eagle keeps censoring Sarah rants, I say we need  another Free Speech wall so that all expressions can be heard without fear of censorship.
•Thank you ever so for you article.Thanks Again.
•I asked you to do ONE thing, and I gave you plenty of time to do it, and you didn't. You suck.
•Where are the May 7th eagle rants???
[Editor’s Note: Editor’s got finals, too, you know.]
•@ @Women's Initiative (who stated a prospective student was worried if sexual assault was an issue on the campus), If statistics such as 1 in 4 were lower, there would be no need for the programming. Stop sexual assault, not the prevention.

•If Sarah McBride is not a public figure then you shouldn't be posting positive rants about her either.  No rants that identify non-public figures remember?  So post 'em all or none at all.

P.S. Nothing matters. 
• @We will take our country back. Really? That's pretty divisive language coming from someone who seeks more acceptance. Honestly, as a dem, I'm usually intrigued by republicans. My question is ""why?"" Social views usually stem back to personal values. I can accept a difference of opinion there. But supply-side economics? The Laffer curve? C'mon.
• people in the group study room talking about some Dutch citizen and international law...what the freak are you going on about!? i can't tell if your project is really interesting or if my work is really boring
• TOUCH YOURSELVES EVERY DAY
• Editor, you're the freakin' bomb.  Don't listen to the haters.  And to whomever keeps ranting that the editor sucks, seriously, knock it off.  Obviously you've never been in a position to experience this, but people's feelings get hurt by that sh*t.
[Editor’s Note: Don’t worry, I don’t have feelings.]
• ""I'm scared of getting loneliness induced psychosis."" I'm scared for you, too, because I've been there and I know how much it hurts, feeling as if you could be saved if you could just find a single human connection but it's like you're a ghost, no one can hear you, so you send out anonymous messages online hoping that someone, anyone, will write back. so. I'm writing back. hi.
• I know, right? Humming people and whistling people... They are awful.
• Brohoof!  These Eagle Rants just got 20% cooler.
• poor humming girl man
• Anyone know of any good bungees you could use for the purpose of attaching an AU ID card to your belt? My roommate loses hers daily, and I feel a bungee cord of some type would rectify this problem.
• As a marsupial expert, I am very koalafied.
• I really need to get up and print something, but I can't move because I'm listening to xm on my computer and all my favorite songs keep playing.
• So, I know I'm pretty, but I like when you say it, so please don't stop anytime soon...
• Where the aspies at?
• I eat too much fro yo these days. I guess there are worse addictions, but fro yo in the Eagle's Nest is such a temptation.
• Dear guy sitting near the computers on the second floor of the library last night, you are unbelievably gorgeous. 
• I'm so sorry for whatever happens between us. I never planned for this to happen this way.
• No hot professors???
• I hate it when people say ""what's good?"" IT MAKES NO SENSE!! I'm always tempted to answer: puppies or cupcakes.
• To the person rating about Italy and France: you are seriouisly a tool.  No one cares and its annoying.  Find something better to do.
• Dear phonathon people...STOP F*CKING CALLING ME.  I gave this damn school 160k in tuition and I refuse to pay another dollar so that AU can redistribute my money to random minority students via scholarships.  Sincerely, an annoyed alumni.
• @beautiful/caring/strong/faithful Now we're all just curious... Come on, details :) 
• Ladies of AU, how big does a guy need to be in order to be considered ""big?"" 
sometimes i push the tip of my penis inward so it matches my belly button
• @plaid shoes girl: i think that was me, thanks!! I'm glad you liked them :D
• @Tavern at 3. Sorry, Mondays are no good for me. How about next Friday (10/19) sometime between 12:30pm and 2:30? And it's all good, I never got a confirmation so I didn't show up. 
• @Northern people are great, but I miss southern people....Who are you and where can I find you? I miss the south and southerners.
• I just want a boyfriend who understands my crushes on historical figures. No, I don't wish you were Alexander Hamilton, I just think he was a cutie. Get over it.
 • you suck editor! 
• @girl who is attracted to straight girls and girls with boyfriends - You need to stop being me, or come find me so we can be perfect and alone together.
• @ “There is a special place in hell reserved for people who don’t use eaglebucks or dining dollars when there’s a long line at Eagle’s Nest.” Um some of us are actually responsible enough to use real money and have real credit like big kids. Using eaglebucks is beyond stupid when almost every major credit gives you cash back.  I get paid $200 a month to use my credit card. So have fun getting zero cash back with your eagle bucks.  
• I wish this could be a happy song. But my happiness went away the moment you were gone.
• @”What if someone was about to kill themselves?” I don’t know about you, but I only have one self who could be killed. But perhaps this is why you are seeking help in the counseling center…
• I didnt ACTUALLY care or anything bro 
• He wants to be Aladdin
• @ 'a cracka helpin a sister out' ..............................................
really bro? Really. 
• Lol don't even bother texting me back. If you're reading this and think I may be talking about you. You're right I am. Put down the flip phone tiger, you've done enough damage for one day 
• I found a really good poop spot. I just thought I'd let you guys know ;)
• You made me physically sick with the amount of awkward you just created. I would congratulate you but I'm sure this is nothing out of the ordinary what with you being a straight male at AU and all
• I'd like to personally apologize for the country music in the dav.I wasnt there and I didn't make the playlist but I have a strong feeling I know who did and I definitely am the enabler in this situation so MY BAD I'm off to un-enable them now and save your ears
• Reading rants all calmly when you realize one might be about you...
• Cheers to the freakin weekend betches ;D
• @""Does anyone know of a nice place to meet attractive, smart gay men besides Town?"" and @""Why can’t I find any attractive gay men on this campus? All the guys I seem to like are either straight, taken or a**holes…""
Agreed.  I’m on Grindr begrudgingly but haven’t actually met anyone (on campus) in person because I don’t want random sex, I’m not out, and to be honest I’m embarrassed I’m even on it.  At the risk of sounding like a total douche—I consider myself intelligent, genuine, masculine, and attractive.  Where are you two?  -Gay Ranter
• WOW wtf white people. stfu.
• You can always make an emergency appointment at the counseling cetnter and they'll take you that same day
• @ ""There is a special place in hell reserved for people who don’t use eaglebucks or dining dollars when there’s a long line at Eagle’s Nest."" What? Why?

2012-11-08,AU,Democrat,"President Barack Obama won re-election in the 2012 presidential campaign against Gov. Mitt Romney on Tuesday after garnering the electoral votes of several major swing states. The president received noteworthy support from college age students as 60 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 cast their ballots for Obama. 
In addition, more young people voted in this election than in 2008.  People between the ages of 18 and 29 accounted for 19 percent of those who voted in the election, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.
Battleground States
Obama won 11 of the 14 swing states, including Virginia, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada.
Both the Obama and Romney campaigns expect Florida to narrowly favor the president.
Same-Sex Marriage
Maryland and Maine passed ballot measures Tuesday allowing same-sex marriage. Washington state is projected to pass a similar ballot measure, but results had not been finalized as of Nov. 8. Minnesota voters also rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. 
Marijuana Initiatives 
Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, and medical marijuana may be legalized in Massachusetts and Montana, pending final vote counts.  However, Oregon and Arkansas voted against legalization of marijuana. 
Puerto Rico may become the 51st State of America
Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood for the first time. According to the Constitution, Congress would still need to decide whether or not to accept Puerto Rico as a state before it can join the union.
Warren Unseats Brown 
Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren defeated Republican Senator Scott Brown in the Senate race.  The Warren-Brown race gained publicity after Brown’s repeated accusations that Warren illegitimately claimed to have Native American ancestry to advance her career. Brown was elected to replace the deceased Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime Democrat in the Senate. Warren helped create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, a major cornerstone for the Obama Administration, and was a favorite among Democrats to head the new agency. 
Mourdock Defeated by Donnelly
The Democrats gained another seat in the Senate with the victory of Joe Donnelly over Republican Richard Mourdock.  Mourdock was severely criticized after he said that pregnancy as a result of rape was “something God intended.”
McCaskill Defeats Akin
Claire McCaskill defeated Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate Race.  Akin’s campaign had its share of controversy. When he was asked whether abortion should be allowed in the case of rape, and he responded that “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down.”  He went on to say that the rapist, not the unborn child, should be punished.

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

2012-11-09,AU,Democrat,"Two filmmakers want you to know that the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lies. 
At least, that’s what filmmaker Oliver Stone and AU Professor Peter Kuznick’s new documentary series wants you to believe. Stone and Kuznick screened an episode of their 10-part documentary series, “The Untold History of America,” and answered questions about the upcoming show and book at Ward on Nov. 8.
Stone is known for making politically charged films, so the pairing for the documentary makes perfect sense. His film “W,” which highlights the personal issues of President George W. Bush, made a splash in 2008, while his earlier military-driven films “Born on the Fourth of July” and “Platoon” were nominated for Oscars in the late ‘80s (with “Platoon” actually taking home the golden statue for Best Picture in 1986). 
Kuznick introduced the series as a “history of the American empire” ranging from World War I to present day, including the presidency of Barack Obama.  
The series, beginning Nov. 12 airing at 8p.m. on Mondays on Showtime, aims to “puncture the common American myths,” Kuznick said. It began as one documentary, based on the 1944 Democratic Convention when President Harry Truman was chosen to be on the ticket above the favorite, Henry Wallace.
The general idea behind exposing this injustice was to highlight the fact that had Wallace, a vocal supporter of equality and peace, been chosen, he could have gone on to become president and avoided Truman’s mistakes.
The first episode, shown at the event on campus, was about Truman’s decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The episode argues that Truman lied to the American people, making them believe that the bombs were necessary to win the war when the Japanese had surrendered three months earlier.
Kuznick and Stone have been working on the project for about eleven years, 11 of which were for filming, since the movie required extensive research. During that time, they also collaborated in the classroom, with Kuznick teaching a course titled “Oliver Stone’s America” at AU. 
The documentary project started when Stone sat in on one of Kuznick’s class and heard the story of Wallace. Stone was immediately hooked, saying he “could not get the story out of his head for years.”
Stone was raised in a conservative household and dropped out of Yale University to volunteer in Vietnam. Kuznick pointed out that several of Stone’s friends from the war claim that he even saved their lives. 
In regards to handling criticism, Stone said he is “empathetic towards these political figures, not sympathetic…and there’s a difference.”
The project was important to Stone because he “felt the urge to do something while [he] is still alive.”
“Only 12 percent of Americans are proficient in U.S. history, and the little that people do know, it’s often wrong,” Kuznick said. “That’s what we’re trying to combat.”
“It’s better to know the truth before you die,” Stone said, “or at least some version that’s a little closer to the truth.”

2012-11-13,AU,Democrat,"Any movie directed and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg is going to carry high expectations on its shoulders.
“Lincoln,” Spielberg’s latest creation, is an epic movie chronicling President Abraham Lincoln’s time in the White House in January 1865, just months before the end of the Civil War. The focus of the film revolves around the vote on the 13th Amendment, the abolishment of slavery, in the House of Representatives and Lincoln deciding whether or not to negotiate with Confederate delegates to end the war immediately. The question about which to do may seem obvious in hindsight, but its complexity becomes apparent while watching, leaving even the viewer conflicted.
The complexity of the situation becomes apparent to the viewer while watching how Lincoln handles himself and his decisions. Lincoln is played by renowned actor Daniel Day-Lewis (“There Will Be Blood”). Day-Lewis’ portrayal of Lincoln is superb: brutally honest and humorous, yet soft-spoken and good-natured. Having a British actor playing one of America’s most iconic and well-known people, let alone presidents, is a risky idea. But Day-Lewis lives up to Lincoln’s legacy.
The remainder of the star-studded cast lived up to their roles as well. Sally Field (“The Amazing Spider-Man”), who has acted in an array of award-winning films and television programs, plays Mary Todd Lincoln (Lincoln calls her Molly in the film). Field does a terrific job conveying the paranoid and deeply depressed feelings the former First Lady deals with daily after the death of her son Willy. Her depression adds to the realistic feel of the movie, particularly in scenes that show the interactions between Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln.
Another major character is House Representative Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones (the “Men in Black” series). Stevens, historically one of the most powerful Republicans during Lincoln’s time, is portrayed as a cynically funny and righteous leader, and the scenes depicting the relationship between Lincoln and Stevens are some of the most pivotal and well-remembered.  Unfortunately, the appearance of heartthrob Joseph Gordon-Levitt (“Looper”), playing Lincoln’s son Robert in the film, is short. With his name so high on the bill, one would expect him to be in the movie a bit more often. 
One of the more surprising elements of “Lincoln” is its humor. It is easy to forget how funny Lincoln was when his inspirational and thought-provoking speeches are the ones remembered in history (not that this is a bad thing in the least).
Also, Lincoln’s Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn, of the“Bourne” series) has some of the funniest lines of the movie, as do the men Seward hires to sway Democrats in the House into voting for the 13th Amendment. While the subject matter of the film is not funny in the least, Spielberg’s choice to lighten up the film was a good one because it keeps the viewer attentive throughout.
The film’s runtime, at two and a half hours, is a bit lengthy even for the most avid Lincoln fan. The lighting and the camerawork of the film were also questionable at times. Some of the scenes had buildings that looked too modern, and there were even instances where the weather changes drastically without an explanation.
The language used throughout the film was tremendously verbose, and the subject matter shared between delegates of the House of Representatives is not exactly common knowledge. These combined factors could potentially confuse the audience.
In the end, “Lincoln” is a film worth seeing for its historical significance and its honest look into the world of one of America’s most beloved presidents.

2012-12-11,AU,Democrat,"by Jonathan Miller
You may have more in common with your member of Congress than you think, especially around this time of year. Students and lawmakers alike want to finish up the year and head home for the holidays. But there’s a final exam standing between Congress and the holidays, and America’s citizens are ready to give the body an “F” if it doesn’t pass.
That exam is coming in the form of the “fiscal cliff” - the combination of arbitrary, automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases coming at the end of the year that could cripple the economy. It all started last year when Congress picked 12 of its members to try to find a deal to secure America’s long-term financial future. Consumer confidence had dropped dramatically, and a credit ratings agency dropped our country’s rating.
It seemed the only thing that could make members of both parties work across the aisle was an alternative so terrible it would be untenable to both parties.
That alternative is coming closer to reality, and unfortunately, it is your generation that will have to pay the highest price.
The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that if we do not avoid the fiscal cliff, the $7 trillion combination of spending cuts and tax increases could send the economy hurtling back into recession for years to come. Unemployment, especially among young people, will rise even further. Education will suffer among the harshest spending cuts, losing about $4.8 billion in funding.
Our leaders have had more than three years to address these issues. Imagine if you had that long to prepare for a test. Yet rather than hunkering down in the library, or in their case the Capitol Building, to solve this crisis, leaders of each side avoid meeting to talk about potential solutions.
We need real solutions. These solutions begin with both parties understanding they need to work together to stave off this crisis. No Labels, a growing grassroots movement of hundreds of thousands of Republicans, Democrats and independents is working to facilitate cooperation. Since last year, we’ve been advocating for leaders in all negotiations to put everything on the table and ensure all interested parties are at the table. You can be a part of this movement and sign on at NoLabels.org
These solutions can also help fix the underlying problem: the way Washington does business. We need to find real and permanent ways for our leaders to come together to govern for the future because our nation’s financial situation is not the only problem America faces. We need our leaders to come together and find solutions in immigration, energy and infrastructure policy. As Washington’s current stalemate has shown, we can’t afford to wait for Congress to find bold, pragmatic across-the-aisle solutions.
Changing Washington won’t happen quickly. But even you would have a hard time cramming three years' worth of work into one night. What we can do now is commit ourselves, and hold our elected officials accountable, to the idea that progress is only made when our common national interest is the priority. That is what No Labels is all about.
Jonathan Miller is the former two-term elected Kentucky State Treasurer and has served three years as the state's CFO, the Secretary of Finance and Administration. During the first Clinton/Gore Administration, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Department of Energy.

2013-03-07,AU,Democrat,"You gotta hand it to the Republicans: they’re the best politicians in town.
They figured out how to manufacture leverage — and use it, too. They’ve found their rhythm, and they sure are grooving to the beat of their own drum.
See, the plan goes something like this:
Allow President Ronald Reagan to quadruple the national debt, largely by increasing defense spending (against the USSR, which was crumbling from within).	
Let President George H. W. Bush continue such disastrous economic policies, and then turn tail and run from him when he suggests something as heinous as raising taxes to pay for his exploits (like that undeclared war).
And then, make the debt the defining issue of the 1992 campaign and, when the other side wins, pounce on the new Democratic president by saying he’s not doing enough to reduce the deficit.
Furthermore, use the deficit as a wedge issue to take back the House in the midterm elections, and force a series of budget cuts that send the president off-message and prevent him from investing in health care, education, science and technology.
Sound familiar? That’s because it is.	
History does in fact repeat itself, and the GOP response to President Barack Obama’s budget proposals is proof of this.
The GOP said nothing — nothing! — when President George W. Bush fought two wars, signed into law a costly expansion of Medicare and cut taxes all at the same time. He doubled the national debt in eight years.
But once Obama got elected, the debt was suddenly the biggest issue we had to address. Some even took to calling it a “national security issue” (kind of like how the USSR was a national security issue in 1984).
The best line yet was Gov. Mitt Romney’s “road to Greece” gimmick.
It is pathetically ironic that the very policies that put Greece “on the road to Greece” — not paying their debts (read: “not passing the debt ceiling”) and austerity (read: “drastic budget cuts”) – are the same policies Republicans are advocating.
In 2010, America elected a gang of lawmakers who don’t understand basic economics. Americans tricked into voting for these people on the basis of a mythical “national security issue.”
And these people are working against their voters’ interests, most recently by failing to stop the sequester.
For all their talk of “job creators” and the need for more businessmen in government, Republicans don’t seem to understand that a CEO can’t provide jobs for his employees if consumers don’t have the money to buy his product or houses to put it in.
Indeed, in a recession, the government is the single most important spender and investor, because it is the only entity that can spend and invest. It did so in 1932, and has done so in every recession ever since.       	
In reality, Republicans in Congress don’t want to solve our debt “problem.” Why would they want to give up prime leverage? If history is any guide, they’ll want to use it again when the next unassuming (Democrat) schmuck strolls down Pennsylvania Avenue.        
The sequester, which Macroeconomic Advisers LLC estimates will ultimately cost 700,000 American jobs, is just the latest riff in the GOP’s tempo.        
It provided the GOP’s desired endgame: instead of talking about how to invest in our children’s future or repair our disintegrating infrastructure, we’re talking about which programs – like Social Security and Medicare – can be cut.        
So, the next time you enter the voting booth, remember that it’s not the deficit. It’s a game of political musical chairs, and it matters a helluva lot who sits in the chairs and who plays the music.

2013-03-07,AU,Democrat,"March 3 marked an important day for Kenyans. It was the day of the anxiously anticipated and crucial presidential election. This was Kenya’s first presidential vote since 2007, when evidence of vote rigging set off ethnic clashes and violence that killed over 1,000 people across the country.
I visited Kenya for the first time this January. While the elections were only two months away, there was a tension present in Nairobi. The bustling city was covered with presidential propaganda — billboards, posters and graffiti everywhere. 
At the embassy, where my father works, anticipation was also high. Not only was the outcome of the elections crucial for future U.S.–Kenya relations, but the threat of violence was also a concern among American diplomats. 
Throughout our trip, my father often asked Kenyans what their opinion was about the upcoming election. While emotions ranged from hopeful to worried, the one thing they all shared in common was a need to vote. 
One taxi driver told us that he would need to take at least three matatus (privately owned and crowded minibuses) to get to his voting location, while others would venture home to their own polling place  outside of downtown Nairobi to cast their ballots. 
When he asked me if everyone in the U.S. voted during the re-election, he was shocked when I told him many American’s don’t vote. He joked that Kenya was more of a democracy than the U.S. 
That got me thinking: is there truth behind that statement?
Kenya’s government is far from perfect. Uhuru Kenyatta has held a commanding lead of 40 percent to 55 percent over the second-place candidate, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s prime minister. Kenyatta has been accused by the International Criminal Court of financing death squads. 
However, Kenya is one of the most industrialized and democratic countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and this year’s election is the most complicated in its history. New positions have been created to change the winner-takes-all nature of Kenyan politics. These include governorships, Senate seats and even female county representatives. 
While many Kenyans still vote along ethnic lines, civic groups have tried to make this election about issues, integrity and plans, not ethnic groups. 
While their democracy and government may not be perfect, the election has impressed me and demonstrated a true desire for peace, stability and democracy. 
Like in the U.S., Kenyans are not required to vote. However, voter turnout on March 4 was tremendous, starting hours before dawn with lines of voters stretching nearly a mile long. In Nairobi’s Kibera slum, people waited nine hours on their feet to cast their vote. 
Voting was peaceful, albeit for some isolated violence on the coast but nothing compared to the riots of 2007.
While Kenya still has a long way to go in terms of ethnic tension and government, we Americans, who complain when we have to wait in line to vote and often don’t take advantage of the privilege we have, can learn from Kenyan citizens. 
The right to vote is one of the most sacred we have. While people flooding the polls in Kenya might not mean that this particular election is corruption-free and perfect, it shows that they want change and to take part of their government. Can we say the same here, where a color divide led many to not even vote? 
Only time will tell what Kenya’s fate is, or if the predicted victory of Kenyatta will spark violence. However, Kenyans are headed in the right direction, and their determination will take them far. 
Let’s hope Americans will one day also have the determination to wait in line, want to vote and celebrate a privilege many do not have.

2013-07-13,AU,Democrat,"By Matthew Farrell
Martin Luther King Jr. famously said from a jail cell in Birmingham, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" 
In a simple and concise manner, it articulates the notion that all men are equal and should have a universal interest in each other's well-being and that incidences of injustice shouldn't be looked at as isolated incidents, but as actions that are helping to shape what is viewed as acceptable in our society. 
With this in mind, I want to talk about the Palestinian / Israeli conflict. What's interesting about this conflict is that while the United States continues to use violations of United Nations regulations as a pretext to rally international action against other foreign countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, we as a nation continually underplay the fact that Israel is in violation of multiple international laws. 
To give a brief overview for those who aren't familiar with this, Israel's admittance as a U.N. member state was under the condition that it abide by general assembly resolution 194 calling for the right to return and compensation for Palestinians. A condition it still hasn't fulfilled. The U.N., in addition to the International Criminal Court, have repeatedly ruled that Israel's naval blockade, separation wall and settlement programs are in violation of international law. 
Israel has also been determined by the U.N. to be an occupying force in Gaza which make its treatment of Palestinians there, including it's extra-judicial killings of military and political figures, illegal. Recently, the U.N. released a report detailing how Israel Defense Forces coerce abused children to open bags suspected of containing explosives at gunpoint and even use them as human shields.
You might be wondering why I'm listing Israel's international crimes without addressing those of the Palestinians. My point is not to demonize Israel. My intention is to highlight the point that people are aware that Hamas has violated international law, but not many are aware of the scope and gravity of Israel's crimes. As a democratically elected political party, Hamas has routinely labeled terrorists, their government is de-legitimized and they also face sanctions and blacklisting. Yet many people are unaware that Israel routinely violates international law and Israel only faces minimal international pressure for it's violations of international law. 
It can't be denied that this is a complex situation whose resolution will extend far beyond the admittance of wrongdoings on both sides. However, it simply cannot stand that we continue to ignore the rulings of our international governing bodies when it comes to states that our government favors. At the very least, our country needs to acknowledge that Israel has a lot to account for in this conflict. Contemporarily we are setting a dangerous precedent. We are showing that it is okay to violate international law as long as you are, or have the backing of, a superpower. ?

2013-11-12,AU,Democrat,"AU’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity will live on food stamps as part of the SNAP Challenge between Nov. 11 and 15. 
Users of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is responsible for giving out food stamps, are given $4.50 a day to spend on food, according to AU’s Habitat for Humanity vice president Jessica Agostinelli, a junior in the School of International Service. 
SNAP benefits are given to people who fall at or below the poverty line. About 49 percent of SNAP benefits go to children 18 or younger, according to SNAP’s website. As of August 2011, 45.8 million people in the U.S. were using SNAP benefits, according to the website. 
SNAP benefits can be used to buy all food items, vitamins and medicine. SNAP does not include alcohol or tobacco products, according to the SNAP website. 
Agostinelli said she hopes this week will be an opportunity to draw attention to this issue. 
“It really relates to issues of homelessness and poverty throughout D.C.,” Agostinelli said. 
AU Democrats, The Homelessness Coalition and American Youth and Government are also participating in the challenge. All of the different groups will be tabling throughout the week to bring visibility to the cause, Agostinelli said.
The group decided to participate in the challenge after 26 members of Congress conducted a similar challenge in June after changes to the Farm Bill threatened to cut SNAP’s budget by over $20 billion in the next decade, according to an article in the Huffington Post published in June. 
Habitat for Humanity has worked to encourage more participation by publicizing the challenge on Facebook and sending out email blasts. 
“We would love for as many people as possible to participate,” Agostinelli said.
As far as the food they will eat, Agostinelli said she plans on eating a lot of granola bars. Sarah Washburn, a junior in the School of Public Affairs and secretary for AU’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity, said she will also keep her meals simple, eating mostly rice, beans and peanut butter sandwiches to emulate the type of meals a SNAP participant would eat. Typically the people on SNAP work multiple jobs and do not have time or energy to be creative with meals, Washburn said. 
“Most people can identify with this,” Agostinelli said. “Food scarcity is an issue for the country as a whole.”

2014-02-13,AU,Democrat,"D.C. mayoral candidates who participated in a debate at AU pose for a picture on Feb. 12.
Candidates for D.C. mayor took center stage to discuss issues such as adequate education, job growth and gentrification at a debate at Katzen Arts Center Feb. 12. The event was hosted by the Kennedy Political Union. 
D.C. Councilmembers Jack Evans (Ward 2), Tommy Wells (Ward 6) and Vincent Orange (Ward 5), as well as former State Department special representative and AU alumna Reta Jo Lewis, community activists Andy Shallal and Carlos Allen are vying for the Democratic Party nomination. The election is slated for April 1. 
As the candidates offered their vision for the city’s future, nearly all touched on the failed leadership of incumbent mayor Vincent Gray, who is currently facing allegations of running a “shadow campaign” that illegally funneled money for his 2010 mayoral campaign, according to an ABC report. 
“We’re distracted with so many other issues,” Shallal, the founder of Busboys and Poets, said. “The corruption, the shadow campaign and all these things, it’s really hard to focus on the issue of statehood.” 
Both Gray and Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser did not show up to the debate. Bowser had a community event and could not attend, a staffer said after the debate. 
Candidates sparred over a marijuana decriminalization bill that would transition possession from a criminal charge to a $25 civil fine for up to an ounce of marijuana while lowering public smoking sentences to just 65 days. 
Wells, who authored the bill, said approximately 90 percent of all marijuana-related arrests are of African-American men, a crime which may hinder their ability to find jobs or housing in the future. 
“Decrim is just the first step,” Wells said. “It’s a smart thing to do, it’s a matter of social justice, and that’s what we need to do.”
Orange said he believes the bill is flawed because it fails to address work drug testing and urged the council to reconsider. 
Evans also pledged his support for decriminalizing possession, but disagreed with Well’s efforts to decriminalize public smoking altogether.
“Most people we talk to just didn’t want to see that happen,” Evans said of public smoking. “I believe decriminalizing marijuana like we did is a step toward legalizing it.” 
Candidates also discussed how to better include college students in the fabric of the city. Both Lewis and Wells supported a loan-forgiveness program that would help retain young talent in the city after graduation.
“If you are out there being the activist you always have been, I want to make sure you have a path to go help our young people, go help our non-profits, go help our elderly,” Lewis said. “We should be assisting you as you assist the citizens of the District of Columbia.” 
As the city balances economic growth and preserving cultural heritage, nearly all candidates agreed that housing prices were too steep and threatened historic communities. The city has veered from its plan to expand affordable housing to tens of thousands of people, Orange said.
“We’re a $12 billion organization, we have $1.7 billion in our rainy day fund, we’re coming off a $320 million surplus, and we project a surplus for the next five years,” Orange said about D.C. government funds. “The money is there, take care and do the job we said that we were going to do.”

2014-08-12,AU,Democrat,"Current Political Communication students surround former SOC professor Dotty Lynch.
Dotty Lynch, a School of Communication executive in residence and prominent figure in the D.C. political scene, passed away early Sunday evening at a D.C. hospital.
The recently retired 69-year-old passed away after complications from melanoma, according to a Washington Post article. 
Lynch made an impact in Washington as one of the first pollsters to introduce the gender gap issue to political office hopefuls. In the mid 1980s, Lynch analyzed national politics as CBS News’ political editor, according to Lynch’s SOC faculty page.
After a career advising White House hopefuls, a Kennedy administration, surveying for the Democratic National Convention and working with CBS News, Lynch joined SOC’s faculty in 2006. Lynch merged politics and communication in the classroom and became instrumental in the creation of the SOC and School of Public Affairs masters in Public Communication program, Rose Ann Robertson, SOC’s associate dean for academic administration, said.
Robertson recognized how Lynch’s expertise and versatility became essential as a professor.
“Dotty was one of a kind,” Robertson said. “She was a journalist, a pollster, a political analyst and an extraordinary teacher. She conveyed to her students the excitement about the political process that she felt every day.”
Lynch’s passing was met with a Twitter outpouring in remembrance. Bob Schieffer, Diane Sawyer and Gwen Ifill were among the famous names that gave their condolences.
RIP Dotty Lynch, as smart as she was good as she was generous to all of us in and around politics. #wayfarertoast

“Her legacy was that she brought the outside in,” SOC professor Amy Eisman said. “At any given point somebody spectacular who was very much a key player in the political world would be at the end of her phone.”
Lynch retired in May with hopes of traveling around the world. Paris was at the top of her list for the summer, according to SOC Assistant Professor and Division Director Pallavi Kumar.
Lynch is survived by her husband, Morgan Downey, and stepson, Robert Downey.

2014-11-11,AU,Democrat,"I am not afraid of men. I am afraid of a lot of things—the dark, that parasite that crawls into your brain in hot springs, peacocks—but not men. I am a freshman in college in Washington, D.C., and I will admit that I walk by myself all the time and I am never afraid. I go places by myself at night that I definitely shouldn’t (don’t tell my parents), and I have never once felt unsafe. 
Recently I watched a documentary on rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo in my sociology class. I watched as women recounted being raped by groups of men, brutalized, sodomized with branches and the barrels of guns. These women often develop fistulas due to the tearing of their vaginal and uterine walls. They are left incontinent. Social pariahs unable to care for themselves and their children. In Congolese society, being raped is often a social death-sentence.  
I walked out of my class at 1:00 p.m. feeling ill. I needed to get off campus. My favorite pho truck was parked on 7th and G Street so I made my way to Chinatown. I got off the metro and headed towards a row of food trucks when suddenly a man grabbed me by the hand. His grasp was so firm that I thought he had broken my bone. 
“Hey, what’s your name?” he said.
“Hi...I’m sorry I have to go,” I managed to stumble out. 
I tried to keep walking but I was jerked back with force. He wouldn’t let go. He pulled me closer to him and put his other arm around my waist. He smelled like grease.
I started to panic. I was practically screaming, pleading with him to let me go but he was steadfast in his grip. About a hundred people were watching, but no one did anything.        I began to cry, he softened his hold on me for an instant and I bolted. I ran up to a group of businessmen and pretended to answer a phone call as my assailant calmly strode away. These men had seen what had happened but none of them said a word to me. 
In a daze, I ordered my beef pho and sat on the side steps of the National Portrait Gallery. Everyone was staring at me. They had all watched from their perch as one of the scariest moments of my life unfolded like it was some sort of Aeschylean drama, and now they watched me cry over a Styrofoam bowl of soup. I felt like some sort of modern Blanche DuBois facsimile, listless in high-waisted shorts and a striped sweater as my Stanley faded into the crowd. 
The reality is that I am considered “lucky.” I was not raped, I was not severely beaten and I have incurred no fistulas. My experience today was incredibly scary, but there will be no lasting damage. But does that make it okay? Is it acceptable that this man was allowed to walk right up to me and make me so afraid that I later cried and vomited in front of my favorite art exhibit? 
I am not afraid of men. I will continue to walk by myself whenever I damn well please. I will not be afraid of what’s lurking in the shadows. I am terrified, however, of anyone who says that he or she hates feminism. Anyone who thinks that women seeking to live in a world where being grabbed on the street isn’t considered “lucky” is some sort of an affront to men. Anyone who thinks that feminism is about women wanting to have their cake and eat it, too. Anyone who can deny that women disproportionately bear the brunt of poverty and conflict.   Anyone who can acknowledge that women face rape, genital mutilation and sexual humiliation as a product of war and still ask, “But what about men?” 
Equality is not a zero-sum game. By increasing the rights of women, nothing is taken away from the rights of men. By advocating for equal pay in this country and equal access to education in another, men do not suffer. The consequence of feminist success is not a militant-lesbian hegemony in which all bras are burned and men become untouchables. The consequence of feminist success is progress.

2016-01-12,AU,Democrat,"Vincent Gray (courtesy Gray 2014 campaign).

	If former mayor Vincent Gray runs for the D.C. Council this year, a new poll shows he has a strong shot at winning either the at-large or Ward 7 seats that are up for grabs.

	Thirty-two percent of Democratic primary voters citywide said they would vote for Gray, giving him a 12 percent lead over incumbent at-large Councilmember Vincent Orange. Further worrisome for Orange is that 4 in 10 residents responding in the same poll said they have an unfavorable opinion of him, with 28 percent favoring him.

	Meanwhile, if Gray runs in his home turf of Ward 7, he would beat incumbent and former political pal Yvette Alexander. The poll showed Gray currently holding 48 percent support, with Alexander at 32 percent. A third candidate, activist Ed Potillo, placed with 6 percent, and 14 percent of residents remained unsure.

	Supporters of Gray funded the poll through a political action committee headed by Gray’s 2014 campaign manager, Chuck Thies. The PAC raised $7,920, with all money raised going to expenses related to the poll, according to Thies, and is no longer accepting donations. The poll, conducted by the firm 
	Public Policy Polling, interviewed 1,569 likely Democratic primary voting Washingtonians between Jan. 5 and Jan. 7, according to a press release.



	Poll of citywide likely Democratic primary voters in potential at-large race.




	Poll of Ward 7 likely Democratic voters in potential ward race.

	The results are a sure boost to Gray, who has openly been 
	mulling a return to politics since the federal investigation into his successful 2010 mayoral campaign ended. That legal cloud hung over Gray’s entire mayoral term, and many say it led to his downfall in his reelection bid against current mayor Muriel Bowser in 2014.

	In December, U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips announced his office would close the nearly five-year long probe without charging the former mayor on allegations that he knew of an 
	illegal shadow campaign. Businessman Jeffrey Thompson pleaded guilty in March 2014 to secretly funnelling $653,000 to aid Gray’s campaign and said Gray knew about it. However, prosecutors were unable to bring a charge against the mayor proving he had such knowledge.

	In a statement following the U.S. Attorney’s decision on Dec. 10, 2015, Gray said, “Justice delayed is justice denied, but I cannot change history. I look forward to getting on with the next chapter of my life, which will no doubt be dedicated to service.”

2016-03-12,AU,Democrat,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a crowd of AU students, staff and international media in the School of International Service Atrium on Friday morning that young people need to challenge the status quo if they hope to see change in the world.
“[Current leaders] need you to be thinking and challenging us about why we’re doing this, why we’re doing that, why we’re not doing this, how we’re doing this differently, and that doesn’t just mean speaking up,” Trudeau said. “It also means getting involved. It also means understanding that your voices are an essential part of the mix to challenge us to think about your future.”
Trudeau’s stop at AU came as part of a larger trip to Washington D.C., the first by a Canadian Prime Minister in 19 years. Earlier during his visit, Trudeau spent time with President Barack Obama at the White House, attended a State Dinner studded with appearances by politicians, celebrities and entrepreneurs and paid respects at Arlington National Cemetery.
Since his election in October 2015, Trudeau has committed his time in office to implementing his liberal ideals in Canadian policy. Trudeau became the first Prime Minister to have gender parity in his Cabinet when he chose 13 men and 13 women to fill the roles. He is also well-known for labeling himself as a feminist and supporting his stance on the issue by saying, “Because it’s 2015,” last year.
“There are lots of extraordinary women standing up for women’s rights, but I need more men to do that. It’s fighting for rights, it’s fighting for equality, it’s fighting for basic respect, and I keep having to update this, but it’s 2016 guys,” Trudeau said at today’s event.
Additionally, Trudeau discussed his commitment to take action against climate change which he also shared with Obama during their meeting yesterday.
“That idea of giving up on economic progress to protect the environment no longer makes sense because the only way we’re going to build a strong, sustainable economy is by cherishing ecosystem services and natural resources that underpin everything else,” Trudeau said.
In light of the current election cycle occurring in the United States, Trudeau said he was not concerned about an influx of Americans immigrating to Canada should people disagree with the United States’s next president and said that he would be willing to work with the person ultimately elected. He also commented on Canada’s recent decision to end its role in bombing ISIS, choosing instead to send in ground troops to help civilians build the ability to support themselves. Trudeau said that this type of diplomacy work is essential to creating long-term security and is something Canada can offer.
During his speech, Trudeau also called for a greater appreciation for diversity and creating opportunities for all kinds of people to succeed as important to developing the economy. He said that in the past, many people’s careers had a linear trajectory, but that isn’t the case today.
“Right now the career paths that we’re going to have will jump around everywhere. I mean, it’s preposterous to think that a former snowboard instructor and nightclub bouncer could end up the Prime Minister of Canada,” Trudeau said, poking fun at his own path to becoming the Prime Minister. “But the experiences we accumulate along the way of multiple career paths and multiple engagements that define us and shape us as individuals and leaders are extremely important and extremely varied and that’s one of the really exciting things for me about this generation.”
Trudeau said that he built his campaign to office based on a pure idealization of what Canadian citizens hoped their government to be, including openness and cooperation, and he plans to keep his promises and maintain Canada’s relationship with the United States.
“People need to understand that the rights and freedoms that keep us free and democratic societies aren’t always easy, aren’t always sort of knee-jerk, adapted to how we’d like the world to be, but they are essential in terms of being the countries we are,” Trudeau said.

2016-08-09,AU,Democrat,"AU alum Sarah McBride speaks at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. 
This year’s Democratic National Convention was significant in more ways than one. Just hours before Hillary Clinton became the first woman to accept a major party’s nomination for president, AU alum Sarah McBride carved out her own place in history, becoming the first openly transgender person to speak at a national political convention on July 28. 
McBride’s journey to the convention stage included a term as SG president from 2011-2012. She credits her transition from Tim to Sarah, which she publicly announced in an Eagle op-ed at the end of her presidency, as the beginning of her life as her “authentic self.” Just over four years later, the Democratic LGBT Caucus honored the 25-year-old with a national platform to share her story -- an experience she called a “whirlwind.” 
“I was mostly nervous about making sure that I did the transgender community proud, that I did right by them,” McBride told the Eagle on the Monday following her speech. “Obviously, no one trans person is a reflection of an entire community, but I did hope that I represented them well.”
McBride said she aimed to accomplish two goals with her speech: humanize the transgender community and educate the public on “what it’s like to be transgender.” With just one week to prepare, McBride placed her personal story within the broader context of the election, urging viewers to support Clinton’s candidacy for president. 
“I wanted to make sure I underscored the humanity of this issue,” McBride said. “I think so often transgender people feel unseen and are treated as though they are unworthy and unvalued.”
McBride began her political career in Delaware. She worked on Gov. Jack Markell’s bid for governor and the late Beau Biden’s two campaigns for attorney general. At the time, she believed that her passion for politics and her gender identity were “mutually exclusive.” This made life as her “authentic self” incompatible with her dreams, something that quickly changed after she came out. 
“I think people so often think, ‘oh, well, no one wants to hear from me and my story’ or ‘my voice isn’t important,’’” McBride said on coming out at AU. “But it is, and it really can make a difference.”  
She later became the first transgender person to intern at the White House and graduated from the School of Public Affairs in 2013 with a degree in political science. The most emotional moment of her speech, however, wasn’t about her transition, her political career or her internship. It was McBride’s reflection on her marriage to Andrew Cray, a transgender man, in 2014. He died of a terminal illness five days after their wedding. Her Huffington Post essay chronicles her relationship with Cray -- one that she said fuels her advocacy for transgender equality.
“For me, his death really underscored the urgency of this fight,” McBride said. “There’s a whole host of unfinished work for trans people and for LGBTQ people.”
At the age of 25, her passion for politics and her gender identity has merged seamlessly into a nationally recognized persona. She told The Eagle that the media attention hasn’t stopped since the start of the convention -- something she’d never imagined possible just four years ago when she came out at AU.
“I think it has been a testament to how things have changed and the goodness of people that the response of those in the arena and from the audience at home has been overwhelmingly positive,” McBride said.  
McBride recently became the National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group in D.C. She’s working toward electing Hillary Clinton in November and believes that all universities, like AU, must implement non-discrimination protections to shield transgender students from prejudice.
“We need to push those [schools] forward so that no student fears discrimination or harassment or bullying simply because of who they are,” McBride said.

2016-08-10,AU,Democrat,"Krista Chavez (pictured left). 
In 2016, voters are using their relationships to swing the vote toward their own party. 
According to a new study by the Pew Research Center, few Clinton or Trump supporters look for friendships in the opposite party. Among registered-to-vote Trump supporters, only 4% have “a lot” of close friends supporting Clinton. This number is more dramatic in relation to registered-to-vote Clinton supporters, with only 2% saying they have “a lot” of close friends supporting Trump. Further, Trump supporters have a lot (44%) of friends supporting Trump, and some friends (38%) supporting him. 16% of Trump voters have “just a few” or “none” of their friends swinging for Clinton. The same goes for Clinton’s voters, with 31% saying they have no close friends who support the opposition.
The data tells us that people are less willing to build friendships with those who support different viewpoints. This explains the widespread polarization in media, pop culture, communities, and the United States as a whole. The age bracket of 18-29 -- Millennials, including college students -- reflects this isolated trend. With 58% of Clinton supporters saying none of their close friends support the other candidate, only 34% of Trump supporters say the same.
As I have different viewpoints than the majority of my peers on AU’s campus, these figures do not surprise me. Another study by Pew supports my feelings by reporting that 40% of Millennials ages 18-34 support the government censoring “offensive” speech. The data highlights the decline in acceptance of other views in America, and how alternative opinions are viewed on modern college campuses.
Examining this idea more in depth, OKCupid released a new study detailing how partisanship actually influences a person’s dating profile. Their research concluded that “the amount of OkCupid users who couldn’t date someone with opposing political views is at 50% — a number that’s been rising since 2008.” 
Apparently, voting even counts when seeking a proper life partner. Personally, this is not surprising. Most people seek a partner who holds their same values that can grow and thrive in a family. Therefore it is only logical that one chooses another to spread these values within the home.
The OKCupid study found that in dating profiles, liberals are likely to feature interests like “The Daily Show, Broad City, NPR, podcasts, and weed,” and conservatives are likely to use words like “Jesus, Faith, Country, and Guns.” Bipartisan overlaps for words include “INTP (a Meyers-Briggs personality type), Outlander, Indiana, iPhone, Adventure, Honesty, and Considerate.”
Examining these polls, both parties express different values that are not only attractive when voting, but also when choosing friends and partners. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is upsetting when a large portion of the U.S. youth population is wary to hear different viewpoints, unregulated speech, and expression. 
As a founding principle of the United States, free speech was intended to support minorities from the dictatorship of the majority. It appears that many millennials do not feel that way, especially when choosing friends and spouses.
At the end of the day, it is a good thing we can all agree: honesty and consideration are good characteristics for partners. But maybe appreciating our partners and friend groups’ differences can be just as valuable.

2016-09-13,AU,Democrat,"Last Thursday, Student Government launched the AU TurboVote campaign in an effort to register every student to vote in time for the general election in November.  
SG is relaunching its partnership with TurboVote, a national platform specifically aimed at young people with the goal of increasing their civic engagement. 
After signing up online, the TurboVote application provides individualized information and updates for upcoming elections, voter registration and absentee ballots.
“The AU TurboVote campaign is one of the most ambitious voter registration plans ever in a college across the country,” said Valeria Ojeda-Avitia, Director of the Kennedy Political Union and coordinator of AU TurboVote.
The campaign has 25 campus partners, including the Undergraduate Business Association, the Interfraternity Council and the Intercultural Greek Collective, with the intention to expand, according to Ojeda-Avitia. TurboVote is also committed to non-partisanship, and the campaign is collaborating with both the AU College Democrats and AU College Republicans. 
“Voting is one of the most important facets of being an American citizen, and AUCRs is proud to do its part in encouraging civic duty by participating,” President of AU College Republicans Tom Herbert said.
The campaign will be tabling on campus throughout September, with heightened campaign efforts expected on National Voter Registration Day, scheduled on Sept. 27. 
Individuals can access TurboVote online, and can also become an AU TurboVote Ambassador and help spread the message. Ambassadors work to register voters and visit AU clubs and Greek life organizations to help groups register, according to TurboVote Ambassador Yazan Hanouneh.
""I became a TurboVote ambassador to ensure that every AU student has the opportunity to vote even while they're far from home,” Hanouneh said. “Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or something else, it is important to be civically engaged and participate in the system of democracy that keeps our nation running. In the end, this work is worth it since we'll have a more representative government that all students will feel like they helped elect.""

2016-10-13,AU,Democrat,"This November, across all 50 states, Americans will vote for a candidate for president. These people have traveled all around America, spending money, time and effort to win your vote. Although they disagree on many issues, each organized candidates have kept their arguing to a respectful minimum, in an effort to focus on themselves and the issues. That’s right, this election year Americans will vote for Green Party presidential candidate, activist and Doctor Jill Stein and Libertarian Party presidential candidate and past New Mexico Governor, Gary Johnson!
  If you're like most Americans and don’t know who Johnson or Stein are, that’s perfectly okay. It's not your fault there has been a distinct lack of media coverage for these candidates. However, if you’re a political WONK or a third party supporter, then chances are you know exactly who they are.
  Throughout this election, I have been shamed for sharing which third party candidate I will be voting for. The problem is that most of the shaming does not have to do with my candidate’s ideals or policies, but rather it is due to the fact that they are running for office to begin with. Although it may be evident on my online social media, offline and in person I have tried to keep my opinions to myself. 
However, friends, family and some professors have personally called me out and told me that my vote is either wasted, or indirectly supporting the candidate they dislike. Both Trump and Clinton supporters have used the same argument, saying that by not supporting their candidate that third party voters are supporting the candidate they specifically hate. While hate is a strong word, it seems appropriate to describe this election cycle.
  It’s understandable for voters to vote for a candidate they believe to be the lesser of two evils, however, that said, voting for a candidate that someone believes in is definitely something that should be pondered first. For me, along with many other Americans, voting third party is an investment in the future. Although the odds are heavily stacked against us, voting was never supposed to be about supporting a winner, but about actively organizing and supporting our ideals.
  The argument has been made that voting third party is a privilege. So far voting Democrat on American University’s campus seems like a privilege, with a heavily liberal leaning voice. Although third party voters would like to be accepted, many are instead shamed online and on campus. The same shaming can probably be seen at the many heavily conservative colleges in America. The fact that voting itself is looked at as a privilege is undemocratic. Many who perpetuate the argument usually cite race or economic inequality as a reason to vote for their candidate, saying that their nominee is the only chance in saving people of color or those from poor backgrounds. 
However, when looking at Clinton and Trump’s records and policies, both seem to care very little about both people of color and those from a low economic status. Both have supported the war in Iraq and increasing military intervention across the Middle East. Trump advocates for waterboarding, deporting and a downpour of bombing across the Middle East. 
Clinton hasn’t really touched upon her plans for the Middle East during the campaign, however, she has shown them extensively during her time as Secretary of State through helping to tear apart the Middle East and causing destabilization in countries such as Libya and Syria, thus giving rise to ISIS and fueling the refugee crisis. Clinton even approved drone strikes, which continue to kill many innocent bystanders, via her smartphone. 
Another country affected close to home is Honduras. Taking into account both Trump and Clinton’s records and views, it seems that privilege would be voting for either two party candidates, and turning a blind eye to the awful and violent policies they have and will continue to support. Although both Johnson and Stein have struggled extensively sharing their knowledge of foreign policy, both have actively supported anti military intervention.
  According to Real Clear Politics, evaluating the polls of Fox New, NBC, Bloomberg and 10 other well-known news sources, around 10 percent of Americans will be voting for either Stein or Johnson this election year. Last week both candidates were left out of the debate, due to a lack for either being able to achieve a 15 percent polling average from three major news organizations, something that even Clinton supporter Sen. Bernie Sanders said was too high. In effect, 10 percent of the nation was silenced during both presidential debates, which is run by both Republicans and Democrats.
  This election I have made my choice for which candidate I will be voting for. It’s perfectly fine to vote for Trump or Clinton this election if you want. However voting for either Jill Stein or Garry Johnson is not a wasted vote, protest or a privileged vote. This election does not just regard the presidency, but includes many local public offices. Voting on a local level for third party candidates or independents should not be discouraged as well. Picking on third party candidates is a petty and last minute act of desperation that both parties are trying force on the American public, and needs to stop. 
Purely pressuring people into voting for your candidate only annoys them, and doesn't change anybody's mind. If you want to convince someone to vote for your candidate then do it with respect. Find a common ground and refrain from name calling. That being said, here are links attached to both Dr. Jill Stein and Gov. Gary Johnson’s campaign sites, if you would like to learn more.

2017-01-11,AU,Democrat,"This article originally appeared in The Eagle’s December 9 print edition.
Looking back on this election, it has been a rough year and a half to be a Republican woman. Facing ridicule from every side, listening to your party’s nominee criticize women and trying to choose between compromising your values and voting for necessary change at the ballot box was maddening.
However, it is over now. The next President of the United States will be Donald Trump, and it is time for the nation to face that reality and move forward with a positive agenda for change.
Although I did not vote for or support Donald Trump during his presidential run, I wish him the best in office and I truly hope he governs well. Praying for his failure at this point does not hurt his reputation, but the American people as a whole. That is why we must be cautiously optimistic: we must support him and guide him on a path toward righteousness while at the same time be willing to criticize his administration when necessary.
Further, President-elect Trump will be complemented by both a Republican House and Senate, not to mention 33 Republican governors, 26 states under the control of both GOP executive and legislative branches and six state legislatures controlled by Republicans with Democratic governors. This is the GOP’s moment, and the party must deliver if it wants to maintain and grow party support in 2018 and 2020.
To do this, I recommend the following conservative policy proposals to limit government power, control spending, cut government waste and prove that success can be achieved under a Republican government.
Step 1: Reform the criminal justice system
One of the most corrupt institutions in American government is the criminal justice system. It is designed to over-incarcerate low-level, nonviolent offenders. Upon leaving prison, these offenders cannot successfully find a job due to their criminal records and become dependent on less-than-legal means to make ends meet. Often, they are reincarcerated and enter a viscous cycle known as “recidivism.” 
This issue disproportionately impacts minority groups, and it must be stopped. Moreover, the entire system costs a tremendous amount of unnecessary tax dollars (an additional $42 million in 2017 from FY2016) and needs to be consolidated and reformed immediately. To address these issues, a bi-partisan coalition of representatives has already proposed several bills to reform them.
Another way to improve the criminal justice system would be to expand programs that assist ex-felons in finding jobs after leaving prison. Companies like Apple, Hilton Hotels and Chick-fil-A hire returning citizens to begin reintegrating former felons into society. By using public-private partnerships with these and other companies and vocational organizations, the government can prevent the cycle of incarceration from continuing to plague our system, destroy the family and consume our tax dollars. 
Step 2: Simplify the tax code and loosen ridiculous regulations
There are areas in Trump’s tax proposal where taxes among certain higher-level income groups will be higher than under Clinton’s plan, according to the Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a center-left tax policy group. This is significant because Clinton claimed she would use taxes to crack down on the upper class.
Scholar Leonard Burman notes, “Trump’s 33 percent top rate kicks in at a fairly low income level for singles: $127,500 in 2017.” The Trump tax plan could generate more levels of revenue. It would remove personal exemptions and tax breaks which would consolidate the current 74,608-page-long federal code, making it more fair. If he implements this plan, it will cut the burden of taxpayers while not letting off the wealthier economic groups from contributing a sizable amount of income in taxes. 
It would also consolidate and simplify the tax code. By simplifying the code, this would allow Americans to better understand how the federal government collects tax dollars. If Trump goes through with implementing this plan, it would save Americans a lot of time, money and headaches trying to understand all the loopholes and tax breaks in the system of which big businesses take advantage.
Step 3: Create an environment inclusive to all Americans
Often, the political left claims that the GOP is waging a “war on women.” However, 42 percent of Donald Trump’s voters were women, especially college-educated white women, 49 percent of which voted for the billionaire. This happened despite Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emphasis on Trump’s history of bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monumental question is why these women still voted for him, and unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll have an answer until we actually ask these voters. Usually, these types of allegations kill political careers, such as was the case with Anthony Weiner. And yet, it has not derailed Trump.
The GOP needs to emphasize the benefits of limited government for minorities. While protections are necessary to ensure that discrimination is prevented, all people can be most empowered by freedom, not the state. The GOP has this platform, but it does not use it. To better project this ideal, Republicans should be more open to comprehensive immigration reform that opens the door to increasing legal immigration. Further, women could greatly benefit from voluntary Personal Care Accounts that encourage financial saving for leave time. Pre-tax dollars would be saved in this PCA, and it would be used to replace or supplement income during periods of leave. This would help the problem of paid leave or medical issues. Women and minorities in the GOP also need to be louder and prouder, stand up in the name of limited government and run for office.
Although I remain cautiously optimistic, I truly hope that the Trump administration is successful in its endeavors-not just for Republicans, but for all Americans. If he fails, we will all have to live with the consequences.

2017-03-10,AU,Democrat,"Former Sen. Russ Feingold and SIS Dean James Goldgeier in an interview entitled “The Undermining of the Legitimacy of the American Government"" on March 1. 
Students and faculty came together in the Abramson Family Founders Room where SIS Dean James Goldgeier welcomed special guest, former Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, as part of the Dean’s Discussion series on March 1. Each semester, Dean Goldgeier invites an expert to campus so they can have a one-on-one interview discussing critical topics relating to international affairs. 
Senator Feingold was a Democratic senator for 18 years. He is most well known for having a strong code of ethics and for being vocal on sensitive issues, at times when other senators were working in opposition to his views. He was the only senator who voted against the PATRIOT Act when it was first proposed in 2001. 
Feingold recently joined the AU community as a distinguished executive in residence. In this role he will teach a series of spring courses in a SIS skills institute, which is meant to introduce students more to the professional world of international service. His course is titled “Diplomatic Challenges and Skills: Case Study—Great Lakes Region of Africa,” and it regards conflicts that occurred throughout the past two decades within the African Great Lake Region, as well as Feingold's own unique perspective regarding American International Affairs with the region. 
The title of the Dean’s discussion was “The Undermining of the Legitimacy of the American Government.” The format of the talk included a 30-minute interview between Goldgeier and Feingold, followed by a half-hour of open questions from the students to Feingold.
Goldgeier began the interview by asking Feingold about what he had tried to do for Wisconsin in his almost two decades as its representative. 
“I've made a career as a senator going to all 72 counties in the state every year and having a town meeting,” Feingold said. “I want to talk to everyone, whether the county has just 4,000 people, or many times more.” 
Following this, Goldgeier asked Feingold what he foresees political campaigns will look like in the future and what problems he has seen arise after the most recent election season, regarding flaws in the voting system itself, and flaws regarding the legality of certain campaigning measured.
The senator said there are four main areas of campaigning that need huge reform: the right to vote, campaign finance, the electoral college and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“An institution of massive concern is the electoral college,” he said, “Two out of the last three presidents didn't win nearly enough votes to get elected but they kept the position anyways.”
After discussing the parts of campaigns that were troubling to him, the senator and the dean talked about the recent presidential election.
“Trump is a big problem,” Feingold said. “The attack of his on the media is really disturbing. We have to protect these institutions. When the president of the United States says the press, the media, is the enemy of people, we have to draw the line.”
Following the interview, many students lined up to ask questions. One question came from Alex de Ramon, a freshman in SIS, who asked Feingold about the path the Democrats should take in the 2018 and 2020 election.
“The hardcore direct talk of Trump appealed to some people,” Feingold said. “I just don't how some people could vote for him after some of the stuff that he has said. Going forward, I think that it would be a huge mistake for the Democrats to try to be a middle party. We need to make a strong message about our democracy.”

2017-03-11,AU,Democrat,"Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., addresses students at an event co-sponsored by the Kennedy Political Union and AU College Democrats.
At 70-years-old, African-American Congresswoman Barbara Lee still hopes to “save the world.” The representative of the 13th district in California spoke in honor of Women’s History Month on Thursday night at an event arranged by AU College Democrats and the Kennedy Political Union. 
Lee was born in a segregated city, El Paso, Texas, in 1946. She said she remembers the days when abortions weren’t safe or legal, and when white people wouldn’t sell or rent homes to black people.
Lee, however, was not always politically active. As a young woman, she refused to register to vote.
“I said no, I’m a revolutionary,” Lee said.
Lee enrolled in Mills College with two small children, on public assistance, to study social work. As a community worker with the Black Panther caucus, Lee invited Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to congress, to speak. Chisholm, dismayed by Lee’s skepticism, urged her to “bring a folding chair to the table,” and register to vote.
“She said no, you’ve gotta get on the inside,” Lee said, who went on to work for Chisholm’s historic presidential campaign in 1972.
Lee attributes her strength to her “very modest, very matter of factly,” activist mother -- the first of twelve students integrated into the University of Texas at El Paso.
“She said… don’t you dare think you’re not as good as another guy,” Lee said. “You’d better fight to let them know you’re here to stay.”
Congresswoman Lee arrived an hour late to the event because she was held up by a vote in the House of Representatives.
“This is what happens on Capitol Hill: you get late votes,” Lee said. “Thank goodness we got out!”
Most students waited the extra hour, eager to hear the congresswoman speak.
“If everyone was more like Lee, the world would be a better place,” AU senior Nick Guthman said.
Lee advised students to follow their conscience, and to know their “bottom line.”
For Lee, that’s war. She made a name for herself as the sole representative to vote against the Iraq War in 2001. Lee has continued to rally against war to this day.  
Sophomore Shaan Chilukuri pointed to Lee’s pattern of voting against the status quo, like the Patriot Act of 2001, as proof of her “anti-establishment, trailblazing” political style. 
“The military has enough money,” Lee said. “They’re wasting it. They want more funds to take it away from schools and education to build more missiles and more bombs. That’s not how you create world peace.”
Lee has also co-sponsored legislation to create a U.S. Department of Peace. The legislation, which has accrued 30 co-sponsors, would examine alternatives to war and violence.
“We have a Department of War, why not have a Department of Peace?” Lee said. 
In terms of the new administration, Lee was irate. She dismissed Paul Ryan’s knowledge of healthcare and criticized President Donald Trump’s plan to cut foreign aid by 36 percent. 
“I see what this Trump administration is doing, trying to roll back all of the gains that my mother and my grandfather and my ancestors fought for,” Lee said. “We’re not gonna let that happen.”

2017-05-09,AU,Democrat,"AU alumna and Peace Corps volunteer Katherin Sibel with students in Paraguay.
AU alumna Katherin Sibel spends her days speaking Guarani, the national language of Paraguay. That’s where she’s stationed as a Peace Corps volunteer, managing several women’s agribusiness projects and social development programs within the Latin American community. 
In February, the Peace Corps named AU a top provider of volunteers from medium-sized schools. Sibel, who graduated from the School of International Service in 2015, is one of 54 from AU serving in the Peace Corps right now.
In fact, AU has indoctrinated Peace Corps’ mission within the classroom since the early 1960s, and continues to do so today.
“As a volunteer, I find myself doing various activities throughout the weeks with different peoples and groups in the community,” Sibel said in an email. “This ranges from planting in gardens and farms, trash cleanups, teaching English and other skills needed with Paraguayans of all ages.”
Twenty-two of the 54 representing AU are education volunteers, and 13 are health volunteers, Emily Webb, Public Affairs Specialist at Peace Corps, said in an email. Others are serving as agriculture, youth development, or community and economic development volunteers. 
Revisiting a focus on undergraduates
Although AU has historically produced high numbers of Peace Corps volunteers, in February 2016, without a clear explanation as to why, Peace Corps decided to end its master’s international degree program, which AU offered through SIS. 
Numerous undergraduates have asked Stephen Angelsmith, Director of Peace Corps Programs at SIS, over his five years with AU about how they can get involved as a volunteer.
Over the last two years, the Peace Corps and SIS developed a new certificate program, the Peace Corps Prep, to give undergraduates a pathway to the Peace Corps, Angelsmith said. 
“The new certificate program is a series of courses, that at the end of graduation, you will also earn a Peace Corps Prep certificate,” Angelsmith said. “It’s a social organization to prepare students for international service.” 
Twelve undergraduate SIS students started the certificate program in February, while about 35 students applied. Ideally, the students should apply at the beginning of their sophomore year. However, all grade levels are encouraged to apply since much of the course work in SIS already crosses over into the certificate’s requirements, Angelsmith said.
Having the certificate is not a guarantee for acceptance into the organization, but going through the series of courses at SIS will greatly improve a student’s chance for being accepted, Webb said.
Angelsmith, who served in Turkmenistan 10 years ago and is now a returned volunteer, said the certificate is a shared experience of coursework and service. Furthermore, the new curriculum provides SIS undergraduates with professional skills and intercultural competencies to possibly join the Peace Corps after graduation, Angelsmith said.
Designed for SIS undergraduate students, he said the certificate will broaden students’ education and experience so that they may implant creative, individual development projects across the globe. 
Opposing opinions 
However, not all faculty and students are fond of the Peace Corps.
AU Professor Daniel Esser said that he and many of his students have mixed opinions about the usefulness of the program. Some see value in the grassroots approach of the Peace Corps’ mission, while others see the Peace Corps as more beneficial to the volunteer than the host country, he said.
For that, Esser agrees.  
Esser said that he’s seen little evidence that Peace Corps volunteers substantially help with development efforts for other countries. By design, the program is not at all sustainable, he said, because the volunteer arrives, works on a project, and then leaves. There may be exceptions, but not much, he said. 
“The stereotypical volunteer is a Democrat, middle-class white person,” he said. “And at twenty-two years old, we’re sending fairly skill-less volunteers.” 
Angelsmith said he is aware of what dissenters say about sending over wealthier volunteers, as opposed to those in lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Since the Peace Corps is unpaid, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may not be able to volunteer, or feel as though they have access to the program, Angelsmith said, because of the loss of income over two years. 
However, he said the Peace Corps offers benefits that fray the costs of being away from home. 
“Peace Corps volunteers are not being paid a salary at home, but you have health insurance and student loans can be deferred,” he said. “The Peace Corps pays for everything while you are volunteering.”
Another aspect for future volunteers to consider is how much time they are away from family and friends, Angelsmith said. 
Sibel, who will be closing service on Dec. 7 of this year, said that social media has helped her stay connected with family and friends at home, if internet service is available.
Her advice for new Peace Corps volunteers is to take full advantage of being immersed in a new culture and country. 
“When you first get into your site, enjoy making connections for the first few months or year,” Sibel said. “Get to know the people, and get into the language, culture, and community vibe. The more vulnerable you are in sharing with the community that is hosting you, the more at home you will feel.”

2017-07-10,AU,Democrat,"Valentina Fernández, student trustee, Neil Kerwin, former University president, and Shyheim Snead, former student trustee. 
Rising junior Valentina Fernández is sitting in a conference room inside the President’s Office Building, awaiting the next Board of Trustees meeting. Although she is surrounded by influential university donors and decision makers, she doesn’t shy away from sharing her ideas and upholds herself with the professionalism she learned from being a student government senator.
As the first Latinx student trustee, Fernández is determined to make her voice heard on behalf of the student body.
“I couldn’t believe that I got the position, honestly,” Fernández said. “I knew it was something I wanted and felt prepared, but there was still that sense of, ‘Am I qualified enough to do this?’”
Fernández is the first Latinx student trustee on the University’s board of trustees, a position she assumed on May 18. She brings to the role stints as vice president of AU College Democrats and financial services director under former SG President Devontae Torriente, and plans to bring new insight into the role from her previous experience in AUSG and AU College Democrats.
She decided to get involved with the Board of Trustees last year after she reached out to Shyheim Snead, the previous student trustee. He told her about his experiences on the Board, such as interviewing candidates for the 15th University president and educating the campus on how the Board of Trustees functions. 
Fernández soon realized that their interests aligned and she felt that this position would be a perfect fit for her.
“The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this is the place for me,” Fernández said. “I think it was a good way to combine my knowledge of campus culture and my involvement that I had learned from other leadership roles into helping the university in the long term.”
Snead then became Fernández’s mentor, teaching her about how the University functions and watching board meetings on the major issues that the AU community faces. Serving a student trustee is a two-year commitment: Fernández spent the past year shadowing Snead before assuming the role herself on May 18. 
Fernández said his influence set the standard for how to behave on the Board and how to speak with eloquence on behalf of students.  He also showed her that the position is much different from a student government role in that although she speaks on behalf of students, she also has to think about the University’s best interests from the administration’s perspective.
Snead said he was fortunate to have mentored Fernández and appreciated her hard work and dedication. 
“Valentina brought with her a host of on campus experiences and connections that have informed her views and will undoubtedly serve her well in the boardroom,” Snead said in an email.
Upon becoming student trustee, Fernández said she worried that she wasn’t qualified enough to work with the influential alumni, donors and CEOs on the Board, but to her surprise, they made her feel welcome and took her ideas seriously. 
“I think that once I stepped foot into the position, I was really overwhelmed but surprised at the same time because I think it was the first time that I was exposed to a room of that many influential people,” Fernández said.
As student trustee, she plans to facilitate more discussions between students and the Board. She believes that by using social media to promote Board activities, hosting coffee talks with student leaders and notifying students when trustees are on campus, she can make the position more transparent and increase communication between students and the administration.
“I think there’s a big disconnect about what students think the Board is doing and what the Board thinks students are doing, and that’s where a bunch of miscommunication happens,” Fernández said. “I think when students have someone that represents them on the Board, they are more willing to listen to what’s going on and understand how things are being broken down.”
As the first Latinx person to assume the position, Fernández plans to contribute ideas from her personal experiences to the Board. Fernández said race has become the largest issue on campus, following a series of racist incidents targeting black women last September and again in May.
She believes that it is her responsibility to offer new ideas that would not have been included if she wasn’t a Latinx person. 
“When my identity comes into play, what can I contribute to the conversations that are happening?” Fernández said. “When can I speak up, especially when it comes to conversations on race?”
Snead, who is African-American, is confident that Fernández will represent her community while heightening the accessibility of the role.
“It is my hope and confidence that she will work to strengthen the bridge between students and the Board of Trustees, both in terms of transparency, information and accessibility,” Snead said.

2017-09-12,AU,Democrat,"Activist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai will speak at AU on Sept. 25 in Bender Arena. 
The Kennedy Political Union has named Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist, the 2017 Wonk of the Year. She will speak in Bender Arena on  Sept. 25, beginning at 8:15 p.m., according to a KPU press release.
Yousafzai is from northern Pakistan and was shot by the Taliban when she was 15 years old while coming home from school. Once she recovered, she traveled the globe as an advocate for girls’ education. 
She was named one of “The 100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine and released her best-selling book, “I Am Malala"" in 2013. In 2014, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.
“Malala is internationally known for her courage and advancing the right of everyone to receive an education,” Shyheim Snead, director of Kennedy Political Union, said in a statement. “She is one of the most inspirational and influential leaders of our generation and embodies the integrity and values that the community aims to achieve.”
KPU will offer free tickets for students on Eventbrite at the following times:
The event, which is co-sponsored by the Muslim Student Association and Women's Initiative, will be presented and moderated by University President Sylvia Burwell. Yousafzai is the fifth recipient of the Wonk of the Year award, with former Democratic National Convention chairwoman Donna Brazile taking the prize in 2016. 
Wonk of the Year is given to someone who demonstrates ""engagement, focus, intelligence and passion,"" according to the KPU release. The event was pushed back to the fall semester after KPU faced scheduling conflicts in April. 
“It is truly an honor to host Malala Yousafzai on our campus,” Burwell said in a statement. “She’s an incredibly brave individual with demonstrated commitment to meaningful change … The AU community is excited to celebrate her courageous and remarkable story.”

2018-08-13,AU,Democrat,"Student protesters march toward the Department of Homeland Security to protest a Trump speech on immigration on Jan. 25, 2017. 
American University ranks as the university with the most politically active students, according to Princeton Review’s yearly rankings.  
Princeton Review, a college admission services company, ranked the university as No. 1 in the category, based on student ratings of their own levels of political awareness, according to the organization’s website. Last year, AU ranked as No. 4 in the category, Washingtonian reports.
AU also ranked in other categories of the review, including “Most Active Student Government,” “Nobody Plays Intramural Sports,” “Financial Aid Not So Great” and “College City Gets High Marks.”
For more than a decade, George Washington University ranked on the most politically active list, ranking as No.1 for four consecutive years, according to the GW Hatchet. But this year, the school dropped off the list.
Campus political organizations, including AU College Democrats and Student Government, shared their excitement with the Eagle on the new title. 
“Like most students, we're extremely proud of AU being ranked the #1 politically active school,” AU College Democrats said in a statement. “With [the] 2018 Midterms around the corner, we can't wait to get started to tap into all the political excitement on campus and get students engaged with campaigns across the country through our phone banking and canvassing efforts.”
Alex Behle, the current student government secretary, told The Eagle he wasn’t surprised the University ranked high for politically active students. 
“AU students are setting an example for how to not only engage locally, but to effectively advocate for issues facing communities across the globe,” Behle said. “This ranking affirms what every AU student already knows—our campus is leading the nation in creating purposeful change. We’re proud to see AU stand among the most elite universities in the nation.”

2018-09-11,AU,Democrat,"Fact PAC is working to give candidates the information they need to succeed.
In response to what he sees as mounting frustration to the political climate and administration of President Donald Trump, senior Noah Levy decided to take action by starting Fact PAC, a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates across the nation. 
“I would be taught throughout university that the far right is rising worldwide and it’s kind of like, what can we do?” Levy said. “Meanwhile, I’m in an environment where most of my friends, they post articles on Facebook and they get angry at the Trump administration and that’s all you can do. So I was just very inspired by kind of using my anger and putting it into action.”
Fact PAC works to provide free database and behavioral scientific consulting to Democrats nationwide who cannot afford it, Levy said. The organization, which is operated remotely online, compiles data on precincts and districts most relevant to a candidate and analyzes it for their use. Fact PAC obtains the data from that state’s Secretary of State’s website, he said. 
“We show historical voter data on the aggregates of all these precincts in their district within the past few election cycles for things like the numbers on Democratic voter turnout, Republican voter turnout, the amount of registered people in both parties,” Levy said. 
The group shows the concentration of voters geographically by creating heat maps, he added, calling it “a really important insight to provide to candidates.”
When it came to the process of starting a political action committee, Levy said he found that a good deal of thorough research and reading was required. However, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) makes it very easy to start a political action committee, he said. 
Fact PAC’s decision to work on a volunteer basis also made the process easier. The FEC’s website has forms to start a political action committee, which can be filled out and submitted electronically. They are vetted and approved every two to three business days, according to the site. 
The organization is operated by a staff of seven people, comprised of Levy, AU student Sarah Duval, four Cornell University students, and a treasurer who is not affiliated with a university. 
Fact PAC currently has nine partner campaigns, one of which is Brittany Dement, a mayoral candidate in Auburn, Alabama. 
“City politics is something I’ve always wanted to get my feet wet in,” Levy said. “I know how personal it can be for people and I know how much power someone who’s the mayor could have.”
Getting leaders such as Dement elected is the central goal for Levy’s organization. He encourages students to put themselves out there and fight to elect the right candidates. 
“I believe in better leadership by better decision-making as opposed to a strict platform of beliefs because I think the world is constantly changing,” Levy said. “If you really want to get something you just have to be willing to send that message, or send that email.”

2019-03-08,AU,Democrat,"John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate, has been named the 2019 Wonk of the Year, the Kennedy Political Union announced today. 
The politician will speak to students about the future of the U.S. and bipartisanship on March 21 in Bender Arena at 7 p.m.
Kasich began his career in 1978 as a state senator and later became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, notably serving 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee.
After leaving Congress in 2000, Kasich returned to politics in 2010 when he ran for governor of Ohio. He served two terms in the office before leaving the governor’s mansion in January. He is currently a senior political commentator for CNN.
In 2016, Kasich became a household name when he ran for the Republican nomination for president. Kasich “presented himself as a moderate alternative to front-running candidates,” KPU wrote in its press release. During his presidential run, he received the Republican endorsement from The New York Times but ultimately did not have the votes to beat Donald Trump, the party’s eventual nominee. 
“With a perspective unique to a public servant experienced in both the public and private sector, leadership on all levels of government, and work with major media organizations, Kasich will bring thoughtful discussion to American University on the topic of bipartisan solutions and the future of American politics,” KPU wrote in its press release. 
While many analysts place Kasich in the moderate wing of the party due to his views on immigration and other issues, critics have noted Kasich’s conservative record on abortion rights, same-sex marriage and cuts to public education, among other actions. 
Kasich once strongly opposed same-sex marriage, but following the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal in all U.S. states in 2015, he said the country needed to accept the decision and “move on.”
According to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Kasich signed 17 anti-abortion measures into law between 2011 and 2016. Those measures defunded Planned Parenthood and banned abortions from public hospitals as well as from receiving public funds. Ohio Right to Life has credited Kasich for the decline in abortions in the state.
The University has recently introduced initiatives promoting bipartisanship, including the launch of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics last fall. The institute, which is focused on creating bipartisan policy solutions, launched with a September event featuring former Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee). 
Previous Wonk of the Year recipients include Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist Malala Yousafzai, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, former First Lady Laura Bush and former President Bill Clinton.
The event, co-hosted with AU College Republicans, will require an Eventbrite ticket and valid AUID for students, faculty and staff. Doors will open at 6:20 p.m.

2019-04-13,AU,Democrat,"On March 26, the Trump administration released a statement saying it would further expand the Mexico City Policy, otherwise known as the Global Gag Rule (GGR). This is a policy that cuts U.S. funding from non-governmental organizations (NGO)s to hinder their ability to use any funding towards abortion as a family planning service overseas. The GGR feeds into health inequities, prevents non-profit organizations from serving the communities they work in and places the lives of millions in danger. 
This is the second time the Trump Administration has expanded the GGR. Although the GGR was originally imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it initially only restricted NGOs from using U.S. funds for abortion services. In 2017, Trump announced that the GGR would cut U.S. funding for NGOs that used their own money and funding not provided by the U.S. for family planning services. On March 26, Mike Pompeo declared another expansion of the GGR, one that entails cutting funding from NGOs that provide non-U.S. funding to other organizations that “support or promote abortion” as a family planning service. This is all in an effort to end all “backdoor funding schemes.”
Secretary Pompeo and the Trump administration have used family planning as a political issue to retain the support of anti-abortion groups and individuals. What Pompeo and the Trump administration won’t mention is that they have also decided to cut funding for other health issues including HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Zika, tuberculosis and nutrition programs. Despite how the Trump administration wants to frame it, access to family planning services is a health issue. 
According to Advocates for Youth, the NGOs that are on the ground can’t decide whether or not to provide necessary treatments with every coming administration. The information simply doesn’t reach them in time. Thus, even when the GGR isn’t in place, the NGOs are operating like it is. The direct impact of this policy causes NGOs to stall the programs they have running, lose donations of valuable materials (including condoms and contraceptives) and lose the ability to expand their HIV prevention and treatment services to better serve the communities they work in. As Sen. Jeanne Shaheen,D-N.H., said, ""Further expanding the global gag rule puts international organizations in an impossible position: provide women the full scope of reproductive health care services or deny critical funding that saves lives. That is unconscionable.""
Women’s rights are human rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are human rights. Access to healthcare is a human right. Now more than ever, it’s imperative that we stand up to the Trump administration and use our voices as the catalysts for this movement. You may not think you can make a difference because of your age. I urge you to hold strong because, when young people set their minds to something, the results are monumental. Our voices are heard, laws are reformed and societal change happens. From the student-led sit-ins of the civil rights movement to Malala Yousafzai's international contributions to girl’s education, history has shown us that youth activism is a powerful force. So, I  urge you to call your local representatives and senators, visit them on the Hill, and push them to pass the Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights (H.E.R.) Act.
With the H.E.R. Act, we would indefinitely repeal the GGR. Through the GGR, the U.S. and the Trump Administration are constraining the ability of NGOs to use their own money for their family planning services and their ability to monetarily contribute to other organizations. At a time when progress on HIV and AIDS has halted, it is imperative that Congress work together to pass the Global H.E.R. Act. The Global H.E.R. Act is a bipartisan and bicameral initiative, garnering support from Democrats and Republicans alike. It was recently reintroduced to Congress by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Nita Lowey and has received support from Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. 
Let Congress know that we will not sit idly by as millions are denied the care they need. Infringement on the rights of the few is infringement on the rights of all. Let them know that young people’s voices matter. They say AU is one of the most politically active campuses in the country, so let’s act like it.

2019-05-02,AU,Democrat,"A new workers’ rights organization at AU launched in January with the goal of spreading awareness of workers’ rights activism taking place across Washington and at AU.
The Works AU, founded and led by Residence Hall Association chief of staff Tom Lebert, seeks to promote workers’ rights activism by AU students by directing them to events around the city. 
“One of the things that I wanted to alleviate was activists on campus not knowing about [protests and events, and] not having an open platform for this type of information,” Lebert said. “I wanted to create that.”
The Works AU primarily operates through its social media accounts and newsletter, through which it recaps the latest legislative trends and shares links to local activist events. While based at AU, Lebert said that given the intangibility of some of the groups’ actions, his group’s focus is on the broad issue of workers’ rights and even includes national legislation.
AU students have a long history of workers’ rights activism, with the Student Worker Alliance leading numerous efforts to protect Aramark workers on AU’s campus under alum Carlos Mark Vera’s leadership.
Vera was able to mobilize students around the #ExploitedWonk campaign, culminating in an April 2016 rally outside Letts and Anderson Halls. But, following Vera’s graduation, the movement has not been as prominent in student life. The Student Worker Alliance, which did not respond to a request for comment, has not been active on social media since early 2018, leaving the University without a dedicated student group for workers’ rights.
The controversial firing of Aramark employee Anthony Randolph in September, reported on by The Eagle, brought renewed interest toward workers’ rights. Randolph was later reinstated to his position at AU. 
“I think one of the issues that we have is that there wasn't like a very coordinated campaign to protect Anthony's rights,” said sophomore Sam Sherwood, one of The Works AU’s original team members. “We might not have had as big of an impact as we could have had if we had a more coordinated organization.”
Sherwood said he believes that the group, despite its broader focus, could help develop an interest in workers’ rights on campus.The issue re-emerged during the recent Student Government executive board elections, when candidates spoke about the importance of rehiring workers under a new food provider and preserving their pensions. 
To further student interest in the cause, The Works AU recently held its first event on campus in coordination with AU College Democrats on April 8, at which about 30 attendees were invited to write letters to their representatives about three workers’ rights-related bills related to family medical leave and the gender pay gap. 
“The idea for an event like this came about during the government shutdown,” Lebert said. “One of the first things that we got involved with was sharing action and events protesting the government shutdown.”
While attendees were eager to write their letters, awareness of the organization remains low. 
“I'm very passionate about AU College Democrats,” said freshman Katia Portela at the event, who said she had not heard of the group until that evening. “I am particularly passionate about workers’ rights after Anthony Randolph.”
His Lebert said that for now, his group is focused on local D.C. activism.
“We’re just trying to boost these unions and local workers’ rights groups and get the word out to students,” he said.

2019-09-11,AU,Democrat,"The University’s new bipartisan Sine Institute of Policy and Politics named political veteran Amy Dacey as its inaugural executive director in June. 
Dacey previously led Emily’s List and the Democratic National Committee. She also worked on presidential campaigns, such as John Kerry’s in 2004. Because of these experiences, Dacey said she has a “360-degree view of policy and politics” that will help further Sine’s goals of finding new policy solutions.
“I think these are all the different players and sectors that come together when they make policy,” Dacey said, “So I do feel like having those different perspectives from my own personal career path will bring a lot to what we’re trying to do here at the Sine Institute.”
President Sylvia Burwell announced the establishment of the institute last September on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” 
“What we’re hopeful for is that our students, our scholars and practitioners - people who are experts across media, government and the private sector - can come together and shape policy, as well as the leaders of tomorrow,” Burwell said on the show.
School of Public Affairs Dean Vicky Wilkins said the hiring committee looked for someone who could increase the Sine Institute's visibility on campus and beyond. Wilkins said they wanted someone who had experience in “institution-building” and bringing people together.
Wilkins said that not only did Dacey’s political experiences impress her, but her most recent experience as a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard intrigued her, as well. In that role, she educated students on politics and policy, just as the fellows at Sine do.
“What resounded with everyone I spoke to there [Harvard], including students, was her level of student engagement and her ideas about how to bring students in and how they could be involved in the institute,” Wilkins said. “It really excited me and made me see that she was the right person.”
Looking toward the future of Sine, Dacey said she has big plans. She said she hopes to bring in international voices to talk about how policy affects us “outside our borders.” Dacey also said one of her main goals is to hire an engaged and diverse group of fellows for this upcoming spring. 
“I think it is a great opportunity and I am excited about this program at American University,” Dacey said. “It is a University-wide initiative, so the collaboration that will take place between all the different schools and colleges and their expertise is exciting.”

2019-12-12,AU,Democrat,"AU professor Daniel Gade in the School of Public Affairs is running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 election.
A professor in the School of Public Affairs is running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 election.
AU professor Daniel Gade is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, former White House veterans-affairs advocate and disability rights activist. He was wounded in combat twice and lost his right leg. After earning a Ph.D. in public policy and public administration from the University of Georgia, he taught political science at the United States Military Academy for several years before coming to AU in January. 
“I am a career servant,” Gade said. “From the time I enlisted in the army at 17 years old, I’ve been a servant of the Constitution. I view service in politics, and particularly, in this case, service in the United States Senate, as an extension of my decades of service to the country.”
Since he launched his campaign in August, Gade raised funds at the same rate at his opponent Scott Taylor, who is considered the established Republican candidate.
His campaign is still in the early stages since the primary vote is not until June, but Gade said that he is now focusing on fundraising and garnering media attention. He released a campaign advertisement last month and was featured in news articles, blog posts and radio shows. 
Gade said that he has not faced any backlash for his campaign yet.
“Reception has been uniformly positive,” he said. “People are really hungry for non-politician political servants. Voters are sick of our political class.”
Gade’s governing principles and the platform of his candidacy are to promote free-market systems, maintain a strong national defense, promote limited government and protect individual liberties and civil rights, according to his website. 
“Getting government out of people’s lives allows them to thrive on their own terms,” he said. “That’s where societies thrive, because societies are an aggregation of political and economic choices.”
If he wins the Republican primary, Gade would face the Democratic two-term incumbent Mark Warner in the general election. The most recent data from the Cook Political Report said that the general election is likely to fall in favor of Warner. 
When Gade is not performing his professorial duties or orchestrating his campaign, he enjoys biking and CrossFit. He is a father of three, including a 17-year-old daughter and two younger twin boys. 
Gade says that, as a senator, he’d like to change the “divisiveness and nastiness” in today’s political climate.
“I’m willing to sit down and talk face to face, but there are some people in this political climate who are not willing to do that,” he said. “Politicians just see the R or the D, but don’t see the A for American. They need to focus on the A first.”

2020-02-04,AU,Democrat,"AU Student Union Board invited Jaboukie Young-White to perform stand-up for AU students on Jan. 26.
American University’s Student Union Board welcomed comedian Jaboukie Young-White, best known for his work on “The Daily Show,” to Constitution Hall, on Sunday, Jan. 26. 
Jaboukie performed a stand-up set, entertaining a large crowd of students. His act was an expressive parody, poking fun at some of the major problems in the ongoing news cycle. Whether it was his jokes on trendy food items, phone addiction or living in cities – Jaboukie actively kept the audience engaged in stories that were more meaningful of a bigger societal picture. 
Opener Charlie Bardey performed before Jaboukie’s set, joking about his “weird vibes,” his daily life with his therapist and his sex life as a gay man. Bardey interacted with the crowd, performing multiple side-bars in his introduction, and even researched some things that AU students joke about, such as the Terrace Dining Room. 
Following Bardey, Jabokuie walked on stage with roaring applause. Jaboukie joked about many topics that AU students could relate to, such as living in cities, riding public transit and getting into college. One joke he told was about how he and a close friend in high school took pictures of already-graded tests and were able to cheat their way through their AP European History class to the point where their scores were starting to influence the grading curve. Laughingly, Jaboukie said he and his friend, “were in class like, ‘we love Euro.’” 
Jaboukie’s act also touched on many deeper topics. He talked about what it has been like living in the current political and social environment. He shared stories about living as a gay person in the U.S., and what the Democratic primary has come to, saying, “It’s hard to swallow everything.” He engaged the crowd with a PowerPoint slide presentation where he compared mainstream foods, such as Oat Milk, to famous actresses. 
Jaboukie’s jokes were more telling of the current political environment, rather than his sense of humor. He often joked about contemporary issues, which have sparked debate throughout the world, such as phone addiction, social media, and 23andMe. He also made light of his diverse background growing up in a religious Jamaican family in New York, and what it is like living in the U.S. as a minority.
He closed the night with a story about being robbed on his walk home. The robbers took his phone and ran; however, they came back and asked for his passcode. At the end of the story, Jaboukie managed to get his phone back, saying “If you’re annoying enough, you can do anything.”
Jaboukie said during his set that he was uncertain about what the future of politics and social issues looked like, but he looks to comedy as another way of thinking about the issues that are impeding students’ newsfeeds and social lives.

2020-02-06,AU,Democrat,"On Jan. 26, Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Dr. Fanta Aw sent the AU community an email regarding mental health resources on campus. The email, masquerading as an attempt to reach out to students searching for support, had an accusatory tone and was punctuated by statistics that functioned to place blame on students for the state of counseling services on campus. It seemed that rather than taking steps to address students’ requests concerning these resources, the administration chose to place that burden back on the struggling students asking for help.
Beyond the absurdity of responding to demands for change by assigning blame, the email and the represented view of administration completely ignore the conversation AU students are trying to have. At the core of this issue, the fact remains that the administration, time and time again, prioritizes its image over the necessary and tangible needs of its students. As the new Hall of Science is slowly constructed and plans for a future training facility are shared, it’s only fair for students to wonder when their necessity for more therapists will be met. 
One of the statistics cited in the email was the fact that 97.5 percent of students who have accessed the Counseling Center would recommend it to other students. Off-campus therapy can be an immense financial strain on any student and many insurance plans cover little to none of those costs. With the Counseling Center being the only free resource AU students have access to, it makes complete sense why they would recommend it to their peers. All this means is they would rather their friends have some hope of treatment, even if it won’t be for another month, than none at all. This statistic cannot and should not be mistaken for any vote of confidence beyond the fact that the Center itself exists. 
What the other statistics fail to recognize are basic symptoms of mental illness. Therapy is a grueling process that forces you to examine and discuss extremely uncomfortable things. Beyond the notion that canceled and missed appointments are a fact of everyday life, getting out of bed to talk about your darkest thoughts is a feat in and of itself. Belittling students and diminishing that to “choosing not to show up for appointments” is an admission that the administration simply does not recognize mental illness to be the tangible problem that it is. 
While the administration should certainly be focused on transforming mental health resources, it should also be more transparent as to where the numbers they base so many claims on are coming from. Are they collected from the tedious survey that the Counseling Center forces everyone to take at the end of their sessions? Knowing a bit more about where this data came from could give students a deeper understanding of this information.
The email also makes a point to disclose cancellations that are “same-day."" It seems contradictory that students should have to wait for three weeks to get an appointment while so many appointments are being missed or canceled. If the Counseling Center could set up a system similar to that of advising, it would both allow students to get appointments significantly sooner and make up for the “waste” of canceled counseling time. Creating a system that allows students to go in and choose appointments as they open up facilitates the process for all parties involved. 
Vice President Aw concluded the email with a plea to students to ensure that counseling services are “utilized thoughtfully.” This phrasing implies some sort of hierarchy of mental health needs as if certain students who are “only” mildly depressed should not take away appointments from students who are severely depressed. This implication is dangerous and only further discloses the reckless attitude that the administration displays towards the mental health needs of students.
Administration is continuously planning for the future, a future with more science majors or higher-ranked sports teams. This careful planning comes at the cost of the students who are here now and who are struggling to find support on a campus that wilfully ignores their needs. Perhaps instead of placing the burden on students to somehow fix the failings of the Counseling Center, the administration could learn from schools similar in size to AU who have comparatively successful resources. It could form focus groups to glean the needs we have that it clearly doesn’t respect or understand. 
Since the email was sent, AU’s student body has responded with outrage. With responses from Student Government, AU College Democrats and the overall student body enumerating by the day, it is imperative that the administration recognizes their shortcomings in sending that email. In a period of our lives as transformative and uncertain as our undergraduate years, feeling supported by the institution where we sleep, eat and learn is essential. 
As the national movement to normalize mental illness in schools gains traction, this email proves that AU is falling behind. It is imperative that AU administration joins this conversation and finally makes the needs of its students its primary priority.

2020-04-10,AU,Democrat,"Halfway through a debate hosted by AU College Democrats on April 8 between candidates for Student Government president and comptroller, the Zoom call used as the debate’s platform was disrupted by anonymous trolls sharing pornographic images and harassing messages. 
“The debate was going so well, discussions were being had and hard questions … were being asked of the candidates, and they were providing the answers,” said Julia Larkin, AU Dems president and the target of some of the harassing comments. “Now, all that’s being talked about is not the issues that we’re facing as students on campus, it’s this stupidity.”
“Zoom bombings” have become a common occurrence in the U.S. following the transition to online classes, Inside Higher Ed reported. This trolling strategy involves gaining admittance to Zoom meetings and disrupting them with inappropriate behavior or content. University classes seem to be primary targets, Inside Higher Ed noted. 
About 90 minutes into the debate, the discussion was interrupted when someone in the call began screen sharing pornographic images, Larkin said. The perpetrator was quickly removed from the call, but a few minutes later, four or five other accounts began posting harassing and disruptive comments in the chat. Moderators were unable to lock the call, as the app notified them that too many people were involved to make the change.
“All of a sudden … chaos just broke out in a chat section and that's when people started writing disparaging comments … about me and … about sexual violence,” Larkin said. “Around that same time, as we were trying to kick those people out of it, someone else started screening pornographic images again so we just decided to end the Zoom altogether.”
AU administrators later clarified to Larkin that locking a call should only be impossible with meetings over 300 people. It is unclear why the debate, which had about 80 attendees at its peak, was subject to this limitation. 
All of the candidates and a large number of viewers rejoined afterwards for a continued debate no longer sanctioned or moderated by AU Dems. 
“I commend a student, Leanna Faulk, who jumped in to moderate because students still wanted to hear from us,” said Joshua Dantzler, a candidate for president. Larkin added that she had intended to invalidate the Zoom meeting ID to prevent more trolls, but the number of people who rejoined prevented her from closing it. 
Candidates have responded on Facebook to the “Zoom bombing,” calling it unacceptable, yet unsurprising. 
AU Dems leadership, including Larkin, Vice President Emily Coneybeare and Campaigns Director Ian Malone, have called for the student body to not give the trolls the attention they seek by continuing to discuss the disruption. Instead, they ask that students and candidates follow through on their outrage and work to make campus a more inclusive and aware community, most immediately by concentrating on the substantive aspects of the debate. 
Before and after the disruption, candidates spoke in depth on a variety of topics. Internal SG issues such as transparency, communication and trust with the student body were discussed, as well as potential points of advocacy for SG members, like mental health, Title IX disputes, continued racism on campus and students’ financial concerns. 
“It’s really sad that we were having a really live spirited conversation about the future of AU and somebody who had nothing better to do just decided that they were going to crash the debate,” said Jacob Robbins, a candidate for comptroller. He expressed hope at the overall reaction of students to the incident.
Presidential candidate Jeremy Ward said he agreed with Larkin’s statements. 
“This isn’t a moment to talk about solidarity on Facebook posts ... when misogyny and sexist comments are made, where are you?” he said. “That’s very important when you’re running for leadership in AUSG. What are your platforms to deal with misogyny and sexism on campus?”
Larkin said she spoke with an official from the Center for Student Involvement, who said they planned to talk to the information technology department about the disruption. 
“American University officials are aware of this unfortunate incident and inappropriate behavior and are in the process of reviewing,” Stacie Burgess, director of public affairs, wrote in an email to The Eagle. 
Larkin said she hopes that those who attended the debate and saw the disruption don’t just act performatively against such mistreatment. 
“It’s very easy to write on Facebook and it’s very easy to be mad about a situation that was put right in front of your face,” she said. “But when you’re in class and you see a fellow student, who’s a man, mansplaining something to another female student, that’s your opportunity to stand up and do something about it. This isn’t just an isolated incident. Women on this campus face sexism from their fellow students and classmates all the time. It’s not fair.”

2020-05-03,AU,Democrat,"Students from AU for Warren sell merchandise on campus to promote her presidential campaign.
While phone banking and canvassing are traditional ways to show your support for a presidential candidate during the primary season, AU student organizations showed that simply sporting a button on your backpack or wearing a t-shirt with your candidate of choice is enough to make a statement.
Student groups on campus have devoted themselves to advocating for specific candidates during the primaries, using merchandise to increase awareness for certain candidates.
Alex Russo is the president of AU for Warren, a student organization that paid for their merchandise entirely out of their own pockets. AU did not provide funding for this merchandise because the organization was deemed as too “short-lived,” according to Russo.
Russo said AU for Warren has about 250 people on its email list, and about 20 or 30 members he could rely on for assistance.
Despite the suspension of Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign in March, the organization has remained active on social media.
AU for Warren wrote in one tweet, “While Elizabeth Warren has suspended her campaign, it does not suspend the truth in her fight.”
Other student groups, such as AU College Democrats, did not endorse specific candidates as an organization. However, Vice President of AU Dems Emily Coneybeare was proudly wearing Elizabeth Warren merchandise across campus. She has a “NH for Warren” sticker on the center of her laptop and a Warren button on her backpack. Coneybeare worked for Warren in New Hampshire, and said that being able to wear merchandise from the campaign has a sentimental value for her.
“To be able to carry on what I know is such a good campaign and to represent it at school and wherever I go is important to me,” Coneybeare said.
Even though Warren suspended her campaign, Coneybeare does not necessarily have plans to stop wearing Warren merchandise. Coneybeare said her Warren merchandise reminds her of the people she met and the formative experiences she had while working on the campaign. 
AU Dems have been continuously using their online platform during the coronavirus pandemic by providing students with resources and advocacy ideas. The club is promoting COVID-19 related material and is selecting students for scholarships.
Christian Omoruyi is the president of AU Students for Biden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, candidate-focused groups have had to brainstorm new ways to keep students involved. 


“Now with coronavirus and all the mayhem that has unleashed, we are definitely looking at virtual ways to keep our momentum going,” Omoruyi said.
Even before Bernie Sanders officially suspended his campaign, Joe Biden had been gaining more traction in the race. Omoruyi said that, across AU for Biden’s communications networks, the club has a wide following.
Since the pandemic caused many AU for Biden members to return to their hometowns, Omoruyi explained that he is “strategizing on future primaries” and encouraging members to raise awareness for Biden in their local communities. He is especially interested in having students spread the word in Pennsylvania and his home state of Indiana. 
Before the spring 2020 semester was moved online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AU for Biden did not have merchandise created.
Nonetheless, Omoruyi said he’s proud of the logo that AU for Biden designed. He said these logos will be used on future merchandise, including buttons. He is working on “light-hearted” t-shirt designs appealing to Biden’s interests in aviator glasses and ice cream.
AU for Biden will most likely sell this merchandise during the fall 2020 semester, since shipping to students across the country would not be financially feasible for the small student club.
Both Russo and Omoruyi agreed that merchandise is beneficial for supporting candidates in the presidential primaries.
“When people see something familiar, like a familiar logo, I guess there’s just something subconscious that just kicks in,” Omoruyi said, adding later, “I think merchandise can also create a sense of solidarity when people are all wearing merchandise together.”
“We are a community of laptop stickers and buttons on our backpacks, and when people see that, just like walking down the quad, that tells them, ‘Oh wait, there’s a community on campus,’” Russo said.

2020-05-09,AU,Democrat,"The U.S. Department of Education released its final regulations controlling how schools handle campus sexual assault cases under Title IX, extending rights given to those accused of sexual misconduct.
Title IX, which went into effect in 1972, is a federal law that protects against sex discrimination in education. In November 2018, the Department of Education, headed by Secretary Betsy DeVos, released its initial proposal on “improving” schools’ responses to sexual harassment and assault. It received over 124,000 public comments, which were reviewed by the Office for Civil Rights, a sub-agency of the department. 
The finalized regulations, released on Wednesday, give students accused of sexual harassment or assault the right to a live hearing and the ability for the student’s advisers to cross-examine accusers in order to “restore due process in campus proceedings.” However, opponents of the new rules say they may discourage survivors from coming forward. Some AU students think the University should take steps to make the process less traumatic for accusers.
“American, much like colleges and universities nationwide, believes it is imperative to carefully and thoroughly review the final regulations, the Department's aggregated response to the nearly 125,000 comments submitted, and the other data and information included by the Department,” AU spokesperson Stacie Burgess said in a statement to The Eagle.
The new Title IX rules also include dating violence as a type of sexual harassment and require schools to offer options such as dorm room reassignments or no-contact orders.
In 2017, AU removed the hearing process and switched to an investigative model, in which an investigator determines whether or not the respondent is responsible. Former Title IX Program Officer Regina Curran previously said that the University switched to the model due to the significant stress that the hearings were causing for students involved. 
However, AU and other colleges and universities will have to comply with these regulations by Aug. 14, as they are enforceable by law, unlike the Obama-era guidelines issued in 2011 and 2014. If schools choose not to comply with these regulations, they could lose federal funding.
Rachel Abraham, a rising senior in the School of Public Affairs, went through the process of filing a complaint with AU’s Title IX office. She said it was one of the worst experiences in her college career, and she thinks giving the accused more rights, such as cross-examination, is dangerous and invalidating. 
“This has given them an elevator, and you’re sort of stuck in this hole and you still don’t have a ladder or rope to get you out,” Abraham said.
Zachary Swanson, a rising sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes students are going to be less willing to report complaints with the Title IX office if the process retraumatizes students through a more criminal-like trial.
“There is already a notable and provable chilling effect in the criminal justice system regarding sexual assault because victims don’t want to have to go through a long, drawn-out legal process,” Swanson said.
Other regulations allow Title IX officials to decide whether to use preponderance of the evidence or a “clear and convincing standard,” suggest mediation as an alternative method of mediation, and do not enforce Title IX offices to investigate assault or harassment that occurs off campus in a non-sponsored setting like an apartment or, in AU’s case, a fraternity house. 
Abraham said her friends who have gone through traumatic situations mostly experienced them in apartments or fraternity houses off campus. Abraham said that if the University is really trying to keep their students safe, they should consider that not everything, especially sexual assault, happens on campus or at school-sponsored events.
While these rules are enforceable by law, the University can choose not to opt in to some of the suggestions. Washington College of Law adjunct professorial lecturer Ian Harris said one way could be to utilize the lower evidentiary procedure as suggested in the Obama-era guidelines. He said as an attorney, he knows it can be difficult to prove sexual assault even with the lower standard of evidence, let alone a stricter standard.
“The preponderance of the evidence is used in most civil cases where judges are actually trained to adjudicate cases,” Harris said. “There is no reason that a more stringent standard should be utilized for cases at universities where many students and adjudicators lack evidentiary knowledge or tools to seek out evidence.”
The release of these changes initiated outcry on social media from students. Rising junior and former AU Democrats President Julia Larkin created a Change.org petition for AU to “uphold survivors’ rights and reject DeVos’s harmful Title IX policies.”
Without the ability to protest on campus, Larkin said her anger propelled her to create the petition, which received over 365 signatures as of Saturday.
“The University needs to come up with some sort of plan, some time very soon, as to how they are going to adapt to these rules and how they can adapt to it in a way that is still survivor-centric that is going to protect people who come forward,” Larkin said. “If no response from the University comes out within the next few days, the distrust and a wall is already built.”
Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw said the University will do everything they can do within the law for survivors to still feel safe and comfortable coming forward. 
“We’ve made significant improvements within not only the process but continuing our commitment to education, like Empower AU. Those will not go away,” Aw said. “If anything we’ll continue to redouble our efforts around that.”
Larkin also helped new AU Democrats President Rhett Martino, a rising sophomore, plan a Day of Action on Friday. Martino said the petition Larkin created was a great first step, but they wanted to encourage more student activism to let the University know that students think these policies would be harmful.
“Step one is to sign the petition. Step two is to send an email to your representative in Congress and we really outline how to do that,” Martino said. “Step three is an email to American University, specifically to the Office of Campus Life, Dr. Fanta Aw and the Title IX office.”
Aw said she has received those emails and ensures students that the University is looking over every single line of the over 2,000 pages of regulations. Even though the timetable is “aggressive” and comes in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she said the University is assessing the full measure of implementation. 
These regulations come at a time when AU has three open federal investigations into potential sexual violence violations of Title IX — the most in D.C. In addition, Curran recently left her position as Title IX program officer. Currently, there is an interim program officer and deputy Title IX officers.
“We will continue to do everything we can, around what we know to be good practices while understanding that this is indeed a federal law,” Aw said.

2020-06-02,AU,Democrat,"Update: The original version of this article included a statement from Brooke Frischer that did not include the end of a quote about how black Americans have told people for years to support them. The end of her statement was paraphrased in the updated article.
Three days following George Floyd’s death, after a police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes in Minneapolis, almost three of which Floyd wasn’t responding, the American University NAACP released a statement asking the University to end relations with the Metropolitan Police Department. 
“We are calling on American University to use its institutional power by following in the footsteps of the University of Minnesota and ending our University’s relationship with the Metropolitan Police Department,” the statement said.
According to the statement, this call to action was inspired by the recent deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and many others at the hands of police officers. AU NAACP said it is not releasing any media statements at this time.
Shortly after Floyd’s death, University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel announced the university is highly limiting their relations with the Minneapolis Police Department. 
In her statement, Gabel said that the university has “a responsibility to uphold our values and a duty to honor” those affected by police brutality. This came after the university’s Student Association demanded that action be taken. 
The AU Black Student Union published a collective statement with the Black Student Unions of the District of Columbia Universities. It included a list of demands that requested reducing the number of youth arrests and requiring all MPD officers to undergo unconscious bias and de-escalation training. 
AU BSU declined to comment. 
AU Democrats also declared their support for the separation between the University and MPD. 
“We cannot pretend that police officers are subject to the same laws as the citizens they are supposed to be protecting,” the statement said. “Our country should not pick and choose who we hold accountable under the law, especially when it comes to vicious crimes, such as murder.” 
AU Dems spokesperson Brooke Frischer said she is an ally for black people and the organization recognizes the violence that has recently occurred.
“We know that we have a duty [as a predominantly white organization] to call out injustices,” Frischer said. “We don’t want to be the people constantly asking black people how to support them when we know how to support them.” 
That's because black people have told others for years how to support them, Frischer said.
AU spokesperson Stacie Burgess detailed what a separation might mean. AUPD predominantly resolves on-campus issues, making MPD, in many cases, nonessential. 
“AUPD rarely needs assistance from MPD,” Burgess said. “In one case, the department took proactive action steps to actively reduce MPD presence on campus by working with the Counseling Center to change protocols.” 
Burgess said that university police departments in D.C. rely on memorandum of understandings, which are supervised by the MPD. This allows access to writing reports, sharing information and conducting background checks. 
“These licensing, commissions and connectivity to law enforcement networks are critical to our mission of serving our AU community,” Burgess said. “Severing our relationship with MPD would require a change in D.C. regulations.”

2020-07-05,AU,Democrat,"The Mary Graydon Center, pictured in 2016. 
President Sylvia Burwell announced the creation of a new office on Thursday that will handle complaints related to racism, discrimination, harassment and sexual assault. 
The Office of Equity and Title IX will replace the current Title IX office. It will receive additional funding compared to its predecessor, and the staff will grow to include five full-time members, according to Seth Grossman, Burwell's chief of staff and counselor. The office will also enhance education and training in anti-discrimination for students, staff and faculty. 
Prior to the creation of the Office of Equity and Title IX, complaints from students, staff and faculty were all handled in different offices. Students reported to the Title IX office, while Human Resources handled staff complaints, and the Provost and Dean of Faculty offices dealt with faculty complaints. The new Office of Equity and Title IX will handle complaints from all members of the AU community. 
Burwell said in her email that the creation of the office will “provide a direct avenue for individual concerns to be promptly and meaningfully addressed; enhance our approach to preventing and responding to discrimination, harassment and sexual assault complaints; and provide everyone in our community with a space to be heard.”
The new office aims to bring together responsibilities, currently spread out across the University, including anti-discriminatory training, handling Title IX complaints and responding to instances of racism and discrimination. 
“Often, the complaints involve different types of discrimination. Separating those out prevented the University from having an approach to address multiple grounds of discrimination,” Grossman said. 
All students, faculty and staff, including the new office’s staff, will receive training in the fall, according to Grossman. That includes specialized training for different groups like members of sports teams and Greek life organizations. Details of the training will be worked out by the new office and its assistant vice president.
A new assistant vice president for equity and Title IX officer will lead the office, and the University is currently searching internally and externally for candidates, Burwell wrote. According to Grossman, the new assistant vice president, who will also hold a position in the president’s cabinet, will be in place when the office launches on Aug. 14, or shortly thereafter.
Despite recent student outcry over how the University handles instances of discrimination and sexual violence, Grossman said that the creation of this office is not directly in response to calls for increased University support for victims. The new office, which is a part of AU’s Inclusive Excellence plan, has been in the works for about a year. 
“The office is in response to feedback we’ve gotten over a long period of time about complaints about how complaints related to Title IX and instances of racial discrimination have been handled,” Grossman said. “This is critical and has informed the work of the office.”
Some students say that the University can do more to support victims in the community. Jeremy Ward, executive director of AU Democrats, is concerned that since the old Title IX office was “not effective,” he’s unsure if adding responsibilities to the office will help streamline complaints and adjudication.
“They have to have honest conversations with many different communities on campus and those conversations need to start now instead of waiting for the office to be established because a lot of whatever work is done by that office is going to be set up on how it is created,” Ward said. 
Student leaders are also calling for more steps to be taken.
“I definitely believe this is a great step in the right direction for AU. But the work is far from over,” said AUSG Comptroller Justin Levine, who is serving as interim president. “It’s vital to believe the students who came forward and shared their stories on campus, but it's also important to discuss what’s next.”

2020-07-06,AU,Democrat,"Students celebrate the announcement of Sharice Davids as the winner of a Kansas congressional race at an AU Dems watch party Tuesday. 
Correction: Edu Nogues' name has been updated with the correct spelling.
All members of the executive board of American University College Democrats resigned from their positions last week, after pushback about a lack of representation of students of color in leadership positions.
The group’s president, vice president, chief of staff, treasurer, communications director, director of activism, director of diversity, equity and inclusion, and social chair stepped down. In statements posted on Facebook and Instagram, each expressed their reasons for stepping down, most of which centered around the need for more representation of people of color in their organization.
“To truly put this organization in the place I want to see it go, BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] voices must be amplified in leadership, and that must start from the top,” former president Rhett Martino said in a Facebook statement on June 29.
Martino said in a statement to The Eagle that resignations were made as a step to “meet the magnitude of the problem.”
“Personally, I believe that I was elected to enact reform on campus in this organization's capacity, and continuing to occupy the seat as head of this organization is not what I currently want to do if that means less representation for marginalized communities in AU Dems leadership,” Martino said. 
In a statement that AU Dems published on Wednesday, Jeremy Ward, previously a deputy diversity, equity and inclusion director, was appointed as the executive director for the duration of the summer, and he will be hosting town halls during this transitional period to determine the next steps for the organization.
In an interview with The Eagle on Wednesday, Ward said that the entire executive board, including the members that had already resigned, had a Zoom call to discuss the resignations and decided to appoint him as the executive director. 
“I just want to speak to as many people as possible and understand their opinions on how the club has made them feel unwelcome, unvalued and tokenized, at times,” Ward said. “Then we’ll compile that report and send a list of recommendations that we’ll make public to the student body.”
While there are long withstanding issues with diversity, Ward said, there have been people in the organization who have tried to implement change.
However, former Vice President Christopher Bastida, who was one of the three students of color on the executive board, was the first to post a statement of resignation. In an interview with The Eagle, Bastida said that the organization had not made proper changes toward more representation during his time there.
“In light of the discussions taking place over social media over the past days both regarding AU Dems and the overtly racist climate that is our campus, and what I can only describe as an unsettling, disturbing, and lackluster response from certain others on this executive board, I am left with no hope for the future of this organization as it stands,” Bastida said in his statement.
Bastida said in the interview that the group's leaders should apologize for their ""history and past actions.""
Bastida said that he coordinated his resignation with Edu Nogues, the former chief of staff. Following the resignations of other board members, Bastida said that he questions how genuine they are. He said he feels as though the resignations are in response to the controversy and “not necessarily in response to the wrongdoing of those individuals and other individuals in the organization.”
Nogues said in his statement that while he joined Bastida in his resignation, he knows that Martino recognizes the challenges that the club faces, and he is optimistic about the future of the club. In an interview with The Eagle, though, he said that there were many instances when the board members could have made changes but chose not to.
“Don’t get me wrong, the e-board tried to improve it many times,” Nogues said. “But after every statement that came out in order to make the club more diverse and address race issues, I kept getting calls, messages and complaints telling me that the statements are performative.” 
The most concerning thing, Nogues said, is that when the board was hiring the new campaign directors, it took on only white students for the role, despite multiple students of color applying for the four positions.
“It felt like we were making a lot of statements, but when we had an actual chance, we weren’t doing anything about it,” Nogues said.
In an Instagram post on Tuesday, AU’s Black Student Union announced it was canceling its Summer of Justice partnership with College Democrats following criticism of AU Dems from Black students on social media. The organization urged AU Dems to look within the club and address its problematic history, instead of hiding behind BSU's efforts. 
BSU did not respond to a request for comment. 
Thrisha Mohan, a rising sophomore at AU, was part of a group of people who were considering running for the executive board in the spring. While she ultimately decided not to run, Zuby Chowdhury, who’s Asian American, ran for president and lost by a small margin to Martino. 
Mohan said in an interview that both she and Chowdhury applied for a campaign director position. However, despite Chowdhury losing in a runoff election by 5 percentage points, and other qualified applicants being people of color, none of them received the position. 
After expressing grievances on social media, Aaditi Narayanan, the former diversity, equity and inclusion director, set up a phone call with Mohan to discuss how to improve diversity. Mohan said that the call seemed pointless, given that the organization had an opportunity to give leadership to people of color, but chose not to.
“My point to them was that I am not sure nor do I care why they made that decision, but the fact that they did is exclusionary toward a lot of qualified POC candidates, which is reflective of the organization as a whole and a problem that they knew had existed prior,” Mohan said.
Chowdhury said in an interview with The Eagle that from the moment she became a campaign fellow for the organization prior to her run for president, she was exposed to the toxicity of AU College Democrats.
“As soon as I took the position of fellow, it started going downhill for me because it was the most ridiculous grunt work position ever,” Chowdhury said. “Having really excited students who are intelligent and capable of doing a lot of things for an organization that is supposed to be progressive, just doing fundraising research was really demeaning in my eyes.”
The issues within the club became more and more apparent to her once she decided to run for president, Chowdhury said, and she heard from many people that the club is not a safe space for people of color.
Diamond Terrell, who served as AU College Democrats’ vice president from May to September 2019, said in a message to The Eagle that, as the only Black woman on the board at that time, she was constantly faced with tone policing, condescension and disrespect. She resigned from the role when she realized that the “organization was past the point of reform.” 
“Despite my calls for changing the organization from within, there was no direct action; it has all been performative,” Terrell wrote. “Historically, the organization has made little to no effort to diversify their ranks beyond white feminists, lacking intersectionality at every turn.”
Terrell added that she hoped students would recognize the flaws in the group, instead of supporting it for its past partnerships with Black student organizations. 
“I don’t want my words to get misconstrued, so let me make it clear: more than ever now, multicultural groups on campus are the organizations that need to be most supported,” Terrell wrote.
Issues with representation also extend to the national organization of College Democrats of America. In an open letter to the group published on Tuesday, state federations, called for the immediate resignation of the current president and demanded that people of color will serve and be represented on the next national board.
Bastida said that resignations within AU Dems leadership are necessary to make way for students of color to serve. He said that former board members should not run again. 
“The other resignations that have transpired [Tuesday] morning and that will likely come, I really cannot speak as to their motives,” Bastida said. “However, I am confident in mine and that I am leaving a system that is built to benefit white students.”

2020-10-09,AU,Democrat,"American University students voiced a variety of concerns following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, who will replace late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if confirmed by the Senate. 
From a shortlist of conservative political figures such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Trump ultimately decided on Barrett, who is known for her conservative stances on abortion, the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ+ rights, amongst other issues. 
The Executive Board of AU College Republicans said in a statement that they support the nomination. 
“In this time of unprecedented tumult and uncertainty, it is especially imperative that the Supreme Court be at full capacity, to remain a steady defender of the Constitution,” the AUCR Executive Board wrote in a statement released Oct. 2. “We strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett and look forward to her many more years of service to the United States of America and our sacred Constitution.” 
College Republicans declined to comment further. 
Many students said they are concerned that if she is confirmed, she will threaten the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision—a landmark case that protects a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction—and the Affordable Care Act. 
Jeremy Ward, the executive director of AU College Democrats, said that Barret’s nomination “shows that the Republicans don't care about health care.”
Roseanna Yeganeh-Kazemi, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, was also concerned. She cited Barrett’s use of religion to justify and support her legal opinions, such as with cases involving LGBTQ+ rights or abortion, as especially threatening, considering that the U.S. has no established religion. 
“We pride ourselves on that concept that we have a separation of church and state, and the fact that in a lot of opinions she's written and a lot of her stances she brings in Catholicism, which I think is a major problem,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
Several students said they were frustrated that Republicans plan to confirm Barrett with only a month until the general election. In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with eight months left until the election, but his nomination was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. 
“Then fast forward four years later, Justice Ginsburg's body is probably not even cold yet, it's just hours after she passed, and McConnell is saying that we are going to have a replacement,” Yeganeh-Kazemi said. 
While some were upset, many students said they were not shocked, given the long-term political power the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers would acquire if Barrett is confirmed. 
“I was expecting President Trump to make a decision very quickly; I was expecting the Senate to be [quick] to confirm her,” said Ali Siddiqi, a freshman in the School of International Service who has been following Barrett’s rulings since she was on the shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. “She had no scandals or allegations to which the Trump campaign would want to deviate from, especially with Brett Kavanaugh. They want a clean judicial pick.”
Barrett’s confirmation hearing is set to start Oct. 12, and it is not yet known exactly how COVID-19 might affect the proceedings.

2020-10-13,AU,Democrat,"AU alum Sarah McBride speaks at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. 
Sarah McBride, an American University alumna and former Student Government president, is expected to become the country’s first openly transgender state senator after winning her Delaware Senate Democratic primary race in September.
McBride overwhelmingly won in the primary, and given the makeup of her district, she is a heavy favorite to win the seat in November. 
“The best way that I can do justice by the LGBTQ community is to do right by my district, and to work my heart out and to be the best state senator I can be for every single resident of the first senate district. That's how I honor and uphold the responsibility I have to the broader LGBTQ+ community,” said McBride, in an interview with The Eagle.  
Democrat Harris McDowell III, the longest-serving legislator in Delaware history, is retiring and endorsed McBride.  
“This moment calls for a politics that is centering our people and our communities and that is really focused on the issues that matter most to people and making progress on them,” McBride said. “I think that we have a responsibility to feed this moment with full action that makes a real difference in our family's lives.”
Her campaign has been focused on health care, paid family and medical leave and education. If elected, she said her immediate priority would be to get her state through the coronavirus crisis. 
“This campaign has reinforced for me that people are hungry for conversations in our politics that are rooted in kindness and compassion, and it's reinforced for me the desire for change and progress. The desire for progress on issues ranging from better health care to education to the environment,” McBride said. 
Despite the historic nature of her campaign, McBride emphasized that her gender is not the focus of her campaign. 
“I’m not running to be a transgender state senator, I’m not running to make headlines,” McBride said. “I’m running to make a difference in my community.” 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, McBride’s campaign did a lot of door-knocking and face-to-face interaction with voters. Despite now having to virtually interact with voters, she said her campaign has not slowed down, and she is still able to have meaningful conversations with voters.
She said, being a millennial herself, she has also made it a priority to engage with and listen to young voters throughout the course of her campaign. 
“It means making sure that when we're talking to voters, we're actually including young voters in that universe and that we're truly, meaningfully, listening to young voters as we are having those conversations with voters across the district,” McBride said. 
While Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 3-to-1 in Delaware’s first senate district, McBride said she is not taking any chances. 
“I'm not taking anything for granted. I am working my heart out over the next few weeks to talk to as many voters as possible,"" McBride said. ""Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, we're leaving no stone unturned.”

2020-12-03,AU,Democrat,"With the tumult of the current political environment, especially during and following the election, American University students expressed heightened stress levels as well as difficulty balancing schoolwork with monitoring election results.
“The only time [I] really looked away from The New York Times map and the CNN video [was] just [to] sleep, so I kind of struggled with balancing homework and election stuff,” said School of Public Affairs freshman Lisa Liubovich in an interview during election week. “I think I already have trouble paying attention in class, but this is just like a cherry on the sundae. It’s very difficult to pay attention when everything is happening right now.”
Sophomore Solomon Dubner, who spent much of his time leading up to the election working on Maine Senate Democratic candidate Sara Gideon’s campaign, agreed. 
“You have this huge monumental event that is going to shape the lives of millions of people around the world, and you’re just glued to the TV,” Dubner said. “That one-page reflection paper, that stats assignment that you have, is going to seem pretty trivial.”
Jeffrey Volkmann, the executive director of the Counseling Center, explained how easier access to constantly-updated digital news could increase stress and ultimately cause a student to lose focus.
“The way the time period works right now, where we’re all in front of screens, I think for many people, there was some sort of [news] like The New York Times or something up at all times on their screen,” Volkmann said. “So while you’re in class, you’re getting this information, it’s impacting you emotionally, and then you’re also trying to focus on the content, and I think that’s a pretty difficult thing right now.”
Some stress among students was alleviated by some professors’ leniency during election week, including optional attendance, asynchronous activities and extended deadlines for assignments.
The Counseling Center also released resources to help students cope with election-related stress, such as an Election Stress Survival Kit and expanded drop-in hours and intake appointments throughout election week.
In order to de-stress, Volkmann suggested setting boundaries, eating meals regularly, exercising, listening to music and other forms of self-care. 
“I think a lot of conversation has been dictated by what’s happening with elections,” he said. “There can be some time made to talk about things other than the election to schedule space for yourself so that you’re not just focusing on what’s taking place in the world [and] taking breaks from the internet for periods of time.”
Dubner echoed this sentiment and emphasized the need for free time in addition to focusing on the election and work.
“At some point, you need just an hour to unwind, watch TV [or] read a book, and I think the main thing was, I didn’t have time to do that. I did have enough time to get my work done to a good enough quality, I’d like to think, and to do my best for the Gideon campaign,” Dubner said. “But I think the biggest problem was after I had time to do that, there was time for nothing else, which was kind of hard to balance [with] work, school and [my] personal life.”

2020-12-07,AU,Democrat,"Along the lines of American exceptionalism, the United States has proven to be exceptional in the worst ways. For a long time now, our nation has been performing low in general humanity and high in the number of police brutality reports, incarceration rates and impoverishment numbers.
In fact, no other wealthy country has the horrible public health infrastructure and social safety net that we do. As supposedly the world’s only superpower remaining, half a million Americans are homeless and 34 million are impoverished. 
Despite the incompetence and general buffoonery of President Donald Trump’s administration, before 2020 it was still widely reinforced that the United States reigned supreme in global matters. The emergence into the new year was a turning point in which no one could any longer place a muzzle on our crises. By Nov. 3, in the face of a pandemic-induced economic recession, 1,130 coronavirus deaths per day and a chaotic presidential election, it felt like the nation was on the verge of collapse.
Somehow, we’re still hanging onto our semi-functional democracy, and yet, internal conflict, failing socioeconomics and institutional backsliding are all indicators of a failing state.
The United States is a reflection of the violence caused by institutional inequality and poverty. The establishment injustice has made bitter racial and cultural schisms to the point where Black Americans feel criminalized at birth, and Indigenous Americans and people of color are painted by the same stroke.
Conflict zones, where the government fails to provide and leaves groups to fight over basic resources like water and minerals, aren’t found in far-off war-torn worlds; they’re found in our own country. Prime examples like the Navajo Nation; Flint, Michigan; and Baltimore, Maryland are a tribute to hundreds of years of neglect by those in power. 
Adding to these ongoing issues, the comparison of the disconnect between the poor and wealthy today versus 18th and 19th century western Europe put together by French economist, Thomas Piketty, seems to echo in modern America. In the 18th and 19th centuries, even as wages rose, private wealth controlled by the top of a rigid class hierarchy dwarfed national income. Similarly enough, in 1965, a CEO’s paycheck was 20 times the average worker’s salary, and by 2018 CEO compensation was 278 times the typical worker’s earnings. 
In order for the rich to remain on top, the movements of class conflict need to be managed by bringing them to a local level where it’s easy to subdue. In theory, if a conflict reaches and arouses the majority, they lose control.
Unfortunately, conflict being popularized isn’t enough to make change, to make change means securing institutional reform. 
During the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests across the country this past year, the demands for reform were popularized but not implemented. The reason is easy to understand: our country rests on the laurels of laws laid down centuries ago; true reform cannot happen until those same laws are rewritten.
Some die-hard Democrats could argue that the election of President-elect Joe Biden changes the direction that our nation is heading in. But, establishment politics aren’t enough to solve this crisis. To save a failing state, the republic needs to be reconstituted — looking objectively at the blue duo of Biden-Harris, that isn’t going to happen during their term.
Our nation requires fundamental change if we want to remain a legitimate state. We can’t keep cycling through the same worn-out politics and expect there to be a change. 
To achieve the goals that America is in desperate need of, change needs to be made in the bedrock of how we address racism, true separation of church and state, LGBTQ+ rights, education, taxes based on income and restore equity in social services and public health.
To create real change, we need to start from the beginning.

2020-12-07,AU,Democrat,"Allan Lichtman is a professor in American University's College of Arts and Sciences.

After correctly predicting Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, American University professor Allan Lichtman is celebrating his 10th correct prediction of the outcomes of the presidential races since 1984. 
Although Lichtman predicted that former Vice President Al Gore would win the presidential election in 2000, he stands by his prediction. He notes that Gore won the popular vote while Bush won the electoral college in a contentious Supreme Court battle. 
Lichtman has said that he believes the results of Florida make the 2000 election stolen, as there was a large portion of the Black community whose votes were suppressed. After this election, Lichtman changed his evaluation to account for the electoral college. 
Three years before his first prediction, Lichtman met Vladimir Keilis-Borok, a Russian seismologist who would later go on to become his “Odd Couple” pairing in correctly predicting presidential elections. Each brought something to the table to create a unique predicting method.
Keilis-Borok wanted to pair his knowledge of earthquake behaviors with Lichtman’s vast understanding of the American presidency to establish what we now know as the “13 Keys to the White House.” 
“The key to our collaboration was to reconceptualize presidential elections in geophysical terms,” Lichtman said. “Not as Republicans versus Democrats…but as ‘Stability,’ when the White House party keeps the presidency and ‘Earthquake’ when the White House party loses.” 
The 13 keys are all true or false, where true favors the re-election of the party holding the White House, and false favors the opposition party. Six or more false answers result in an “Earthquake.” 
The keys include whether there is a significant third-party candidate, how the short- and long-term economy is doing, and whether the incumbent is charismatic.
As Lichtman is a lifelong Democrat, being objective has major impacts on accuracy and success, he said. 
“The secret to being a successful forecaster is putting aside your own political preferences,” Lichtman said. “If you let your prediction be tainted by your preferences, then you would be useless as a forecaster.” 
In 2016, Lichtman received backlash for his prediction that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump would win, as polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton up double digits in several battleground states. He did note that his prediction was not impacted by Trump specifically, but because the keys swayed against the incumbent Democratic party. No matter who the Republican nominee was, according to his system, they would have won. 
Lichtman said that he believes the coronavirus pandemic has had a monumental impact on Biden’s victory. 
“The COVID pandemic was pivotal in turning this election against Trump,” Lichtman said. “However, it wasn’t just the pandemic, it was the failed response to it.”
With more than 14 million cases of COVID-19, over 280,000 deaths and millions of people filing for government assistance, the pandemic has put a strain on almost every U.S. citizen. 
The professor was very critical of Trump’s reaction to this November’s election results. 
“What we are seeing from Trump and his enablers since the election represents the worst moment in the history of the U.S. presidency,” Lichtman said.
Lichtman said there is no way to tell if these keys will stay useful in the coming presidential elections, but for now, he maintains his streak.

2020-12-09,AU,Democrat,"D.C. celebrated a historic milestone this past summer in the fight for statehood when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would admit certain portions of D.C. as the 51st state. 
Regardless of the outcome, this was a significant achievement for those fighting for statehood, including those in the American University community. Noah Wills, a 2018 alum of the School of Public Affairs, now president of Students for D.C. Statehood, said the bill’s passing in the House was “the pinnacle of the statehood movement.” 
“I felt the excitement from the generations of student leaders and advocates before,” Wills said. “It was a testament to their determination. I’ve only been involved in the movement for about six years, but I’m happy to have contributed something to the past generations’ work.”
Votes were mainly along party lines, with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting the bill. However, the Republican-majority Senate hasn’t taken the bill up for a vote due to unpopular support.
H.R. 51 would declare the state, which currently has a non-voting member of Congress, two senators and a voting representative. The bill would also declare that the state consists of all District territory, with the exclusion of some federal buildings and monuments. The excluded territory would be known as the “Capital.”
ANC 3D07 Commissioner-elect Christian Damiana, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and president of AU Students for D.C. Statehood, shared in the excitement of the moment. 
“When it comes to statehood, progress has been very slow, and the success is rare,” Damiana said. “When success does come, it’s very powerful. We’ve seen more of this over the past few decades with small successes like D.C. getting more budget autonomy.”
Wills said that D.C.’s lack of representation is contrary to the ideals the country upholds. He said that is what drew him to the movement.
“I was astounded when I first heard that the capital of the United States, as a beacon of democracy in the world, doesn’t give its own residents the right to Congress,” Wills said. “I used my four years at American University to study the issue and to learn about why we are where we are, what the arguments for and against it are and why it hasn’t happened yet.”
Through D.C. Students for Statehood, Wills focuses on mobilizing high school and college students through education and advocacy — work he has continued since leading AU’s chapter of the organization. 
Damiana said a goal of the organization is to spread this message of what statehood would mean. 
“A lot of AU students will not stay in D.C. for the rest of their lives,” Damiana said. “Students come to D.C. and learn how important statehood is. Then, when they go back to their home states, hopefully, they’ll tell their family, friends and their representatives and senators how D.C. desperately needs statehood.”
As for the near future, statehood’s support has been on the rise among voters. In polls conducted by Data For Progress, 43 percent of voters supported statehood in September 2020 compared to 35 percent in early 2019. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed support for D.C. statehood, but for now, much is riding on the runoff Senate races in Georgia, where two additional Democratic seats could mean sure progress for the movement. 
Wills and Damiana hope to see more substantial change in the future as they continue to work toward their shared goal.
“D.C. statehood is a pathway to economic justice, to labor rights and to saving our environment and eventually passing the Green New Deal,” Damiana said. “Many of these things will never be able to pass the U.S. Senate without statehood. Statehood would be the clearest showing of what D.C. residents can do for America if we let them.”

2021-01-06,AU,Democrat,"In this October 2019 file photo, Trump supporters demonstrate during the March for Trump.
Correction and update: This article has been corrected since it was first published to clarify that an AU-branded bus photographed transporting National Guard personnel was not previously owned by the University. It has also been updated with comments from a University-wide email sent by President Sylvia Burwell Thursday.
In a University-wide email sent Thursday evening, President Sylvia Burwell called on the American University community to “address the systemic challenges on display and to care for each other,” following a pro-Trump insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. 
Burwell also said that the effects of these events on communities of color and systemic racism must be confronted too. 
“The events at the Capitol were the antithesis of our AU community’s values of dignity, justice, inclusion, and truth,” she wrote. “While we reckon with the challenges of this moment, we will continue to act in pursuit of those values. That includes the antiracism work fundamental to our university, and the overall pursuit of knowledge, truth, community, and progress that is central to our mission and critical to further our democracy.”
Burwell wrote that the University will continue to monitor events and adjust security precautions if necessary and that AU is focused on risks that may arise around the presidential inauguration. She urged students to take care of both their physical and emotional well-being and to download apps such as the AU Rave Guardian Safety app and to make use of resources like the Counseling Center and Kay Spiritual Life Center. 
While most staff are currently working remotely, Burwell said in her email that the University is supporting the team members and making alternate arrangements for those whose presence is still required on campus. 
On Wednesday, Burwell condemned the right-wing rioters on Twitter, calling their actions “a threat to democracy.”
Burwell denounced the mob, tweeting, “There is no place in our society for violence or attacks on our democratic institutions and the people who diligently serve our nation. We condemn the rioters and stand united in support of our democracy and those defending it.” 
Today's reprehensible actions at the U.S. Capitol are an unacceptable threat to democracy. There is no place in our society for violence or attacks on our democratic institutions and the people who diligently serve our nation.
Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw tweeted Wednesday that the events marked ""a sad and distressing day in America.""
“AUPD has increased patrols and visibility on campus and on our off-site locations,” said Assistant Vice President of University Police Phillip Morse in an email to The Eagle. “This has been done as a precaution and to give confidence to our community should they be using our facilities. We will continue to monitor events and adjust our security precautions as necessary.” 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser instituted a 12-hour curfew following the forced entry of right-wing rioters into the Capitol Building and chambers, starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday and lifting at 6 a.m. Thursday. Media and other essential workers are exempt from the order, Bowser said. 
Bowser also extended a public emergency order Wednesday, leading up to the inauguration.
The mob forced the Capitol into lockdown and halted the count of electoral votes, forcing lawmakers and staff to evacuate. According to the Associated Press, one person was shot inside the Capitol Building.
Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Dustin Sternbeck said the woman shot had died, according to CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
WMATA announced Wednesday that Metrorail and Metrobus services would end services at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively, in the “interest of public safety.” 
Lisa Stark, a University spokesperson, clarified that an AU-branded bus photographed transporting National Guard personnel to the Capitol was not previously owned by the University.

The few classes at American University and Washington College of Law meant to be held in-person following the beginning of the spring semester will be held online through Jan. 24 due to “security concerns,” University officials announced in an email on Tuesday. 
While most courses were already planning to meet online, a few exceptions for certain classes are still impacted. In addition, the officials asked community members to avoid AU’s campus — especially via public transportation — until Jan. 25. 
University officials and the Office of Information Technology also requested that faculty members increase security for their online classes and other meetings held via Zoom by limiting access to only those with AU email accounts. They also advised faculty to carefully manage access for meetings with external personnel. Officials hope that these changes will prevent instances of “Zoom bombing,” where hostile users connect to a meeting to disrupt it, as AU College Democrats experienced during a Student Government debate in April. 
“With the ongoing security concerns in Washington, DC following the January 6 events at the US Capitol and in preparation for any potential incidents in the lead-up to the January 20 presidential inauguration, all AU class meetings, including at the Washington College of Law, will be fully online through January 24,” the officials wrote. [Emphasis from original]. 
The guidance from Acting Provost Peter Starr, Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw and Vice President and Chief Information Officer Steve Munson follows the insurrection at the Capitol on Wednesday and an email from Aw on Monday advising students to avoid downtown D.C. due to safety concerns surrounding the presidential inauguration and possible increased coronavirus spread from the crowds. 
They also encouraged faculty to set up recurring Zoom class meetings with the additional security guidance, and directed anyone with questions to the OIT Help Desk at helpdesk@american.edu. 
On Monday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asked Americans to participate virtually in the presidential inauguration instead of coming to the District. Bowser also enacted an order last Wednesday to extend a state of emergency until Jan 21.

2021-02-13,AU,Democrat,"Multiple American University alumni began their positions in the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following the historic inauguration on Jan. 20.
Michael LaRosa, who earned a master’s in political science and government from the School of Public Affairs, serves as the press secretary to First Lady Jill Biden. Most recently, LaRosa worked as the chief spokesperson and traveling press secretary to Jill Biden during the 2020 campaign. 
LaRosa attended AU immediately after completing his undergraduate degree at Seton Hall University. LaRosa spent his days on Capitol Hill working full time as an executive assistant to former Rep. Melissa Bean, D-Ill., and his nights taking graduate classes. 
“In my second year of graduate school, I took a class called Voting Behavior. It had a profound impact on how I processed why people vote and what factors they consider before making up their minds,” LaRosa said. “It developed my understanding of voters, how they reason, and the importance of the media and campaigns on voter attitudes which ultimately affect how they vote.”
LaRosa said his classes had a substantial impact on his career. He and his favorite professor, Masaki Hidaka, who taught The Presidency, are still in touch today. 
“He has the right combination of being responsive, responsible, generous, loyal and smart. And I think that's what you need in his role,” Hidaka said. “You have to believe in the person you work for, and so I know that he believes in Dr. Biden, and that is going to make him even better at his job.”
After receiving his master’s degree from SPA, LaRosa worked as a producer for “Hardball with Chris Matthews” for six years and then went on to work for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as deputy director for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. 
Shuwanza Goff, who earned a master’s from SPA, is also familiar with working in the House. 
Goff serves as the White House deputy director of legislative affairs and liaison to the House. Goff spent most of the past 12 years working in various capacities for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. 
Goff broke racial barriers in 2019 as the first Black woman to serve as floor director. 
Goff’s work in the House has earned her the reputation of a highly experienced and talented individual who has become an expert on the legislative process, Hoyer said in a press release on Nov. 23. Pelosi also released a statement following Goff’s nomination. 
“Over twelve years of working for Leader Hoyer, Shuwanza has distinguished herself as effective and experienced and has earned the bipartisan respect of Members and staff across the aisle and across the Capitol,” Pelosi said.“In the White House, she will continue to be an effective force, as she coordinates and strengthens the work of the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress to deliver For The People.”
Thomas Winslow, who earned a bachelor’s from the School of Communication, is Biden’s senior adviser to the deputy chief of staff. Winslow worked as the chief of staff to the campaign manager during Biden’s campaign.
Melanie Nakagawa, who earned a law degree from the Washington College of Law, is Biden’s senior director for climate and energy. Before joining the Biden administration, Nakagawa, who also earned a master’s from the School of International Service, worked for Princeville Global as the head of climate initiative. 
Prior to Princeville Global, she served as a strategic adviser for then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s Policy Planning Staff. 
Following Nakagawa’s appointment, Kerry congratulated her on Twitter.
“Thrilled to see Melanie Nakagawa joining the NSC on climate,” he tweeted “She's seen and done so much on this issue, from the Senate and to the State Department, and will be a terrific team member addressing the climate crisis.”

2021-03-09,AU,Democrat,"GOP strategist and TV political commentator Ana Navarro spoke about her experiences in politics, media and current events at a Kennedy Political Union event on Thursday. 
The School of Communication and the American University College Republicans co-hosted the conversation with Navarro, which was moderated by SOC professor Jane Hall. Central to the discussion were Navarro’s thoughts on the future of the GOP — a future, she says, that will be without party unity, at least in the short term. That’s not to say that Democrats don’t have their own internal issues, she said. 
“If we’re going to be fair, I think there’s a lot of diversity of thought within the Democratic Party as well. Their divisions, their cracks, their systems — are about ideology, they’re not about personality,” Navarro said in a student media interview before the event. “In the Republican Party, the division and the schism we are seeing right now, it’s not about principles, it’s not about convictions, it’s not about policy issues — it’s about Donald Trump.”
Navarro said she is not sure what will happen to anti-Trump Republicans as the GOP moves forward. Navarro belongs to the prominent group of Republicans, often termed “Never Trumpers,” who broke away from the party following the then-candidate’s nomination in 2016. 
“The purity test that some want to apply [within the GOP] is, ‘do you support Donald Trump or not,’ and so for me, that’s no longer a political party,” Navarro said in the student media interview. “The people who are with Trump think those of us who want should no longer be in the Republican Party and, go I guess die somewhere, knit, pickup golf? Maybe not golf.” 
Now with President Joe Biden’s administration in power, Navarro said that she and her colleagues in multiple networks realized how many topics they can discuss without Trump dominating their time. News has been very U.S.-centric since Trump took office, and Navarro is looking forward to discussing other topics on her shows. 
“We are again as a media talking about things like the Iran deal, talking about things like Syria, talking about things like the Paris Climate accord,” Navarro said in the interview. “We’ve been constantly responding to a 24/7 Twitter live president, and that was to the detriment of looking beyond our borders to what is happening in the world that also affects us.”
During the event, Navarro spoke about her moral reasoning and decision process behind voting for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential election, despite being a life-long Republican. 
“There was no choice because I’m a human, I’m an American, I’m an immigrant, I’m a Latina, I’m a woman — before being a Republican,” Navarro said. “I’m not going to vote for somebody who I think is just completely unfit, morally, and frankly, intellectually, just because of a party label.”
Navarro also said that she has dealt with a lot of hate — including daily racist and misogynist attacks on social media — and faces constant threats for being vocal about her support for the Biden-Harris administration. Even some of her good friends would turn their faces when seeing Navarro at the same restaurant, she said. 
As an outspoken female political commentator, Navarro advocated for more women to join the field. Especially with more awareness about gender inequality brought up in the #MeToo movement, she said she has noticed some changes within the primarily male-dominated media industry. 
At CNN, for example, where Navarro said most hosts have historically been male, more women are being brought on than ever before. 
In response to a question from AUCR about how to engage in civil discourse with those who hold opposing views, Navarro spoke about her experiences critiquing then-President Barack Obama on CNN with her colleague and former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile, who Navarro described as an Obama defender and advocate.
“Oftentimes after debating vigorously, we’d go have drinks, and oysters, or whatever watering hole in Washington, and people would walk in and marvel because they have just seen us fighting on TV,” Navarro said. “And I just think you make a conscious decision, ‘okay, I am going to talk to this person. … I’m going to try to listen to what they say and tell them how I feel.’ I do draw a line on conspiracy theorists and white supremacists and racists and bigots.”

2021-05-12,AU,Democrat,"Editor's note: The subheading of this story has been corrected with proper spelling of Brock's name.
Outgoing Student Government President Eric Brock’s call to establish a community advisory board over the American University Police Department in February has made progress over the last month, including meetings with University leadership and more concrete plans in development. 
While the plan is still in its early stages, Fanta Aw, vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence at AU, confirmed that Brock’s idea is under consideration after being submitted to Douglas Kudravetz, the outgoing CFO and vice president who oversees AUPD. 
The next step, Aw said, is to develop a more detailed proposal. 
Brock’s plan for the Police Oversight Committee involves three steps. First, implementing a community oversight board over AUPD that would provide accountability and an avenue for community members to make their voices heard on the role of the department. After step two — accountability — is achieved, the majority of the board could vote on a possible step three: defunding the department.
The oversight board would be a transition, Brock said. 
“As a community, we come to the consensus that there needs to be community accountability for AUPD, which then establishes the community oversight for AUPD, then handles all the oversight, handles all the policy recommendations, it moves it out of HR into a more community-oriented format,” Brock said. “Then, that’s where it starts to come to the question — when you’re talking about policies, you’re also talking about defunding.”
According to Brock’s plan, the board would be made up of students, faculty and staff who can formally advocate for changes to AUPD. It would provide a space for the community to share their experiences with the department and to suggest changes and adaptations to benefit the campus as a whole. 
Ideally, Brock said he wants the board located high in AU’s power structure, rather than being relegated to a small, relatively powerless SG committee that he believes administrators could easily ignore. Both the University’s vice president of campus life and the chief financial officer need to sit on it, as their presence in a room with students and faculty will have more of a “bite,” he said. Brock hopes that decisions made in this context will be binding.
But what do oversight and defunding look like? Brock acknowledged that the words mean different things to everyone, but his vision involves moving money from what he terms a more “militarized” AUPD into student programs, the health center, counseling center and the Center for Diversity and Inclusion. Most importantly, he wants to see more investment in students.
However, he’s not interested in collecting signatures or campaigning on the issue again. Brock was elected to advocate, he said, and he’s not concerned about student buy-in, especially during a pandemic. Instead, if you’ve got an opinion, he encourages you to reach out directly.
“For far too long, we’ve waited for the University to take action that would protect Black students,” Brock said in an email to The Eagle. “I don’t think we need to campaign for buy-in. In fact, I think it’s long overdue. And the conversations in the Black community have reflected that for generations.”
It’s absolutely vital, he said, that affinity organizations, students of color and especially Black students are given the platform to oversee and advocate for change surrounding AUPD. Communities of color are disproportionately policed across the U.S., and protests against AUPD in recent years underline the issue. 
Brock isn’t the only student leader calling for the implementation of an oversight board. Christian Damiana, the ANC 3D07 commissioner and a junior in the School of Public Affairs, said he’s “absolutely” in favor of the idea.
“Even when things are going well, there’s still things that students will have opinions about and should be given an opportunity to share,” Damiana said. “First off is how much money is being spent on AUPD. Are those resources that could be better allocated elsewhere?”
While Damiana doesn’t have a firm position on defunding, he believes that students deserve the opportunity to voice their opinions. He’s also concerned about the relationship between AUPD and D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department, an organization dogged by controversy over police brutality and misconduct in recent years. 
The MPD did not respond to The Eagle’s request for comment. 
Damiana also hopes that the proposed board might include local residents, not just campus community members. Some have had experiences with AUPD, he said, and although most see the department positively, its presence affects much of the surrounding area. 
Interested students should reach out to him, the ANC and President Sylvia Burwell’s office, Damiana said.
Police defunding and abolition have also garnered support from several student organizations. The Asian-American Student Union, Latinx and American Student Organization, Muslim Student Association, AU College Democrats and AU PRIDE cosigned a statement in August, stating that the University “must set an example of what inclusion truly means and abolish AUPD.”
The statement notes disparities in the University’s budget. AUPD and Parking and Commuter Services operated with over $8 million in the fiscal year 2020 while the Office of Campus Life, which is home to 17 different offices including the Counseling Center, received $17 million.
“It’s about reallocating funds to prevention methods because really, the police department is reactionary,” said Jeremy Ward, president of AU College Democrats. “The social services are more preventative. It’s shifting, on campus, money from a reactionary department to an underfunded, preventative department.”
Unlike the existing campus police advisory board at the University of Michigan, which staffs two students, two faculty members and two staff members, Ward said that he would like to see an oversight committee with a larger operating staff.
“The composition of the panel has to look like the University,” Ward said. “That being said, you want to have affinity groups at the table. NAACP should be at the table, BSU or other Black groups, other minority groups and organizations that often don’t get the spotlight. You also want to have students who may not be in on-campus leadership. It has to span different classes. Members of HPAC and the counseling center should be there.”
The conversation of police abolition has been at the forefront since, and even before, the nationwide movement in the summer of 2020. Brock said that while defunding is a possibility in the future, all he’s asking for right now is oversight and a seat at the table. More, he hopes, will come later, once student voices are reliably included in institutional decision-making. 
Brock’s proposal is flexible — a vital component of negotiating with the University, he said. He’s learned that it’s all about compromise, even if that means keeping plans relatively vague for a period. 
Once the University provides him with more comprehensive information about AUPD, such as its budget and policies, Brock plans to get more specific with his request. However, he doesn’t plan to compromise on everything. 
“We’re not interested in defunding small amounts,” Brock said. “We’re not abolishing, but we’re also not interested in getting bargaining chips, right? We want to make sure that this is a proportional amount that actually creates a smart investment in our students, specifically our BIPOC students.”
Brock’s term as student body president has recently ended. While he hopes students will continue the initiative, he recognizes that’s not a guarantee. He’s planning to continue working on the proposal, and has meetings scheduled with University stakeholders, he said. 
“I hope after this pandemic that people really start to question these systemic issues as they have this past summer, and really sit down and start to think, ‘We can use this organization, we can use these sugar-coated positions to really change the dynamics on campus, we can organize in a way that we used to as a people in terms of the civil rights movement,’” Brock said.

2021-08-02,AU,Democrat,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
Despite its reputation for politics and international affairs, American University boasts a growing population of science majors. A tight-knit community of five, the science students spoke with The Seagle at the grand opening of the new science building last week.
“Sophomore year, I spent $26.99 on a hard copy of Mary Wollstonecraft’s ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Women’ just so I could use the front cover to conceal my Calculus textbook,” rising senior Daniya Newman said. 
While Newman lamented financial losses, others grieved the loss of time spent trying to fit in with their peers. 
“My first year at AU, I struggled to make friends. As an alternative to Greek life, I familiarized myself with common topics in international relations,” neuroscience major Travis Massey said. “I started with the anarchical structure of the global order and spiraled from there, eventually publishing a piece in AU’s undergraduate research journal ‘Clocks and Clouds’ on the long-run viability of democratic peace theory.” 
Massey looks forward to pursuing his goal of becoming a chemist without the pressure to fit in with the IR majors. 
Other student interviewees included Yasmin Ayad and Nick Johnson, both of whom are data science majors and occupy a unique space between the “in” and “out” groups. While Ayad completes her homework in the bathroom, Johnson opts not to complete it at all. 
“The decision to forgo homework entirely was very hard,” said Johnson, “but ultimately worth the public humiliation it would have cost me to pull up an Excel sheet in public.” Ayad nodded in agreement. 
“But was it worth the internal humiliation of succumbing to the external pressures of the student body and in turn becoming somewhat of an undriven cattle roaming aimlessly towards a false promise of reward?” Massey added. 
Johnson’s face turned red. “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just trying to play devil’s advocate.”
When President Sylvia Burwell finally snipped the ribbon and unveiled the bright halls of the new building, the students erupted with applause. They marveled at their newfound place of study, beaming at the sight of empty tables devoid of IR students and CLEG majors. 
Undoubtedly, the day marked a new beginning for all five science majors alike. 
During editing, The Seagle was informed that there are only four science majors, as “Nick Johnson” and “Nicholas Johnson” are the same person.

2021-10-12,AU,Democrat,"The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
This year’s display of sticky note messages on the inside of residence hall windows lacked the pizazz students had come to expect from their peers.
The messages, made out of hundreds of individual sticky notes, reflected a steep decline from previous years in terms of quantity, variety, and creativity, according to students familiar with the situation.
“During the Democratic primaries in 2020, everyone would spell out which candidate they were supporting,” junior Linda Estrada said. “Now it’s like a heart here, a smiley face there. How are we supposed to keep up our reputation as one of the most liberal colleges in the country with those sort of amateur tactics?”
Only 30 percent of this year’s sticky note designs have anything to do with electoral politics, according to an Eagle tally — an all-time low for the University. 
Another point of contention among students concerned is the perception that fewer students care about decorating their windows this year. 
“I remember in my freshman year someone organized the whole fifth floor of Letts to spell out a sentence going down the line of windows,” senior Delia Mathis said. “Now the freshmen claim they have more important things to do like studying for class. Give me a break!”
Students are not the only ones impacted by this trend.
“I’m really miffed that students aren’t taking their window decorations seriously,” said Celia Bennett, director of undergraduate admissions. “A robust sticky note display on the residence hall windows can help us entice prospective parents. It shows them that AU kids don’t have enough time to drink and carouse if they’re designing, planning and arranging intricate sticky note designs on their windows.” 
Students reported a conspiracy theory circulating, which implicates disgruntled George Washington University students in the demise of AU’s creative sticky note messages on windows. The connection between GWU students and the lack of creativity of AU students remains to be seen.

2021-12-09,AU,Democrat,"File photo of the White House.
Investments in public transport, the building of electronic vehicle charging stations and the rebuilding of roads and bridges are all changes D.C. residents can expect after the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act last month.
On Nov. 6, 2021, Congress voted to pass the bill, a bipartisan deal that aims to rebuild infrastructure across the country, as well as expand access to services such as drinking water and internet access. 
The infrastructure bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden on Nov. 15. According to a statement released by the White House, the legislation will add an average 1.5 million jobs per year for the next 10 years.
Claire Whitman, a junior in the School of International Service and the president of the American University College Democrats, said she is in favor of the infrastructure bill.
“I’m from a rural state,” Whitman said. “I think we can really see the impacts of rural broadband of crumbling roads and bridges, that’s very basic infrastructure, but also some of the more modern technological investments.”
Whitman said the fact that the infrastructure bill passed in such a bipartisan manner was a big deal to her.
According to the White House, D.C. is expected to receive over $1.2 billion in funding toward the improvement of public transportation over the next five years.
Dr. Andrew Ballard, an assistant professor of government in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes it is good Congress collects and redistributes money toward projects that are beneficial to the public.
“That said, there are all sorts of infrastructure problems in the United States that didn’t make it into this bill,” Ballard said. “So there’s always more work to do. And this is kind of how policymaking in the United States is set up, that it is a lot easier to have incremental changes rather than extremely large changes.”
The passage of the infrastructure bill comes as Build Back Better, a framework created by the Biden Administration, heads to the U.S. Senate for debate and a vote.
Build Back Better, which passed the House of Representatives on Nov. 19, promises to combat climate change, provide universal and free preschool and expand the U.S.’s affordable health care program.
Sal Cottone, a freshman in the SIS and a member of the Sunrise Movement at AU, a youth-led organization dedicated to fighting for climate and environmental justice said both the infrastructure bill and Build Back Better need to be passed together.
“If we kept the infrastructure bill as is, we would have saw nothing towards climate change, it would have actually funded more fossil fuel production and in turn, would have basically went against everything that we were fighting for, which is why we have Build Back Better, which in our opinion, needs to be passed hand in hand with the infrastructure bill,” Cottone said. “You can’t just have one or the other, they both have to go hand in hand.”
While Cottone is worried that Democratic Senator Joe Manchin will vote no on the Build Back Better bill, he remains hopeful.
“In general, I’m hopeful because even if he votes no, I know our generation will rise up like we’ve been doing and even in a bigger fashion, because this is the first step to combat the climate crisis,” Cottone said. “And if it’s voted no on that, we have nothing left.”
The Sunrise Movement at AU is currently on their third week of organizing a sit-in protest for the Build Back Better bill. 
According to Whitman, both the infrastructure and Build Back Better bills address the impacts that these investments have on people’s lives.
“As a Democrat, and as a student who represents the Democratic Party on campus, I’m pleased to see that the party is making these investments, because I think that's really what they were elected to do.”

2022-01-10,AU,Democrat,"American University’s Disabled Student Union is petitioning University administrators to require frequent coronavirus testing of all faculty and students in the name of equal and safe education for community members with disabilities.
The petition says that the University’s lack of enforcement of safety measures limits students’ access to the right to a safe and equal education guaranteed to them in Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. By testing community members at least twice a month, the University could help to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable students in the process, according to DSU.
According to DSU President Katherine Greenstein, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs,  DSU met in December and expressed a number of frustrations with the University’s existing testing policies.
“Our members were feeling very frustrated, because we’ve spent two years watching our community kind of be seen as disposable,” Greenstein said.
After expressing these frustrations, a member suggested students take matters into their own hands and write a petition. 
“I drafted it in a night … I had to write it, I got a bunch of people to look over it, I posted it,” Greenstein said. “And then it’s been kind of a whirlwind since because it picked up quite a bit of attention.”
The petition now has over 1,600 signatures and has garnered support from a number of campus organizations, including the AU College Democrats and the SPA Undergraduate Council. Sixteen members of the American University Student Government Undergraduate Senate later signed their own letter of support for the petition. 
“Not only does mandated testing provide additional protection for the health of the student body and the DC community, but it follows suit with universities such as George Washington University, Cornell University and others who have implemented similar measures to increase campus safety,” SG Senate representatives wrote in their letter.
The Disability+ Faculty and Staff Affinity Group, co-founded in part by Tanja Aho and Anna Cook, also expressed its support for the petition, helping to publicize it and garner support. 
“We believe that the Disabled Student Union is absolutely correct in asking AU to step up and do better and provide more safety and protection for its students through regular testing. To us, the safety of students and, of course, the faculty and staff as well should always come first before any other considerations,” Aho said. “And if we want to resume in person classes and be back in community, we need to do so in a safe way that protects all of our community members.”
In a recent question and answer session with SG President Chyna Brodie, Brodie said that the University is unable to mandate frequent testing due to limitations posed by its partnership with external testing party ShieldT3 and a lack of an in-house lab at the University to process testing results. 
“​​This petition … does not represent viable change here at American University because it fails to acknowledge the capacity of our school to conduct primary COVID-19 testing compared to other university systems,” Brodie said in the Q&A. 
In an email to The Eagle, Elizabeth Deal, University spokesperson, wrote that the administration is “requiring testing for all AU community members … before and once returning to campus/affiliated AU buildings.”
“We continue to employ a comprehensive approach using all available tools, while following the data to mitigate risk. We will also continue to review and adapt our policies and protocols as necessary to ensure the ongoing safety of our community,” Deal wrote. “We have offered testing since the start of the academic year and the data shows our community is utilizing testing, particularly during higher risk periods, such as travel and during surges.”
Cook said in an interview with The Eagle that she feels privileged to be working remotely and knows many faculty and staff members who still feel unsafe. 
“It’s not just something on this student's mind, it was also something on the mind of faculty and staff as well, especially when we were talking about meeting students face to face in small offices,” Cook said.
Greenstein emphasized the positive impact that mandatory testing would have on DSU members and on the University as a whole.
“Our organization was anxious, our members were anxious, we were struggling, because it is hard to handle being scared for your life and trying to learn at a collegiate level at the same time,” Greenstein said.
For Greenstein, the decision to start the petition was a sign that they were no longer willing to wait for the University to take action. 
“The University should be including marginalized communities in discussion of policy and disabled people especially should be especially privy to conversations surrounding public health,” Greenstein said. “This is what affects us. That is the whole point. And the fact that we weren’t included in that discussion, the fact that our voices haven't been heard in that discussion is why the petition became necessary in the first place because they weren't listening to us.”

2022-02-10,AU,Democrat,"In an Advisory Neighborhood Commission Meeting for ANC 3D on Feb. 2, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton answered questions about her activity in Congress and advocacy for D.C. statehood.
The district’s non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives answered questions about the “Build Back Better” plan, pushing priorities forward while Democrats retain Congressional control, mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on the city and her efforts to achieve D.C. statehood.
Norton outlined her efficacy as a representative and detailed how she has helped the district in Congress recently. 
“I was rated the most effective House Democrat by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, and last Congress, I was rated the second most effective non-full committee chair among House Democrats,” Norton said. “This Congress, of the 80 bills I have introduced thus far 18 have moved, at least through committee and two have been signed into law.”
Attendees were asked to submit their questions for Norton before the meeting, most of which covered activities in Congress and their impacts on district residents. 
Unifying Democratic control under the threat of losing control of Congress is a priority for 2022, but is limited by the filibuster, Norton said. 
“The House has passed my D.C. statehood bill and my bill to give them air control over the D.C. National Guard, but they can't pass because of the filibuster,” Norton said. 
However, Norton’s provision to increase the annual D.C. tuition access grant awards from $10,000 to $15,000 in the D.C. Appropriations Bill is likely to succeed despite the filibuster. 
With regards to D.C. statehood, Norton said it feels “very close, yet very far away right now.” Fifty-four percent of the American people support D.C. statehood, and understanding this and mobilization are key to getting statehood passed, Norton said.
“The biggest hurdles to pass are the filibuster and getting Americans activated on this issue,” Norton said. “Republicans in the House and Senate have introduced more than 20 bills and amendments this Congress to overturn D.C. policies. Six members have tried to overturn D.C. vaccine policies of all things. I will defeat all these efforts just as I have defeated virtually every effort to overturn D.C. laws in more than a decade.”
Many of the questions from the public centered on the power Congressional legislation has over the district, and Norton made it clear that D.C. interests are her main priority. 
“As a matter of home rule, I don’t weigh in on council legislation,” Norton said. “My job is to defend in Congress whatever legislation Congress passes, so if I weighed in, that would be held against the district, whatever passes.”
Norton detailed the way the country’s COVID-19 policies have failed and expressed frustration with the misinformation and disinformation that have, “caused many needless deaths,” in response to a question about how these policies will continue to impact locals. 
“I’m very concerned that we are no better prepared to confront new challenges in this pandemic or future pandemics. Our healthcare workforce is exhausted and quitting in large numbers and we have an underfunded and fragmented public health system,” Norton said. “COVID will likely be around forever and we will need to be prepared to relax and scale up public health measures based on what the virus does.”
Norton closed by answering several more locally based questions from members of the ANC 3D neighborhood and providing questioners with relevant contacts in her office.

2022-04-11,AU,Democrat,"Congressman and American University alumnus Jim McGovern (MA-2) discussed his career and the political issues facing the country at an event hosted by the Kennedy Political Union on Wednesday.
School of Public Affairs Dean Vicki Wilkins moderated the event and asked McGovern questions about his life, political work and perspective on current events. 
McGovern began by describing his experience as a student at AU, looking back on the people, places and opportunities that shaped his undergraduate years. 
“I loved every minute,” he said. “I had some great courses, I made some great friends who are lifelong friends to this day, I had incredible discussions and I had this incredible internship with George McGovern that’s still among my most cherished memories on Capitol Hill.” 
Upholding this culture of activism, McGovern mentioned how he led a protest against his graduation speaker, economist George Gilder, where he convinced several students and their parents to turn their backs to the stage during Gilder’s speech. 
“He had written some pretty controversial things, like there was no discrimination against Black women,” he said. “We all had black armbands on and we stood and turned our backs in protest when he spoke.” 
McGovern said that losing his first congressional campaign in 1994 taught him important lessons that helped him win on his second bid, despite little support from his personal and political circles. 
“When I announced [my run] both times, nobody thought it was a good idea,” he said. “I had never run for anything in my life other than class treasurer when I was a senior in high school, so there was not a lot of establishment support.” 
McGovern said his decision to run again in 1996 was fueled by a desire to run a better race the second time and a belief that he was more equipped for the job than the incumbent candidate. 
“The most important thing was that I wanted to do it,” he said. “It enabled me to get up every day in spite of the odds and campaign my heart out.” 
McGovern has won reelection in each subsequent term since his first successful bid in 1996. Some highlights of his career include starting the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, which provides school meals to nearly nine million of the world’s poorest children, and the Innovative Approaches to Literacy Program, an initiative that strives to improve literacy skills for children and students from birth through 12th grade. 
Another pivotal moment in his career took place on Jan. 6 of last year. McGovern was inside the Capitol Chamber overseeing the certification of the electoral college when the crowd of insurrectionists infiltrated the building. 
“It was really a terrorist attack, not just on the building, but on our democracy,” McGovern said. “I was in the chair, I took over for Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, and I was hearing shouts in the corridor … I was getting texts from my daughter saying ‘Where are you? What are you doing?’” 
McGovern said the emotional effects of what he witnessed that day still linger. 
“When I walk to work and I see the Capitol building, I still get emotional when I think about what it symbolized, and to see people ripping it apart,” he said. 
Speaking of the rioters, McGovern said, “Looking at their faces, if you asked me to describe what hate looks like, I would tell you it is what I saw in the eyes of these people.” He added that the rioters were there “to nullify and overturn the will of the American people.”
McGovern expressed dismay at his Republican colleagues who continue to downplay the events of that day. 
“I serve with people who say that the people who attacked us were patriots,” he said. “I can barely look at them, I can’t get into an elevator with them … 140 Capitol police officers were injured, staffers were traumatized … so to glorify any part of that day to me is sick.” 
McGovern also warned against letting history repeat itself, saying another coup “will happen again” if those involved are not held accountable. 
Asked how Congress can move forward, McGovern said that the upcoming midterm elections are a “crossroads” for protecting democracy against a future of “authoritarianism” and “fascism.” 
“If Republicans win the House or the Senate in the midterms, that is a reward to Trump, it’s a reward to those who are the ones who were cheering on those who wanted to nullify the election,” he said. “I think that strengthens their ranks, and it means the Republican party moves more and more in that direction.” 
Despite the circumstances, McGovern said he still holds hope that democracy will prevail, but added that protecting democracy is contingent on people being politically active. 
“It's not enough for us to be able to think good thoughts or to be able to argue in a classroom over policy,” he said. “If you really care about this stuff, you’ll find a way to put your energy into something of service.” 
Born into a family of small business owners, McGovern developed an interest in politics after seeing the economic challenges that his parents faced running their liquor store in Worcester, Massachusetts. Once he became a student at AU, McGovern worked his way through the ranks, interning in the office of Senator George McGovern, to whom he isn’t related, before graduating with a B.A. in history and working in the office of Democratic Congressman Joe Moakley. 
McGovern was asked to share some tips with students looking to build a career in politics. His advice: “Just run.” 
“Lightning can strike,” he said. “If you wanna do it, do it, and give it your best.”

2022-07-05,AU,Democrat,"A mural commemorates the history of Tenleytown
Many incumbents emerged victorious in citywide primaries and progressives succeeded in council races in the D.C. primary election held on June 21. The election centered around issues such as housing and homelessness, policing and crime, education and transportation.
Although the June 21 election was the primary election, D.C. is historically a Democratic stronghold and Democratic primary winners almost always go on to win the general election.
Mayor Muriel Bowser won the Democratic nomination for mayor again, likely making her the second ever D.C. mayor to hold the office for three or more terms, with Marion Barry being the first. Bowser won 49 percent of the vote, beating out more progressive challengers such as Robert White, who trailed her by only 10,000 votes, with close to 41 percent of the vote.
In Ward 3, progressive Matthew Frumin secured the nomination for the seat left open by former Councilmember Mary Cheh. In the weeks leading up to the election, several other progressive candidates strategically dropped out of the race in order to avoid splitting the progressive vote and afford Frumin the votes necessary to win against more moderate Democrat Eric Goulet.
In another open race, in Ward 5, progressive Zachary Parker, secured a win against his six competitors, winning approximately 44 percent of the vote. Brian Schwalb is set to succeed Karl Racine as D.C. attorney general, who served as the city’s first elected attorney general. Until 2015, D.C.’s mayor appointed the city’s attorney generals.
Progressive Ward 1 councilmember Brianne Nadeau retained her seat, winning 48 percent of the vote, as did Charles Allen who ran unopposed for the nomination in Ward 6.
Incumbents won their races across the rest of the district Eleanor Holmes Norton won 87 percent of the vote, securing the Democratic nomination for the D.C. delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives primary. Phil Mendelson held onto his position as D.C. council chair, but defeated candidate Erin Palmer only by about 8,000 votes. Anita Bonds, councilmember-at-large, won her primary, a citywide race, with a plurality of the vote.
Turnout in the election was at a decade high, at around 32 percent, approximately 130,000 of D.C.'s around 410,000 eligible voters. Primary election turnout had not been above 30 percent since 2010, when 37 percent voted. In the 2020 primary, turnout was slightly lower than this year, at 28 percent, and in 2018, only 19 percent of eligible voters turned out to polls. 
According to the D.C. Board of Elections website, two thirds of votes were cast via mail-in or special ballot. Election board spokesman Nick Jacobs told the Washington Post that about 30,000 ballots were submitted via drop box or mail on Tuesday alone, and the board was “stunned at the magnitude.”
Few Republicans ran in the primaries, however, those who did, such as David Krucoff in Ward 3, or Giuseppe Niosi for the at-large seat, were virtually unopposed and will face their Democratic opponents in the general election this November.

2022-09-06,AU,Democrat,"This article is an opinion piece and does not necessarily reflect the views of The Eagle and its staff.
Global warming inspired a global movement. Activists from New York to New Delhi are united in calling for decarbonizing the earth’s electricity. Efforts to address the inequities created and deepened by climate change, collectively dubbed “climate justice,” is a growing movement of its own. Yet, this movement is missing a critical component: Addressing the power structures through which our electric grid is administered.
We must transition to renewable energy, but the vision for who will shape the transition is underdeveloped. The management of our electric grid in the United States is undemocratic. Taking on the fossil fuel industry is a wider task than most people realize. Yes, it requires taking on oil companies and yes, it involves taking on sellout politicians. But we can do both of these things, and control over the transition will still largely be in the hands of monopolies and other unrepresentative institutions that manage the electric grid.
Tackling global warming means rethinking our electricity generation, so developing a new vision for our electricity management is paramount. A talented group of almost two dozen American University students is working on doing just that. The Energy Democracy Coalition (EDCO) is a student-run filmmaking non profit organization based right here at American University. By highlighting a diverse array of community efforts to re-think who controls the grid, EDCO’s goal is to show people around our country and the world how they can take power over the grid and save the planet. So what is EDCO’s vision for the future of the grid?
Empowering communities to have a say in how they get their electricity, often referred to as “energy democracy,” is the core of EDCO’s vision because energy democracy is an angle for climate action that bypasses federal gridlock, cuts emissions and empowers communities in one fell swoop. 
How does energy democracy work? The key is scalability and decentralization. The chief frustration of the climate movement today is its inability to swing the world’s major institutions towards substantive action decisively. By scaling down efforts to a community-by-community approach, things change.
Let’s do a thought experiment: Imagine what it would take to make the whole U.S. stop contributing to climate change. It’s a massive, overwhelming task. It requires that we electrify almost three hundred million cars, heat a hundred and forty million homes without gas, redesign air travel, rethink maritime shipping and the list goes on. At the nationwide scale of reference, fighting climate change seems almost impossible.
Now, let's imagine something else. Picture instead what it would take to make just your hometown carbon neutral. Suddenly, the world shrinks, and the impossible tasks of climate action crystallize into manageable goals. Electricity, for example, is often the largest emissions contributor. A single institution likely administers your electricity, be it a utility company or a co-op. Transition that institution from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, and you’ve already come a long way in reducing emissions.
If individual responsibility is the great myth of the climate movement, then the power of community action is the climate movement’s best-kept secret. The same institutions that engage in price gouging, racism, monopoly control over public goods and unaccountable leadership hold the keys to climate action. From Boulder, Colorado to Jackson, Mississippi and beyond, grassroots efforts to take back the grid are already leading to reduced electricity bills, corporate accountability and empowered communities. By amplifying these efforts, we can create a climate-vision that is encouraging rather than burdensome.
Democratizing the grid is decentralized because the grid is managed differently around the country. In some cases, energy democracy means holding electricity cooperatives accountable to their bylaws, electing representative new leaders and re-centering community interests. In other cases, energy democracy means the municipalization of utility companies. Municipalization means the electricity is managed by elected leaders rather than unaccountable bureaucrats. It can also mean fighting monopolies through deregulation and allowing for competitive, renewable options to cut costs and emissions.
Deregulation and municipalization appeal to opposite ends of the political spectrum and display the versatility of energy democracy. Because energy democracy is focused on community needs and efforts, it defies myopic political characterizations of “left versus right” and creates a vision for climate action that anyone can get excited about. Sharing this vision for rethinking our energy grid can give the climate movement the makeover it needs.
Energy democracy brings people together to reclaim power, making it politically effective. Even climate skeptics are interested in having more control over their lives and their wallets. Energy democracy does just that while building a framework for climate action that replaces stagnation with empowerment and abdication with action. 
If you’re interested in EDCO’s vision for energy democracy and want to get involved, we need your help. Whether your forte is in social media, filmmaking, research or advocacy, we hope you’ll join our team.

2022-10-10,AU,Democrat,"Protestors gather outside of the Supreme Court on Friday, June 24. 
Following the Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, national uncertainty has persisted about how abortion access may change and how states may suffer disparate impacts. As the midterm elections loom, voters will weigh abortion as a definitive issue when electing future decision-makers.
The Dobbs v. Jackson decision returned legislative power over abortion to Congress and state governments. Since then, states have imposed abortion bans and restrictions, several more are underway and further such laws may be implemented if the Republican Party gains sufficient control in state legislatures. Federal bans and restrictions are also possible, though not at all likely under the current Congress. 
Research from Pew Research Center suggests that the issue of reproductive rights will be an important issue in the midterm election. Voter registration has surged among women, which points to the fact that abortion is a mobilizing issue for voters.
In D.C., abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy, but since the district does not have statehood, the future of abortion rights in D.C. differs from states throughout the country.
Congress controls aspects of D.C., as it is a federal district. Though D.C. does have a city council, Congress has exclusive control over the district, according to the Constitution.
As the midterm elections approach in November, which party holds Congress could impact abortion rights in D.C. and nationally.
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has proposed a 15-week federal abortion ban, which would ban all abortions after 15 weeks, with limited exceptions carved out for rape, incest or threats to the bearer’s life. This ban cannot pass in the current Democratic-controlled Senate, but this could change if control shifts to the GOP in the midterm elections.
Any abortion legislation, either in its own bill or as a rider on unrelated legislation, would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president.
In 2011, former President Barack Obama signed a law that had an abortion-related rider attached to it. In signing the bill, the rider portion went into effect, banning local D.C. dollars from going to abortions for low-income people in the district. 
Additionally, abortion-related measures previously passed by D.C. City Council would be void if faced by anti-abortion legislation, D.C. local news reporter Chelsea Cirruzzo said in an interview with The Eagle. 
Potential abortion restrictions in D.C. would disproportionately impact Black residents. In 2015, more than 60 percent of abortions in the district were sought by Black residents. 
Abortion is still legal in D.C. and the broader DMV area. Despite this, there may be barriers even to legal abortion, such as potential costs.
An abortion through Planned Parenthood in D.C. can range in cost from $578 to $2,008. While financial assistance is available, this is an additional hoop abortion-seekers must jump through.
Organizations such as DC Abortion Fund also provide financial assistance to abortion-seekers. Such nonprofits rely on fundraising through events and campaigns, as well as one-off donations to provide this type of support. Other regional abortion funds include the Baltimore Abortion Fund and the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund.
Another barrier abortion-seekers must overcome is having to face anti-choice protesters in order to physically enter clinics. 
The Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force provides volunteer escorts, also known as “clinic defenders,” to reproductive health clinics in D.C., Maryland and Virginia.
“It is a scary moment, for a lot of people, that moment of walking into the clinic. Because the narratives that are out there about abortion are often so demonizing and scary,” said one local clinic defender, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons. “And so we're out there to make sure that protesters don't get out of control, don’t get too close to the patient. Or if they do have those conversations, to be able to say, ‘Hey, it's okay, we can just go inside.’”
At AU, students with reproductive health concerns may seek guidance from the Student Health Center and the Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services.
According to Dr. Ariel White, the university physician at the Student Health Center, the center provides “comprehensive reproductive health services for all students, regardless of gender identification,” as well as pregnancy counseling. The center does not provide abortions, but can refer students to the appropriate resources.
The Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services can provide counseling and supportive services, including for students who have experienced sexual assault, said its director, Dr. Jacquelin Darby. These services are all confidential.
“Our main goal is to support students and make sure that they are well, and so we will work to continue to do that,” Darby said.

2022-11-07,AU,Democrat,"The 2022 midterm elections are fast approaching this Tuesday, Nov. 8. On the federal level, all 435 House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 Senate seats will be contested. Additionally, races for state governors are being held for 36 of the 50 states. 
Currently, Democrats have a federal government trifecta, meaning they control the presidency and both chambers of Congress, the House and the Senate. The 117th United States Congress consists of 212 Republicans and 220 Democrats in the House of Representatives and a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties. However, the Democrats' hold could change with the results of the election, which will determine the 118th US Congress. 
In D.C., multiple city offices are on the ballot. Voters will vote for the open Advisory Neighborhood Commissions seats, as well as for mayor, in which AU alumna and Democrat Muriel Bowser hopes to secure a third term. Additionally, voters throughout the district will choose in races for the At-Large Council, council members for some wards, attorney general, the delegate to Congress and school board members. 
Jenn Rafter, a Ward 6 resident who has lived in D.C. for 12 years, said that residents are more frustrated than in years past: “I think that people are a little more frustrated than they have been … people are really upset about the cost of housing and the crime increase so I wouldn’t be totally shocked if there were a couple of … surprising results.”
One major issue that residents of D.C. have been fighting for is gaining statehood and making the district the 51st U.S. state. Leah Mackie, a 2010 alumna of AU’s Washington College of Law, expressed doubts of the possibility of statehood in the near future. 
“Until we have a remarkable advantage on the Democratic side in the House and Senate, it’s going to continue to be a struggle,” she said.“That being said, I think a lot more people outside of D.C. realize that it’s an issue and realize that it’s unfair.”
For the D.C. election, there is also ballot question Initiative 82. If passed, it would incrementally increase the minimum wage for tipped employees each year until 2027, which is currently sitting at $5.35, to match that of non-tipped employees, which is at $16.10. Employers are required by law to make up for their workers’ pay if the tips don’t reach minimum wage. 
Both Rafter and Mackie said they understand both sides but don’t support the initiative. Mackie, who was a server and bartender for years, doesn’t think people understand how the pandemic has damaged the restaurant industry. Particularly, independent bar and restaurant owners suffer. 
“I waited tables and bartended for years and years and years. I never made less than double minimum wage … I probably averaged $50 an hour,” she said. “The tip structure was very incentivizing to really hustle and provide great customer service. When you start shifting the onus of the payroll to those folks [small and independent restaurants and bars] I really worry that it’s going to drive some more out of the industry.”
Rafter shared similar views. “There’s more that could be done to support tipped workers. But I don’t think that raising the minimum wage that high is going to really benefit them at the end of the day,” she said. “Most tipped workers make more than what the minimum wage is and I think that it will discourage people from tipping.”
Proponents of the initiative believe that tipped workers should receive a higher minimum wage on top of tips, and that the current system makes income too unpredictable. Additionally, they say that the two-tiered wage system is discriminatory towards people of color and that workers should not be primarily dependent on strangers’ choices of how much to tip. 
Voter outreach on campus
Jackson Reynolds, a junior in the School of Public Affairs and the vice president and director of political affairs for AU College Democrats, said the organization has been doing a lot of voter outreach work for the upcoming election. Among canvassing and bringing candidates such as Bowser to campus, phone banking has been the club’s main focus recently and they have made over 8,100 voter contact attempts so far this semester, according to Reynolds. 
“By doing [voter outreach], it’s also making sure that our elections are running smoothly, and making sure that everybody has the chance to vote and making sure their vote is counted,” Reynolds said.
Voters expressed enthusiasm for certain issues on the state level, such as abortion and reproductive rights, criminal justice reform and environmental concerns. 
“I know we hear this every election, but it is the truth in that this election is a major election that will determine our future,” Reynolds said. “Most of the issues … happen at the local level. That’s most of what the focus is on.” 
Other organizations around campus have also been helping community members with the voting process. AU Votes is a nonpartisan group that was founded over the summer by staff that guides students with absentee ballots, as well as registering to vote in D.C. The initiative stresses the importance of student voting and has helped over 500 students go through the process of requesting a ballot, according to Jacob Wilson, co-founder and co-chair of AU Votes and a first year advisor and AUx instructor at AU. 
“We are going to have close elections across the country and young people are going to be the deciding votes,” Wilson said. “Young people choosing to use their voice and exercise their right to vote is going to be consequential.”
Emma Baumgarten, a freshman in the School of International Studies and AU Votes student volunteer, expressed her excitement and feeling of empowerment of being able to vote for the first time this year, and emphasized how important it is for people to vote. 
“While it’s not a presidential election, it’s still important and I think sometimes the importance of a midterm election is diminished because it’s not a presidential election … the votes still matter,” Baumgarten said.

2022-11-09,AU,Democrat,"For many students at American University, the most politically active college campus in the U.S., Election Day is sacred.
This election cycle, both leading up to the midterm elections and on Election Day itself, some students devoted their time to phone banking, working on campaigns, registering others to vote and monitoring the results of races by attending watch parties.
Approaching Election Day: AU Votes and campaigning
For some students, Election Day and the time leading up to it was spent encouraging their peers to vote and assisting them throughout the process.
AU Votes, a nonpartisan initiative launched this semester to help students navigate voting, helped prepare the AU community to cast their ballots leading up to the midterm elections.
“Youth vote is extremely important, and not everyone feels confident in voting and feels comfortable voting and feels as if their voice will be heard,” said Emma Baumgarten, a freshman in the School of International Service and social media director for AU Votes. “So part of AU Vote's mission is to kind of encourage students to vote, have their voice be heard and kind of be here as a resource and as support for students.”
One of the most common problems students have been coming to AU Votes with is where they can submit their mail-in ballot, something they worked to clarify for students this election cycle.
“A lot of people didn't know where to mail their mail-in ballot, and it's simple things like that, that create such a barrier,” said Alyssa Levin, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs who is also a social media director for AU Votes. “It's just information. So we just really wanted to open up those barriers of people asking, ‘Where do we drop this off?’ ‘How can we request our mail-in ballot by mail?’ and ‘My ballot never came?’ ‘What do I do?’ There are fixes to these. And we're really just trying to close that gap in information and make sure that everyone on campus and even off campus have the opportunity to vote.”
Lucy LaVigne, a sophomore in SIS, works as the social media director for YOUth for Beto. LaVigne created social media content informing voters about Beto O’Rourke’s campaign for the Texas governor. O’Rourke lost the gubernatorial race to Republican incumbent Greg Abbott. 
According to her, making information accessible is a big help to voters leading up to Election Day.
“I really feel like it makes an impact because we get so many DMs from people about how they're going out to vote, how they made a plan, how they were inspired. And so it just was really nice to know that it makes a difference,” she said. 
LaVigne said part of the outreach goals were to help remedy deficits in voter turnout by making young people feel connected to politicians. She also cited AU’s politically engaged student body as a motivator for her work.
“In the past, there's been a really low youth turnout for elections as a whole,” she said. “And so when we create these [posts] for Beto, our goal was to make sure that young people felt heard, they felt seen by a campaign and also that they know that they're vote matters.” 
Christian Damiana, a graduate student in SPA, said that AU helped prepare him both for his role as Matt Frumin’s campaign communications director and serving as AU’s Commissioner for Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D07. 
“My education definitely helped me significantly, and gave me the skills and the motivation to serve others and to make sure that we're doing the best to be stewards of our neighbors,” Damiana said.
According to Damiana, Frumin’s campaign, which emerged victorious for Ward 3’s seat on the DC Council, made a point to reach out to AU students that make up almost 10 percent of Ward 3’s residents.
“AU students historically have not voted in large numbers,” Damiana said. “And that's something that I find unfortunate and so, throughout the campaign we did work to do outreach to AU students. My understanding is that yesterday and, a few days before, more AU students than normal did end up voting, both in their local ANC race and for the D.C. council.”
Ainsley Frederick, a sophomore in SPA, is another student who worked for a campaign. She worked as a lead coordinator for Youth for Patty. Patty Brooks ran to represent Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District in the house and lost to incumbent Republican Mike Flood. According to Frederick, in addition to making policy information more accessible, her role made her able to advocate on behalf of youth issues with Brooks’ campaign. 
Despite the loss, Frederick said she was glad to have the experience as their efforts have paid off in other ways. 
“I think giving people, Democrats, Republicans and independents, a hope that there is something better than what we're seeing on the national trend is really good and I'm really grateful to be a part of that,” she said.
Election Day events encouraged students to get out the vote 
AU College Democrats focused on getting out the vote in areas beyond the AU community. Throughout the afternoon of Election Day, the group held a phone bank event where student volunteers could drop by to reach out to voters. Jackson Reynolds, a junior in SPA and the vice president and director of political affairs for AU College Democrats said this gives people more insight on the issues facing other regions of the country and how that influences campaign strategies.
“Doing phone banking in particular is a really good way to allow students to get involved in close elections all across the country without actually having to physically be there,” said Reynolds. 
AU College Democrats phoned over 600 registered voters on Tuesday afternoon to ask about their plans to vote and share information about polling places, according to Reynolds.
“Being able to let people know 'hey, you do have the ability to make your voice heard here, and this is how you can do it,” Reynolds said. “There's been some people that I've talked to that are like, 'I don't support the Democrats.' Great, but here's where you still vote because at the end of the day, it is still about making sure everybody's voice is heard and has access to casting a ballot.”
In addition to making sure students knew how to get their ballots in, AU Votes stationed themselves on the quad during Election Day to answer students’ voting questions and distribute “I Voted” stickers. Students also wrote down issues compelling them to vote.
“A lot of people are getting really individual to things about them, talking about gun violence and stuff like that,” Levin said. “So it's been really, really inspiring, seeing all everyone's different motivations and how they're linked just through power. Everyone's motivations are so incredibly powerful and will make change.”
Lizzie Williamson, a senior in SIS who is registered to vote in Minnesota, a big priority was preventing election deniers from holding office.
“It became a much bigger issue to me to vote in this midterm because I would be voting in an area that has typically been very red and I'm a blue voter, for the most part,” Williamson said. “So I really wanted to put my vote towards potentially trying to eliminate election denial and kind of just increased stability within the electoral machine, essentially.”
Eli Duncan-Gilmour, a senior in SIS who is registered to vote in New York, said one of the biggest issues on his mind was voting out Republicans and blocking them from picking up more seats.
“If [Republicans] take power, you know, they've proven that they're just behaving like fascists right now. So I think that you know, not voting? It's just out of the question,” he said.
Magnolia Mead, a junior in SPA and the president of the Sunrise Movement chapter at AU, is worried that if Republicans dominate either chamber of Congress, it will be more difficult to pass effective climate policy.
“Climate policy, like the Inflation Reduction Act, won't be possible to pass,” Mead said. “Because, as we've seen, the GOP does not take climate change seriously. They're still figuring out if they even believe in it or not, many of them. So that's not going to be possible like it was last year.”
For Emma Godel, a graduate student in SPA who worked with AU Votes, the most important item on her list is voting rights.
“Everyone has different issues, you know, climate, health care, environment, LGBT rights, you know, it goes on and on,” Godel said. “But I would say that our work is especially important, because without this movement, none of those reasons will be able to make it to the polling place.”
Election night on campus
The SPA and School of Communication Undergraduate Councils and AU’s Leading Women of Tomorrow chapter hosted a midterm election watch party in SOC’s Malsi Doyle and Michael Forman Theater Tuesday night.

AU College Republicans also held an election watch party, located in the East Quad Building. The event featured food, a Fox News live stream of the midterm results and a Senate prediction game. 
Representatives of AUCR declined to be interviewed by The Eagle during Tuesday’s watch-party.
Kyra Thordsen, the SPA council president, said the midterm elections were “a really good time” for the community to come together. The event party included refreshments, MSNBC’s live coverage of the midterm results and a Kahoot quiz about elections and government. 
AU College Democrats was initially a co-sponsor of the watch-party, but removed their sponsorship to keep “things nonpartisan [and] make sure that all sides are represented,” Thordsen told The Eagle.


Sam Spivak, a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences who attended the SPA and SOC watch party, said that being on AU’s campus made them more aware of politics.
“I was pretty involved back home but now … it feels more real because I'm an adult, which is just scary to admit,” Spivak said. “I’m feeling pretty terrified right now.”
Most attendees of Tuesday’s event with the SPA and SOC Undergraduate Councils and Leading Women of Tomorrow who spoke to The Eagle said they were watching elections in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Much of the crowd cheered when MSNBC updated results for U.S. Senate elections in those states.
When MSNBC called wins for Republicans, boos took over the crowd.
Ben Piccarillo, a freshman in SPA and an undergraduate senator for the Class of 2026, told The Eagle he thought that despite a mixed mood in the room, hopes for Democratic control of Congress were too optimistic.
“There’s a lot of high spirits in here,” Piccarillo said, “but [Democrats in the crowd] shouldn’t have as high spirits.”
Anshul Shukla, a freshman in SPA and first-year fellow for programming for the SPA Undergraduate Council, said, “It was really fun to see this [event] come into fruition. I know everybody on the council worked hard.”
During the watch party, a group of students seated towards the back of the room shouted remarks about candidates as results came in, and voiced support for various Republican candidates.
Shukla and Maya Check, a first-year fellow for advocacy in the council, told The Eagle it was interesting to see many different opinions from other attendees.
“You can get a lot of different perspectives because people are from lots of different places,” Check said.

2022-11-10,AU,Democrat,"D.C.’s major power players won big in the midterm elections Tuesday, as Mayor Muriel Bowser, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson were all reelected with overwhelming support.
Ward 3 D.C. Council
In Ward 3, which includes American University, Democrat Matthew Frumin cruised to victory in the D.C. Council race, defeating Republican David Krucoff by a margin of over 52 percentage points, according to preliminary results from the D.C. Board of Elections.
Frumin will replace retiring Councilmember Mary Cheh, who has held the seat since 2007. 
In a statement posted on social media, Frumin called his election “a dream come true.” He praised the candidates he defeated — nearly a dozen people ran in the Democratic primary — and pledged to help make the city “as safe, welcoming and green as it can be.”
Krucoff, who won the endorsement of The Washington Post but gained little traction among residents, congratulated Frumin on Twitter Wednesday. A self-described moderate Republican, Krucoff had tried convincing voters they should send a “passionately pragmatic” conservative voice to the entirely Democratic Council. 
Advisory Neighborhood Commissions
It will take several days to know who won the two ANC seats on AU’s campus. Neither district had any candidate on the ballot, but there appeared to be at least one write-in candidate for each seat: freshman Micah Rogers in 3E07 and sophomore Rohin Ghosh in 3E08.
Board of Elections data showed just three votes cast in 3E07 and 12 votes cast in 3E08. Because the elections board does not distinguish write-in votes by name in its preliminary results, it was not immediately clear whether Rogers or Ghosh were elected.
Initiative 82
One of the most hotly contested ballot measures was Initiative 82, which passed with 74 percent of the vote, according to preliminary data. This measure will alter the way tipped workers are paid in the district. The minimum wage will be incrementally increased for tipped employees each year until 2027 — it is currently at $5.35 — to match that of non-tipped employees, which is at $16.10. Prior to the initiative, employers were required by law to make up for their workers’ pay if the tips didn't reach minimum wage. 
Opponents raised concerns the initiative would hurt small and independent restaurants and bars especially after the pandemic. Additionally, many restaurants may implement service charges, leaving customers less likely to tip. Proponents argued the two-tiered wage system makes income too unpredictable and is inherently problematic, forcing workers to rely on strangers' biases as they decide how much to tip. 
Board of Education
Eric Goulet appeared on track to secure the Board of Education seat for Ward 3 against Michael Sriqui with nearly 54 percent of the vote as of Thursday morning, according to the D.C. Board of Elections. Current BOE seatholder Ruth Wattenberg did not run for reelection. 
After losing in the primary for Ward 3 Council earlier this year, Goulet launched his campaign for BOE and was endorsed by The Washington Post. Sriqui is a current ANC commissioner from the Palisades in District 3D04. His campaign was heavily focused on the fact that he was the only candidate with children enrolled in D.C. public schools; Goulet’s children attend private school. 
At-large
In the competitive race for an at-large D.C. Council seat, Ward 5 Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie ousted the incumbent progressive Councilmember Elissa Silverman by a three point margin.
The race was one of the most closely watched in the district. McDuffie, who represents Ward 5 as a Democrat, left the party to compete for the at-large seat as an independent after a judge found him unqualified to run for attorney general. Silverman conceded Wednesday night when a newly counted batch of mail-in ballots made McDuffie’s lead too large to close.
Democrat Brian Schwalb won the attorney general’s race unopposed, and at-large Democratic Councilmember Anita Bonds was also reelected. The at-large race allowed voters to choose two candidates among the eight on the ballot.

2023-03-09,AU,Democrat,"Kogod Dean David Marchick, left, and Seth Goldman, right, kick off the new speaker series
Seth Goldman, founder of Honest Tea, Just Ice Tea and Eat the Change, opened the Kogod School of Business Gamechangers in Sustainability series alongside Kogod Dean David Marchick on Feb. 22. Goldman’s talk focused on his renewed insights on helping people and the planet. 
Every student was given a copy of Goldman’s 2013 graphic novel, “Mission in a Bottle,” a telling story of the joys, trials and challenges of his company creations, and every chair had tea, snacks and a coaster for attendees. 
“I appreciate us having the book here for people. Somebody brought the book up to me and said ‘you know this reads like a horror story,” Goldman said.
Goldman’s tea journey began in the late 1990s when he couldn’t find any “just sweet enough” drinks in a cooler after a run. Then, his first company, with the help of his former professor Barry Nalebuff, who co-wrote “Mission in a Bottle,” was born. Shortly after Goldman created “Honest Tea,” Coca-Cola purchased the company. However, in the spring of 2022, Coca-Cola discontinued Honest Tea.
Undiscouraged, Goldman, Nalebuff and celebrity chef Spike Mendelsohn, created and launched Just Ice Tea, only 90 days after Honest Tea ceased manufacturing. Now, Just Ice Tea is supplied at Whole Foods and other grocery stores across the country.
Along with Goldman’s best-selling tea, his 2017 company Eat the Change explores the impacts food has on communities and the environment and continues to experiment with other plant-based products.
“Eat the Change is founded around a call to action,” Goldman said. “What we do, what we eat is the single biggest environmental act we take every day.”
Although tea is what he specializes in, he continues to explore mushroom-based jerky snacks and cosmic carrot snacks — a snack attendees got a chance to try. 
Throughout the event, Goldman kept true to his “mission in a bottle,” the social impact issues he and his companies stand with. There was a short, educational video featuring a recent visit to his fair-trade tea supplier in Mozambique and the impact he and his company have there.
“Every time we buy a pound of tea leaves, a portion of the sales goes back to that community and they can invest in the schools you saw or buy an ambulance, whatever the community deems their needs are. You can have such a huge impact in a community like that,” Goldman said.
Goldman’s persistence, and his passion for his company, the people and the planet, were evident in every answer. 
“It’s meaningful to be the best-selling team in the natural foods industry, but the goal is to democratize this. Not just healthy, wealthy people should have access to organic and healthier drinks,” Goldman said.

2023-04-12,AU,Democrat,"Ramòn Cruz answers questions from SIS professor Simon Nicholson and students. 
Ramòn Cruz, president of the Sierra Club, aims to expand social justice initiatives in the environmental organization, according to a talk he gave in honor of Nancy Weiser Ignatius in the School of International Service on April 4. 
The Sierra Club was not always inclusive to marginalized groups in the past, according to Cruz. Founded for wilderness exploration by John Muir in 1957, the club used to be invitation only. Cruz reckoned with the organization’s racist and exclusive past, which included pushing Indigenous peoples off their native lands. 
“Before the great national parks, the lands belonged also to people that had been much better stewards than us and or anybody that came after them,” Cruz said. 
Cruz said he received criticism for venturing outside the bounds of the environmental movement. He wants to include “voting rights, working rights, reproductive rights, labor rights and housing rights” in the organization’s work. These issues all intersect with the environmental movement, according to Cruz. 
“I hope that Sierra Club supporters concerned about whether we focus on a narrow definition of environment can find a way to broaden our idea of the Sierra Club,” Cruz said. 
Cruz is the first Puerto Rican and Latino president of the organization. When the organization was founded, his father and grandfather would have been excluded from participating in the organization. 
“Things are very different today thanks in large part to people of color and white allies who fought to open the doors of these organizations to people like me, but it doesn't mean that there is no discrimination in the environmental movement,” Cruz said. “For many years, I was the darkest in the room with a cute Spanish accent.”
Now, the Sierra Club is taking steps towards environmental justice by adopting the principles of democratic organizing, according to Cruz. These principles include “Be Inclusive, Emphasis on Bottom-Up Organizing, Let People Speak for Themselves, Work Together In Solidarity and Mutuality, Build Just Relationships Among Ourselves and Commitment to Self-Transformation,” according to the Sierra Club website. 
It takes more than reckoning with the past to change the future, according to Ariana Lippi, a first-year graduate student in SIS. Lippi volunteered with the Sierra Club in New York before starting her graduate program at AU. 
When Lippi volunteered on the sustainable finance committee of the Sierra Club in New York, she found it difficult to create change and mobilize in the organization due to leadership and bureaucratic processes. Although Cruz pointed out the chapter has a new president, Lippi believes there is an “infrastructure problem” in the organization. 
“I do think that there is so much that could be done to make it more inclusive,” said Lippi in an interview after the event. “I think environmentalism overall, the environmental movement in the U.S. is not inclusive towards people of color, trans people, just different identities and youth as well. There's a very white, old guard in that movement.”
Lippi wished the organization could improve its outreach since it is mostly volunteer based. There was a long application process she went through to become a volunteer. She thinks this process can be cut down or eliminated. Cruz said the organization now does student coalition training, but he recognizes that is not enough.
“I think it's the people and the old school organizing that can get us there,” Cruz said.

2023-05-05,AU,Democrat,"From the Newsstands: This story appeared in The Eagle's April 2023 print edition. You can find the digital version here. 
The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
As wonks across American University’s campus are suffering from stress ulcers in the wake of finals, many look to the greener pastures of summer break for a glimmer of hope. The Office of Campus Engagement recently conducted a survey in an attempt to gauge which factors excite AU students the most about the upcoming break and remind us all of the light at the end of the tunnel. Here are the top seven activities AU students are most excited to do come May 10, most of which were a surprise to precisely no one:    
1. Referring to D.C. as “the city” in their hick hometown. This answer was reported by 28 percent of students.     
My brother in Christ, let's stop pretending Joe Biden is your neighbor; you live in Tenleytown. You are closer to Wegmans than the red line.      
2. Paying under $15 for a shot. This answer was reported by 22 percent of seniors.  
Sure, the bar will have an autographed picture of Rudy Giuliani and only play country/pop sung by neck-bearded tenors, but nothing tastes better than cheap feels! Fair warning, though, some bars will not allow every wandering, babyfaced 19-year-old to slip through the doors, so use that awful fake sparingly. Not every bar values your dollar over their liquor license.  
3. Name-dropping Congress members they briefly interacted with during their Hillternship. This answer was reported by 17 percent of students.    
Cory Booker made eye contact with you at Union Station because you had mustard on your chin, not because you’re the next AOC. Also, the most you’ve ever done to advance your pro-worker agenda was mute the constituent ten minutes into his thirty minute rant about how your moderate democratic state representative is a pawn for ANTIFA.    
4. Cheating on their Georgetown situationship with their hometown situationship. This was reported by 12 percent of students.      
A real Edward versus Jacob moment.      
5. Complaining about their internship. This answer was reported by 9 percent of students.      
What’s more fun than complaining about the classes you’re voluntarily paying a small fortune to take? Complaining about the internship acceptance you literally prayed for! After a grueling nine months of complaining about classes, complaining about an internship will be a breath of fresh air.      
6. Eating a “real” bagel. This answer was reported by 8 percent of students.  
As much as it pains the Seagle to acknowledge the so-called “state” of New Jersey, the people have spoken: there is nothing more important to them than the gluten product they have chosen to define them as a people. This answer wasn’t even a survey option, either. Those watered-down “Italians” abused our “other” section like their terrible fake tans abuse our eyes. 
7. Mansplaining the election for Speaker of the House. This answer was reported by 4 percent of students.      
Our SPA-iest of Eagles are salivating at the mouth to explain to every innocent home friend or unsuspecting younger sibling the historical significance of Kevin McCarthy’s humiliating speaker election. While this event will be months old by the time summer comes around, everyone knows explaining political events aren’t about educating anyone: it’s about that sublime feeling of superiority. And the best part? You don’t even have to be a man to engage in mansplaining. As long as your attitude is pretentious enough, you’re golden.   
Whether your parents are paying for your overpriced apartment in the city or you’re loitering around suburban America and working your part-time high school job: best of luck on your finals and, of course, HAGS.

2009-12-03,AU,Republican,"On Tuesday afternoon, hours before his televised address at West Point, President Barack Obama wisely acknowledged, “None of this is easy. I mean, we are choosing from a menu of options that are less than ideal.” For such a statement, I applaud the president for his candor and realism. He is right in asserting that Afghanistan can no longer be the forgotten war regulated to the back page of the American mind. Afghanistan is not the “good” war, it is really the great unknown — troubled by a corrupt and feeble central government, a lack of infrastructure, and persistent attacks from Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, Afghanistan has a bleaker future than even Iraq. That would have been difficult to say three years ago. 
Had the president decided to withdraw immediately from Afghanistan, I would have respected his decision. But his timetable for America’s exit is shortsighted and setup for failure.
The moment Obama decided to add more troops to the equation should have been the moment he placed all of his cards on the table. Go all in, or do not go at all. Expediting the deployment of 30,000 troops may help in the short term, but it is not a viable solution. Contrary to what some Congressional Republicans have argued in recent days, this is not about aiding the enemy by handing them our timetable for departure. There is no doubt that Obama recognized the divisions in his cabinet and the widening rift in his party over war policy. But even more certain is the fact that the July 2011 date to begin some form of an orderly exit coincides well with a looming presidential election the following year. Politics, rest assured, is always part of the equation. 
No one can argue with Obama surrogates that reject the prospects of extended nation building in Afghanistan. America’s finances will not defeat an entrenched insurgency if the Afghan government refuses to cooperate on issues such as educational development or reductions in the illegal drug trade. What is perplexing about the Obama war plan, however, is his awkward marriage of a substantial troop increase with his refusal to embrace the essential features of the army’s counterinsurgency tactics. Adding manpower to protect the civilian population is admirable, but what will happen when we depart in the coming years? 
Unless we commit ourselves to ramping up the training of Afghan security forces, the current mission will go to waste. If the president is sincere about leaving Afghanistan in stable condition, he will grant American troops the time they deserve to prove their mettle.

2010-02-11,AU,Republican,"The Democrats officially ceded the seat of their fallen hero — a seat they had held since the late Ted Kennedy’s brother occupied the White House — when Vice President Biden administered the oath of office to Republican Scott Brown last week. Brown’s arrival in Washington sounds the death knell for the dreamlike demands of President Barack Obama’s liberal base. Gone are the days of health care optimism and cap and trade consensus. Silence reigns where there were once cries for a second stimulus and righteous calls for a New York City civilian trial for Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 
At least Obama had fair warning. Fragmentation of Democratic majorities began last November in New Jersey and Virginia. At the time, I described the gubernatorial victories of Republicans Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell as needed boosts for a desperate Republican Party, not direct repudiations of Obama’s policies. For the GOP to continue such success, it would have to court Independents and field “the right candidate … trumpeting a tailored message.” Three months later, despite doomsday predictions of the Tea Party's rise, Republicans have utilized this game plan to perfection. The American public has indeed rejected the Democratic mantra of more: more spending, more debt and more centralization of power in Washington. Judging by history, however, Obama should be quietly cheering his party’s fall from grace this coming November. Yes, you heard me correctly — root for the Republicans, Mr. President. 
As a man who grounded his 2008 campaign in centrist rhetoric, Obama has been willing to punt the liberal agenda to Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill. On top of the criticism that boxes him in from his left and right, the president has watched the center slip from his fingers. Therefore, Obama cannot tie his legacy to Democrats in Congress if he has any hope of turning his fortunes. In fact, working with a resurgent opposition party after 2010 would insulate the president from warring factions in search of his head. Then-candidate Obama enraged many Democrats when he claimed that Ronald Reagan had altered the trajectory of the political landscape in a way Bill Clinton had not. He did not mention that, as Jonathan Rauch of the National Journal reminds us, both Reagan and Clinton, the most popular and successful recent chief executives, shared power for significant portions of their terms. Detractors to the divided government theory may argue that George W. Bush benefited from Republican majorities in Congress throughout most of his presidency. How did that go for him in the end?
Data derived from the American Presidency Project demonstrates the counterintuitive notion that a Congress run by the rival party need not cripple a sitting president. The combined concurrence percentage of combined House and Senate votes to the expressed wishes of President Eisenhower (an underrated president) was roughly 70 percent. This statistic is relatively high until you consider that less successful presidents like Jimmy Carter (77 percent) and G. W. Bush (81 percent) witnessed better levels of concurrence. Reagan left office with a 62 percent concurrence mark and a 63 percent approval rating. Clinton’s Congress voted for his policy proposals only 57 percent of the time, but he exited the White House with support from two-thirds of the nation.  
Christie, McDonnell and Brown are just the first wave. Voters are frustrated with the priorities of Democrats in Washington. The economy is slowly recovering, but it will be a long march out of the woods. Republicans are priming viable, jobs-focused candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Shift to the center and Obama could enjoy a Clintonesque revival after the midterm elections. Embrace arrogance and partisanship, and Obama’s legacy will follow the path blazed by Carter and Bush.

2010-04-12,AU,Republican,"The lack of access to healthy and affordable food is not a problem unique to Third World countries. Millions of Americans live in impoverished urban communities without the luxury of a supermarket that others may take for granted. These areas, sometimes called “food deserts,” present limited choices in the way of nutritious food options for their residents.
When the small convenience store down the street becomes the main source for household groceries, families typically pay higher prices even in the absence of essential fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Moreover, economic conditions in some poor neighborhoods foster the dominance of fast-food restaurants. The demand for their speedy service, tasty products and relatively cheap prices is strong. Unfortunately, a steady diet of burgers and fries only hastens the slide to obesity and increases the risk of diabetes.
How can we possibly address these issues? How can we encourage people to make better choices with their time and their health?
The roadblocks ahead are immense. Real estate prices in the areas in question swell the cost of doing business. On a broader level, the Farm Bill legislation, amended every five years, essentially determines what products consumers may access on a large scale. Constantly subsidized and overproduced foods, such as corn, soybeans, wheat and rice, provide crucial ingredients for a number of highly processed items crowding America’s store shelves.
We must fashion a wholesale change in the way the government engages the food industry, starting with more subsidies for fruits and vegetables. This measure will give producers the incentive to boost their supply and eventually drive down the cost of these healthier items. Such a shift in policy would serve as a constructive model in helping consumers help themselves.
In 2008, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance banning the construction of new fast-food restaurants in a low-income ward. In fact, a number of cities and towns have instituted similar laws in recent years. Food zoning, however, is not the right answer to the dilemma presented here. Preaching the importance of exercise or a moderate diet is perfectly worthwhile (even banning trans fats has its merits), but actively prohibiting certain businesses from poor communities is divisive and counterproductive; it is a heavy-handed tactic that does not bolster food choices and ignores the jobs these restaurants bring to the neighborhood.
Conversely, New York City offers a more effective and less intrusive means to encourage development and lure new businesses to food deserts. An array of zoning law adjustments and tax credits has been established for grocery stores that carry a significant amount of fresh dairy, meats and produce. Granting developers the room to work under normally tight building restrictions and giving tax exemptions for approved stores can diversify options for the poor and diminish the travel time once required to reach distant supermarkets.
Another avenue to improve the accessibility and affordability of healthy foods in urban areas is the growth of community-supported agriculture and community gardens. Community-supported agriculture builds partnerships between area farms and poor communities. Farms deliver produce to neighborhoods that purchase a portion of the crops at the beginning of a growing season as a collective group. Community gardens bring opportunities for environmental education, fresh produce and aesthetically pleasing landscapes.
Pragmatic ideas and grassroots level changes are out there. It’s time we enact them to fight the widespread problems of obesity, diabetes and limited healthy food choices in poor urban areas.

2010-06-02,AU,Republican,"Bang! — the shutting screen door was once a familiar sound of America’s summers. Children would venture out from under the watchful eye of their parents and spend the day on the streets, playgrounds and parks that surrounded their homes. There was stickball in the vacant corner lot and hopscotch on the blacktop. 
As the years passed, however, the streets and open spaces grew quiet, their former visitors few and far between. The harmless age of Nickelodeon had given way to an excessive saturation dominated by SpongeBob and PlayStation and online fantasy worlds. Gym class became a corny relic of the past for teenagers obsessing over Advanced Placement tests and college planning. Adults worked longer hours at jobs further from home and have little time for the outside air.
Yet rediscovering the wonders of physical activity will do more to lower long-term medical costs and improve the lives of millions of Americans than would any health care plan.
Along the way to our epidemic of inactivity, exercise has become an ugly word that everyone avoids. It’s the mysterious vegetable your aunt makes for a holiday dinner. No one wants to touch it. Studies show that approximately 60 percent of American adults don’t get the recommended amount of physical activity. More shocking is that more than 25 percent of adults are not active at all. Our nation’s youngsters are overweight at an earlier age and the risk of diabetes is spreading into their ranks. These troubling patterns will only add to the growing number of visits to the doctor’s office and the emergency room.
Inciting an exercise revolution begins by reminding people of the endless benefits of physical activity. Regular exercise builds healthy bones, muscles and joints. It can prevent or improve common illnesses through a stronger immune system. On a separate level, exercise also has mental rewards, including reducing anxiety and boosting self-esteem.
Many hear of the suggested 30-minutes-per-day exercise guideline and snicker. There’s simply not enough time, they insist. Admittedly, the strains associated with school, work and family no doubt restrict one’s options for exercise. But, then again, 30 minutes is the equivalent of most nightly television shows. It’s shorter than the average dinner time or the time it takes to read the newspaper. Go for a walk on your lunch break. Take the stairs to your office, instead of the elevator. On pleasant days, leave early and bike to school or work. A gym membership is not required to be active and stay fit. For whatever reason, working out is now linked to elaborate exercise machines and expensive running gear. Erasing the perception that physical activity entails a grueling routine suited for a marathon runner is essential. There are plenty of free and fun alternatives that have nothing to do with achieving the body type of models on the latest magazine covers.
No matter its flaws, the health care legislation does succeed in at least one regard: its emphasis on reinvesting in public recreation. Grants for walking paths and jungle gyms can’t be counted among the ridiculous earmarks that ooze from Washington these days. A spokeswoman for the late Senator from Massachusetts Edward Kennedy, the father of the health care bill, wisely asserted that, “...these are not public works grants; they are community transformation grants.” State and local governments across the country must do more to expand access to bike paths, green spaces, playgrounds, after-school programs and youth sports leagues. In an era of commercialization and multitasking lifestyles, I urge people to remember the glorious spirit of childhood in the sun — the scenic jog, the catch with your dad, a walk in the park with the family dog — anything that gets you up, out and on your feet.

2010-07-01,AU,Republican,"In his first visit to AU as president, Barack Obama laid out the framework for his idea of comprehensive immigration reform July 1 — including a pathway to citizenship as well as increased accountability — but did not announce any new policy initiatives. 
About 250 invited guests filled the atrium of the new School of International Service building in its inaugural event to hear Obama’s nearly 40-minute-long speech. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, the Rev. Al Sharpton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus filled the first few rows of the atrium. AU officials, professors and a small group of student leaders were also in attendance.
“In sum, the system is broken,” Obama said. “And everybody knows it. Unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling — and to the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.” 
The president said he hopes Congress can pass an immigration reform package soon, but did not address whether he had the support to pass any legislation before the end of the year. The majority of Democrats and Americans want to move forward with reform, and it’s up to Republicans to make the next move and create bipartisan legislation, he said.
While he did not offer many specifics, Obama expressed support for the DREAM Act, a bill before Congress that would provide a pathway to permanent residency for illegal immigrants who graduate from a U.S. high school and show good character. 
School of Public Affairs Dean William LeoGrande was in the audience and said he thought Obama gave a successful speech. Primarily, Obama was challenging the Republican Party to step up and support immigration reform efforts, LeoGrande said.
 “I think the White House is signaling that it really wants to try and push ahead on this issue now and not wait until after the election or next year,” he said. “But he also was very clear that there has to be Republican counterparts who are willing to cooperate in this. Democrats by themselves don’t have the votes to do this.”
Nearly half of the Main Quad and portions of New Mexico and Nebraska Avenues were blocked. Since the speech was invitation-only, students filled Ward 2 to watch. 
Rebecca Paley-Williams, a junior in SPA, watched the speech from Ward. She said she and a lot of the people with her at the watch party were annoyed the event was not open to students and the public. 
“I felt like [Obama] was coming here — this is our campus,” she said. “They probably should have let us see the speech or [provide] some sort of benefit for being a student here.” 
Sara Torneden, a sophomore in SIS, said that while she is disappointed more students were not let in to the event, she understands why the White House selected a smaller venue.  
“[The building choice] is very representative of how [Obama] wanted it to come off,” Torneden said. “He didn’t want it to be in a huge arena with hundreds of thousands of people cheering and everything. He wanted people who were interested in pursuing this in higher education to hear this and take this and motivate them to learn more about it in their studies.”

2010-09-08,AU,Republican,"Chris Matthews said the current state of bipartisan politics is driving the nation in a downward spiral in a speech Tuesday night in Bender Arena.
Matthews, the Kennedy Political Union’s first speaker of the year, said the Democratic and Republican parties need to put their rhetoric aside and work together.
“Excessive partisanship, excessive commitment to the notion that anything goes, that anything you can do to win is OK ... disrupts the system. It ruins it in many ways, and nothing gets done,” he said. “The pettiness between the parties [is not] even strategic — it's just crankiness.”
He went on to explain that the key to solving our problems in American politics is to elect good leaders without looking at partisan issues.
KPU Director Josh Levitt agreed with Matthews’ assertion that the two parties need to work together.
“As Obama said, we cannot expect to solve our problems if all we do is tear each other down,” Levitt said.
In an interview before his speech, Matthews said he hopes students attending his speech could come to fully understand a few key problems in the country and find ways to change them.
“I hope that people understand the question, which is 'what’s wrong with politics today?' ” he said. “Why is it so cranky and unproductive? Maybe [they can] begin to set some standards to change it.”
Matthews, who spent many years in politics and government, transitioned to print journalism working as the Washington bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner from 1987 to 2000. He is currently the host of ""Hardball,"" a daily news show on MSNBC and ""The Chris Matthews Show,"" a weekly syndicated public affairs program.
“I’ve watched politicians from the inside, and if you do that you’re able to understand what they’re doing,” he said.
Matthews said he knows how politicians speak and work because he worked as a presidential speechwriter for former President Jimmy Carter. He uses this knowledge of politicians to better understand his guests and inform his audience.
“I think I know what the politicians are up to better than a lot of other people,” he said. “I watched politics from the inside, and if you do that then you are able to understand what they are doing from the press releases, the speeches, the positioning, the dodging.”
Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the first post-apartheid presidential election in South Africa in 1994, the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 and the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.
“Those were great moments for me, and of course all of the presidential elections are fun,” Matthews said.
Matthews believes Democrats are demoralized and disappointed with their own party, but Republicans are angry and energized by the current state of politics.
“Fear makes people angry, and this election this November 2, it’s going to be an explosion of anger,” he said.
Matthews pointed to a rise of unemployment, overflow of government spending and the national debt as a few problems currently facing the nation.
Matthews said there has been speculation in the past that he may return to politics and possibly run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, but he said he does not want to give up his jobs as a news commentator and a reporter yet.
“I thought a lot about it in this [election] cycle and it would have meant giving up what I have spent years developing,” he said.

2010-09-11,AU,Republican,"The AU College Democrats and College Republicans both have many plans for expanding their groups on campus and becoming more involved with the D.C. community, starting with the National Day of Service and Remembrance on Sept. 11.
The College Republicans participated in the Freedom Walk. This event was created in 2005 to establish a national tradition of remembrance of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, according to College Republican President Stephen Laudone.
The College Republicans will also be working on a community service initiative at Walter Reed Hospital on Nov. 11, Veterans Day.
The College Republicans and College Democrats have also doubled their outreach efforts, with revamped websites, new Facebook groups and fan pages for members to join and stay in touch.
College Democrats President Bo Hammond said the College Democrats have added an internship board to their site for the first time. He said this has been set up to help members of AUCD get jobs, and in the past has secured internships on Capitol Hill and at WeatherizeDC, a non-profit based campaign in D.C. focusing on home efficiency.
The College Republicans have arranged several outings, starting with a meet and greet session at the Tenleytown Z-Burger, followed by a weekend trip to a Nationals game. They have also booked a number of speakers for the upcoming months, such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., sometime in September or October and former United States Senator Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in November.
The College Republicans are also co-sponsoring the Kennedy Political Union's Family Weekend event on Oct. 23. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and presidential candidate, is scheduled to speak. 
Laudone said he is focused on expanding the community service wing of his organization.
“It is important for the [College Republicans] to walk the walk on this [service] issue, so you will see us engaging more than in past years in community service initiatives of our own and with the Community Service Coalition,” he said.
The College Democrats have a themed schedule entitled, “Blue Rising.” This is a six-week period during which they have scheduled many events, starting with advertising and recruitment in the first couple of weeks.
Hammond believes that this will be the best year for the College Democrats.
“We are going to have more members and more resources than we have ever had in the past,” he said.

Why would you close the doors to the event on Thursday night after it started?  Some people have evening classes and would have liked to have slipped in late without making a disturbance. Think about that in the future please.

2010-12-06,AU,Republican,"The Rat is clearly more evolved than us. While we huddle in our dorm rooms next to whatever bottle of liquor we still have stored for winter, desperately trying to avoid stepping out into the frozen tundra, they will somehow survive and thrive, coming out to meet us next spring with a hope that this season will bring a bountiful harvest of garbage.
Now is the time to stamp them out, before they consolidate power. Our best weapon against them? The Nutcracker, the famous ballet that I assume is the first musical based on a tool we use to feed ourselves (“Mac the Knife” of course is the second). Here are the recommendations:
Eliminate the Monarchy
Apparently the leader of the mice in the ballet is the Mouse King. Honestly, I don’t know why the mice resorted to an autocratic regime. I’m not even sure how a mouse would justify his dominion. Perhaps he is the divine providence of the Mouse God, who I assume looks like Mickey. But that’s not important. What is important is taking down a king, and history has taught us many ways to accomplish this. We could read them the Constitution — I’m sure the College Republicans would chomp at the bit for the chance — or possibly construct a tiny mouse Magna Carta. Admit it, you’re thinking about it and it’s adorable.
Do NOT use Edible Soldiers
They tried to fight rats with gingerbread soldiers. That’s a worse strategy than the Surge. Unless the gingerbread has rat poison in it, in which case it’s genius. Why didn’t the Nutcracker think of that? This ballet is full of plot holes.
Know when to retreat
After the Nutcracker defeats the Mouse King, the soldiers retreat to their own castle, which is apparently filled with candy and sweet tea and a boat pulled by dolphins. Honestly, you probably won’t find that on campus. The closest thing would be to go back to huddling in your dorm room with the bottle of liquor. For dolphins, I suggest Animal Planet.

2010-12-06,AU,Republican,"Something wicked this way comes — it lurks in our skies, awaiting the return of innocent college students from winter break. It will drop around the beginning of February, wreaking havoc not only upon Washington, but the rest of the East Coast as well. 
People will rush to the grocery stores and Terrace Dining Room, which will run out of food within a week. The Metro system will shut down and cars will be inoperable, making the only viable mode of transportation cross-country skiing. Classes will be canceled day after day, while a civil war breaks out at Dupont Circle. 
Civilization as we know it will cease to exist and D.C. will descend into chaos, buried under a thick blanket of fluffy, white snow. 
Snowpocalypse 2011 is coming — are you prepared? Heed The Eagle’s warning and use this guide to start a survival kit before it’s too late.
Powdered milk
Since the Eagle’s Nest and local stores will face a milk shortage, be sure to pick up at least five industrial-size boxes of powdered milk. Even if the pipes freeze, use the abundance of snow outside to your advantage and mix it in for a truly ice-cold drink.
Hot Pockets
Stockpile as many frozen entrees as will fit in your freezer. Hot Pockets are the best bet because of their nutritional superiority and tendency to make you too nauseous to eat more. Not only will you have enough food to last through the crisis, but you’ll gain some extra padding against the bitterness of winter as well.
10-layer cake
Celebrate the impending end of the world by eating one layer of cake for each day of being trapped on campus. For more creative types, you can decorate each layer with the circles of Hell as you descend further into cabin fever.
Alaskan dog sled
Though snowshoes and cross-country skis will work for a while, save your legs and invest in an Alaskan dog sled with a few strong Huskies. It’s fast, fun and furry — and you’ll look that much cooler arriving at the 2,000-person Dupont Circle snowball fight on a wintry chariot.
Well-stocked entertainment system
Nothing fends off boredom like a five-day Mario Kart tournament. Pit Democrats against Republicans, East Coast natives against West Coast natives, School of International Service majors against School of Public Affairs majors — you get the idea — for the title of Snowpocalypse King. If holding such an event off campus, don’t hesitate to include alcohol to make each game truly warm, fuzzy and much more memorable.
Remember that Snowpocalypse 2011 is deadly in many ways — do not, under any circumstances, walk under campus buildings that seem to be in danger of collapsing. And please, enjoy battling the Snowpocalypse responsibly.

2010-12-06,AU,Republican,"This will be my final column as an opinion writer for The Eagle. In this space, I’ve argued for drug liberalization, urban renewal projects, and a greater focus on our long-term fiscal health. I discussed the importance of living within one’s means, lamented our dysfunctional political system, and criticized our incoherent foreign policy. 
What I never wrote much about was American University, and for that, I’m sorry. I know that I wasn’t your first, second, or even third destination when you wanted to read a view of the political scene. 
I also apologize to those who were looking for more partisanship and found my writing muddled in the middle. Actually, I take that back. I can’t stand fringe politics, Left or Right. Ideological polarization is tearing this country apart. Regardless, if you ever stumbled across my column, I do hope that you found my thoughts insightful, temperate, and, above all, reasonable. 
However, I want to devote my parting words not to opinion or policy, but to everyone and everything that made American University special during my years here. When I submit my senior thesis next week, I will conclude a journey that began in August 2007. Less than three and a half years later, I can proudly say that I wouldn’t trade any of it for the world. 
So here’s to you, AU:
To the Letts third floor of 2007-2008, where I spent countless nights in the South side lounge and started friendships that will last a lifetime. 
To Letts’ sixth floor sky lounge, where residents know not to enter if the lights are off and the two couches are pushed together. Trust me, stay away.  
To Centennial Hall, where sophomores go to pretend that they are moving up in the world and where I fell in love. 
To the four knuckleheads that I chose as roommates for the last few years, thanks for all the nonsense and the endless laughter. 
To the Terrace Dining Room, where I’m an endangered species: a senior in a sea of freshmen and sophomores. To the most underrated cafeteria on campus, thank you for feeding me.   
To the men’s basketball team, for winning back-to-back Patriot League crowns in 2008 and 2009. Facing the fourth-seeded Villanova Wildcats in the opening round of the 2009 NCAA tournament, the 13-seeded Eagles played unconscious basketball for more than half of the game. AU led by as many as 14 and held a 10-point lead with under 13 minutes to play. It was some of most inspired basketball I’ve ever seen. Somewhere, Garrison Carr is still knocking down 25-foot jumpers. 
To the now-defunct School of International Service pit, I miss your character and sheer depth. In all seriousness, it’s been exciting to watch this campus develop since 2007. The new SIS building and the Kogod School of Business addition are helping to put this university on the map. It will be interesting to see how the administration transforms the Nebraska Parking Lot in the coming decade.   
To Professor Cynthia Bair Van Dam, whose College Writing Seminar on the Politics of Education drove me to be a better writer. 
To Professor Robert Johnson, who showed me the distressing reality of our prison system and altered my stance on the death penalty.  
To Professor Alan Kraut, whose masterful lectures on the Civil War made me want to put down my pen and just listen. His oratory skills were that powerful. 
To three School of Communication professors, Rick Horowitz, Lynne Perri, and Rodger Streitmatter, who deepened my passion for journalism and media studies.
To Professor Leonard Steinhorn, my Honors Capstone advisor, whose tremendous insight and guidance have proven invaluable. 
To everyone at the American University Career Center, from Elaine Salisbury to Bridget O’Connell to Lara Ferraiolo to Chris Hughes to Susan Gordon—you’ve all been integral parts of my professional growth and career exploration process. It’s going to be hard to let go. 
To The Eagle, thank you for giving me a voice and granting me a platform. 
Farewell, AU. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.

2011-01-11,AU,Republican,"It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve. 
Big Brother has proven inept and can’t be trusted. It’s about time we stick up for ourselves and start advocating transparency.

2011-02-09,AU,Republican,"Political strategist Ed Gillespie has been involved in Washington politics since his college days.
The former Republican National Committee chairman began at the bottom of the food chain. He worked as a Senate parking lot attendant while he was a student at the Catholic University of America.
Gillespie spoke at AU Feb. 7 about his own career and the future of his party in what he calls a “center-right nation.”
“The great thing about going to school in D.C. is being able to intern. The great thing about politics is that it’s a meritocracy and you can work your way up,” he said.
Gillespie, chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the state level is an important arena for politicians.
“It is a training ground for new Republicans. There are innovative ideas and policy proposals, as well as working to increase diversity.”
After winning a historic 690 new state legislative seats in 2010, Gillespie has high hopes for future Republicans.
“There are great opportunities in the Senate and whether President Obama re-elected or not, we’re likely to hold the House given the size of the margin and the nature of redistricting,” Gillespie said.
He predicted eight to 10 Republican candidates in the 2012 primaries.
“There are a lot of really good potential candidates that are going to run, bringing new faces to the party,” Gillespie said.
The most important issues in the election, he believes, will center around government spending, the economy and jobs.
“The most important factor will be what is the unemployment rate,” Gillespie said. “The real overarching dynamic is where are the jobs? Do people feel like they’re coming back?”
He said Republicans should recruit minorities and female candidates.
“It’s a long term concern, a demographic challenge. We need to do better with minority voters, most acutely with Hispanic voters,” Gillespie said.
But independent voters are important too, he said, saying the “overwhelming” support of this group was crucial to the 2010 victories.
Gillespie also said he believes the tea party movement will assimilate into the mainstream Republican Party, comparing them to Catholic Democrats joining the party in the 1980s and the Ross Perot supporters in the 1990s.
“Growing pains are better than shrinking pains,” he said.

2011-03-03,AU,Republican,"Former D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee said the state of the U.S. public education system today “sucks.”
Rhee spoke to students March 2 in a panel event sponsored by the Roosevelt Institute at AU, after a screening of the documentary “Waiting for Superman,” a film about the nation’s public schools system. 
 “We are supposed to be living in the best country in the world,” Rhee said to a packed audience. “The land of opportunity, and whether or not kids get a good education is dependent on luck and the spinning of the wheel.”
The documentary says Rhee simultaneously drew praise and criticism during her tenure as chancellor. During that time she cut over a hundred jobs in the D.C. Central Office and closed 23 schools in D.C.
Her alliance with former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty made waves during the mayoral election earlier this fall. Rhee resigned after Vincent Gray was elected.
Rhee talked about her stance on teachers’ unions, saying she was surprised that President Barack Obama has advocated for holding accountable and even firing underperforming teachers. 
“I don’t think you can overstate the importance that he has had over the debate of teacher quality over the last two years,” Rhee said.
She said while Obama has held teachers more accountable, Republicans primarily criticize the teachers’ unions. A Democrat herself, Rhee said that stance needs to change. 
However, she said she has seen Republicans, Democrats and independents alike calling for reform, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and her fiancé, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a Democrat.
“Democrats have been resistant about saying that within the last 10 years and I think that with some of the stuff that’s going on in Wisconsin, it is actually a different dynamic that’s happening there,” she said. “I think that you can hold unions accountable and draw very strong distinctions in what they ought to be doing and fighting for.”
Zachary Kolodin, director of the Future Preparedness Initiative for Roosevelt Institute, also served on the panel and said it is not productive to vilify the unions. 
He said that while the recession and deep deficits across the country have hit budgets hard, money should still be directed towards education.
“In Wisconsin, there’s a real demonization of unions and public employees and I think that reflects something real in our economy,” Kolodin said.  It’s really not the unions’ fault that America is such a ruthless place for the middle class right now.”
But Rhee said that in New Jersey, thousands of dollars are spent per child with disappointing results. 
She said that the root of the problem doesn’t come from poor districts or lazy parents, but the poor performance of teachers and attitude in the central office. 
“Once we as a school district do everything that we’re supposed to be doing, then we have the right to go to the parents and the kids and hold them accountable too,” Rhee said.
Rhee has continued her crusade against the unions by establishing her own interest group called StudentsFirst. 
Rhee said she believes that the failure of the system now is that there are advocates for adults but none for kids.
“The education landscape over the last few decades has been driven by special interests groups: textbook manufacturers, teachers unions, testing companies, et cetera,” she said. “We don’t have a system that is set up to protect children, we have a system that is set up to protect adults and their jobs.”

2011-03-07,AU,Republican,"Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf called for a new discourse about Islam in America on Feb. 28, saying the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks violated the religion itself. 
Rauf founded the Cordoba Initiative, which addresses the topic of healing U.S. Muslim relations after 9/11. 
Rauf made headlines this fall when he became the center of the highly publicized ground zero mosque debate. 
“We were found to be a convenient tool for the extreme right of the Republican Party for the midterm elections,” Rauf said.
9/11 not only had human casualties, but violated Islam itself, Rauf said. 
He said he took the attacks personally, saying that members of his congregation were among the first responders.
Rauf also said that the site was not to be an actual mosque, but rather a community center similar to the YMCA or Jewish centers that include athletic, educational and religious activities. 
The imam said that the point of the “Cordoba house” was to establish an American Muslim identity and catalyze a turning point in the discussion of Islam in America.
But the perceived conflict between being Muslim and being an American citizen was addressed long before the 2010 midterm elections, Rauf said. 
During the 2008 election, rumors circulated that Barack Obama was Muslim, eliciting some negative sentiment and fears. 
Rauf commended former Secretary of State Colin Powell for tackling the rumors head-on when he asked, “Is there anything wrong with being Muslim in America?”
Rauf also said he was astounded that the president's recent comments at the State of the Union received applause from both sides of the aisle, when he said, “We are committed to the conviction that American Muslims are Americans too and part of our American family.”
The School of International Service sponsored Rauf's appearance at AU.

2011-08-12,AU,Republican,"Though public officials reached a deal on the debt ceiling Aug. 2, many student government presidents from across the country are unhappy with the deal.
Before the agreement was made, more than 120 student government presidents from 40 states, including AU Student Government President Tim McBride, signed a letter demanding Congress come up with a solution to raise the national debt ceiling and prevent the U.S. government from defaulting on its loans.
The letter, asking “Do We Have a Deal Yet,” says the student government presidents support the proposals of the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Gang of Six, a group of senators containing three Republicans and three Democrats. There are no particular provisions of those recommendations the group supports, but it does urge congressmen to accept a “bipartisan framework,” according to Andy MacCracken, executive director of the D.C. Student Alliance and former SG president.
Now that a default has been avoided, the group is disappointed the deal includes the founding of a commission to continue to debate debt reduction that is tasked with finding more cuts by November. 
“It’s very unfortunate that our leaders kicked the can down the road even farther,” MacCracken said. 
Though the group has no “grandiose” ideas that their opinions will suddenly cause bipartisan cooperation on the Hill, a few of the students, including MacCracken, were granted a conference call with President Obama and members of his staff on July 26 and a meeting with staff in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office on Aug. 1 regarding the letter.
“That speaks volumes to the impact we’ve already started to have,” MacCracken said.
Student leaders will continue to advocate to members of the new commission to reduce the deficit. 
They want politicians to focus “on what the ramifications are going to be for the next generation as opposed to what short-term benefits might be for the next election,” MacCracken said.
The student presidents’ main hope is to encourage students to get involved and take a stand on debt negotiations by calling their representatives or senators and getting their opinion heard, McBride said.
Some of those student government presidents held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. July 21, garnering media attention from CNN, NPR, ABC, FOX, and the Huffington Post.
“We’re not telling our leaders what to do,” MacCracken said. “We’re just telling them to lead.”
The difference between this lobbying group and others is that they are not asking for favors, according to McBride, who signed the letter July 12. Instead, these student leaders are still looking for a deal that will not bankrupt the country that some of these students will one day lead.
“We have a unique message that needed to be heard,” McBride said.
As Obama echoed in the conference call, students have the most to lose from any failed debt reduction negotiations. 
“Young people will shoulder the consequences of gridlock during a time that requires bold action,” the letter reads. “Your decisions will determine what kind of country we will inherit.”

2011-09-13,AU,Republican,"President Barack Obama will be re-elected next year, according to AU Professor Allan Lichtman’s predictions.
The AU College of Arts and Sciences professor, who has correctly guessed the outcome of every presidential contest for the last 30 years, is beginning to get notice from various news outlets such as U.S. News and World Report and Fox News.
According to Lichtman, it’s quite simple to predict the winner.
There are 13 “keys,” or factors, that can go for or against the party controlling the White House.  If the party in power has six or more keys going against them, they lose, according to Lichtman.
 “You don’t even have to take your shoes off to find out who’s going to win the White House,” Lichtman said.  “You just have to count to six.”
 He was able to compile his system through presidential election campaign history going back to 1860, the beginning of the two-party Republican-Democratic dichotomy.
 Lichtman first developed the system in 1981, and used it to successfully predict the re-election of President Ronald Reagan three years later and again during every subsequent presidential campaign, coming out correct every time.
 Lichtman explained that leading up to the election in 1984, economic conditions seemed poised to make Reagan a one-term president. However, Professor Lichtman’s keys, such as substantial policy change in his first years in office and the lack of a third party challenge, showed a re-election on the horizon.
 He did not develop this methodology alone, citing assistance in developing his “keys” system with Russian geophysicist Volodia Keilis-Borok.
 “Geophysics, specifically earthquakes, are all about whether there is either stability or upheaval, and the same could be said for political campaigns,” Lichtman said.
The only “key” that Republicans can fully control this campaign season is their candidate’s charisma. However, that he doesn’t see much promise in that area for the Grand Old Party, Lichtman said.
 Chris Litchfield, the president of AU College Democrats, agreed with Lichtman’s speculation that the Republican field candidates will be unable to attract the same amount of voters as President Obama. However, he is apprehensive about basing electoral hopes on predictions made months in advance.
 “By any means, I urge [Democrats] to realize that we can’t write this election off,” Litchfield said.
 AU College Republicans did not respond to requests for an interview in time for publication.
 Professor Lichtman, who has given speeches across the world regarding his system, is ready to stick to his process even among skepticism.
“Despite vast changes [in the American political system], the keys stay the same,” Lichtman said.
Lichtman’s 13 Keys to the White House
1 Short-term economic conditions: The economy can’t be in recession during the campaign in order to have the incumbent party win this key. Thus, it’s unclear which party the key will fall on.
2 Long-term economic conditions: The economy is still in a recession, causing President Obama to LOSE this key.
3 Success in foreign or military affairs: Obama WINS this key, as Osama Bin Laden has been killed.
4 Failure in foreign or military affairs: There have been no massive military failures, which gives Obama a WIN for this key.
5 Presidential Scandal: President Obama WINS this key, as the Obama Administration has not had a major scandal.
6 Incumbency: Obama automatically WINS this key, as he is the incumbent president.
7 Domestic social unrest: There have been no large-scale riots or other large domestic disturbances in the course of the administration. President Obama WINS this key.
8 Charisma of the incumbent: President Obama hasn’t used his charisma effectively in the debates over health care and other legislation, causing him to LOSE this key.
9 Charisma of the opponent: The opposing field doesn’t have someone who can rally large amounts of the electorate through the candidate’s charisma. President Obama WINS this key.
10  Third party challenge: As of now, there is no serious third party challenger for the presidency, allowing President Obama to WIN this key.
11  Primary election challenger: Likewise, there is currently no serious challenge to President Obama within his own party for the upcoming Democratic primaries, giving President Obama a WIN here.
12  Significant policy change: However unpopular among some his proposed legislation may be, there have been significant achievements, be it the stimulus or health care reform, among others. President Obama WINS this key.
13  Party mandate (whether the President’s party holds more seats in the Congress after the midterm elections than the previous term): The Democratic Party’s loss of the House of Representatives in last year’s midterm elections gives President Obama a LOSS in this key.
Total: 9 keys in Obama’s favor, three keys against him, with one undecided

2011-10-11,AU,Republican,"Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., started his career as an orthopedic surgeon who was tired of being told by the government how he could treat patients. 
Following a trip to lobby about tort reform at Georgia’s State Senate, Price decided to run for the state Senate. After winning that Senate seat, he ran to represent Georgia’s sixth district in the U.S. House of Representatives and won.
“One free American ought to be able to contact another free American for a service,” he said during a College Republicans event Oct. 4 in Butler Boardroom.
Price, a doctor turned politician, shared his views on health care, the American Jobs Act and the 2012 presidential candidates.
He serves as the Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, according to his Congressional website. 
Price began his address by talking about the American Jobs Act, placing blame on overregulation by the federal government and the corporate tax rate. The United States holds one of the largest corporate tax rates, second only to Japan, he said. 
Price said he believes this tax rate only punishes businesses, especially small businesses. 
“I’m a zero percent business tax guy,” Price said.
He also spoke about health care, a problem that Price said he has insight into both as a doctor and politician. 
“It’s important to appreciate that we can fix all the challenges in health care right now, today, without putting the government in charge of a thing,” Price said.
Price said he believes health care decisions must be made between the family, the patient and the doctor without worrying about insurance. However, he said people deserve to be able to pick their own health care, as he believes the government cannot do this properly. 
“[About] 99.2 percent of the time, the federal government messes up,” he said.
The Republicans are currently pushing a few health care bills that Price said he believes will not make it past the Senate. He said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would not bother to introduce the bills on the floor.  
“Sen. Harry Reid decided he doesn’t want to do anything that he doesn’t absolutely have to do because he has decided it is politically wise for his party not to address any controversial issues,” Price said. “That’s just an absolute absence of leadership, and it’s harming the country.” 
As for the presidential election candidates, Price said he believes former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney will get the Republican nomination. 
“If it’s Romney, he’ll trounce the president,” Price said.

2011-11-13,AU,Republican,"CNN anchor John King likened the current Republican primary campaign to a civil war and drew parallels between President Barack Obama’s re-election bid and former President George H.W. Bush’s failed bid in 1992 during his talk Nov. 9 in Ward 2.
“By every statistical, historical model, Barack Obama loses,” King said. “You cannot find a historical, statistical model that says he wins. But that doesn’t mean he’s not going to win.”
King, now covering his seventh consecutive U.S. presidential campaign, illustrated an electoral landscape full of nuances and unpredictability. He warned students not to trust the traditional methods people use to predict elections.
King also spoke candidly about the shortcomings of certain media networks, including his own, and urged students to get their news from outside of the main Washington, D.C., media outlets to broaden their horizons at the Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event.
Reflecting on the Republican primaries
King outlined the framework of the Republican campaign as a tug of war for control of the heart and soul of the Republican Party. 
“The easiest way to sum it up right now is Romney versus the rest,” King said. “On paper, Romney will be the Republican nominee.” 
King said Romney is taking advantage of the “crowded field” of Republican candidates because it will split the votes to his right. 
“The last thing he wants is a one-on-one,” King said.
The only other candidate who is equal to Romney in electability on paper is Texas Governor Rick Perry, but he has to step up his campaign to remain competitive and be a leading contender, according to King.
“You don’t win Texas if you’re a dope,” King said.
King’s remarks proved to be true. Perry has been widely criticized and quickly discredited in the media for his bumbling gaffe in the Nov. 9 Republican debate when he couldn’t name the third federal agency he would cut.
King also addressed the peculiar aspects of primary elections, taking note that “lily-white” states like Iowa and New Hampshire play an influential role in weeding out candidates because they are the first two states to hold primaries.
And with the added eccentricity of independents now allowed to vote in the New Hampshire primaries, King hypothesized, “If the vote is really close, mischief could decide the race in New Hampshire.”
2012 election repeat of 1992 election?
King said Obama in the 2012 election reminds him of George H.W. Bush in the 1992 election, without going so far as to say the outcome will be the same. 
Despite coming off of foreign policy victories, Bush faced a faltering economy and disenchanted voters, and Bush ultimately lost the race.
“George H.W. Bush was one of the most respected presidents in my lifetime,” King said. “And the American people said, ‘Thanks for trying. See you later.’ That could well happen to [Obama].”
King also laid out the central attack Republicans would launch at Obama: the promise of hope and change that never came. 
The Republicans will emphasize high unemployment and home foreclosure rates and what seems to be the apex of gridlock in Washington when Obama promised post-partisanship as main arguments, according to King.
Obama faces other challenges as well. King said part of Obama’s appeal during his first presidential bid was that he was ""new."" Now that Obama’s novelty has worn off, King predicts an uphill climb.
“He’s a used car now,” King said. “So it’s a tougher sell for him this time.”
Although he listed all the factors that would hurt Obama’s chances, King called Obama a “pretty damn good politician” and left the outcome of the presidential race wide open.
“Remember the arithmetic,” King said. “We’re all equal — one vote. So whoever organizes the best wins.”

•@smokers please don't litter: the only reason I don't throw cigarettes in the trash can is because I'm always afraid that my cigarette is not fully put out and that it's gonna set fire to the trash.
•@""This is the quiet floor"". Try studying in McKinley building. Although it isn't designated as a quiet building, it is often way more quiet than the library. Same goes with Kreeger, Watkins, and Gray.
•I actually saw Neil Kerwin walking through campus the other day, and almost died of shock
•I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone is from the same state, has the same political views, and the same provincial world view. At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world. And not just a couple students, but in every single class at AU. So glad I chose AU.
•I hate that you're flirtatious by nature. It creates feelings in me I know you don't share. I'm really happy to be your friend and am proud to know you trust me with your issues. But now I have feelings for you, and that can't be good for either of us.
•The awkward look guys give you when they find out your ring is a purity ring......
•I feel like ranting should not be the place that you come out of the closet...
•Irene was a joke compared to Wednesday night.  A poorly timed, inappropriate, fart joke.
•There should be like buttons for individual rants.
•I don't want to go home... I'm happier here in DC <3
•Dear Big, I know you read eagle rants so listen up. You chose me, remember? And I chose you? We were so happy that first semester. Then you went abroad and I tried so hard to make time for you, despite my personal issues. Then you came back and acted like nothing changed. I worked so hard to try and talk to you, but you were ""too busy"". This semester I'm abroad and have emailed you, messaged you, skyped you... with no responses. What did I do to make you not like me? I just want to get an answer.
•I know I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I'm pretty sure my neighbors use their apartment for a Fight Club. That's the only rational explanation for all of those noises...
•AU is SO. SMALL.
•Why doesn't my boyfriend like cuddling more??? I DON'T UNDERSTANDDDDDDDDD
•I think my friends are telling me I'm pretty because they don't want me to give up hope on the closeted lesbian and bisexual ladies.  please come out, come out wherever you are.
•why is it so cold in the library? :( I have so much to do but I can't work like this
•@Nothing about being single could make me happier than finding out your ex boyfriend is now a misogynist frat boy douchebag.- I feel you. Brings a smile to my face to hear others talk about his attitude, and say what I'm thinking.
•Thanks for all the suggestions for essay-writing soundtracks! I now love Bastion btw. Perhaps because the music reminds me of Firefly.
•@SGShouldn'tAcceptVIPSeats: Actually, the only times people on SG get VIP seats is when their organization co-sponsors the event. KPU and SUB are very strict on who gets VIP seats, and SG members are in no way allowed to just go because of their position. If you want to get a VIP seat, ask KPU or SUB if an organization you're involved in can co-sponsor!
•I'm the only one of my friends who have not had finals yet... all of their facebook statuses are killing me.
•Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin!
•This is supposed to be an incredibly open, diverse, and accepting school right? Everyone, regardless of race/creed/sexual orientation is supposed to be accepted right? Except Republicans appear to be the exception. All the time. And it's gone farther than joking - now it is starting to really hurt.
•Why aren't my rants about sex being posted? Are we not allowed to rant about sex?

I in a position to get help, but I just hid from him in the stall until left, so it wasn't necessary. Needless to say, I'm shaken by it, but I don't fell like I can tell anyone because nothing ended up happening beyond the above...
I've learned two things: (1) those rape stickers in the bathrooms are absolutely vital, and (2) I can never imagine what rape victims must feel like, given how I feel bc of this
[Editor’s note: First, sexual harassment is against University policy and the student conduct code. Even though “nothing ended up happening,” as you said, you have every right to talk to someone, whether it be a friend, counselor or AU staffer, and to report the incident if you want to. If you want more information on sexual harassment and assault at AU, you can look through AU’s resource page: http://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/sexualassault/. If you’re just looking to talk, maybe try the Counseling Center at 202-885-3500. I’m sure other ranters have ideas as well.]

•I wish we weren't so complicated. I wish you weren't so medicated.
•I hate it when people think the glass study rooms in the library are sound proof. THEY ARE NOT. The whole entire floor can hear your conversation. You biddies have no right to disturb the students in the library who actually care about their work. Also, wtf are you wearing? Mini skirts don't constitute winter clothing, and 30 pounds of make-up won't replace a lack of personality. Why has our society let this happen, and why are there are so many people like you at AU??
•Now don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for Winter Break. But I want the chance to hang out with you actually before break to know if something is there! Why is break coming so fast now??

•""White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like ""I hate all white people, they are all racist"", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street.""
One of the key parts of racism is one group having power over another.  Sure, you could argue that we have a black president but let's be real, there still is a huge amount of discrimination against black people in many parts of our country.  Clearly, AU DOES need to change the Dean's list.

2012-02-07,AU,Republican,"Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler is surprised Maryland hasn’t moved to legalize same-sex marriage sooner. 
A state senate committee is expected to vote on a Gov. Martin O’Malley’s same-sex marriage bill in the next few weeks.
“Ten years ago, people would think, ‘there's no way in the world,’ ‘it's like walking around on Mars,’ ‘there's no way same-sex couples are getting married in this country,’” Gansler said at a speaking event Jan. 31 in MGC 3, sponsored by AU College Democrats. “Ten years from now, they are going to look back at it as if it was some sort of quaint debate: ‘You know that was weird. Remember when they didn't let same-sex couples get married?’""
Gansler also called the issue a “Republican” one, saying that he believes Republicans see homosexuality as choice and “believe that they can be changed to no longer be homosexual.”
“There’s no issue — it seems to me right now — that’s a social issue that’s more Republican,” Gansler said.
Lawmakers also remain undecided on whether the state should recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
""There's five states in the middle where we say marriage is between a man and a woman, so we don't allow same-sex marriages in the great state of Maryland,” Gansler said in his speech. “But we will, and we are silent on what we are going to do about these other marriages [same-sex marriages from other states].”
Gansler testified in favor of same-sex marriage at a Maryland senatorial hearing Jan. 31, a move Gansler considered risky.
""I knew if I talked to my political people — as you see everyone is over-coached these days — they'd say that was a really stupid idea politically,” Gansler said. “But I thought it was the right thing to do, and I get paid less than paralegals that work at big law firms, so I thought, ‘you know, what if I'm going to be doing this job, I might as well do what's right.’"" 
The State Senate legalized same-sex marriage in February 2011 but it failed in the State House that March. Gansler hopes both chambers will pass the bill this year.
Gansler was elected attorney general in 2006 and is in his second term. He is also the president-elect of the National Association of Attorney Generals, the assembly of all the attorney generals in the United States.
Gansler teaches as an adjunct professor in AU’s Washington College of Law, where he teaches Criminal Trial Advocacy. 
He supports the unionization of AU adjunct professors, saying it gives adjunct professors an opportunity for competitive pay. 
“If in fact it passes, the next issue is: What will the union do for the adjunct professors?” Gansler said.
He encourages students to vote whenever they can, but also to take their time in college to pick a side of the political spectrum.
“I don't think people should pick a party based on what their parents are, but they should understand the issues and figure out which party is more aligned with their views,” Gansler said. “And then get involved the party.""

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant.

2012-03-06,AU,Republican,"First I wanted to introduce myself, for the majority of campus who probably doesn’t know me. My name is Chris Litchfield; I am President of the AU College Democrats, and a proud AU Student. 
That is, I was until today.
Two Fridays ago, American University College Republicans invited Gov. Jan Brewer to speak on campus. In response to her presence, a number of individuals, myself included, organized a demonstration against the legislation she has implemented in Arizona. As Governor, she has supported not only SB 1070, the controversial bill that codified racial profiling into the Arizona criminal justice system, but additional legislation HB 2281, which bans the teaching of multicultural studies. 
In both instances the laws have been crafted to place immense pressure on enforcers of the law, police officers and schoolteachers and to conform to a racist ideology which vilifies Latinos as ‘illegal’ because of their immigration status. 
This culture of racism has directly affected students at AU and across the United States, and to show opposition to this culture, we disrupted her event. Controversy ensued.
However, this is really the beginning to the story, a story that while not unique to The American University, defines our campus every day. 
This academic year, organizations on campus such as the College Republicans and the Youth for Western Civilization have organized multiple events targeting certain demographics with hateful programming and consistently pushed rhetoric that targets AU students with personal attacks. 
On the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah, the AUCRs hosted a pig roast on the Quad titled the Carnivore Initiative, affirming their “right to eat meat.” I suppose this was a show of bravado against the vegetarians and vegans on campus trying to “force feed” them greens or the folks of the Jewish faith who were observing a High Holiday “too faithfully.” 
On the first day of Latino History Month, AUCRs fliered the campus with posters as part of their Anti-Che Day. While there perhaps needs to be a discussion of Che Guevara’s status in pop culture, the event was targeted too specifically to be anything less than racism and intimidation.
We are a campus that prides itself on our diversity. Many voices exist at AU, and allowing them to be heard is of the utmost importance. But there is a difference between free speech and intimidation – dialogue and hate. 
AU students on the whole vehemently oppose racism, but in practice we refuse to admit our hand in perpetuating it. It happens every day in our classrooms, dorms and apartments. But we instead blind ourselves with the next electoral race or internship on the Hill or prestigious speaker. It’s easier, and we have all done it, but we can no longer make those excuses. Not if we care about our fellow students.
I am not immune either. As College Dems President, no matter which issue we faced I tried to argue that the organization should stand by the principles of the Democratic Party to stand up for those marginalized by economic inequality, racism and gender and sexuality norms. 
And yet time and time again, be it in the call for sexual assault education on campus or in the face of targeted racism, the organization I love stood silent. It was easier to play politics, to spin the story or dodge the question, than it was to stand up for our beliefs. 
We did everything that Congress does, and then we went back to our dorms and wondered about our spineless politicians: how the agency of a woman could be rolled back, how fair access to health care be challenged and how laws limiting the freedom of Americans, be them undocumented workers in Arizona or union firefighters in Wisconsin, could be passed.
But it starts here. It starts with our own attitudes. The politicos on AU’s campus, myself included, saw it only as a game to be played and a line on a resume – not the very future of our country. We took the easy path and oppression perpetuated itself.
Our campus should be a safe place for all of our students. However, it isn’t when certain groups continually harass certain demographics of students. Gov. Jan Brewer’s unchallenged presence on campus represented this tacit approval of hate. 
After a semester of feeling abandoned by the campus at large, disrupting Jan Brewer’s speech seemed like the only way to send this message. How do we live by the beliefs we all are so quick to espouse? Paul Wellstone once said, “If we don’t fight hard enough for the things we stand for at some point we have to recognize that we don’t really stand for them.”
As of today, I am resigning from the College Democrats, an organization I dearly love but of which I am also ashamed. 
Our political lives begin today, and I know the AU community can address the real issues of oppression here on campus, if we stand by our beliefs. They run much deeper than a single banner or speech or op-ed.

• @”how many people they sleep with is not a measure of their worth.” I disagree. Sleeping around signals psychological problems such as insecurity, neediness, low self-esteem, impulsivity, depression, etc. It often goes hand in hand with substance abuse.  While we may agree that these people need to be helped rather than scorned, not everyone is willing to take on the drama of such a damaged friend.  That’s what the counseling center is for.
• My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.  I have other pants that aren’t sweat pants, but I really prefer to wear my sweat pants each day.

I feel like he is being kind of controlling, but on the other hand I want him to be honest and feel like he can tell me when something bothers him. Am I overreacting?
• @”Please continue to judge everyone by things that don’t remotely affect you and have NOTHING to do with their personality.” Actually sleeping around is considered a symptom (when combined with other impulsive behaviors) in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is used to diagnose mental disorders and personality disorders. And if you have ever studied personality psychology you would know that any given personality test calculates sexual behavior into account (as it correlated with many other behaviors that make up personality).
• People complaining about secondhand smoke don't know anything.  You're going to die because you eat junk like Pop-Tarts and french fries, and because you judge the quality of exercise based on how many calories you burn.  You won't die from a whiff or two per day of cigarette smoke.  Your health is in your hands; don't blame the smokers.  - A non-smoker
• F*** it. Just tell yourself to F*** it. And tell the person you like that you like them, kiss them, ask them out, make them smile, laugh. Or even just a friend. Make the world a smily place filled with laughter. Because when you reeeeally think about it, what is better than that?
• This past Monday was my 5th week at the Counseling Center. I feel like I have transitioned into an entirely new emotional state/mental state, because of them. I had/have a variety of topics to talk about, but only one dragged me to the center to talk about others. Thank you counseling center. I will continue to use you. Because I honestly feel like I am capable of doing anything at this point. :-)
• @I want an explanation! - or the ugly wonk who hates smokers. I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Maybe if you stopped being such a control freak nerd, you would have some friends and not notice the smokers as much. Just stay indoors and the evil smoke won't get you, and that shouldn't be too hard for you I am assuming you have spent the majority of your life hanging out with your parents.

But good try.
• @Am I overreacting?,
WHY are you wearing sweatpants in public? I'd agree with your bf that you should dress a little nicer than that to go out. But if he also criticizes the clothes you wear around the dorm/ in private, that sounds controlling/problematic.

It sounds like someone is a virgin in terms of emotional maturity. Apparently, you still have some growing up to do.
• @""Sweatpants wearer."" You have to be yourself, do your thing, and stick to your own style. Keep on wearing sweatpants as much as you like.  But if it would make your bf happy, it wouldn't hurt to dress nice every once in a while.

I choose to live a healthy lifestyle and do not appreciate people who selfishly release their toxic fumes into my walking path when they could just as easily get their high from a nicotine patch and thereby avoid harming others with their decisions. I try my best not to make decisions that harm others, and I expect the same respect from others.

• @TimMcBrideDelawareRant- I'm just glad you know it's a state. Proud to rep the state of our SG Pres, not so proud about that witch

• @”I can tell by the way you write that you are an annoying sheltered virgin. Actually I have plenty of sex with my amazing girlfriend, thanks for asking.  But I’m glad you view your sluttiness and impulsivity as an accomplishment.  And I admire virgins for waiting for the right person instead of giving it up at a trashy frat party. But I don’t even know why I am bothering to argue with someone who clearly lacks basic human decency towards others and doesn’t care if they blow toxic fumes at innocent bystanders.
• I'll be your candle on the water. My love for you will always shine. I know you're lost and drifting. But the clouds are lifting.
• AU might become smoke-free?? I might consider moving back from CA. (jk I like the weather here). But seriously... a lot of the colleges out here are smoke free and it's sooo nice. And no one is complaining. I don't care if you smoke-that's your decision and your health at stake. But I don't want to be forced to smell it.
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”
No I won’t “get over” your poisoning nonconsenting bystanders with cancer causing, genetic mutating toxins. There are less selfish ways to relieve stress that don’t harm others. How about exercising, yoga, sex, masturbating, smoking weed, watching shows on hulu, playing board games, watching porn, etc?
• @""My bf of a few months told me he doesn’t like it when I wear sweat pants.""... i can't tell if this is serious or not but if this is true, that's kindof a weird thing for him to say. if someone said that to me i'd be uncomfortable. i mean every so often dress up for each other, sure. but like. wear what you want.
• Does AU provide free child care for the children of AU students? Many schools do. I know AU has a children's center on the south side of campus, but I'm not sure if it is free. I don't have kids; I was jw.
• I think the smoke free campus issue should be put to referendum. Let the students decide. I have no doubt that they will make the ethical choice and vote for a smoke free campus. You know years from now our children will be horrified that campuses use to allow smokers. Just like nowadays we find it hard to believe that when our parents were young smoking was the usual past time on airplanes.

[Editor’s Note: Probably not. Maybe once on Wednesday]
• @“Smoking relieves my stress. It may be entirely psychological, but it does. So no, I won’t give up my one bad habit. Get over it guys, it’s just smoke!”  If you are relying on a harmful habit to relieve your stress, maybe you would benefit from going to the counseling center to get the root of what is causing your excess levels of stress and how to find more healthy ways to handle your stress. Your primary way of relieving stress should not have to involve harming others. There’s free help out there waiting for you are the counseling center.

• To the editor: You make my day with your comments, especially since you love Christine like I do too. Keep on being awesome. :]
• To the smokers: maybe a smoke-free plan wouldn't even be necessary if you actually listened to the 25 feet rule? Just saying, it's not that hard and could make everyone's life easier. Could even save you from dealing with a smoke-free campus policy. Hm, novel idea? Sounds like it to me.
• @""boyfriend doesn't like it when I wear sweat pants each day."" Honestly, you should be able to wear whatever you want. I mean, it's nice to see your girlfriend in something cute or something ""nicer,"" but he really shouldn't try to control what you wear. That's just silly. It starts with something simple like that and it can escalate into even crazier restrictions. But don't let me should on you. I just think that if you want to be comfy, be comfy. :]

• Oh boy! the SG dumped more tuition dollars into a Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator!

• I am extremely disappointed in the American University community. Where are the AC fans?
• Why are you judging the quality of the student body by the anonymous rants people post when they're feeling bored/ frustrated and need to vent?
Rants are a way to let off steam by complaining or being weird or random or crazy, not a way to accurately evaluate student intelligence. If reading Eagle Rants annoys you...then why don't you try not reading them?
• @Am I overreacting?
I don't think so. Your boyfriend should make you feel beautiful, not frumpy and unattractive. If he teased you about wearing sweatpants a couple times, I would say let it go, but if he's really pushy then that's a problem. I can understand why it matters to him (I have certain expectations for how my boyfriends should dress as well) but he shouldn't be trying to control your appearance. In my opinion that's crossing a line.

• @""Why is everyone hating on the slut shamers!?"" If you're happy in your 2 year relationship, congrats. If someone is happy ""whoring themselves to every guy in EI"", what do you care?? You're both happy, worthy people and who you sleep with is NOT a factor in that!
• Oh my god not everyone who has sex is screwing the first person they see. And if they are, why on earth does it matter to anyone else? Have sex with no one or have sex with everyone: that's their choice and everyone else should mind their own business because it doesn't matter!
• For the last time, Student Government has NOTHING to do with tuition money!
• @""To the ranters making Breaking Bad references, I want to sweet raw love to all of you!""
As the original poster from yesterday, this makes me so excited I just want to throw a pizza on the roof! But don't worry, I'll save the dipping sticks. ;]
• @I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer.
I have been ranting about this to my friends and everyone I know for every single day of my life...MARRY ME PLS???
• Smoking's a choice; if smokers want to smoke, let them.  This is an awfully controlling thing to try to shove down people's throats, just saying.
• ""@“Drop. Your. Sword.” Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!""
And don't forget: Never get involved in a land war in Asia!
• @ a girl- Might as well have said ""You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week. So I guess you picked today. Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays."" Quit hating! She's concerned about her boyfriend, don't judge her choice to wear sweatpants.
• @Alanis Morissette lyrics
I love you. That is all.
• You sir have also lost the Game.
• Wait you mean smoking is bad for you??? I can't believe no one told me that before!!! I am obviously going to quit right this second now that I know that!
• Woman, I ain't your man, so stop acting like I am!
• “And if you ACTUALLY knew what you were talking about, you’d know that unless a person’s habits and actions are affecting their, or another’s, day to day life, they dont have a problem. But good try.” LoL are you serious here? Are you aware sex involves two people? That means the actions are affecting BOTH the individual with the sluttiness issues AND the people they are sleeping with. That meets your criteria to the letter honey. But good try.
• ""And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with, hm? What one particular element comes to mind, hm? Hmm?""
""Aaaah, wire."" XD
• @ Hey guess what?: Hellz yeah, seems like people cant keep their mouths shut and private business to themselves
• @”I have to wonder, why is there no on campus river? I feel like my tuition should pay for such a thing.” You have no idea how often I think the exact same thing. We should least get a little steam thing going.
• Can everyone just live and let live? Just quit judging people and just BE? But I guess then there wouldn't be any Eagle Rants...
• Last semester, I had a great time at AU without out-of-class friends.  This semester, I got some and had a blast hanging out with them.  Then they randomly quit talking to me.  Now I feel super down on myself and am not having a good time at all.  Hopefully being around people who actually like me back home over break will help my confidence, because I feel really sh*tty right now...
• @”Again, can we please put the Eagle Rants tab on the website on the LEFT side of the screen, so we don’t have to expand the website each time we open the eagle website in order to access the rants.” Agreed. This is three seconds of my life WASTED each day when I have to expand the webpage. Eagle staff, GET ON THIS.
• @”I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer. That’d be cool. But God could have made pokemon real but instead was like “Nah man. Malaria.” T_T” You’re the kind of guy I wanna marry. A) Are you single? B) Where can I find you?
• @ ""I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked."" If you come to the wrestling room in JFC on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 AM, you will have come to the right place.
• Does anyone else watch TV shows on Netflix, and then once you start a show you become obsessed with it and can’t do your homework until you have finished the whole season? #bing tv show watching problems
• sweatpants girl here, thanks for everyone's advice. It was all very helpful. I've talked to my bf about it and we've come to a compromise. :)
• Can we have a vending machine full of Clif bars? Is that even remotely possible?
• @""Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it.""- Handily enough, theres a whole article about this! Right here! Online! Under the ""News"" section!
• @""what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked.""
We're a loosely-military training group.  I'm a Marine officer candidate myself, and I design the workouts.  They will broadly strengthen all elements of functional fitness.  Do and don't be intimidated by us at the same time.  We welcome all fitness levels (many civilians are part of the group), but we WILL kick your ass :).  We're done until after break, but you won't regret joining us at 6am on the 20th.  All are welcome.
• ""we don’t judge or insult you for not joining."" Hmm.... I wonder how the term GDI came about??
• @""does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?""
I know it existed as of last semester, at least.  I'm pretty sure it's still going on now.  HOWEVER, I run a completely different club, and I can tell you from experience that those ""official"" email addresses usually don't get checked very often.  Your best bet is to find someone who's in it already that can give you the details.
• How about all the confident and attractive people just keep having lots of great sex with each other, and all the nervous virgins can keep calling women ""sluts"" and f***ing themselves?  Problem solved!
• I'm sick and tired of being judged for being male. I'm actually one of the men who is NOT a terrible person.
• I didn't get a Little. :'( I guess I'll just walk the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
• I've cordially invited many people to my pants party but as of yet no one has RSVP-ed. What should I do?
• No matter, how much I try, I cannot will myself to finish this paper.
• Re the leggings as pants debate, and this also applies to the girl with the boyfriend who doesn't like her frequent sweatpants-wearing: I used to be a anti-leggings gal. Now, I love them. They are mega comfortable. If you by a good quality pair (which doesn't have to be anywhere near expensive), they won't be so tight and revealing. And my boyfriend loves when I wear them, so wins all around!
• lol thyroid - cute.
• I just got rescued by the search and rescue raptor. Yay for being home!
• Dear freshmen who thinks they have more credits than me. You dont. You're just like everyone else at this school who thinks their smart. STFU or GTFO
• @people complaining about 30 year old guy walking around in a building: did you care to see if he worked for AU as facilities or maintenance? did you see if he had been claimed by someone? because I work at a front desk and I have seen strangers ask residents to claim them and the resident will. so double check among yourselves before blaming the people at the desk.
• @• ""I’m sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished..."" If you actually read the email, it wasn't talking about the creation of a victim's advocate position, it was talking about the recent development of confidentiality for that position... which just happened this year.  Also, the email opened up with ""For years.""
• I WANNA MAKE LOVE WITH YOU!
• Regarding the smoking issue:Its irrelevant whether or not smoking is addicting or dangerous. I'm sorry, but if you really are so terrified of second-hand smoke that you cant stand to be around it, then you should have gone to a non-smoking school, instead of making everyone conform to you. This is a matter of liberty. People have the right to do what they want to their body. You do not have the authority to limit people's free choices. Plain and simple.
• @""Where are the AC fans?"" I am a fan of air conditioning.
• Dear Person who quoted Pete's Dragon, I love you.
• Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
• Can we go back to weekly rants?  As much as I enjoy the daily rants, 1) The Rants were all around better when they only came out once a week and 2) I'm sick of these ""hey post the rants already"" rants.
Signed,
A Disgruntled Ranter
• why, why, WHY? cant you just respond
• I was watching Kenan and Kel tonight, and the plot was them trying to get to a double date on time. Their date was to see a movie called Teen McBride. Anytime it was brought up, I only heard Tim McBride... #AUproblems
• @""sweetie, if you want silence don’t sit outside the mud box and don’t tell me what to do cause im a freshman, i probably have more credits than you anyways.""...honey, talk to me in 4 years when you grow up and think twice before you throw lip, because you don't know who you may cross.
• Banana,
Thursday night I met you on LAL. you seemed really cool. thanks again for the genuine conversation.
Apple
• Well all the friends that you knew in school, they used to be so cool, now they just bore you. Well look at them now, already pulling the plow - so quick to take to grain like some old mule.
• @virtually no sexual assaults on campus: Come to Take Back the Night, I (double-dog) dare you. Amazing how your perspective changes when you see that girl from class go up to the microphone.
• So over people hating on Women's Initiative. They go hard in the paint, get over it.
• drunk eagleranting is the bestest eagleranting
• So ready to live with people who understand that mental health is a real thing.
• Come on guys let's all be friends.
• Trouble...feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again.
• I will totally date a girl who wears sweatpants.
• Someone needs to start a petition or awareness campaign or something to cut down on the excessive amount of long-distance relationships (half) on this campus.
• Jose for #
• To my photo TA: If you get any hotter, I may go insane
• LISTEN UP. AU will never be smoke free, not at least until we get our campus plan approved. Where do people go when they can't smoke on campus? The neighborhood directly around campus. This is the same neighborhood that hates AU and the students. As long as the university wants to get the campus plan approved, the campus will never go smoke free. It would be a very stupid decision. (Don't get me wrong though, I totally support a smoke-free campus!)
• @""Is Women’s Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a “rape culture”?"" ARE. YOU. JOKING. ME?? GTFO.
• To the person who responded with a hash tag about straight female conservative republican. I'm glad you people are demonized on campus. How dare you try to deny legitimate members of our society the right to marriage? Or to spend countless tax dollars on drug testing the poor to satiate your appetite for humiliation of those less fortunate than yourself? I've got a hash tag for you. #scum
• I""m just going to let you go, I like you enough to not want you to get hurt by me.
• @ whoever commented on my @5th week at the counseling center.
Thank you! Things are going very well. It's all about attitude and learning to help yourself rather than having someone else help you. It's rather exciting. Good luck with you too! Just remember to trust yourself, be yourself, and believe in yourself! (little words of wisdom I tell myself everyday to keep going, it sounds cheesy I know) LOVE YOUR LIFE everyone! It gets better :-)
• To the girl whose dog just had puppies and who let her sorority sisters take them out on the quad: Those little bundles of joy made my day, and you are amazing. I would love to have one if I could in my dorm! XP They were really so adorable. :']
• to awful lotta high class honkeys: please quit your whining - at least sometimes. it's getting old.
• Gov. Brewer ""deserves to be protested,"" while at the same time we should welcome a ""saint"" with open arms who named a sitting US Senator and Presidential candidate after a sex act... Way to go AU. Disgusting.
• TY TY RAH RAH!! ;) you fine like dynamite.
• T,
YOU'RE SEXY AND I KNOW IT!!
-curiousgal
• So excited to have the room to myself! Zumba every day!!!
• Is there a way I could get an e-mail when rants are posted. Am I too obsessed?
• Please post rants are at a more consistent time (like 5 each day). This week's times have ranged 4:34 pm to 9:30 pm. I need consistency in order to plan my daily schedule of activities. Thanks.
• omg you suck for not responding to my texts. i'm just bored and want you to come have sex with me, sheesh.
• Guys at TDR were making fun of us for staying on campus during Spring Break, calling us nerds.  Not to sound elitist, but I don't think I'm going to be taking life advice from a TDR worker.
• To the kid in my lit class who always disrespects the teacher: I'm not saying I love everything about her. But I'm putting time and money into that class, and if you don't shut up FAST, we will have a problem. PS: your paper was terrible and it DIDN'T fit the assignment. true story. stop whining.
