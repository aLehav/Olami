2009-03-05,AU,conservative,"As the crowd streamed out of Ward 1 last Thursday, shouts for ethnic pride and gay rights rang through the air while faint voices sang ""This Land is My Land."" Former Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., had just given his talk about assimilation against the ""cult of multiculturalism,"" and some students had been stifling and hushing their reactions to his words all night.
The AU chapter of the national organization Youth for Western Civilization invited Tancredo to speak on campus, and the event drew both interest and protest.
YWC started on campus last semester through the efforts of Kevin DeAnna, a senior in the School of International Service who also helped found the national organization. 
""I started it here and found some other people who agreed with its goals,"" DeAnna said.
YWC chapters also exist at several other campuses across the nation, according to the group's Facebook page.
The group's Facebook page also displays its mission statement.
""The purpose of Youth for Western Civilization is to form a right wing youth movement,"" the page said. ""Youth for Western Civilization educates, organizes and trains activists on campuses across the nation to create a subculture that promotes the survival of Western Civilization and pride in Western heritage.""
Protest organizers referenced the Facebook page during a preliminary organizational meeting prior to Tancredo's speech.
""The language on the Facebook group is flawless,"" said Bianca Jones, Inter-cultural Liaison of Black Student Alliance, who came to the meeting representing herself and not the BSA.
The AU YWC Facebook group's description said the group's purpose is to educate about and promote pride in Western heritage and incite debate among its members on ""issues of vital important to Western Civilization.""
Josh Jacobs, a freshman in SIS, said he thinks the YWC is not racist on its Facebook page or elsewhere.
""I'm Jewish, our vice president is Hispanic, our president is an international student and we have multi-ethnic and multi-religious members,"" Jacobs said.
Even with diversity within the group, one can still show pride in the group's collective Western heritage and identiy, Jacobs said. 
""We hold that you should not be proud of your biology. There is nothing special about being born white, black, or Hispanic. It's a skin color,"" he said.
""I felt the need to join the Youth for Western Civilization group in order to see what the group and some of their members stand for,"" said Nafiza Jelassi, a senior in SIS and the Kogod School of Business who is an Egyptian-born Muslim.
Jelassi said she felt the group directs its attitudes solely towards white Americans.  
""I want to disprove their stereotypes of people who don't fall into their understanding of who's an American by getting to know them and letting them get to know me,"" she said.
""It is important for Muslims to not only be open to others but to help people understand what we stand for,"" she said. ""[YWC] is very new to our campus and perhaps some of the members may benefit learning from AU's diversity,"" she said.
DeAnna discussed the YWC's mission and views in an e-mail interview.
""We are opposed to radical multiculturalism, mass immigration, racial preferences and attempts to move curriculum away from Western Canon,"" DeAnna said in the e-mail. ""We are a nonpartisan conservative youth group that is concerned about the far left climate on American college campuses and are trying to push the debate back to the center.""
Vitus Van Rij and Amanda Patino, freshmen in SIS, helped to start and lead the group with DeAnna this year.
""The reason I was attracted to the group was because of the sort of hypocrisy I found on the leftist movement,"" Patino said. ""There's this idea that we're all equal and whatnot, but at the same time there's nothing unifying about their actions ... there are plenty of other people trying to tear our country apart and they don't need our help doing it.""
She said she helped DeAnna start AU's YWC chapter last semester, but they did not plan any events until this semester.
""[Tom Tancredo's talk] was our first main event,"" DeAnna said. ""It went well ... It was to open a debate on immigration and assimilation and announce our presence on campus ... We got our message out, the lecture was well attended by both sides.""
Some students wore black clothing and carried signs to protest of the event, but some came to support Tancredo's message and join forces with YWC.
Since Tancredo's lecture, YWC's Facebook group has increased its membership.
""I met a number of new members,"" DeAnna said. ""I don't exactly have a formal roster right now ... [but] it's certainly growing ... and I expect that growth will continue.""
Jacobs said he joined YWC a few weeks ago.
""The group offers a good alternative perspective on ... a very pro-multicultural campus,"" he said.
Jacobs is involved in College Republicans as well as in YWC, and several other YWC members are also affiliated with College Republicans, including College Republicans Vice President Luke Kraus and David Lindgren, a freshman in SIS.
Though College Republicans and YWC hold certain ideals in common, Lindgren said YWC needs to exist separate from a partisan organization.
""I am a member of the College Republicans,"" he said. ""And although certain parts of the Republican ideology align with that of the YWC, I feel YWC focuses and seeks to promote a greater understanding of Western culture and the harm of multiculturalism in American society that college Republicans do not address.""
YWC's message is for both those who associate themselves with Republicans and Democrats, Lindgren said.
""Specifically addressing the point of multiculturalism, an individual does not need to be a Republican or Democrat to understand the challenges multiculturalism poses and the problems associated with seeking to differentiate cultures,"" he said.
The purpose of the group's opposition to multiculturalism is to unify, according to DeAnna.
""America has a lot of different kinds of people here,"" he said in the e-mail. ""Something has to hold us together.""
Tancredo's talk expressed the group's goal to be as inclusive as possible, DeAnna said.
""[Tancredo] stated that people - regardless of race, religion or background - can become part of this country and identify proudly with American history and as part of the American people,"" he said in the e-mail.

2009-03-05,AU,conservative,"Being at AU for four years now, I'm no stranger to rolling my eyes when another misguided ""progressive"" colleague, seemingly unaware or indifferent to the eugenics, racism, social planning and contempt for individual freedom synonymous with the word's history, proceeds to attack conservatives for being both ""mean"" and ""stupid."" Watching progressive ignorance embarrass itself can be fun, but the absurdity of Jacob Shelly's most recent column simply cannot be exaggerated, largely for the same reason infinity cannot be exaggerated.
First and foremost, Shelly shows his own ""meanness"" and ""stupidity"" when he throws all substance and seriousness to the wind by willfully embracing an ignorant caricature of former President Bush's term in office. Surely, our 43rd president's term in office was filled with failings, and we should be honest about what they are and what they are not. Seeing the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, our economic hard times and the war in Iraq as the result of President Bush being one-big meany-pants hardly is the mark of someone whose accusations of ""stupidity"" can be taken seriously.
Many of Shelly's assertions also go a long way in disqualifying him from making stupidity calls. For one thing, President Obama is hardly ""wildly popular."" His approval rating is about average for a president within his first 100 days, according to Gallup polls taken of presidents going back to Eisenhower. For another, the stimulus is hardly ""wildly popular."" At the end of January, CNN reported support for the stimulus dropped nearly 12 points in a week, finishing off at about a 51 percent approval rating. This of course says nothing of the more than 30,000 phone calls the offices of Sens. Snowe, Specter and Collins against the stimulus bill from their constituents, forcing them to shut off their office phones. 
While it's clear Shelly is titillated by the stimulus (even with the contraceptives funding removed, curiously enough), I'd love to know one ""poor"" person that will actually be aided by the stimulus, unless of course he means those 1.2 million additional recipients of Medicare as a result of the stimulus, which could even include Wall Street CEOs. Then again, seeing as the Dow has lost nearly 20 percent of its value since Election Day, nearly half of it coming since Obama's inauguration, they may need our tax dollars after all. 
Shelly should also be more concerned about making sure the provision in the stimulus to override governors' decisions to refuse stimulus money is actually constitutional before he starts questioning the motives of those against the money. And, given Shelly's logic that any governor refusing stimulus funds is clearly plotting a presidential run, he might want to talk to Gov. Phil Bredesen, D-Tenn., who is considering turning down stimulus money.
Fiction can be fun, or ""awesome"" as Shelly alludes. But without facts, the only person left sounding mean and stupid is Shelly himself.

2009-03-05,AU,conservative,"Some of your readers may recall a letter that I previously sent to your paper in reply to an Alex Knepper column. In it, I take him to task on the straw man that he sets up, which stated that liberals cared less about victims of bigotry in non-Western countries than about the comparatively less severe discrimination in the West. Apparently, he has revived this canard in his latest column. 
I once more reiterate that crimes east of the Prime Meridian do not mitigate the crimes to its west, and it's more practical to address problems at home than those abroad. If Knepper says he supports the plight of victims of bigotry in Muslim countries, then I recommend that he donate his time and/or resources to human rights organizations (most of them run by leftists) that advocate for them (such as Human Rights Watch), instead of crassly appropriating their cause to score cheap political points against liberals. 
He also makes another erroneous point in regards to ""victimhood"" and ""identity politics."" First, no minority advocacy organization wants to perpetuate victimhood as conservatives want to caricature them. They are simply about transforming victimhood into empowerment. 
Second, identity politics is a fact of life in the U.S., let alone the world. Identity politics is but a simple acknowledgment of the fact that people are categorized into groups beyond their control. The identity of each group is shaped by the forces around it, and if those forces involve past discrimination, then that cannot simply be abandoned as easily as some say it should.

2009-04-09,AU,conservative,"The national teenage birthrate has increased for the second year in a row following a previous 14-year trend of steady decreases.
The rate at which unmarried women who gave birth rose by seven percent between 2006 and 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control National Center for Health Statistics. The same report showed Texas, New Mexico and Mississippi - all states that traditionally vote conservatively - had the three highest number of teen birth rates. In Mississippi, there were 68.4 births for every 1,000 girls aged 15-19. The report did not cover how many pregnancies were terminated.
The consensus among many experts is that nobody is certain as to what is causing the sudden rise in unplanned pregnancies, although authorities on both ends of the ideological divide have voiced their opinions.
""With any kind of contraceptive there's a risk involved,"" Karin Thornton, AU's associate Catholic chaplain, said in response to the report. The Roman Catholic Church and the federal government both advocate for abstinence-only programs. Under President Barack Obama, the programs could receive significant funding cuts, according to The Washington Post.
Critics of these programs argue that abstinence-only programs do not always provide a complete and effective education.
""I think it's pretty clear from a number of independent research studies that abstinence-only education is not particularly helpful to students,"" said Women's Initiative Director Ashley Evans. 
Evans said that although she supports a person's right to abstain, she also emphasized the need to get all the information.
""'Abstinence-plus' programs would be a more comprehensive solution,"" she said.
While she said she supports a complete education, Thornton said she did not know about other programs outside of her area.
""I don't know the matter of the education is because I haven't listened to their particular plan,"" Thornton said.
Evans and Thornton chose not to comment on the CDC's report, but were happy to share their views on the general topic.
Parents have a role in their children's actions, said Rebecca Hsieh, a graduate student in the School of Public Affairs' Justice, Law and Society program.
""I feel that's where parents really need to intervene and talk with their kids and realize what they're going through because it's ultimately the kid's decision,"" she said.
Women's Initiative will host ""I Heart the Female Orgasm,"" a sex-education presentation put on by authors Dorian Solot and Marshall Miller, on April 24.
While the program is part of a national movement, Evans said she encourages men to attend, calling the event ""the climax of the year.""

2009-09-10,AU,conservative,"As I watched Ted Kennedy laid to rest at the end of August, I found myself thinking about 1987. That was the year Kennedy castigated Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. During Bork's hearings, Kennedy said, ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government."" In retrospect, many people think Kennedy's speech was the beginning of the end for Bork. Critics also charge that the harshness of his words caused of our current culture war. Maybe so. As recently as Aug. 28 of this year, The New York Times ran an editorial stating as much.
Whether or not he caused it, Kennedy certainly was on the right side of the culture war. Like all good progressives, he battled social conservatives who seek to suppress anything they personally find un-Christian, immoral or inconsistent with traditional American values. It is a struggle that still rages today.
The current Virginia gubernatorial race is rife with culture clash. The Washington Post recently reported on Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's college thesis for Regent University (Pat Robertson's school). In said thesis, McDonnell writes that working women are ""detrimental"" to families. He argues that government should prefer married couples to ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.""  He also calls a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing contraception for unmarried couples ""illogical."" He wrote that at age 34. McDonnell is starting to look like George Allen, a Virginia Republican whose 2006 Senate re-election campaign was eventually derailed when he was caught using an ethnic slur.
The Democratic National Committee has released a statement on this issue and its wording sounds familiar. It makes reference to ""Bob McDonnell's preferred Virginia,"" and pundits are already describing Democratic attacks on the thesis as ""Borking"" McDonnell. ""Borking"" is the term Republicans created for when Democrats show their backwards-looking nominees and candidates for what they really are. This entire episode illustrates why despite Democratic struggles, the Republican Party is far away from returning to power. And why? Perhaps because the GOP is a party made up of white men looking out for the interest of white men.
The problem for Republicans is that the number of white men in America continues to decline. Women outnumber them today, and in just a few decades there will be no racial majority in America. The election of a black man who campaigned on the change undercuts the decades-old GOP strategy of appealing to certain white, male fears. There are still plenty of scared white men. They are the armed nuts you see at town halls, and they would love to live in Robert Bork's America. But let us always remember Ted Kennedy. As we look around at our country as it exists now, not in a Republican fantasy of yesteryear, let us realize something. We don't live in Robert Bork's America. We live, mostly, in the America of Ted Kennedy's dreams.

2009-10-12,AU,conservative,"Clarification Appended
It’s always tough to talk about abortion. It’s a divisive issue on which many good people vehemently disagree. This is true at American as it is across America. On our campus, the Students For Life and Students For Choice organizations both thrive. Both are big; both are active. The abortion debate plays out articulately and passionately, to the credit of all involved. 
This newspaper has no plans to take sides in this struggle, especially because there is diversity of opinion among our editorial board. However, we are supportive of advancing honest and open discourse on this issue, which is why we appreciate the panel discussion AU Students For Choice hosted this past week.
Clearly, “Exposing Fake Clinics” was a pro-abortion rights affair. Wednesday’s panel featured representatives from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, the National Abortion Federation and the Feminist Majority Foundation. It’s safe to say none of these organizations advocate overturning Roe v. Wade or supporting Sarah Palin for president in 2012. Still, social conservatives can and should learn from them. The panel exposed disturbing misinformation campaigns on the part of anti-abortion rights activists, which undermine the anti-abortion cause and embolden pro-abortion rights activists. More importantly, they are harmful to American women, pro-life and pro-choice alike.
According to a Sept. 21 press release from Feminist Majority Foundation, many anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers in this country use “misinformation, fear and shame tactics to coerce and intimidate women out of considering abortion as an option.” Some call condoms a “con job,” completely misrepresenting their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and disease. Additionally, some CPCs distribute pamphlets that claim abortion leads to an increased risk of breast cancer. The World Health Organization refutes this claim completely.
To be fair, pro-abortion rights organizations can also be guilty of stretching the truth and omitting information harmful to their cause. This should go without saying. But no serious activist on either side of this issue would justify bad behavior by pointing to more bad behavior. In fact, most activists on both sides of this issue would probably agree on a few things.
Given that abortion remains legal in this country, women should be able to access a wide range of accurate information on this sensitive topic. Social conservatives should stop their scare tactics and misinformation. Social liberals should be honest about abortion’s physical and emotional consequences. Abortions are not a walk in the park. They can be gruesome and they raise troubling moral and ethical questions for an increasing number of Americans, including an increasing number of young people.
This issue is divisive and emotional. For many, gray area simply does not exist. But this is all the more reason why our campus and our country deserve an honest, substantive debate. The abortion argument should never be reduced to competing smear campaigns. Precisely because we cannot render this culture war unnecessary, America must fight it fairly. 
Clarification: The term ""pro-abortion"" was inappropriately used several times in this editorial and should have been ""pro-abortion rights."" This version of the editorial has been changed to reflect this.

2009-11-12,AU,conservative,"PHILADELPHIA — Libertarians are a diverse bunch. Some of them wish they could abolish government entirely. Others just want its power reduced. But what unites them is their shared belief that the state should be substantially smaller and do drastically less. 
Here at AU, the libertarians have a club. AU Students For Liberty is a small operation. I’m told that fewer than 20 students attend regular meetings or events. Still, there are few diehards, most of whom I met this past weekend when I traveled with AUSFL to the 2009 Students For Liberty Mid-Atlantic Conference. The event took place at Drexel University, smack dab in the middle of the Cradle of Liberty itself — Philadelphia. The journey I took there and back again is something I won’t forget soon. It taught me about an alternative governing philosophy, but it also gave me a glimpse at what it’s like to be part of a political counterculture.
Our odyssey began last Friday with a Chinatown bus ride. On the way from D.C. to Philly, I got a primer on libertarian philosophy and policy from a few members of AUSFL. For two hours, I asked hundreds of questions and took furious notes. The young libertarians explained their core principles of nonaggression and self-ownership. They argued that taxation is slavery. They dismissed the entire idea of slicing up the economic pie, saying the solution is simply to make that pie bigger. 
Throughout the conversation, I had several realizations about libertarians. First, many of them don’t love Ron Paul. True libertarians want government out of their lives in every respect, so they don’t understand Paul’s pro-life stance or his opposition to gay marriage. They say the state shouldn’t be involved in any of this.
Second, libertarians disagree amongst themselves — a lot. In fact, it seems to me, based on my little exposure, that there is greater diversity of thought within the libertarian movement than within the conservative or progressive movements. There is a great libertarian debate over just how tiny government should be. A few of them like public education, but most don’t. Many think the government should run the justice system, the military and the police force, but some don’t.
As I learned talking to AU and Drexel students at a mixer late Friday night, there are two main camps within the libertarian movement: the minarchists and the anarcho-capitalists or anarchists. The former advocate extremely limited government. The latter, at least ideally, prefer no government at all.
Learning about anarcho-capitalism shocked me, as I imagine it would shock many people. Certainly, I am familiar with the argument that limited government means more freedom. I get it. It’s compelling. I can conceive of a scenario in which America reverts to the traditions of the Founding generation and structures government simply to provide justice, defense, security and maybe a limited form of welfare. That transformation, which is what minarchists want, would be radical, but it could happen.
What I found unbelievable was that anarcho-capitalists think the Founders’ government was way too big. They have so much faith in capitalism, so much faith in free exchange, that they literally wish for a world where markets make the rules. They philosophically and practically think the state is a problem. Its abolishment, they argue, is the rational endgame of the liberty movement. 
These are radical views. They fly in the face of the Founders’ intent. They’re outside the mainstream of American politics. I think they’re insane and an overwhelming majority of Americans — nearly everyone — would reject them outright. 
The students I talked to know this. They’ve faced reality. None of them wear rose-colored glasses. The minarchists understand government will always be bigger than they’d like and the anarcho-capitalists know they’ll never have the government-free society of their dreams.
At Saturday’s conference, the students and the speakers made mention of these realities. The presenters — college professors, organization leaders and authors — spoke of setting small goals and pushing for incremental change.
I left the conference early, but I stayed long enough to get the gist. I saw Irena Schneider, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, give an impassioned speech in her capacity as Mid-Atlantic Director. I saw Eagle columnist Alex Knepper realize he was the moderate in the room. And most importantly, I saw a group of earnest political activists enjoying each other’s company, which is always cool. 
The Students For Liberty may have unconventional views about government, but they’re well within the mainstream as far as how to have a good time. I hardly knew any of them before last weekend, but everyone was accommodating and appreciative of an Eagle writer tagging along.
I had many personal firsts last weekend. I made my first visit to Philly. I ate my first Philly Cheesesteak. And for the first, and likely last time, I saw an apartment full of libertarians sing “Don’t Stop Believing” at the top of their lungs.
“...Some will win, some will lose/Some were born to sing the blues.” 
Sounds like libertarian economics to me.

2010-03-04,AU,conservative,"Democrats aren’t doing half bad right now. So far 2010 actually isn’t looking nearly as dire as it was just after pseudo-Republican Scott Brown won the Kennedy seat in Massachusetts.
If Democrats keep up the hard work and continue to ignore tea partiers—radical conservatives and ultra-liberals like they have been—they might just survive this year. Nevertheless, here’s a little advice.
Dear Democratic Strategists,
You’re doing alright. Behind all the tea party crazy talk and “Washington is broken” nonsense, the news cycle seems to be trending your way.
Predicting the news cycle is a difficult thing to do. Sometimes it’s rough for Democrats, sometimes it hits the GOP where it really hurts. 
This is supposed to be a rough year for Democrats. President Barack Obama’s policies haven’t sailed through as smoothly as we hoped. Hardly anyone’s happy with Congress, and it consists mostly of Democrats. So it’s all bad news for the Democratic Party, right?
I’m not so sure. Look at the news from Tuesday just this week, for example.
The leading headline in the Wall Street Journal was “Deal Near on Banking Rules,” one of the Democrats’ key policy items. Point for us.
Let’s look at others. “Tea Party Holds Risks for GOP.” Minus one for Republicans.
“Fed Void Clears Path for Obama,” “Manufacturing Shows Strength,” “Bailout Update: AIG’s repayment means U.S. is close to getting back half of its IOUs.” Point, point, point for Democrats.
And then there’s darling Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., holding up unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
“One Senator Holds Up Bill, in New Level of Gridlock,” proclaims the WSJ. And then Tuesday evening: “Deal Reached to End Senator’s Holdout.” Point.
“Well that’s just one paper!” conservatives might protest (never mind the fact that the Wall Street Journal typically leans right). Sure, but The Washington Post’s headlines tell the same story.
Oh, and see that cover story in the Metro section? It exposes Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia as the hypocrite he is, lobbying for education funding from the Recovery Act he’s been lobbying against since last year. Point.
So the media momentum has shifted left a bit. But we can’t just sit back and be passive, can we? “We can’t let Republicans control the agenda and the message!” say paranoid political strategists on the left.
Well, maybe not completely. But lately they’ve done a good job digging themselves into a hole without your help, Democrats.
So, let ‘em talk.
The Tea Party is a joke. Every time Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck opens their mouth, people ridicule them across the political spectrum. Ron Paul? Not much of a threat when the Republican establishment still loathes him. Let them talk.
The “Party of No” is still just saying “no,” as evidenced by Bunning’s ignorant protest of the unemployment bill. If all the public hears is “no,” let ‘em talk.
Finally, the stimulus bill is working, the economy continues to improve and Obama is working hard to find solutions to our debt problem.
Meanwhile, Republicans continue to pan his economic proposals, as if they weren’t going home to hypocritically take credit for the stimulus. Let ‘em talk; it’s only hurting them. 
So Democrats, for now I think you should just ride the wave. Let the Republicans screw up their own messaging—you just focus on getting things done. The people will notice. You act, let them talk.

2011-11-08,AU,conservative,"Just as one might wake up with a hangover after New Year’s, the government wakes up with a hangover at the beginning of a new fiscal year, said Heritage Foundation economic expert Alison Fraser.
Comparing the fiscal year to New Year’s Day, Fraser spoke about the current state of the economy at an AU College Republicans event Nov. 1
“Our hangover for the federal government is our debt,” she said. 
Fraser spoke to an audience of around 15 students in the University Club. Her organization, the Heritage Foundation, conducts conservative public policy research.
Fraser also discussed specific economic problems facing the United States and potential solutions to these problems.
“We are seeing a dramatic increase in the size and scope of our debt,” she said.  
America’s debt will only get worse with the direction the United States is headed in now, she said.  
“Our lesson learned, if any, from the EU’s experiences is that we are just a couple of years behind having to deal with the same issues,” she said.  
After explaining the issues, Fraser talked about solutions that the Heritage Foundation has supported in the past.  
“I would do it all on the spending side without raising taxes,” she said. “Rather than taxing the rich, I would rather take away their benefits,” referring to Social Security and Medicare.
Taxes make economic growth more difficult, she said.
“We’ve got to do this in a way that makes everyone’s future brighter,” Fraser said.
Fraser encouraged the students in attendance to talk to their parents and grandparents about these issues over Thanksgiving. 
She challenged students to ask them, “What are you going to do to help me?” 
“A lot of these solutions are going to rely on us having a conversation,” she said. 	
The solutions Fraser proposed seemed to resonate with many of the students at the event.  
“I really think she made a lot of sense,” said Ella Davis, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. “She had some really good ideas for the economy in the long term.”  
Charles Merrick, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, had a different opinion. 
“I generally liked the speech,” Merrick said. “I didn’t necessarily agree with things, but they made their points well.”  
Merrick said he was invited to the event by some of his Republican friends and attended because of his interest in economics.  
“It’s important to be open to other opinions,” he said.

Throughout the past two weeks, Herman Cain has weathered multiple accusations the he sexual harassed multiple women while the CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Four different women have alleged that Cain acted inappropriately toward them, while two went public this week. Yet despite the media firestorm, Cain remains a republican front runner, only a few points behind Mitt Romney. Why has Cain been able to whether the scandal? How should people react to sexual harassment allegations? Our Quick Take columnists weigh in:

Looking for a decent leader
By Derek Siegel
As Cain emerges as a front-runner for the Republican nomination, his campaign suffers an unexpected twist: three different women, more than a decade after the alleged incidents, have released simultaneous accusations of sexual assault. Do I think there’s politics involved? Of course. Even unproven and vehemently denied by the candidate himself, these allegations have shaken the playing field. 
But should the claims be dismissed as political froth? Never. No man, including Herman Cain, is above the law. If these allegations contain even a shred of truth, he must face the consequences. But what would happen if Cain apologized to these women? What if he released a press conference denouncing his past behavior but affirming his renewed commitment to lead our nation with dignity? 
We’d boot the bastard right out of Washington. If he didn’t respect these three women, then he’s certainly not fit for office. 
What’s more interesting than Cain’s response to the scandal is our response to it. When did we become so interested in the personal lives of our candidates? I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

I never bothered to read Cain’s 9-9-9 plan for economic reform, but I’ve scoured the Internet for the latest news on his sex scandal. This is just one facet in an unspoken nation disagreement as to what makes a “good” leader. For some people it’s all about the policies. They’ve just a check list of their own—education, immigration, diplomacy, etc—that they compare to the candidate’s platform. For other people, though, politicians are more than the sum of their policies. 
There’s the old stereotype that you can’t trust a politician. But I think, when we go to the ballots on Election Day, we like to vote for men and women we can trust. We want to have a person that we can trust to lead America to greatness sitting in the Oval Office, but a person we can also trust on a more personal level. While Cain’s personal life makes little difference in his ability to serve as our next President, it does affect the way we think of him as an individual. For better or worse, the Presidency has evolved to a position of morality as well as a position of power. Americans need to know that their leaders are honest and justice-oriented. And it’s hard for us to feel that way about a man who has been accused of such indecent behavior. 
We look for our leaders to be exemplars of decency as well as expert politicians. Idealism, as I see it, isn’t dead because we’re still looking for that knight in shining armor.

It's time to take sexual harassment seriously
By Sarah Palazzolo
And people wonder why there are so few women in U.S. politics.
Herman Cain's recent scandal just goes to show that men in power appear to have unchecked opportunities to indulge themselves in whatever sexual fantasy is convenient: Monica Lewinsky doesn’t even begin to address the gravity of sexual harassment in federal politics. 
According to the Washington Post’s history of political sex scandals, since Clinton in 1998, there have been twelve federal legislators and state governors, all men, involved in major public sex scandals, not including the recent example of Herman Cain. What is even more interesting is that none – none! – of the twelve were convicted or forced out of office. They lost the next election or chose to resign rather than face the electorate - some were re-elected anyway. But none of these offenders faced disciplinary action or direct legal consequences.
I think one reason that men get away with this kind of thing in politics is that sexual harassment is not considered (by dominant male discourses) a “serious” issue. Theoretically, debates focus on policy goals rather than personal lives, but of course everyone loves a good story, so personal lives are dragged to the forefront of any campaign. The women who press charges against political tycoons are caught in a war of he said-she said where the campaign denies allegations and the burden of proof falls to the victim. Harassment victims are belittled in the media as unreliable sources, gold-diggers, malicious campaign saboteurs. Women are told that perhaps they misunderstood the politician’s sense of humor. A little sex scandal here or there is like comic relief, an interesting plot twist in the soap opera of national politics.
If sexual harassment is not a serious issue, men like Herman Cain will continue to feel it is appropriate to refer to the former Speaker of the House as “Princess Nancy.” It will continue to be permissible, somehow, for national media to discuss Hillary Clinton’s laugh, criticize her hairstyle, and analyze gendered stereotypes about her leadership abilities.
On his campaign website, Cain calls the recent sex allegations “trivial nonsense” and reminds his audience that “we actually have serious matters to talk about.” He then goes on to describe how he refuses to play by the rules of the “warped,” “absurd” process of presidential selection and freedom of journalistic expression.
I’d like to encourage women in politics at any level – campus, grassroots, local, and even national – to borrow a line from Cain: Let’s refuse to play by unspoken, unjust political “rules” that have warped and corrupted our democracy. In order to solve the gendered representation gap, the electorate needs to speak out so that women’s issues will be taken seriously.

The rise of the incredibly arrogant candidate
By Nick Field
As it’s become more and more inevitable that Mitt Romney is going to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, conservatives have been looking for literally anybody to replace him. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that they would eventually turn their sights to Herman Cain, the man who had always been the funny, charismatic long-shot in the primary debates. 
Cain’s infamous 9-9-9 plan captured the electorate’s attention and vaulted him to the top of the polls. Now, however, the electorate is getting a look at the real Herman Cain and their reaction is almost as serious as the accusations leveled against Cain. Instead of calling for Cain to be pushed out, they have instead tried to hold this man of incredible arrogance up as a victimized hero.
Of course we really should have known Cain’s life and career were just one uninterrupted episode of uninhibited hubris. An early clue was the title of his autobiography “This is Herman Cain!” and the fact that he spent all his time selling his book instead of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. I know I realized it when he was questioned on the inaccuracies and ineptitude of his 9-9-9 plan and he, with no further explanation, responded “The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect”. Then, there was the illuminating revelation that his staff had been issued a memo which stated that when traveling with Cain “Do not speak to him unless spoken to.” And finally there was that incomprehensible and oft-mocked smoking ad. So when we heard the allegations that Cain had sexually harassed employees, we shouldn’t have been surprised, nor should we have been when his response was to attack the victims.
Ultimately, it shouldn’t be surprising that Republicans have backed Cain and his despicable and disqualifying conduct, over those who are truly victims. And yet they defend Cain and his belief that his accusers are all part of some type of DNC-sponsored “liberal media” conspiracy. Cain’s joined himself to Clarence Thomas; another man correctly accused of sexual harassment, and invoked Thomas’ insulting term of a “high-tech lynching”. 
Now we are faced with the sad realization that the Herman Cain campaign is, and always has been, more about increasing his profile and stroking his ego than running for President. Cain is now running for martyr instead of President of the United States, and the worse he has acted, the more support he has gained. What a shame for all of us that our presidential nominating process now aids and abets those least qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?

•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty.

•@Christian and Republican is impossible: It's not. I am and proud of it :) and other Christian Repubs, let's be friends.
•So the only free time I have to go into the city is during the weekend and that happens to be the time every week when the Metro SUCKS. Thank you DC for ""amazing public transportation""...
•Study break: I'm making little elf suits for the mice in the dorm.
•@ All the people who posted a rant about me after I said I wish someone would: You guys are the best. Seriously made my day, THANK YOU!!
•PSYCHO YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT.
•That awkward moment when the librarians are making more noise than the students on the quiet floor. You can stop yelling when you talk. Oh, and please stop hitting on each other...
•@your swipe is only worth $8... the cost of a swipe varies based on what meal plan you have.
•@Fourteen days: you can do this!
[Editor’s note: Ranters supporting each other makes The Eag so happy!]
•that awkward moment where you see typos in Eagle Rants.
[Editor’s note: Happens every day. The Eagle is tired of editing Rant grammar and is leaving it all up to you guys!]
•Wanted:  A boy who like Kiel James Patrick.  Please come find me.
•""How the hell did I not ask you out? The opportunity practically presented itself on a silver platter and I didn't take it. I'm an idiot"" You can make up for it ;) next time you see her!
•That unfortunate moment when you realized that the guy who gave you a ride back from a party (while you were sober) had some things in common with you and you didn't do anything about it.
•Before I started lifting weights I was like a 120 lb. virgin.. As soon as I touched my first weight it was like BOOM, still a virgin
•About the football thing: You knew it when you applied/chose AU. Or if you didn't, if it was that important, you should have made it a criteria in looking for a school. But personally, I'd say it's more about the academics than the athletics (for me anyway) and perhaps that's what you were thinking when you chose to attend AU; so if you overlooked it then, can't you overlook it now? Alternatively, transfer to a school with a football team?
•@""You know how girls get, right?"" Yes, I do, because I AM a girl, and I hate girls who make excuses for not having a handle on their emotions. Is it your time of the month, sweetheart? It's mine too, you don't see me sobbing and yelling and freaking out - take some Midol and get over yourself!""
I love you
•@truthaboutKristenStewart: It's all over Tumblr.
•@I don't think a good morning text and a goodnight text is too much to ask from a long distance boyfriend. Am I wrong here?
You're wrong to have a long distance relationship
•damnit. yesterday I ranted I had fourteen days left in this hellhole abroad. turns out I had fifteen and today I have fourteen. why didn't I change my flight when my mom suggested it? DYING.
•why do i seem to find the jerks who are only physically interested in me? Of course, the only decent guy who's interested in me AND my personality is abroad right now, and I'll be abroad next semester #timingfail :(
•Hey what's with the hating on Letts  4 North? Sure almost everything has broken at some point, but at least our floor is tight
•Why in the hell have the Eagle Rants gotten so pitiful and scathing? I remember the last time I sniped someone's grammar just to be an ass; I remember the last time I ignorantly bashed on someone's religious beliefs and politics. Seriously people, rants are NOT for:
-Relationship classifieds
-Poetry
-Public policy debate
-Being a dick
-Etc...
So, let's get this nice and crystal clear: play nice, play fair, and don't be a complete tool. Sincerely,
- All the normal people who read these
•If Greece defaults on their debt, what does that mean for Greek Life!?!
•@""Wow, Clark and Roper Halls were the ones that saved the most energy last month..."" I'll have you know that students in both halls took the challenge quite seriously and purposefully reduced unnecessary electricity use, even going so far as to unplug the vending machines. So thanks for mocking us.
•Why is it that being a conservative at AU automatically makes everyone hate you? I'm not rude to you about your political beliefs, don't be rude to me about mine. And for the record, conservative =/= republican.
•That moment where you're hooking up with one of the 3 guys in your class and none of your classmates know.
•That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.
•If you missed the basketball game Monday night, you really missed out. People need to start going to games, our team is actually really freaking good!!
•""is it weird to ask a girl to go on a jog as a first date? i want it to be casual, but part of me doesnt think this is a good idea... feedback?"" DO IT. if she likes jogging too! otherwise it could be awkward.
•""How the hell did I not ask you out? The opportunity practically presented itself on a silver platter and I didn't take it. I'm an idiot"" next time! im sure you'll have another chance!
•Were you in IB in high school?  Wait, really?  I didn't realize you were, I guess I didn't hear you the first twenty times you mentioned it in class.  Stop thinking and acting as if you're better than everyone else.  You're not.  And also, stop answering other students' questions before the professor gets to them; I'm paying over $100 a class to learn from HIM, not some prissy-assed girl who thinks she knows more than the man with the Ph.D. in the front of the room.
•Dear next door neighbor: I'm super delighted you like playing electric guitar so much but it would be awesome if you could do it less than FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK and maybe turn your amp down a little, plug in some headphones or realize that we hear you ALL THE TIME I especially enjoy it when you stop playing guitar and just start singing at the top of your lungs, it really brightens my day
•""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other..."" This is intense but just adorable. Make plans to see this person again. I'm sure they want to see you too!
•Dear Professor,
I appreciate you assigning us a 3,000 word essay on an event that happened in North Korea during 2011..  and not teaching us a damn thing this semester.  This should be fun, because you know.. There is so much information available on an event from North Korea... in 2011... /sigh/
•Rob Battaglia resigned from the AUSG Senate...one less member to take themselves too seriously
•@Oregon pronunciation: I know how you feel. Signed, student from Arkansas
•I know how stressed out I am by the number of times I masturbate during the week.
•To the first date jogger-- depends on the girl, but I personally would worry that I""d be sweaty and gross while jogging. Maybe a walk instead? That's still pretty casual.
•Dear Roommate,
I love you but your biddie best friend has to go. Every time she visits our room, I want to scream...
Sincerely, love you not her.
•@dear person who wants to get to know me (the one who plays roller coaster tycoon)...do you love math?-- I love both!!!!!!!
•I hate classes where EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD is due the last day of the semester. Spread the misery out a little, please?
•Dear stupid giggling biddies,
The quiet floor is called the QUIET floor for a reason. Don't bring your unwanted noise here.
•@""I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other for a long time..."" I know exactly how you feel-- I ran into a guy who's that person to me this weekend. I had just convinced myself to give up but every time I see him... I can't V.V and I almost never see him.
•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.
•The other day I was in CVS and I saw some guy smelling a bottle of shampoo, and I totally freaked him out by running up to him and telling him really excitedly that I do the same thing. Then he was embarrassed and said he was trying to do it all sneakily so no one could see...
•@The NAVY ranter-- Don't be hatin' on the Air Force. I'm a proud Air Force sister. The Chair Force saves the country one cup of coffee at a time ;)
•Don't re-download eagle secure.  Disconnect from the internet, connect to ""connect2eaglesecure,"" wait, and then select ""eaglesecure"" from the available wifi options.  You may have the repeat this process if it doesn't work immediately.  Beats re-downloading though.
•How many double-spaced pages have you written for classes this past week?  Winner gets the right to b**** about it.  Bidding starts at 29 pages.
•Why hasn't the IT department been fired yet?
•To the girl in my M/TH American Political Parties class who doesn't shut up,
SHUT UP! Your answers and comments are incredibly drawn out and saying ""like"" and ""um"" every other word makes you sound dumb. Your 67-sentence answers can be condensed into 1-2.
Sincerely,
Somebody Who Would Rather Hear the Professor Speak
•You don't have to keep downloading SafeConnect. Just double click on it in your downloads folder. 2x faster at least.
•Also, person who pointed out I wrongly said ""Timonese"" rather than ""Timorese"": you misspelled ""sanitation.""
•meow from abroad.
mraow.
•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@""try to get laid right now"" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT IN THE SEMESTER. seriously, I admire his courage for asking me out and I do like him, but now isn't exactly the time to start a relationship!
•Yes, male biddies do exist. However, they frequently go by the title of douche, tool, or a$$ hole.
•Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one.
•My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning
•You've got beef with the occupiers? Really? Making assumptions about what type of wood was used haha?!?! Get a grip. Let's hear the reasons...list them and perhaps we can educate you some.
•@I really hate animated movies! Why doesn't anyone want to watch gory horror movies with me?--Gory horror movies are the sh*t. I love being scared.
•@""Can someone please explain what guys find attractive in females? I've seen some rather unattractive ones get attention and I'm just not comprehending.""
answer = S-E-X
•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because ""you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide"": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@""Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,
I feel like you must be a guy.""
Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ ""Good Christians aren't Republican"":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@""(but of course I have to come back...)"" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.
-person who loves AU and dislikes complainers who like to complain for no reason
•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.
•@""That awkward moment when you are the ONLY one that does not want to go home"" It's only one WHO not only one THAT. You are a human being. Human beings are WHOs not THATs. Items are THAT. YOU ARE NOT AN ITEM. LEARN THIRD GRADE GRAMMAR NOW!
•Nicholas Kristof is a god.
[Editor’s note: Agreed.]
•I am not a security threat. And my middle name is KURT, NOT FART.
•Just finished an 11-page paper.Nothing to rant about now. BOOYAH!!!!
•Clark and Roper saved so much energy during November because we lived in a dark hell for two months.
•What's good about sad? It's happy for deep people.
•*If you play acoustic guitar on the quad.... your TERRIBLE..... Animal Collective is not music, it's poison...
•It's three in the morning. I'm so spaced out from lack of sleep that ergativity actually makes sense.
•I wish it was socially acceptable to be naked all the time. Figuring out what to wear every day is a pain in the butt for indecisive people.
•Yes, it is 6 AM. Yes, I am belting You and I in the study lounge. Thanks finals week.
•I write a rant about not seeing you in a while. For having these feelings for you. And who do I run into in TDR that day, before Rants went up. But there was so much awkward silence...
•Hi I'm calling from AU, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!!
•I. Will. Kill. The. Tech. Department.
WTF CAN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE INTERNET WORK. IT ISN'T THAT HARD. MY FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL MANAGED IT JUST FINE.
Just create a goddam system where the password for the internet is your student ID or something and stop making me download safe connect. If the internet works well enough to make me download something IT OBVIOUSLY WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO LET ME ON THE INTERNET.
•I just don't understand people sometimes. They just don't make sense. At all.
•Whenever I find the jerk who invented Eaglesecure, I'm gonna roast his chestnuts on an open fire.
•Scones all day erry day. #occupytdr
•I'm freaking out about whether I'm just tired and have a sore throat, or if it's mono (I hope I'm just overreacting...)
•Why does everyone else seem so damn interested in my love life? Like more so than I am? Is it really obvious I need to get laid or something?
•If anything, the sh*tshow that was my behavior this weekend showed me that I have the best friends ever. Thanks for keeping me sane through my scrimmage/putting up with my drunk biddiness, guys. Y'all are the best.
•As if running Safe Connect every other time I want to go online on my computer wasn't bad enough, I now have to do it on my phone. #eaglesecureproblems
•""Beware the Jabber WONK, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that snatch!""
•The Dav didn't have soy milk... A good coffee shop would have soy....
•I got a double shot latte by accident instead of a chai -- I don't usually drink caffeine. I'm going craaaazy. I'm sorry English class.
•Ever since our talk, there have been days when you're acting not like a friend and days where you are acting like a friend. I have had many, if not all people tell me that you are not worth it...not even the friendship. Too bad that I am my own person, and I am in this world for ME, and I advocate for myself. I see all the good in people, even if some may not. I believe there's good in you-I can genuinely see it. Do what you want, and forget the rest. You'll be happier listening to yourself.
•@Got any Sodium jokes: Who are you?! That's  my favorite meme! My roommate thinks I'm crazy :/
